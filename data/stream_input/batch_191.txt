630438551X|1.0|I'm sorry people. This movie blows. It's awful. What were these people thinking?!. Why would they ruin a masterpiece like this story by filming this junk?. Claire Danes is the only saving grace of this boring, whorish film. If you want a good movie, rent the original. Pass this turkey.
B000005S6H|5.0|A love story, this album combines the deep melancholy vocals of Australian musician Nick Cave with lusty piano and beautiful words.  Speaking so poingnantly of love in his signature depressing ways, I was comforted for months by this album.  In the song &quot;into my arms&quot; Cave refrains from the conventional love song which touches the listener. The album has a definite jazz feel to it, and is very unlike any of Cave's earlier work.  A definite album for fans of Tindersticks or even Leonard Cohen. Fans of this album would also like &quot;No More Shall We Part,&quot; Nick's newest release.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is without a doubt one of the most fresh and original films to come along in a long while.  While some might frown upon its rather &quot;adult oriented&quot; material (something that helped Dreamworks's last computer animated movie, Antz, work so well) others will realize this movie is more for us adults in the first place.  Sure, we've all seen the Disney films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty etc.  The thought of turning those classics on their ears with a comic twist is enough to entice many of us to see Shrek, even if only out of curiosity.  And with comic talents such as Mike Myers (as Shrek), Eddie Murphy (as Donkey), Camerine Diaz (as Princess Fiona) &amp; John Lithgow (as Lord Farquaad) you know you're going to be howling all the way through the picture.  <br />The story, like most great animated features, is pretty simple, but with added intrigue.  Because of Lord Farquaad, all the fairytale creatures have been banished to Shrek (the Ogre)'s swamp.  So to get them off his land he goes to the kingdom of DuLoc (accompanied by a talking Donkey) where Farquaad offers him a deal...free Princess Fiona from the clutches of an hideous dragon, and he will give him back his swamp as well as get rid of all the fairytale characters.  Then you have your typical &quot;Quest Scenerio&quot; (with a twist) having Shrek (w/Donkey) going to save the Princess.  (see the movie to learn more :-)  <br />Even the background characters such as the Gingerbread Man are a hoot.  And to any &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; fan out there...doesn't Farquaads's magic mirror look a whole lot like Kryton (the robot)'s head?  From the Fantastic computer animation that just makes you say &quot;WOW&quot; to wonderful Fairytale surroundings, Shrek is an instant classic that kids &amp; adults alike will be watching for decades to come.<br />The DVD is a 2 Disc set, mostly 2 discs so the filmmakers could make everybody happy by giving us both a Full Frame (Pan &amp; Scan) version of Shrekto watch (1.33:1) as well as a Widescreen (Letterboxed) version (1.78:1).  A very cute scene is added at the very end of the movie (after all the credits have finished) that is just hilarious!  The DVDs have quite a lot of special features, such as a Behind the scenes featurette with interviews from the cast &amp; crew.  The Tech of Shrek: a small look behind the creation of the revolutionary visual computer anmimation, is quite interesting.  Plus there are technical goofs (the Chia Pet Donkey is just a gas!) and much much more.  But not everything came out perfect.  The Game Swamp section is somewhat disappointing.  With any game you play, not only do you not receive any type of reward or congradulations for winning, but for many choices you make in the game, it's mostly up to chance to get them correct (choose 1 out of 3 doors to continue your quest...but they all look the same!).  Dreamworks should take a look at the fun games Disney has been giving us, namely Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, which is a lot of fun.  Disney has even done DVD games where the winner gets to see a bonus cartoon as his reward.  Take notes, Dreamworks.  And the audio commentary is pretty good, but what I wouldn't give for an &quot;Actors commentary&quot; with Mike, Eddie, Cameron &amp; John altogether (for the first time it would seem) discussing the film with hilarous anecdotes and laugh out loud humor.  But don't let this in any way stop you from buying the movie.  It's still very much worth it!  Plus id you have a DVD-ROM, there's even more fun!<br />Shrek - An Computer Animated Classic!<br />&quot;You may have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly.  But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!&quot; - Eddie Murphy as Donkey
B00005OM4N|4.0|A glance at the album cover and you know Britney Spears has shed her pristine virginal Princess of Pop image to define her edgier style. A look at the music inside screams unadulterated teenage angst - from the heavy grooves and sexy beats &quot;I'm a slave 4 U&quot; composed by the Neptunes, Dido's contributed easy-on-the-ears ballad &quot;I'm not a girl , Not Yet a Woman&quot; to the catchy bubblegum pop of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and her long-time collaborator Max-Martin Max and Rami's composition &quot;Overprotected&quot;. BRITNEY is a gauranteed commercial success with the bandwagons of capable producers ranging from Rodney Jerkins (Lonely) and J. Elofsson et al. Those fans hunting down for ballads will not be disappointed - &quot;That's where you take me&quot; and &quot;Let me be&quot; are fine treats. However the fine tracks that truly mesmerize are the cutesy rock anthem &quot;I love rock &amp; roll&quot; and the radio-friendly &quot;anticipation&quot;. Ms. Spears shows more grit this time round - with more swears and flesh, but not necessarily more of her rebel streak and soul. It's a pity that her album is always full of techno beats and pyrotechnics to compete with her vocal range. BRITNEY is a welcoming change though from her Oops, I did it again debacle - at least the tracks here are more confidently expressed with a change in style. She reigns high with her breathy and husky take in &quot;Boys&quot; and her latest single 'I'm a slave 4 U' to take on the throne from Ms. Aguilera.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|There is really only one reason to watch this movie. Only one reason to tolerate it. That reason : Angelina Jolie. There is no question that this girl is a great actress. While this film may not show you her true talents, she does do the best of what she had been given. She is definitley her hottest in this film. She might be a tad quirky in real life, but, that's endearing. This movie is pretty mediocre. I'm not a Lara Croft fan. In fact, I don't really know anything about it. I really wasn't expecting much. I didn't get much either. The silly plot about time or something, I really can't remember, was pretty transparent. I mean, I just said I can't even remember it!. The action scenes are pretty adequate. The raid on the mansion is especially fun and thrilling. It's too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold on to that thrillness. Is thrillness even a word?. Oh well. Jon Voight is on hand in a cameo as Lara's father. Voight, a brilliant actor, is pretty much not there in his performance of a barely there character. If mindless, senseless action films is your thing, you'll probaby like this. Others will probably just fall asleep. Five stars for Jolie tho. Not worth raiding.
B00005AFVR|5.0|This is one of my prized possessions.  The Boss rocks Madison Square Garden like nobody can.  I love the fan interaction and if you love Bruce, this is a must have.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This album is way better than her other two.... Her sound is still pop, but she sounds very raspy and airy in her voice, very sexy. there aren't as many songs with the fake manufactured beats..so thats good... my only main complaint is that there is only 1 (2?) slow songs... personally I always find her ballads comforting and was dissapointed to find only one....<br />1. I'm a Slave 4 u.... the song everyone knows and loves... its just all around hot! The beat is hot, her voice is hot, the video is hot...it just makes you wanna dance! definetely one of her best songs to date... (5/5)<br />2. Overprotected.... ughh this song sux! sounds way too much like your average &quot;pop gone 'r&amp;b'&quot; track.... the beat isnt that great and the song is just stupid... i really hope this isnt ever gonna be released... (1/5)<br />3. Lonely.... wow this song is great!...it has everything..her sexy whispery voice, a little rap, some nice singing... really hot beat... just love it! I'd say her best uptempo ever...(5+/5)<br />4. Im not a girl...this is the only ballad... its nice and not too corny sounding... it seems to be one of the only songs not about love or breaking up or whatever... i like it but i wish she went higher is some places... (3.5/5)<br />5. Boys... another whispery track... very funky, nastay...it gets kinda dumb during the bridge but overall its a good dance track..love the beat.... (3.5/5)<br />6. Anticipating... first listen it sounded like the Spice Girls track 'never give up on the good times'... it has a really weird beginning but you get used to it i suppose...its a different sound for her so its nice...(3/5)<br />7. I love rock n roll.... well i don't really think anyone could go wrong with a cover of this song. it sounds pretty good (3.5/5)<br />8. Cinderella.... ok this is the worst song ever!!! how did this get on the cd??? the cinderella theme is way over used... it sux so much i dont even wanna talk about it anymore...  (-1000000000/5)<br />9. LetMe Be... like the beat . nice song... kinda dancy... just like the average britney stuff and very catchy (4/5)<br />10. Bombastic Love.... another pretty pathetic song... corny pop whatever... it kinda sux too..but its ok i guess (2/5)<br />11. That's where you take me.... very sweet melodic song.... generic pop lyrics but the sound is great... another favorite of mine (4.5/5)<br />12. What it's like to be me... well lets say i like nsync... but their songs get old quickly.. i love their ballads but their uptempo all sound the same... well now justin decides to lend a beat to britney and it just sounds terrible.. its just weird... ugghh too much like nsyncs dumb songs... i dunno i just cant listen it gives me a headache (1/5)
B000002L5I|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best of the three albums that the KWS band have released. The album is strong from start to finish with &quot;True Lies&quot; being the only, albeit minor, weak link among 12 songs. Personal favorites include the cover of Jimi Hendrix's &quot;I Don't Live Today&quot;, &quot;I Found Love (When I Found You)&quot;, and &quot;Nothing to Do with Love&quot;. Others that can only be truly appreciated with the volume turned up to 11 are the smokin' &quot;Slow Ride&quot; (no, not the Foghat version--this one is much better), &quot;(Long) Gone&quot;, &quot;Somehow, Somewhere, Someway&quot;, and &quot;King's Highway&quot;. This is good guitar folks. It really doesn't get much better.
B00005J6UP|5.0|It was the summer of 1985. A summer that will leave a life lasting impression on this little 6 year old kid. I went into the theater and saw The Goonies. What a ride. What a summer. I saw it in the theater 2 or times. I would of seen it again if my dad hadn't persuaded me to try another new movie that just came out. A certain Zemeckis movie about a teenage boy who goes back in time and see his parents when they were his age. Like I said, what a summer!. The Goonies is a special and magical film for all those who were lucky enough to witness it in it's original release. How many of us have had our group of childhood friends who would play, pretend, and just be kids?. How many of us would dream and fantasize of being a superhero, or a pirate, or going on great adventures?. Well, with The Goonies, it's all there. It hits close to home for me not just because of the times and how nostalgic it was, but because it spoke to me. I could of been a Goonie. The film follows a group of Oregon kids(The Goonies) who stumble upon an old treasure map leading to the treasure of pirate One Eye Willie. The kids see it as a way of possibly saving their homes from destruction. From then on, our fearless kids begin their search that leads them thru tunnels, face to face with gun toting criminals, and trying to survive deadly booby traps. It's a wonderful adventure for everyone. The cast is phenomenal. From Sean Astin to Corey Feldman to Jeff Cohen, these are real kids. They seem to really be friends. They all have their own quirks and personalities, and the kids are so talented to pull it all off. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and it always sounds genuine and just \\"right\\". What is also great about the film is that it has an \\"edge\\" to it. A certain darkness just underneath that doesn't make it 100% squeaky clean. Some curse words and a corpse helping. The bad guys, The Fratellis, are an interesting bunch. Both seriously menacing and cartoonish at the same time. And really, who didn't want a Sloth of their own after seeing the film?. Some people and critics complain that nostalgic kids from the 80's make the movie out to be better than it is. Maybe, but the movie IS good. Sometimes the hype from it's life long fans are justified. This is one of them. It's funny, it's wild, it has engaging and relatable characters, and it's just...magic. The commentary has all the kids and director Richard Donner, and what's great is that the film will go to a box in the corner and actually show the entire cast sitting there watching while they record the commentary. Outstanding!. They all look great too. A vintage 1985 special and a Cyndi Lauper video round out the package. No bones about it, The Goonies is one of those special gems that lives up to it's legacy. I can still watch this movie and feel like I am 6 years old again sitting in the darkened room at North Division Cinemas. Very few films can do that for me. The Goonies will live on.
B00000I4XR|5.0|Ok, thinking this movie was made in 1975 and I did not have very high hopes for it, I rented anyways because I love the work of Director Steven Speilburgh. I have throughly enjoyed this movie time after time, in fact, I am watching it right now! This is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion. I STRONGLY suggest for ANYBODY, except children under about 7, to watch this movie. DVD:WONDERFUL VHS:WONDERFUL PERIOD.
B000002N3J|4.0|Madonna often changes her looks and her music, like a chameleon. But there is one thing that will never change, ballads. This is an very strong ballad collection. I love a lot of the songs, including This Used To Be My Playground, and I'll Remember. I was surprised that it wasn't off her upcoming Greatest Hits Volume 2. I may not like Madonna that much, but I like songs that are very sincere. I recommend this for any Material Girl Fanatic.
0345350499|5.0|I read this book, and I thought it was great. I had heard about it on TV and thought it sounded good. I've seen the other movies about Arthur, the one title &quot;Merlin&quot; showed on NBC. I saw that one,and thought it was awesome, but it portrayed Morgaine as a sluty,power-hungry,evil sorceress. And she wasn't!! She didn't know that it was Arthur that she slept with, until it was too late! <br />I loved this book for so many resons. In every story, Gwenhwyfar(welsh spelling) is always portrayed as the sweet and innocent woman. But in &quot;Mists&quot; she's seen as who she is, mean, spoiled, winey, and not the always beautiful, oh so sweet Queen.<br />I recommend this book to everyone. Even if you don't believe in some of the things. Have an open mind! I feel that one of the themes in the book is that it doesn't matter what you call God, whether it be God, or Allah,or even if you call it a Goddess, it doesn't matter. Just have an open mind. And enjoy the book.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman is one the greatest comic book adaptions to date and now 23 years later it still is not mention this great DVD to. As the film opens we see Jor-El (Marlon Brando) banish three Kryptonite criminals out of Krypton because of what they did to endanger. Then a couple of new scenes are restored revolving the decision of the council to decide what penality Jor-El should face. Jor-El decides he must send Kal-El his only son to earth, and he does. After that the Krypton sun approaches Krypton even more and the planet expldes. When the small star like vessel is traveling he happens to pass by the Kryptonite criminals in the glass spining off (we'll see them again Superman II). He crash lands on earth somewhere in Kansas and is adopted by childless couple who offer him much love even though they knew his powers. He is raised as Clark Kent shy, dosen't talk to much, and dosen't have many friends. After his adoptive father dies he discovers the green crystal in the farm from which he Jor-El sent along with discovers he must leave and find out who he really is. He heads of somewhere cold and throws the crystal far out and somehow the crystals start to build and becomes what is known as Fortress of Soltitude. He discover's his real father and the his birth place as well. Soon enough the second half is what you'll never forgot. The much older Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) works at The Daily Planet and meets Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) his love interest. Whenever Superman reveals himself to the public he's a superhero and quite unbelievable. But he meets his most unforgettable foe to Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Its up to Superman to stop the madman and saves the people he cares about. This movie is Unforgettable never without the doubt Christopher Reeve made us believe Superman can fly, he make a perfect resemblance to Superman, and his acting is quite excellent he was made for this roll. Gene Hackman is great as the sadistic criminal mastermind Lex Luthor a performance sureto please. Thumbs up as well for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane she is quite the actress for her role. Marlon Brando's role as Jor-El was short but none the less he was great in the character. The DVD is marvelous its in Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 the way it should be the picture is best watched when your in the dark you can see the bright color off of Superman's uniform. The sound is magnificent in 5.1 Surround espically the credits its awesome and truly unforgettable as well. Superman will always be remembered as A Unforgettable Classic and not to mention the DVD.<BR>Buy it!! You will always remember this movie.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Being a Floyd purist, it is difficult listening to butchered versions of Echoes and Marooned, not to mention the chopped Shine On. But for the casual Floyd listener and first time listener, this CD is a gem. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the music is just so good no matter what order. The sequencing of songs is interesting, but many of these songs are taken out of the context of their conceptual formats and are just not the same. Part of the excellence of Pink Floyd is the way THEY sequenced songs on their albums, especially post Meddle.<BR>As others have mentioned, leaving off Atom Heart Mother, More, and Obscured by Clouds is unacceptable. Fat Old Sun, Green is the Colour, Cymballine, and Free Four or Burning Bridges at a minimum should have been included. Leave off the FM classic rock staples of Comfortably Numb, Another Brick in the Wall Pt 2 and Money. As a diehard Floyd fan since 1972,I had to have it in the collection, but after one listen, I will reserve my Floyd listening to the original albums.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is personally my favorite Mariah album!  It has it's upbeat songs, mellow songs &amp; some of my all time favorite ballads!  Close My Eyes is my favorite song on the album, because it has personal meaning, and it's just a beautiful song!  Despite the fact that it didn't sell as many as her previous albums, I love every song on this album &amp; I think the people that didn't buy it are definately missing out!!!!  Definately a must have for a past, present, or future Mariah fans!
0671027379|4.0|Dan Brown's latest scientific thriller doesn't quite match his last thriller (Angels and Demons), though it comes darn close.<br />As NASA's failure rate is high and it's popularity low, a much needed boost--to it's reputation--has been discovered. A NASA satellite orbiting over the Artic discovers a meteorite buried deep in the ice. It turns out that this could be the discovery of the century, for within this meteorite are numerous fossils resembling giant insects thought to have originated on another planet. Rachel Sexton (Daughter of a Senator who is out to destroy NASA and gain the presidency) works for the White House and is sent to the Artic to verify the meteorites authenticity. Rachel, working along with scientists, soon discovers some amazing facts. She also learns that nothing is as it seems.<br />Brown's Novels are always top notch entertainment. His characters highly likeable (Michael Tolland Reminded me of Bill Nye the science guy) and his research impeccable. The different subjects in this book covered things like Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), physics of glaciers and meteorites, the theory of Panspermia and the story behind megaplumes. The controversial subject of privatizing space exploration was also heavily written about.<br />Exciting, educating, and highly enjoyable. A topnotch thriller.<br />Highly recommended
B000002A46|5.0|...all year long!<br />Every year I can't wait 'til it's close enough to Xmas (that I can listen to this &amp; people wont think I'm crazy, lol).  This is an awesome Christmas CD that everyone should own!  O Holy Night is my very favorite, (it's such a powerful version of a classic song, I haven't heard a better version since Mariah's!) but every song is wonderful!!  This is definately an album you have to have!!
B00005JKHP|4.0|The original theatrical release was just not engaging.  The later TV version was just too long.  This is a very good almalgamation of the two.  My favorite scenes from the TV version are now included, and all the scenes that were edited out are included separately anyway.  Also, unlike the Star Wars Special Editions, the enhanced effects really DO improve the movie.  I now realize what all the visuals actually are!  All in all, definitely the best version made of this movie.
630157401X|5.0|This movie was every bit as goos as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.<BR>Harrison Ford is very good in his role as Indiana Jones. The film<BR>is improved by the addition of Sean Connery in the role of Indiana Jones's father.This time Indiana and the Nazis are trying to find the Holy Grail. In this search you have excellent action shots. The scenery in this movie is outstanding as well.<BR>Jones manages to get out of several tight spots in his search for the Holy Grail. The ending of this movie is the idea way to finish a film. Buy this film. You will be well pleased with your<BR>purchase. This is a classic.
0966638328|5.0|I give high marks to Leatrice Eiseman for giving us a book we can actually use!  This book has become an essential at my work station, with it's exceptional use of examples, hundreds of color palettes and fantastic layout.  A pleasure just to browse through.  It's a book, it's a tool, it's a guide, it's an idea starter.  Add it to your collection.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Two years after his English language debut, Iglesias returns with his far superior follow-up, which veers from the usual &quot;bandwagon&quot; approach and is geared far more towards pop and rock rather than Latin-based beats.  First single 'Hero' is actually one of the very few slow tracks on the record, which instead leans in the dance direction.  Metro, among his production collaborators on the last album, are back here, providing their trademark brand of updated disco; among their contributions are the aforementioned 'Hero', as well as the more upbeat 'Love To See You Cry' and the strangely titled 'She Be The One'.  The best tracks, though, are those that incorporate not only pop but rock undertones--'Don't Turn Off The Lights', the album's best track, sounds like a lost '80s smash that got lost in the mail on the way to a Steve Perry recording session.Among the other stellar highlights are the energetic 'Love 4 Fun' and the set's other ballad 'Maybe'. Armed with more hooks than a fishing tackle box, this is one of the best pure pop albums you're likely to listen to this year.
1891252089|5.0|it's best if you've done the series before, or at least know the postures. the picture and layout are incredibly useful. of course, the best possible thing is to do this in a class, but, like it says in the book, it's all about practice.
0385015364|5.0|I think this book is one of the greatest apologies for the Christian faith ever penned; possibly even better than C.S. Lewis' &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Rather than attempting to build an airtight logical argument from the ground up in which the reader is forced to accept the premises of Christianity or be logically inconsistent, Chesterton builds his apologetic on the idea of wonder and imagination. He attempts to show that anyone who enjoys an imaginative, romantic, adventure filled life owes it to themself to look into the Christian faith, because this is exactly what it offers. He offers a frank disclaimer at the beginning of the book in which he says that anyone who does not want this kind of life need not read this book because it has nothing to offer them. He constantly attempts to make the reader see the mystery and the glory of normal, everyday things and then argues that Christianity offers the best possible scenario for holding together the mysterious with the mundane. The fact that the book is focused on mystery, romance, and imagination, however, is not to say that Chesterton rejects logic or good critical thinking altogether. To the contrary, he delightfully skewers, slices, and dices the inconsistency and ridiculousness of a great deal of worldly wisdom and the popular thinking of his age, which, as it turns out, does not look all that different from a great deal of the accepted wisdom of our own. Chesterton, however, recognizes that logic has it's limits, and that it cannot fully appeal to or account for all that makes us human. The book is filled with many wonderful passages, and there are parts of the book where it seems like every line you read is a quotable quote. So, with Chesterton's disclaimer in mind, if you are looking for an eminently readable, and unique defense of the Christian faith you owe it to yourself to get this book. <BR> On a final note, I feel the need to respond to the reader who accuses Chesterton of being racist and elitist in this book. I'm wondering if the reader read the same book I did, as I found nothing that I can recall that was racist or elitist at all, and anyone who knows anything about Chesterton at all will know that he was neither of these things. Chesterton was one of the greatest spokesmen of all time for the importance of ordinary people and common values and morality, and, especially in his later life, was an outspoken opponent of racist practices and groups like eugenics and the Nazi party.
0688170528|1.0|When you finish &quot;The Pact&quot; -- after you dry your eyes, catch your breath, and compose yourself -- take a minute to think back on the story and you'll realize &quot;you've been had&quot;. The characters sketched in this book (and they are only just sketches) simply don't add up. The plot is completely manipulative and utterly implausible. I realize Jodi Picoult is a popular author with a faithful following, but if you insist on even a shred of intelligence in your reading material or in the characters you read about, this book is not for you. For a fully-realized and satisfying treatment of some broadly similar themes try Maeve Binchy's &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; instead. For courtroom drama, just watch an episode of &quot;The Practice.&quot;
B00004STDN|5.0|The first movie I saw in this type of genre was Vertical Limit and I found that to be very boring and unexciting. A while later, I saw Cliffhanger and I was blown away. This movie was everything a good action movie should be. It had real thrills, great suspense and perfect villains. John Lithgow and Leon were great. I should warn weaker viewers out there however that this film has a lot of gore in it. A man is shot with a bolt gun, another is stabbed with a stalactite and the head busting scene is really bloody and gross. This movie is very exciting and fun to watch. Go buy it today.
B000002J1L|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for this album! I think it's an<br />absolute masterpiece and not only do I consider it to be the best<br />Genesis album, but it's also on of the best progressive rock al-<br />bums ever made! THE MUSICAL BOX is my all time favorite Genesis<br />song! The acoustic/folky parts are beautiful, but the heavy, instrumental sections are very exciting! The second heavy instru-<br />mental part may be the most exciting thing Genesis ever did. Phil<br />Collins drumming is outstanding and Tony Banks keyboard solo is<br />phenomenal. For the longest time, I thought his electric piano<br />solo was an electric guitar solo. FOR ABSENT FRIENDS is an under-<br />rated folk tune, on which Collins made his unofficial vocal de-<br />but. This is followed by the heavy metalish RETURN OF THE GIANT<br />HOGWEED. The ending of this song is breathtaking!!<br /> The second half of the album isn't quite as thrilling, tho it<br />has it's share of wonderful moments. HAROLD THE BARREL may be the<br />funniest song these guys ever did, while THE FOUNTAIN OF SAL-<br />MASCIS is another prog rock classic, featuring some outstanding,<br />dynamic guitar work by Steve Hackett.<br />  I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!11
6304711891|4.0|Excellent movie. Nobody could disagree with this.<BR>A real edge-of-the-seat action thriller full of great images and astonishing sound. <BR>But the DVD release surely could be a higher quality stuff in terms of including a couple of more extras than the simple trailer.<BR>Perhaps an interview to the actors or the director, backstage videos, or something like that. Action movies are particularly apt for enhancing them with that kind of extras, because the watcher always wants to know how this or that scene was footed. And of course the directors comments are always welcome.<BR>Ive got several early- and mid-80s action and suspense movies that include those cinema-fans most wanted features. Strangely this late-90s release lacks them.<BR>In fact, after you watched to the movie a couple of times at the cinema, perhaps another two or three times at home, theres no further interest in the movie itself. But backstage videos or any kind of add-ons you could not see in cinemas surely can show you a different aproach to the subject.<BR>This review applies to the standard edition, not the Criterion-Colection edition, which actually IS full of features. Unfortunately I found it after buying the other one.
B00005NW02|5.0|&quot;Father, into your hands / I commend my spirit / Why have you forsaken me?&quot; - Chop Suey!<br />You must hear this album for yourself to understand why it is dropping the jaws of critics and fans alike. Toxicity is 14 tracks (15 if you count the beautiful Arto Tuncboyacian hidden outro) of pure ear candy. <br />Serj Tankian. Daron Malakian. Shavo Odadjian. John Dolmayan. System of a Down is comprised of these four brilliant Californian Armenians. Their innovative style and powerful lyrics (no, Slipknot's &quot;I want to slit your throat and f--k the wound&quot; don't cut it here) will leave you speechless. Only then will you understand why they are truly &quot;the most popular band that nobody has heard of.&quot; Do yourself a favor and buy this album. Sure, they made us wait for Toxicity, but boy was it ever worth it. In a sea of crap nu-metal bands, System of a Down emerges as the most original and rockin' of them all. <br />My copy of Toxicity hasn't left my CD player ever since I got it. It's that good.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Robert Wise's remastering of Star Trek: The Motion Picture rights a wrong imposed on him by Paramount Pictures demands for a quick release of the film in December of 1979; he wasn't allowed to edit the film into the masterpiece that it is now.  Paramounts blunderous decision to trade quality for box-office profits obviously dissapointed William Shatner, Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek fans and most of all, Robert Wise.<br />I remember seeing the original in 1979 when I was six years old.  At that age, even I though the movie dragged on for a long time.   The later TV version only slowed the film down even further.<br />The new effects perfectly blended into the special-effects from 1979.  Unlike the re-released Star Wars films, the CGI is invisible which is a big plus.<br />Another big plus is the musical score.   The tempo of the original score was way too slow for &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  Now the tempo of the score is speeded up to the score used in the Next Generation films.   The horns in the orchestra seem a little heavy but make the theme even better and richer.<br />The opening credits are terrific and replace the original films flat and lifeless opening credits.<br />The extras on the 2nd Disc are a bonus for those of you interested in the history of the &quot;lost&quot; 2nd Star Trek Series and the making of the movie.<br />Definitely add this to your Star Trek DVD collection.   You won't regret it.
B00004Z311|5.0|I remember renting &quot;Legend&quot; years ago and thinking, &quot;Hey this movie is missing bits.&quot; And so it was.  The version I had seen on cable was the Brit version, not the American Theatrical release.  So here it was, I had access to a not quite perfect version of a movie I cherished.  But now, on DVD, I can have it all baby!  This is a Ridley Scott masterpiece (widely and enthusiastically panned by every critic) that I would put up against any fantasy movie ever made.  It's romantic, menacing, and fantastic.  Also, it has infiltrated everything I have ever drawn or painted since I was eight years old.  I know you all are as expectant as I am, this is going to be great.
6305531374|3.0|I will say that Jamie Lee Curtis gave a terrific performance in this film.  She played her character so well, you could just feel her emotions and how scared she really was that Michael might return to get her.  I think that this film was very well done because it had a pretty flat story that was able to translate quite well.  But, there are quite a lot of noticable, and annoying, flaws.  First off, why, oh, WHY did the makers decide that we shold be able to see Myer's eyes?  Why???!!!  It ruins what was so, so scary about him in the original.  And, simply put, the guy who plays him (...).  In his interveiw (which you can see on HalloweenMovies.com) he said he didn't watch any of the others to see how he should play the part.  Well, if every other actor that played Michael studied the origial, this guy should have too.  He looks like a human.  I hate it.  I can't stand it.  How hard is it to make a mask that looks like the one in the original, huh?  This Michael is like Ghoastface (Scream) in a different costume.  He jerks his head around, walks fast, and he's not even scary, just dumb looking.  And when Jamie Lee kicks him in between the legs, his eyes get all big.  I think this guy  who's been shot like a million times, and stabbed, blown up, caught on fire, all that... well I don't think he'd care if you kicked him.  This Michael doesn't have that ghost quality that all the others had.  So, he really, really, sucked big time as Michael.  There are also strange mistakes.  Like, Marion Whittington?  Did she get married or something, because in Halloween 2 she clearly states \\"This is Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic.\\"  That was strange, and I noticed that the first time.  If she didn't get married, this is just one of the silliest and ridiculous flaws in a movie.  Also, ignoring the events of all the films after Part 2?  I say, if you start something, finish it.  It's like all the films from 4-6 weren't good enough, like a bad book.  I found the conceptof Michael in a cult called Thorn extremely interesting, and was eager to watch this one after I finished the sixth one.  I was hoping for a continuation of Part 6.  But, there's no mention of Jamie, Jamie's baby, Kara, Danny, Tommy Doyle, or many others.  And of course, to bring Jamie Lee back they have to make the lame excuse \\"She faked her death in the car crash\\".  For god's sake, since 1988, people have been beleving she was dead, died in a car crash.  And this silly excuse is just way to sloppy.  There's lots of other stupid mistakes, the movie does have it high points as well.  Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a great, great performance, Adam Arkin's good, LL Cool J is really funny, and the cameo by Janet Leigh is sweet (and it's so cool how that car from Psycho pops up in the one scene, pure genious).  However, an annoyance is the horrible score.  They simply use music from \\"Scream\\" and hope we won't notice.  Well, I noticed.  There's nothing wrong with the Scream music.  It's a terrific score, but it belongs in Scream, not in Halloween.  Also, the music is just to much.  They've taken John Carpenter's terrifc score and turned it rotten.  It's like a whole, big orchestra playing the theme now, and not the scary, simple theme sone of the original.   But, I loved the little clip of the two girls watching Scream 2 (as in Scream 1, they watch Halloween).  And the amusing referance where John's (Josh Hartnett) freind, Charlie (Adam Hynn' Byrd) sais that in twnty years John will still be living with his mother, propably running some weird motel out in the middle of nowhere (and people thought the original had a lot of Psycho references).<br />The plot has Michael dispatching of Marion \\"Whittington\\" near the beggining, as well as two annoying teens (one, for a second, dressed in a hockey mask, as the director directed Friday The 13ths 2 and 3) and stealing the file for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  He finds out that she's up at a secluded private school, and so he heads out.  It just so happens to be Halloween's eve (what a surprise).  He heads to the school, where most of the kids, and staff, are on a feildtrip.  He makes his way past the security guard, Ronnie (LL Cool J)  and enters to go find Laurie, his sister.  <br />H20 doesn't feature any scares or suspense whatsover, but it's an overall well crafted sequal.  Laurie's alchoholism, is a nice addition, it doesn't stick out and scream \\"Laurie's an alcoholic\\", like some movies do.  And I feel Josh Hartnett played John very well. <br />The DVD doesn't deserve the title Collector's Edition.  Most of the things Amazon listed as special features (Production Notes, Theatrical Trailers) aren't there.  Also, the cover says there's an audio commentary by Director Steve Miner, and Jamie Lee Curtis, but there isn't.  At first I thought it might be hidden, but I don't think Dimension does that.  There is only a short 15 minute documentary (which is more about the original than this one) and a music video, as well as a super duper easy trivia game.  The movie is presented in proper 2:35:1 widescreen letterbox format, and it's got good picture and sound, as well as english subtitles, and scene selsction.  I'd say if you don't already have the movie, just get the DVD for the correct format (widescreen), but if you've got the video, stick with it.  I dought if there's gonna be another version, because this is marked as a collector's edition.  <br />If you found my reveiw helpful, please vote for me.  Thank you so much!
B00000J7J4|4.0|Carlos has outdone himself on this CD.  Definitely a work that will stand the test of time. Every tune is fantastic, exuding that unique amalgam of latin music and american rock. My faves are Smooth and Corazon Espinado.  Is it my imagination or does Dave Matthews sound like Sting ? Enjoy!
B00005O5CM|5.0|When my friends and I went to go see this at the theater, I thought it was going to be another movie about dumb blondes. I was very wrong! Reese Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, a blonde sorority sister who is equal in brains and beauty. Her boyfriend is a Harvard law student who dumps Elle because he thinks she is not smart or good enough for him. Elle proves him wrong by taking an entrance exam and making it into Harvard! Elle wants to prove to her boyfriend, er, ex-boyfriend, that she is as good as him, and in my opinion, she is much better. She uses her wits, skills, and charm to solve a murder that her friend is accused of committing. I give this movie 4 thumbs up!
B000002AV5|5.0|This album makes me feel like I'm walking on a tropical beach with sand between my toes, even if I am really dodging slush puddles and enduring winter's tight embrace.  Take me away Sade !
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd are/were a great band, and the songs on this double disc set will attest to that.  I do have a few gripes about the tracklisting.  In my opinion, they needn't had included so many tracks from A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell while leaving out many more superior pieces from their late 60s/early 70s work.  It just boggles me that they decided to include &quot;Marooned,&quot; one of the more boring instrumental pieces from 1994's The Division Bell, but neglected to include, in any form, the 1967 instrumental masterpiece &quot;Interstellar Overdrive.&quot;  Some would argue that this track (&quot;Insterstellar Overdrive&quot;) was the greatest piece of music Pink Floyd ever created, whereas &quot;Marooned&quot; is most definitely in the lower echelons of the Floyd canon.  I am a fan of the post-Roger Waters era Pink Floyd (I think &quot;High Hopes&quot; is one of the greatest songs in their entire backcatalogue), but I feel this era was overly represented on this compilation.  Why nothing from Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma, or from their soundtracks (More and Obscured by Clouds)?  Some of their best work was on these inexplicably excluded albums.  I know they couldn't include everything, but I think it would have been a good idea to include at least one track from every album they released, along with some essential rarities.  I am happy that they represented the Syd Barret era with five cuts, and even included a track from The Final Cut (it was basically a Roger Waters solo album, with little to no input from the other members), an underrated album that Floyd fans know isn't a huge favorite of David Gilmour, nor the rest of the band, other than Waters of course.<br />But even with these flaws, I can't help but give the compilation 5 stars, as it includes some of the greatest music ever recorded.  The final analysis is that it's a good (but it could have been better!) sample of their work, spanning nearly 30 years.
B00004XQ83|2.0|I absolutely could not stand this cd. I hated it. It sounded like something from a distant time and the music had no emotion. The movie was O.K and the music went with the movie but hearing this on a cd is just worse than a migrane headache. I have absolutely no idea how this beat the other albums for album of the year. The only good stuff on the whole cd is stuff from Allison Krauss who sings pretty nice. Another strange thing about this cd is how something this awkward and outdated can make it so big. Listen before you buy don't go buy it just because it was album of the year to me it tanked. Absolutely not todays sound at all. Everyone in this country has a right to their own opinion and how dare anyone (...) tell somebody they are not a good music lover. Because I know good music!
0312117337|4.0|The Osho Zen tarot card deck is a wonderful and highly evocative spiritual tool. These cards have a way of stirring the intuition upon first glance and promptly extracting the truth from any situation in question. My suggestion? Keep an open mind and practice regular use of these cards. <br />I have found them to be a wonderful guide on my Spiritual Journey.  The ultra-colorful illustrations tend to evoke strong images and bring immediate clarity and accuracy to my Readings. This is especially important since I must maintain a high level of excellence at my site, Psychic-Advicespot.com ,as a professional psychic Tarot Card Reader. <br />There is a very special genius at work here: unlike most decks I've run across over the years, Osho Zen has a silly, yet intelligent sense of humor in its illustration of so-called negative cards like \\"exhaustion\\" and \\"schizophrenia\\". I think part of the objective behind the author and/or illustrator's humor is to help us poke fun at ourselves and not take every single thing so seriously. The cards seem to offer a \\"free pass\\" to not get bogged down by the heaviness of our concerns. Within the cards and the companion book you receive, there is the continued reminder to look at the value in each moment and to live in today (not inside the cares of yesterday or tomorrow).  <br />Osho's visual and written text may indeed be a breath of fresh air for those who need a change from the more Westernized decks, which almost always boast cards like the \\"Devil\\",\\"Death\\"and \\"Hanged Man\\". The symbolism commonly associated with the \\"Hanged Man\\", for example, is that of St.Peter or Jesus Christ's hangings. Osho contains thought-provoking Eastern ideas like the one depicted in \\"No-Thingness\\". I think you should understand what I mean once you read the card's description in the book. <br />Even if I weren't looking to this deck as a means of spiritual divination; if I merely wished to do casual non-professional Tarot Readings, I still would have made it a point to get the Osho Zen deck because of its amazing artistry!  The intensity of color and detail is astounding! Each card is a vibrant feast for the eyes. I have seen many many decks throughout my years as a professional Reader and I still find this deck to be one of the most, if not THE most beautiful I've ever seen! <br />If you take your Readings seriously, I whole-heartedly suggest you choose the sometimes silly, yet highly meditative images that comprise the Osho Zen deck.(...)
B00003CXWV|2.0|Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled \\"Traffic,\\" \\"Blow\\" emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.<br />Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (\\"Traffic,\\" by the way, did NOT follow this path).  We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.<br />The early days of his \\"career\\" - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the \\"glamorous\\" world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.<br />The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an \\"innocent victim of circumstance\\" George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.<br />As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.  Writers Bruce Porter and David McKenna and director Ted Demme never establish that feeling of explosive dramatic intensity so crucial to a film of this nature.  In fact, for a film dealing with the dangerous world of drug trafficking, \\"Blow\\" seems to just sit there lackadaisically on the screen for most of its duration, devoid of energy, tension and drama. Needless to say, \\"Blow\\" ain't no \\"Traffic.\\", Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.

B000002QWD|5.0|This is it! The start of it all.  If you're a lover or hater of Christmas albums this is the album to praise/blame for them.  Bing Crosby's album originally called &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; now retitled to take advantage of one of the most popular songs of all time, &quot;White Christmas,&quot; is what popularized Christmas music as a commercial commodity.  As another reviewer stated this is the standard by which all other Christmas music albums are measured.<br />That being said &quot;White Christmas&quot; features some of Der Bingle's most famous songs- &quot;Mele Kalikimaka&quot; was used in Chevy Chase's movie &quot;Christmas Vacation;&quot; &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town,&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot; can be heard in the movie &quot;A Christmas Story;&quot; and if you have not heard Bing's version of &quot;White Christmas&quot; then chances are you're probably not from planet Earth.  This collection contains songs recorded in the 40's and as such reflects that period with backup being provided by the Andrews Sisters and Carol Richards.  Also the quality of the recordings is not great, but that is understandable considering their age.  However, Bing Crosby was THE voice of Christmas for decades and any Christmas collection without this album would have to be called incomplete.<br />On a side note: I'm an Irish-American Catholic just like old Bing, but I can't stand &quot;Christmas in Killarney.&quot;
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album is so good! It fits very well with the movie itself and listening to it takes you back into time. I love the black gospel music in it as well as the bluegrass. For anyone who trulely likes old-time country and bluegrass, you will definetely love this one.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Go Britney! After months of anticipating, pop queen Britney Spears has finally released her 3rd new album &quot;Britney&quot; and the long wait is unquestionably and definitely WORTH IT for her new album is AMAZING!The new album is a transition for Britney...she's not the &quot;Baby one more time&quot; or &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot; girl anymore...she has not only grown as a person, but also as an artist and it's obvious if you listen to the new music. It's INCREDIBLE, MORE MATURE, and shows WHO BRITNEY REALLYS IS. The tunes, from the diverse &quot;I am a slave 4 U&quot; to the funky &quot;what's like to be me,&quot; are sooo unique that you just can't get them out of your head and the album reflects Brit's creativity because she co-wrote 5 of the 12 songs. Moreover, Brit's voice sounds EXCELLENT and MORE MATURE AND SOULFUL especially in her beautiful ballad, &quot;I am not a girl, not yet a woman.&quot; Overall, &quot;Britney&quot; is Britney's GREATEST SUCCESS YET and it's a must have for fans and it's a must be in the number 1 spot in the charts. I give Britney all the credit and the applause for &quot;Britney&quot; shows not only who Britney is as a marvelous phenomenon, but also as a true artist and musical icon who we will see grow and develop better in the years to come. Go Britney!
B00005N9CV|3.0|I became a Krall fan from the time I heard Love Scenes.  I then bought all the CDs she had made.  I am very disappointed in the Look of Love with the large orchestral backing. Mrs Krall performs best with a small jazz group; there is an intimacy which I find enthralling and her piano playing ability is more evident.  The orchestra is a disturbing intrusion, completely destroying the intimacy of previous discs.   I hope she will return to the jazz group format.  I was not impressed by the quality of this recording.
0792846710|3.0|Killer Klowns from outer space is a good horror flim for the kids because in is mild-violence but still has some great scenes for example in the scene where vetern actor John Vernon is being used as a puppet by one of the klowns to talk to the deputy that is a the best scene in the whole movie i think. It is a B-movie so your going to see little actors you know. The movie also as some funny scenes in it one i can think of is where Mikes the main charactors horny two best friends meet the killer klown chicks who are also horny. the movie is good and I think it is good enough to rent but i dont know about buying. features, great make up work, alright acting, and a somewhat good ending.

0783229526|5.0|Jonny depp and benico dela toro do an excellent job acting in this i mean if you can act like your triping on acid that good then they should have won an oscar. The movie is about Rauol Duke which is played by Jonny Depp and his attonery Dr.Gonzo which is played by dela toro to go to Las Vegas and cover the MINT 400 which is the super bowl of dirt bike racing, although the movie only spends 15 mins at the races it is also alot about two friends on drugs in Las Vegas and that makes it a movie to watch. This movie was written by Hunter S. Thompson the greatest journalist in the late 60s 70s 80's and 90's. You can find some of his columns at espn.com. To prepare for this role Depp spent monthes at Hunters cabin in Coloardo to figure out what it is like to be Hunter S. Thompson and he puts in a great preformance in this movie. If you like this movie you should take a look at Where the Buffalo Roam.
B00000ING2|4.0|In The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers tackle the genre of classic American studio-produced comedy. It talks like the 30's, looks like the 40's and is set in a 50's New York that only exists as the workplace. The film, like any film by the Coens, is populated with characters that feel like they're something less than wholly human. The directors push their characters toward emulating the past's character actors with such uncanny precision that they become misshapen. None of these characters has a home or a life outside the workplace. The film, which follows the rise and fall of a mailroom clerk (Tim Robbins) that lives and creates the American dream, exists entirely within the tight sphere of its genre, and to stop to suggest more would only detract from the overall, streamlined effect.<br />In my opinion, The Hudsucker Proxy is the closest the Coen brothers have come to creating a mission statement. It's a clever satire of the phoniness of the studio system's product that simultaneously seems to be celebrating it (or, perhaps, its ability to expose its own falseness). There's such a corporate cleanliness and symmetry to the film that one suspects the brothers' main target is assembly line, Hollywood-ized narrative itself. It's probably not coincidental that this film was the first Coen brothers film with a significant budget (over $30 million). The film's key sequence, and perhaps the key to understanding all of the Coens' work, is one in which a female reporter's (Jennifer Jason Leigh - channeling Katherine Hepburn and Rosalind Russell) investigations into what makes the Hudsucker Company tick take on a bold literal dimension. She meets Moses, a black custodian (a part that would feel racist if not for the film's satiric bent) that tends to the firm's oversized clock. The keeper of the machinery, he is the only person that understands the events as they transpire. He explains to Leigh's reporter the circularity of the situation and predicts the outcome of the events. The assertion here is that these characters act as they do because they've been programmed like machine parts to do so in order to achieve the film's desired outcome. In this film, which has been programmed so that the little guy will &quot;win&quot;, he isn't even free to lose, since the story is ultimately being told by the big guys - complete with their biases, stereotypes, and rigid sense of class structure. They've been getting rich off of selling the little guy a simpleminded, counterfeit dream that he eats up time and again. Worse yet, many little guys are tricked into thinking the big guy's version of their dreams is actually their dream. When the film closes with Moses' narration, his knowledge of another, similar, story that took place on an even higher floor that this one did sounds like nothing less than a threat.  <br />It's rare to see such directness in a Coen brothers production, as they usually seem somewhat aloof about their motives. This film seems to be the key to understanding their work as a whole. Every head whip and hand swing of Leigh's character has to be accompanied by a whooshing sound because that's the requirement of the genre taken to its full extreme. They pump up the falseness inherent in this sort of character stereotype until it reaches its breaking point. In some of their films, such as O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the bubble breaks revealing nothing profound underneath the façade. In their better films like this one, and The Big Lebowski, their best film, they manage to make that core of hollowness a reprimand to the ideals that the film's very specific time and place represent. Here, Hollywood's corporate perception of the American dream being a direct function of ingenuity and hard work seems to be the target. The inevitability of the story's outcome and the pre-destined happiness of its stars both feel like arbitrary rules a cruel game. And cruelly, at the film's end, there's little implication that the future holds anything but more of the same.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Listening to this 3rd (gasp - who thought THIS would happen?) Britney CD, I've come to the conclusion that everything good about this  album is good simply because it's been ripped off from other great artists - mainly Britney's idol, Madonna.  Some of the samples, beats and lyrics have been stolen from other hit songs - including some recent ones.  On &quot;Boys&quot;, Britney assumes that she can use Janet Jackson's &quot;Nasty&quot; line, and she uses it to her full advantage, acting like she invented it.  Not to mention, on &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; she basically uses Pink's opera back beat, with her own new words.  Of the numerous Madonna references, the most obvious is the spoken part found in &quot;Cinderella&quot; - ripped from &quot;Rescue Me&quot; off of The Immaculate Collection.  Overall, this album is much better than the other two - including an *NSYNC song - oops, sorry, Britney and Justin DUET at the end which is worth a listen.  But otherwise, Britney has proven that she is indeed merely a product of the music industry - she will do whatever sells, even if it has been done, and done BETTER, before.  Supposedly, Britney arranged a ton of stuff on this album - she's trying to prove that she really is an ARTIST.  Could someone please call her up and tell her to try again in a couple of years, when she has ORIGINAL material? Hopefully, her second fifteen minutes will be up soon - and then, we music lovers can go back to the real divas - Janet and Madonna.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Well done, a fine piece. Finally a cd worth staying in the the car to listen to when you pull in to work, already thirty minutes late. I believe the entire work was created around song 6, &quot;Hard F....&quot;, a song of passion and inspiration. In fact, try poping this one in and driving by any local church or synagogue right after they convene.

You boys are gonna make a million offa this here album, and by God you deserve it. Rock on!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I just heard John perform on Conan and immediately sought out MP3s of his music, having heard the wonderful sincerety of his music I of course came straight to Amazon.com to buy the cd.  I don't buy many CDs being on a college student's budget, but John is an artist who deserves support.  Get this CD.
B00005JKHP|3.0|The flaws of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; never bothered me that much upon its release, but this new version, while better, still is a long way from greatness.<br />The revised special effects are an improvement over some of the flawed originals (particularly the final scenes involving the walk to V'ger), and director Robert Wise has trimmed a lot of the unnecessary dialogue, but the main problem with this film was a script that packed too little excitement.<br />Unfortunately, that can't be cured with better visual effects or more effective film edits. This film was always a visual treat, but the characters and script let it down badly, and they still do.<br />Still, this film IS a good time, especially for Trekkies, and simply watching it in widescreen, on DVD, makes the film look and feel a whole lot better. Paramount also included some terrific bonus materials on the making of the film, and the aborted Star Trek TV series that became the film series.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I am a teenage girl which might mean I'm sterotypically a teenie-bopper Britney fan that has closely followed her career ...But I can't say that is true, I was once a Britney fan..mostly by peer-pressure and naivety in her early days. But as soon as \\"Oops\\" came out I was already sick of her.<br />She is not a good role model for girls and frankly she is very superficial ... Her new Cd, \\"Britney\\" is evidence of her ever-growing reputation to be ... 'BAD GIRL'. It's not just that she is a bad girl, but for soooo long she denied it. How un-genuine and sneaky of her!<br />I do not own her new Cd, but my silly friend does(sorry ...!). For that reason I have been subjected to her songs (which are pretty much listening to Britney scream and pant while catchy beats play in the background). her songs are overloaded with attitude and ... She wants to come across as an independent, self-respecting, modern women (who walks around half-naked and wears a thong on the outside of her leather pants and bears her implants as if they were nature's gifts and must be seen by all).<br />I'm sorry if I let my personal opinion influence my musical opinion of Queen Britney's new Cd. But I wanted to get this out there, break the mold of all the reviews that praise her, add something different for people to read. Please display this online I didn't swear or outwardly judge any fans. This is just what I think...and is that a crime?!<br />Thank you.
B000006ZL4|5.0|I`ve read a lot that to be a prog band you`ve to be a Dream theater clone (no one can do that), there are a lot of clones out there though, but Symphony x is far away from that concept, and that makes this band outstanding and excellent<br />This album is simply their best (maybe V, could be but...) it has everything, amazing guitars, melodies, basslines, but to my opinion: drums are just the best, Rullo is the best drummer out there (just behind Portnoy), the keys by Pinella are simply incredible, and to give the perfetc mixture to the album there`s Russell Allen, what a vocalist, simply stunning.<br />Give i try to this album that includes my personal favorite Candelight Fantasia, the title track (23 minutes long) is amazing, the entire album is breathtaking, so to conclude: this is a stunning 3rd album, by SX, and i highly recommend to prog fans, DT fans, and of course to those who are listening to prog music to find clones of DT, well listen to this album and you`re gonna undestand that you don`t have to be a clone to be the best.<br />By the way, give a shot the the concept album V, it`s simply great, symphony x at his best.
B000002MP2|5.0|I have been a fan of greenday from the begining altough their songs aren't as edgy as some punk music they are catchy and funny my favourite song is basket case but when I come around is a real nice song .Having a blast Is cool to all in all best greenday ever!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|For all people out there, i`ve to say if you`re a DT fan you already know what this album is about, and the whole world of DT, and i cannot say enough, but if you`re new, and looking for great music, real music, well don`t wait that long and go buy this album that is simply amazing, it`s breathtaking.<br />I can assure you`re going to buy all catalog of the most amazing band in the whole world - DREAM THEATER-<br />And i must say that you couldstart with this album (their best), and then you will end with their new live album SCENES FROM NEW YORK, or simply go out and buy the one you want to, and believe you`re gonna love it
0380973650|5.0|I originally heard about Neil when a friend recommended Good Omens(GO) (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) about 10 to 12 years ago.  After reading GO a second time a few years ago, I started to seek out other works by the authors.  After reading a couple of each of their works, I can now separate out their contributions to GO. (My guess is that Neil does the dark drama, and Terry adds the Douglas Adams type humor)<br />It was by chance that I heard about American Gods earlier this summer, the premise sounded unique enough to keep it at the top of my list until it arrived at a local bookstore.<br />This book is easy to read and the detail is such that you really feel you just watched a movie.  Plus, being from the midwest, I can relate to a lot of the places mentioned in the book.  This just adds to visualization!!<br />The book has several twists and great foreshadowing (no pun intended since the main character is Shadow).  The characters are definitely unique in literature.  As far as I know, this is definitely not just another recycled plot.<br />I am usually intimidated by books this long because I tend to lose interest.  However, I read this book in record time.  It draws you back to find out what's happening.<br />Based on AG and GO, I am now reading Neverwhere and hope to have the same experience.
B000002L9Y|4.0|I remember cuts from this album when I was in junior high school.  At least four singles got radio airplay... Big Love Seven Wonders, Everywhere and Little Lies.  And while this album at times feels like a Lindsey Buckingham solo album, there are some great highlights.  For one Stevie's voice has a timbre that is never heard before or since.  This is her first post rehab album and it is reflected in the lyrics of Welcome to the Room.. Sara.  Check out how she can say the word Baby about 15 different ways in &quot;when I see you again&quot;.  This song features Stevie on the first several verses and Lindsey finishing out the song.  It's an underrated stand out.  Also check out Lindseys soaring guitar solo on the title cut.  He really is one of the most underated guitarists ever.  Even Christine shines on all of her songs.  What strikes me as odd.. is that at points it sounds like there is a drum machine instead of good ole mick fleetwood.<br />At points it sounds a bit 80's and dates itself that way.. but in my opinion it has great value as the last studio album of the rumours lineup of fleetwood mac.
078401213X|4.0|This movie is confusing and very good if understood fully. its about a mathematician with a goldfish named after a famous mathematician of the (i think) 20th century. this guy, max, suffers from paranoia, due to all his thinkings and accurate perception of everything around him. the movie is filmed in black and white, so it gives that gloomy feeling. he in the movie, is in search of the rest of numbers to the formula called PI in math, which start with the munbers 3.14...and it keeps going. i feel that this number is infinite, that is why the end of the movie is the way it is. THERE IS NO ANSWER. anyway, i gotta go. see the movie.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I bought the DVD, having really enjoyed the movie (ok, so I fell out of my seat laughing) and was not disappointed in the slightest.  Watching the movie again, I still laughed at everything (especially the gingerbread man and magic mirror scene...possibly the best scene in the movie), something that is rare when watching comedies (i.e. Something about Mary...not as funny the second time).  The DVD is loaded with extras, but the best is the Shrek Karoke Scene.  Some of the games are silly (i.e. ask the Magic Mirror) and the character interviews are not the funniest, but buy the DVD just for the crisp quality of the picture and sound.  It is something you can enjoy all year round!!!
0446310786|5.0|i am only 12 years old, and i can still see how amazing and honest this book is about our culture and the way things used to be. its so realistic, and the way that the writer captures such magnifigance through a childs' eyes is truly inspiring. to top it all off, i'm only half way through the book! prejudice was a terrible thing, as was slavery. this book shows how terrible, yet wonderful our history was and how good we can try to make and improve it. i recommend this book to anyone who has a nack for reading, or perhaps doesn't, because this will light up the bulb to your world.
6305531412|4.0|I bought the DVD because I love the movie.  I still love the movie, but the DVD is not anything special.  There are no extras and the picture and sound quality remind me of the video cassette copy I own.  In essence, there was no reason for me to go out and buy the DVD because it is exactly the same as the cassette tape.  I love the movie (hence, that is why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars) but the DVD needs a lot of work.
B000002A3T|5.0|&quot;The Division Bell&quot;, the often misunderstood and much maligned Pink Floyd album, works. And it does for one reason: Roger Waters is absent.<br />It's not that he was not talented while on the group; he had a gift for writing great music. But somewhere along the way he lost his humility and began inflating his ego to monstruous proportions. Animals was the veiled start to it; The Wall and The Final Cut, with his obsession about the death of his father was the climax. While The Wall is a good album, The Final Cut is a terrible one, filled with hate, anger and aggression towards all. It gives you the impression that he is the only perfect being in the whole world.<br />&quot;Momentary lapse...&quot;, the first album without Waters is not a good example of the post-Waters Floyd. But &quot;Division Bell&quot; is. It's a relaxing, intensely atmospheric album with great guitar playing, intelligent, poetic lyrics and a very introspective feel. Quite fitting for such a mature band. The fears of every individual and of the band as a whole are displayed here, instead of the egocentrism of one single individual.<br />This was my first Floyd album, and along with Dark Side of the Moon, it is my favorite.
0140434135|4.0|This is actually one of Austen's first works, she kept it for fifteen years, polishing it. It is her lightest work but it is still very good, we all need something light once in a while.<br />Our heroine is Catherine, she is a rather silly young girl who has read too many gothic romances. &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; in particular has turned her silly head. She seems to see a gothic mystery everywhere she looks. Catherine soon learns that the world is not all melodrama and eventually matures and marries a very sensible man. What keeps Catherine likable is her capacity to learn from her mistakes. She is certainly the least mature of Austen's heroines but she is never boring.<br />This is a marvelous book to start with if you want to get into Jane Austen, it does not have as many characters or subplots as her other works and it is very breezy. I enjoyed it and am now reading Udolpho myself. We'll see what happens. ;-)
B000001IPL|5.0|I Love This Album. This Is  Probably The Best Album I Ever Bought. It Has a Load Of Good Songs. My Favourite Tracks Are,Bad Habit, Smash, Come Out And Play, Self Esteem And What Happened To You. This Is The Offspring's Best Album But It Is Hard To Decide Between Smash And Ignition. Overall I Think This Is A Great Album And Well Worth Your Money. You Should Try It Out.
6302719631|1.0|Of course I understand that movies cannot help but be affected by the time period during which they were made but this movie is just too much. It is very clear that it was made at the height of the slasher flick craze and it shoehorned it into the plot of a Jane Austen novel.<br />Horror novels of the late eighteenth, early nineteenth centuries were more about atmosphere and melodrama than fingers being sewn together (yuck) The fantasies of Catherine were completely out of place and gave no indicator of how a girl of her time period really felt. In fact, none of the preformances convinced me that these were regency people and not modern actors wandering around sets.<br />This is also what I call a &quot;staring&quot; movie. That is, to build up suspense, the characters flash one another meaningful glances as though that is supposed to make us gasp at their emotional intensity. To me, it just looked like indigestion.<br />I am not a stickler for historically accurate music (if I were, I would never enjoy ANY movie) but I found the soundtrack annoying in the extreme. With it's sax/guitar nonsense, it sounded as though it had been lifted from a daytime drama.<br />I returned the movie and read the book, much more rewarding.
1878424319|5.0|&quot;The Four Agreements&quot; gives the reader a simple understanding of how to act in order to change how you feel about yourself in this world. This book reminds me of a fantastic book I read for parents and teachers titled &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; by Matt Pasquinilli. Like &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot;, &quot;The Four Agreements&quot; will give you simple steps to take to improve your sense of contentment and sense of purpose as a parent, or just as a member of this world. Buy both books to get a more comprehensive understanding of simple and effective living.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Gold is like no other album I own.  Adams is all over the place with this, his second post-Whiskeytown release.  Fans of Heartbreaker, his debut album, will be surprised to hear the pop, electric, whimsical Adams of Gold.  They will be confused by his falsetto, perhaps turned off by the less-than-desperate lyrics, and maybe dismayed to hear no overt reference to anyone named Amy.  But the truth is, and it can be discovered after a few listens, that the melancholy is still there, so is the heartache, and so is Amy.  Ryan Adams is still Ryan Adams, even if the style with which he conveys his message has been slightly, well, revved-up.  Every song on Gold is worthwhile, even \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" is irresistible.  \\"Nobody Girl\\" and \\"Enemy Fire\\" will lull you, but they're not soft songs.  \\"Somehow Someday\\" will remind you that Adams is a melodic genius. \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" calls us back to the country with an up-front pedal steel.  \\"Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues\\" (in my opinion, very Gram Parsons-esque) is just a fun number.  Then there's \\"SYLVIA PLATH,\\" a touching, simple song about longing for a lover that one will never find.  And don't forget the bonus disk, with five songs each of a different sort, all of which will propell you to the porch to sit down in your dirty jeans and light a cigarette and enjoy.  <BR>When I listen to Gold-in my dark room, in my car, on my porch-I can sing loud or hum low, open my mouth and smile or close my eyes and cry.  All I know is I am a different person with this record on.  I can't help but play a part that no one asked me take on.  Buy the album and you'll know what I mean.  Be sure to have a six pack in the fridge, buy a brand spankin' new pack of cigarettes, and set aside some time to be a lonesome badass.  Gold will have you wanting to play the part.
B00003CXXI|2.0|The animation is pretty good but the whole movie never really impressed me beyond that.  I think of the children's movies I grew up with and feel sorry for this generation of children that a movie experience is comprised of worn out gags and a hodge podge of popular music.  Let your kids see Bambi or Fantasia instead.
0385505833|3.0|amazon.com reviewers are urged not to be \\"Spoilers! Please don't reveal crucial plot elements.\\" No need on John's Grisham's failed attempt to write a little Christmas story. The plot may be summed up in three words, predictable, predictable, predictable. Its a slim volume, but it could have been summed up in a half dozen sentences or a short story.<br />This is a disappointing effort from an author who has in the past kept me up at night because I could not bear to put down his latest book. Even his last, \\"A Painted House,\\" contained sufficient surprises to make me forget I was being inconvenienced by airport delays and cancelled flights.<br />Unless you're a reader who wishes to be able to display \\"everything Grisham ever wrote\\" in hardcover on your bookshelf, read this one at the library.
0446677450|5.0|Robert's book clarifies what I have thought for a long time, it is the parents responsibility to teach their children practical financial lessons, whether opening their first savings account to using credit, etc.  We can do a lot to help our children avoid financial hardships in the future, not doing so is an injustice not notice till the child has become an adult and don't live up to our and their expections.  Teach them about the stock market, real estate, how to identify opportunities, and minimize risks so they can be successful in the real world.  Get involved with the schools so they can do their best for the kids: setting standards, sharpening minds, and providing wonderful memories of classroom and athletic accomplishments. <br />If you don't know much about investing in stocks, real estate, etc., then get started now, it is even better when learned as a family.  If you never get any other book for self-improvement, this should be the one you add to your library.  Guess what my friends and family members are getting this Christmas? <br />Lastly, before picking up this book open your mind to new ways of thinking while reflecting on your past experiences and memories.  Holding judgement until you have finished, I have not been able to put this book down since I opened the cover.  Be open to new ways of thinking about assets and liabilities; his lesson on home ownership as a liabilities flies right in the face of what we have been taught or observed in our childhood.  How you react (I know I thought he lost it at first until I continued reading) is a great measure of whether you can shift your long standing paradigms, use it to try and identify your assets and liabilities.  Enjoy!!!!
0671027573|5.0|The only problem about this book - was that it ended! This book was a laugh a minute - don't read the negative reviews - they must have been reading a different book!! This would have to be the best LH book to date - a pity she doesn't write more books along the same format.
0395925037|5.0|Mein Kampf is a conundrum of a book.  Hitler wrote it whilst serving an absurdly truncated prison sentence for attempting to overthrow the democratically elected government of Bavaria.  Even with the editorial advice of better-educated friends and sympathisers, it's still a turgid, rambling, humourless (!), frequently mendacious read.  Hitler frequently lies about his own life and career (for example, he casually omits to mention that he used to be an Army propagandist for the Social Democrat government, before he ever got interested in the fledgling German Workers Party that would evolve into the Nazi Party).  He churns out a lot of stamped-in-tin rhetoric about the evils of democracy, and there's some sub-pornographic BS about curly-haired Jews raping Aryan maidens.<br />Nevertheless, a lot of very committed and dangerous people think that this book is a masterpiece.  This is perhaps because they are too lacking in any sense of justice and human decency to see that the man who wrote this book went on to cause an unimaginably destructive and needless war, destroying the country he claimed to love in the process.  <br />This needs to be said: Hitler was not some supernatural genius.  He was a beerhall orator, with unusual gifts of persuasion and a raw tactical skill, who rose to prominence because power interests around him had no faith in anything better coming along.  Ian Kershaw's excellent biography makes this clearer than anything I could say.  It's worth pointing out that Hitler himself, once he had gained the Chancellery, admitted that if he'd known he was ever going to get that far, he'd never have written this book.  It exposes him for the small-minded, unimaginative, hate-ridden racist he was, and he knew as much himself.<br />It's a bloody awful read, but it remains the best guide there is to the cramped and stuffy little world that is the imagination of the Nazi.  Or, for that matter, Neo-Nazi.
B00005B6C9|5.0|April 24 was when it came out. In 2001,that is. I bought the CD fifteen days later. Before purchasing the CD,I must have heard the title track about 50 times over the satellite feed where I work. I am a longtime Bee Gees fan and have been since the '77 theatrical release of the John Travolta movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. Some of the other tracks I truly enjoy are LOOSE TALK COSTS LIVES,EMBRACE,SHE KEEPS ON COMING BACK and TECHNICOLOR DREAMS. Barry,Robin and Maurice Gibb sound no different than when they broke into American radio in 1967. Like Hanson,this group of brothers really does rock!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney is doing her thing and this CD proves it!! She is writing for people her age and showing that she is no longer a little girl!! I am 20 yrs old and i can relate to the songs and i hear what shes saying! All of the tracks are funky and the beats are hot! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants some good music to rock to!
0553277472|5.0|After all these years as an active reader, I still consider Robert Pirsig's incredible tour-de-force in this book to be the intellectual adventure of a lifetime, one that still makes me  shake my head in wonder after a number of readings of it. I was introduced to &quot;Zen&quot; by my brother in law, who promised me that I would enjoy it. Wow, what an understatement! By now I must admit to now having several short quotes from it framed under glass at various spots in the house, because I was so taken by the gravity of what he has to say, and the disarmingly simple way he usually chooses to say it. Pirsig is a man with a lot to say, and a lot of wisdom in what he has to offer.<br />Although I must admit that I do not agree with certain key aspects of his argument regarding the way the ancient bifurcation between what he calls romantic and classic perceptive orientations can at last be repaired and restored to cognitive and intellectual unity, I stand in utter awe at the quality of mind any human being must have to marshal such a breath-taking effort as this, at the accomplishment of conceiving and articulating the philosophical treatise described in such loving and painstaking detail here. His grasp of such eclectic, obscure and philosophically central notions truly is a feat quite the equal of the ascent of Everest in terms of the levels of concentration, mental endurance, and simple cognitive acumen necessary to muster this kind of argument.<br />The book works on two levels that both assist and complement each other. First, the story narrative, which he uses both to illustrate ideas he is talking about and to introduce ideas he wants to discuss, also acts to bring us back to &quot;normal everyday reality' after spinning high in the thin cold air of his theorizing. Second, the philosophical story becomes a kind of sophisticated detective story for curious intellectuals, as Pirsig's alter ego, Phaedrus, searches deeper and deeper into the mysteries that once led him into insanity because of the sheer intensity of his efforts to solve the riddle of the difference between the two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of reality (the romantic and the classic).<br />The book is an awe-inspiring trip into a discovery of the nature of reality, contemporary society, and yourself. It has led to study groups, study guides, and a whole cult of Pirsig watchers who consider him the functional equivalent of the wise seer. The wildly best-selling book also led Pirsig deeper into a life of isolation, eschewing publicity and seeking greater introspection. There is a sequel, called &quot;Lila&quot;, which also enjoyed a best-selling run on the charts in the early 1990s. This is a book that is quite unlike anything else you have ever read, and is something you have to experience to understand in its full impact. It is also a book I can recommend with a smile, knowing with confidence you will be glad you finally decided to buy it and read it.

B00003CXWV|2.0|Putting it quite simply, Blow blew. While I greatly admire Johnny Depp, and think he has amazing talent as an actor, not even he, nor any of the other talented supporting cast members, could save this piece of garbage. The movie plods along slowly, without any real purpose. Sure, there are some fun scenes along the way, but the movie doesn't seem to have a real point. I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it; everyone should form their own opinions. But I'd definitely suggest renting it before splurging on a DVD.
B00005N9CV|1.0|OK, I took the plunge, bought into the hype, believed what I'd read and ordered this CD from Amazon. Hey, it doesn't hurt that she looks great on the cover either! Talk about the old addage &quot;Don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;, don't judge this record by it's cover, or the reviews or the previous Grammy nominations. This is such middle of the road, unimaginative, watered down pap I can hardly believe it. Mediocrity really has risen to the top, a la Britney, J-Lo, etc. A pretty face and a pretty weak musical effort. If this type of music REALLY interests you I suggest looking elsewhere for your aural pleasure - Enya, Eva Cassidy, Marilyn Scott, Patricia Barber are all better places to spend your hard earned music dollar.
B000002JNJ|5.0|While Pantera has already released 6 albums including the live album with their greatest hits, my opinion is that Cowboys From Hell is their first and best album of all time. The best song in the album is &quot;Cemetery Gates.&quot; But the rest of the CD is strong and brutal especially &quot;Shattered.&quot; Other great bands are Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Sepultura.

B00002ZMNV|4.0|I am a beginner when it comes to Metallica, a total newbie, the only songs I really know well are Enter Sandman and Nothing else matters. As soon as those guys entered the stage and began playing their music I realized that I'll become a fan very very soon. The solos and the singing were absolutely unbelievable - although the music played by the symphony wasn't over the top and is a bit simple and not sophisticated the combination with the drums and the guitar is absolutely perfect - many bands have tried but these guys are natural. One point though, the picture quality in the beginning is not that good as you expect from DVD. But it's all worth it after you see and hear them play.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The movie was great, but the music, that was phenomenal! I can listen to the music contained on this disc numerous times, without ever getting tired of it. The music sings straight to your soul, and is beautiful to the ears. Favorite songs include O Death and Angel Band. If you liked this soundtrack, I suggest you hear the Soundtrack of Songcatcher. It is along the same lines. Good old mountain music.

B000002KJQ|1.0|...charges should be laid against those responsible for talking a fantastic album of this calibre and &quot;neutering&quot; it to the point of making it into a &quot;new and improved&quot;??? better sounding album for the musically deprived!<br />I owned this on 8-track tape 25 years ago, and trust me, this is not the same album! I just purchased this cd and the first thing I noticed was the hollow, &quot;tecno-pop&quot; type sound of the drums on the entire album. I have proof that new tracks were laid down for the song &quot;La Grange&quot; because on ZZ Top's 2nd Greatest Hits compilation, it includes the new &quot;remastered&quot; version, and its different than the version from the 1st Greatest Hits album.<br />Well it appears to me that someone in their infinite wisdom said &quot;hey, lets clean up the whole album&quot;? Also, throughout the entire cd, you can hear blatant changes to the songs right down to the vocals which again were re-done in most instances. A perfect example of this comes from the opening of &quot;Jesus Just Left Chicago&quot;. In the original version, Gibbons does not over-emphasize &quot;Chicaaaaagggooo&quot; in the 1st verse as he does here.<br />Add to this the softening of many of the original guitar licks and chords. In the &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot; tune, it's bad enough that we have to contend with &quot;tin pan- electro synth&quot; type drum sounds, but the edge has been taken off of Gibbons<BR>wailing guitar. Proof of this exists if you own the 1st Greatest Hits album and listen to the version included here compared with the new cd version. <br />I dare you to put the two of them on and play each song that is included here with the new and improved &quot;La Grange&quot;cd. It doesn't take a genious to hear the difference, and the drastic changes made to this once classic and superb sounding album is a crying shame. <br />Ohhhh if only I had kept my 8-track tapes.<BR>As a previous reviewer states, find this one onvinyl if you can.
B0000508U6|5.0|I had actually never heard of Coldplay until I read an article about Charlize Theron in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine.  She had remarked that it was the CD she presently had in her car.  Now I sure have!  I read in an earlier review that &quot;Spies&quot; reminds them of 9/11/01.  I have that same specific thought.  I had just purchased the disc right around that time,and listened to it constantly.  Maybe its a timing issue, but I find the lyrics haunting.  ...they're going to catch us where we sleep.&quot;  &quot;they're&quot; being bin laden and the rest of those ignorant, sadistic folks.  Enough ranting...  I absolutely love this album.  I look forward to more great stuff from Coldplay.  I hope the next one won't be as ironical though.    Brian
B000000OAL|5.0|I first heard this album back in 1974. I was in a friends car. We had just headed out onto a slightly snow covered frozen lake, <br />Driving along in a Dodge Barracuda, sliding around and then all of a sudden he puts on this tape, (8 track no less)... and says, here check this out. As he hits the gas, on comes <BR>&quot;Great King Rat&quot;<br />... well, that was my introduction to Queen! Here we are driving around like madmen... all out...full bore... Great King Rat blaring through the speakers!!! It's no wonder after this, I had to have this album. I bought the 8-track and played the hell out of it. As the years passed by, and Queen continued to put forth hit after hit and carried on with showing the world what great artists they were, I could not help but think of where they came from. In 1987, as cd's were becoming the standard for music, I was able to purchase the original Queen in this format. It was an import and was taken from its original format, no extra tracks and even including the &quot;pound&quot; symbol<BR>on the price tag, from Britain. I was pleased to hear the album in its original format, bassy and somewhat muddled as was the 8-track. It occurred to me then as it does now that I possess a true gem and would not give this up for the world.<br />Here is a debut album from a group that truly set the pace for many years to come as far as prestigious rock groups go.<br />Even with this first album, Queen had the insight to show us just what was to come. Unlike many debut albums, they didnt come off as &quot;one hit wonders&quot; and yet at the same time, filled an entire album with 10 powerful, to be reckoned with songs. Go ahead and name the worst song on the album... (it is difficult isnt it?)<br />Bearing that in mind, this shows just how much influence these guys had right from day 1!<br />Here is an album that highlights all of the talents of all of the performers and does so convincingly to the point of saying, &quot;here we are, this is what we can do, just watch what we will do years to come&quot;.<br />Here is where you get to hear Freddie Mercury at his best with his unique vocal styling, (Just listen to &quot;Great King Rat&quot;). Here is where you'll hear Brian May have his way with his guitar, John Deacon knock us dead with the bass and of course Roger Taylor let loose with his drums the likes that has not been seen since on anyone's debut album.<br />To critique each and every song would be futile, simply because there is something here for everyone, and anyone with the remotest passion for Queen will find something in this album that will endear them further. Yes, it's true that when this album was released, these guys were ahead of their time. It's quite evident when you throw the album on today and hear the sheer power that comes through with each selection. <br />These guys were serious, and they knew that they had something.<br />I can't say enough about this album, suffice it to say that if you want to know what Queen was and is all about, please... please... you must give this a listen to.<br />In my humble, yet honest opinion, to me it was like these 4 guys made about 3 practice albums, and then said... Okay &quot;this one's for real&quot;... and man... was it ever!!!<br />Queen's &quot;Queen&quot; truly was and remains their crowning glory.
B00003CXV4|3.0|I have heard a lot about this movie... so I expected a lot from it. Can't say it is not worth watching! It is a very nice movie, the setting is very catchy but I am not sure how can I describe what is missing... maybe I'd call the movie hallow! Maybe the story ought to have been left to be read in a book not acted! <br />Keanu Reeves &amp; sweet Charlize Theron did a great acting job. Great sound track of course as well as great settings. <br />Again I must stress that such a story better left to be read than filmed. But still don't miss watching this movie to be the judge of that.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Every critic says that teen pop is only a passing fad, which may be true, but this album is most definitely not teen pop. On her self-titled third album, Britney Spears is introducing us to what's in store for popular music in the future. No song on this record sounds the same, and none sounds like anything you've heard before. On the album's first track, and first single, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U,&quot; Britney delivers a sensual R&amp;B/Hip Hop vocal performance reminiscent of Janet or even Prince. The most prominent feature of the song, however, is the unique track provided courtesy of The Neptunes (Jay-Z, P.Diddy, Ray J., etc.). At times Britney's sexy grunts, moans, pants, and ad-libs seem to blend into the track as if they were beats. The album's second track, &quot;Overprotected,&quot; is produced by Britney's long time producers Max Martin and Rami. This is most definitely the duo's most innovative work with Britney. The song, although mainly pop, samples a little bit of R&amp;B, a little bit of Hip Hop, and even some beats that seem to be a play on Industrial music (kinda like the beats on Janet's &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;). Also this song has strong relations to Britney's life. The song discusses feeling that the people around you are trying too much to protect you. In it Britney talks about being willing to make mistakes, and wanting the chance to do things on her own. Track 3, &quot;Lonely,&quot; is a song Britney wrote herself. It's produced by Rodney Jerkins, and features a heavy Rock &amp; Roll beat and a taste of R&amp;B grooves as well. This is one of my favorites on the album; it shows Britney taking control and showing some real grit. &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; track 4, is the only ballad on the record and Britney's best yet. Max Martin and Rami provide the track, and singer-songwriter Dido (&quot;Here With Me,&quot; &quot;Thankyou&quot;, etc.) provides the lyrics. This song really relates to Britney. It's about being stuck in between a girl and a woman: wanting to have fun, but wanting to take control of life too. The lyrics are the best Britney has ever sung. Plus, Britney's voice has never sounded as good. Track 5, &quot;Boys,&quot; is a deliciously unique Hip Hop edged track that pays homage to retro 80's R&amp;B (most especially Janet's &quot;Nasty&quot;). The Neptunes are responsible for this track as well. The lyrics are exceptionally sexy for Britney. &quot;What would it take for you to just leave with me,&quot; She sings. &quot;Anticipating,&quot; is yet another retro track. This time Britney samples dance-floor disco grooves of the 70's. This is the second song on the record Britney wrote. It's produced by Josh &amp; Brian (Willa Ford, 3LW). Track 7 is a cover of Joan Jett's 1984 hit &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll.&quot; This version is produced by Rodney Jerkins, and features a clever record scratching Hip Hop chord. Track 8, &quot;Cinderella,&quot; is the third song Britney wrote on the album. This is another song with Max Martin and Rami. It's a classic Britney pop song with a little techno/industrial twist. On &quot;Let Me Be,&quot; track 9, Britney talks about people trying to change who she is. She co-wrote the song with Brian &amp; Josh. It's produced by Rodney Jerkins. It has a light R&amp;B groove, with smooth vocals that are some of Britney's best. Track 10, &quot;Bombastic Love,&quot; is a Max Martin and Rami written and produced pop song with theatrical and operatic effects. &quot;That's Where You Take Me,&quot; track 11, is an electro ballad, written by Britney and produced by Brian &amp; Josh. It plays out smoothly like a ballad, but has a more accelerated pace. Track 12, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me,&quot; is an over the top track, written and produced by Britney's boyfriend Justin Timberlake (who also contributes background vocals), and choreographer, Wade Robson. It samples tons of styles and genres. It's heavily influenced by Rock (it's got killer guitar riffs). You'llalso notice techno, trance and electonica as you listen. Most especially unique is a bridge and breakdown, featuring Britney and Justin harmonizing over Justin's beat boxing. <BR>Overall, this is an incredible record everyone should get whether you're a Britney fan or not. It's very unique and fun to listen to. There's only one ballad so you could definitely bring this to a party to play down. Hey, who wouldn't want to groove to Britney singing &quot;I Really Wanna Dance With You, I Wanna Do All The Things You Want Me To.&quot;
0385484518|5.0|it's certainly a book that reminds you a lot of forgotten everyday things that you usually neglect. when i first bought it, i expected it is in some sort of &quot;lessons&quot; or &quot;preachings&quot; tone. but, turned out it's a really simple book. words are basic but it echoes with your weakest part. it is a very touching book. it made me cried several times. it even made me visit my teacher in the pass. it reminded me of things i also did as an average person yet i felt guilty of. it opened up another angle to see life. some questions it set out was really appealing.
B000059XUI|5.0|I've been reading some of the criticism of Superman II ...and I have to say that really, it just seems to be a load of sour grapes spouted by people who know more than they probably should!<BR>Superman II, whoever takes most credit for the directing duties (who cares?!), is, has and always will be a classic movie...<BR>I don't know anybody who really gives a toss about the production problems - this movie is just as exciting as the first and, basically, equals the first movie for excitement and entertainment value.<br />One thing I would note though, is that I have given the movie the full 5 stars strictly for the movie itself as there are no real extras to speak of besides the trailer.<BR>Superman II on DVD just doesn't compare to the value for money you get with the DVD version of the first movie.<br />It's a shame because, as with all 4 Superman movies (especially the much criticized Superman IV), there were lots of footage which were cut - some of which were (strangely) reinstated in television broadcasts of the movies. (Why? I have no idea!)<BR>Scenes still not in this version include how Clark got his powers back, and deleted scenes could have included General Zod using a machine gun(!)...<br />In terms of using DVD to its full potential, Superman II is definitely a let down... <BR>But saying that, you really can't beat Superman II on DVD in widescreen, compared to the dodgy old tapes released commercially way back in the late eighties, (and that goes for any of the other Superman movies), so if you have a DVD player I still can't recommend Superman II highly enough!!<br />One point of interest for the Superman movie fans who wonder why there's nothing extra in the DVD version of Superman II:<BR>The reason is because Richard Donner refuses to have anything to do with the movie. Apparently he was offered the chance to rework the film as he did with the Superman: The Movie DVD, but he declined, still angry at being sacked by the producers all those years ago...(I think he must own the bits which were cut out then, otherwise why couldn't somebody else at Warners have put them in as \\"Deleted Scenes\\"...????)
B00005JG6Q|2.0|Why oh why did they think they needed to redo the english dubbing. now insted of they sounding like they look on the screen . they all sound like a bunch of first graders. although it still is watchable if you turn off the english and go with the subtitles
B00005LB9O|4.0|Although this is the first cd I've ever heard of this band, I can say it won't be the last.  Travis is a band that at times is very reminiscent of Radiohead and at other times sounds like classic pop that you just don't mind listening to on a regular basis.  They may not be as upbeat as some people would like but they are great for that lackadazical day where you just want to have some good music in the background.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I thought that I would write a follow-up review to the one I previously submitted, back in July 2001, before this box set was released. Having purchased and viewed the entire set (and there's a lot of bonus materials, folks, enough to fill a whole evening), I want to share my enthusiasm with you. First of all, the ditigal transfer is amazing on all 3 films. It is difficult to appreciate the improved picture and audio quality unless one views the old VHS version, side-by-side with this edition. Trust me, there's no comparison. As for the films themselves, well, you wouldn't be reading this review if you aren't a Godfather fanatic like I am. Even GIII is an entertaining finale to the trilogy, even if some of the acting sucks, the dialogue is cliche-ridden, and most of the characters are two-dimensional (with the exception of Pacino, of course; he makes the best of<BR>mediocre dialogue). Normally, I don't care for commentary tracks, because it's difficult to watch the movie (and hear the dialogue) while some disembodied voice is explaining this or that scene. But Coppola's commentary is truly entertaining, with many humerous anecdotes about Brando, et al and behind-the- scenes revelations about his near-firing from Paramount on the first film. I watched all 3 films a second time, just to listen to his commentary. The deleted scenes (and there are a lot of them) were great; one wishes that they had been included in the orginal release. There are 2 full-length featurettes, with short appearances with some of the actors, such as James Caan and Talia Shire. All in all, this set is well worth the bucks, and should be in the collection of any serious student of film. Happy viewing!!
B00003CXXS|1.0|Is this the best Steven Spielberg cold do?  Oh that's right he didn't direct it, how obvious.  Did they honestly think that a movie with the name &quot;Jurassic&quot; in it and zero quality in it would do well?  How dumb do they think we are?  I saw this movie and wanted the entire cast to get eaten, and was disapointed when certain people lived.  I feel really bad for Sam Neill there is no way this movie could have looked good on paper, they must have driven a dump truck full of money up to his house for him to say yes to this movie.  I loved Jurassic Park.  It should have stopped there.  I bought Lost Word because it came with the Jurassic Park DVD.  Also in that set was a free pass to JP 3, I went and even though the ticket was free I still felt like I was ripped off.  Just thinking about JP 3's plot is making mad.  Horrible.
B00005QK3B|5.0|I have owned this album since it was originally released. I have owned it in vinyl, cassette, and now CD. Why do I continue to buy it when my old version wears out? Because &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; is simply one of my very favorite albums ever. <br />This is a concept album, composed after the progressive rock style. This is intelligent, variable, engaging music. The musicianship is superb; the songwriting is oustanding; and the lyrics are mesmerizing.  I own many (if not all) Marillion albums, and &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; stands out far above the rest, in my opinion. This album is simply brilliant. <br />All the songs flow together so that they sound like one continuous piece of music. The moods range from gentle introspection to agressive defiance.<br />Fish passionately sings lyrics that are often cryptic but allow the listener to conjure up his/her own individual interpretation or images of what each song is about. Other songs, such as &quot;Kayleigh,&quot; are more straight forward lyrically, dealing with more obvious themes. And the band adds beautifully to Fish's words, creating a variable and always appropriate musical ambience. <br />You simply have to listen to all songs on this album in order in their entirety to get the full magnitude of Marillion's work. Every song is unique.  Every song is majestically performed. Every song contributes to the magnificence of this album. <br />I cannot say enough good about this disc. I LOVE IT!  Definitely a recommended pick for you Amazon.com listeners!
0517543052|5.0|So, here I am about a year ago and I am in the process of <BR>knowing &quot;whats up&quot; with things.  I had had pychedelic expierences with psilocybin and LSD and whatnot, I I thought, wow<BR>they don't tell you this is skills for adolesence class!  Then I hop on the ol' internet, read psychedelics encyclopedia and realized that alot of people, doctors included<BR>that believed drugs can actually expand the mind.  It wasn't just me and my exclusive, aparrently misguided friends. My Parents, &quot;what is happening to our son!&quot; But I show them the studies and the opinions of well known &quot;smart respectable people&quot;<BR>many scientist and philosophers, and they say, &quot;well perhaps there not all nuts afterall, or maybe there lunicy  is hiding under a viel of legetamasy.... Anyway the guy who sold me my '79 <BR>v-dub bus says have you ever read &quot;Be Here Now?&quot; and I say, no, but I've heard of Ram Dass, the guy from harvard with leary, yeah I know whats up with that guy. Boy was I wrong, I thought Ram Dass was a footnote on america's psychedelic history, but I find that he is a true hero for those seeking truth, at least as big as leary for that sake.  Any way he gives me a copy and says check it out.  I start reading it and get to the dark part, And I'm thinking, Am I trippin, Is this really just some cracked-out <BR>acid-head that is hiking down a trail of drug induced un-thuths? am I only down with this because he has done psychedelics, what if he were'nt into drugs would I be down with this, and the drawings and all this, and I began to test my faith in the guy. But as I read it I thought&quot;well he isn't preaching any religion, he doesn't tell me what to do with my life he simply says listen what I believe to be true.  And I began to see, no matter how skeptical I was trying to be, I couldn't deny that it made sense, real sense to me.  And then I look at what the Dali Lama says and ghandhi and krisnamurti and infinite more and they all say the same thing! If Ram Dass is nuts then vitually every religious leader and holy people are all on the bandwagon of deception. To add to this  rather comforting thought is that the words ring true in my heart, which can't be wrong.  The first part of the book may seem far fetched, but he says it happened this way, he is still alive, and was a harvard professor, look at christianity and think that was 2000 years ago, his deciples were farmers, Neem Karoli Baba died about 30 years ago and Ram Dass is HERE NOW. I met mim a month ago in San Rafeal, he has had a stroke but is doing well, if you are skeptical, talk to him your self, I did, he'll be in the open secret book store again soon.  Search google to find out the details. Don't take my word for it; take yours,read it. After all its the only opinion you can trust. There are may great books that say things very similiar this. in that respect, this book is not unique, but the way the information is delivered and Ram Dass's wonderfull way of communicating what's in his heart. And this is what makes the book a classic, a must read. pure love egoless love thats Ram Dass.  Good luck on your journey.  Namaste:)
B00005QDW5|3.0|That some of the Post Roger Waters material is that good to be included in a best of. For that matter Roger's solo material from Amused to Death should be considered because it has such a more superior Pink Floyd feel than the abyssimal High Hopes. (Ughh!) I cannot stop cringinng when hearing this Britney Spears type Pink Floyd (Way too contrived and not very good at that) Not to mention the even more horror show of Keep Talking. It seems they were scratching their heads watching 2001 A Space Oddesey like the Monkees in the movie to come with a Pink Floyd type song. The monkees would've have done much better. If they have litgitimize this era of Pink Floyd where is On the Turning Away? or What do you want me to do? Songs that have a much more Pink Floyd sound.<br />Aside from that it covers as much as they could, but I could've still made much more genuine.
6305181772|5.0|This is BY FAR the best action movie of the 90's. A fantastic epic film, with the sites becoming more and more exotic until we reach the climax in the [UK-France] Chunnel. This last chase scene by itself is better than most action movies of this decade. <BR>I've seen this movie more than 10 times and I see something new each time.<BR>Highly Recommended.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Wow, I love this movie. Great great music, super cool cars and great actors. Hell, who needs a story anyway! Ahhhh, just look at these cool cars :-) The plot isn't that bad by the way.
B00005LC3Y|3.0|This movie is excellent.  I don't think I need to expand upon the numerous reviews which state this very same thing.  I do, however, want to point out that I was sorely disappointed to see the movie only released as standard (1.33) format and not widescreen.  As extras go, this DVD falls short here too.  For a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; I expect to see more depth behind the movie.  I know Kubrick is dead but I'm sure there are numerous interviews with him, the author of &quot;The Short Timers&quot;(dead as well) and the auhor of the screenplay.  More information about why the movie was split the way it was.  Why didn't it cut between incidents at boot camp and the war?  So many questions are left unanswered by not including an interview into the making of the movie and the writing of the screenplay that I have to give this particular edition a thumbs down.
6304196938|5.0|I highly recommend this film!  It is really <BR>entertaining full of adventure!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out \\"Legally Blonde,\\" a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her \\"frivolous\\" curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the \\"serious\\" of the \\"upper crust\\" elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears.  With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any \\"shallowness\\" around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.<br /> Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain \\"mold,\\" or coincide with someone else's \\"opinions\\" of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her.  At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; \\"dumb blonde\\" jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well. <br /> Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you rootfor her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground.  There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.<br /> The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, \\"Legally Blonde\\" can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature.  Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Only Pink Floyd could release a concept 'best of' album, and this compilation is as good as any released.  Its concept is, simply, the story of Floyd as told by its four members and the ghost of Syd Barrett.  That being said, it could still be better (as much of the other 76 reviews attest.)  If the 2 minutes of the edited &quot;Marooned&quot; were eliminated, there'd be room for &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Nobody Home&quot; or maybe &quot;The Gunner's Dream.&quot;  And exactly how is it that not one of the reviews mentions the omission of &quot;Fearless&quot;?It would have been great to see this artwork on a large vinyl album cover.  In any case, it's a great introduction (or conclusion?) to a phenomenal band.  But buy 'Dark Side' and 'The Wall' first.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham did a great job on this book. I'm not a big fan of novel reading but John Grisham's books change my mind and even make me like reading even more. At first, I thought this book was some kind of adventurous story like the Testament. Although it's not, I love it still. This book is very heart felt and funny at the same time, something you'd want to share with people you love. I don't regret that I rang up many bookshops in my area and in the city to find out whether they had it in the store. Luckily, a bookshop in the city has them in stock so I travelled all the way in a cold weather to get it and finished it overnight. I feel very good when I think about Skipping Christmas story and the Krank :) Try it!
B0000025H6|5.0|It had been at least ten years since I listened to _The Wall_. Vinyl copy lost to divorce, tape copy eaten by car player--you know. One recent day I felt the urge to hear it. Ordered it on CD, waited impatiently for its arrival . . . but waited for the right time to pop it into the player.<br />&quot;Look, Mummy; there's an aeroplane up in the sky.<br />&quot;D-d-d-did you see the frightened ones . . . D-d-d-did you hear the falling bombs . . . D-d-d-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?&quot;<br />Now I know why I wanted to hear it again, after 9/11, that crushing loss of innocence. I sat riveted, unable to do anything but listen to a life shaped by horrific events, wondering how many walls are building out there.<br />The poetry is heart-wrenching. The musicianship is as solid as anything in rock history. This album is as vital, as necessary, now as it was when I first heard it some 20 years ago. <br />&quot;The basis of great literature is that it speaks to the universal human condition,&quot; said my college Lit professor. <br />Listen to this. It speaks.

B0000203YT|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is really awesome. I just saw it on tv and absolutely loved it. There are some parts it could be better off without in my opinion, say, for example the &quot;it&quot; parts and how they seem to do it almost every moment. But, I suppose it adds to the atmosphere because, hey, some people think it's romantic. But I still liked it, especially when they acted out the part that 'Romeo and Juliet' is most known for {which is when they die or mistake each other for dead and then die}. It sort of made me feel like crying because the way they acted it really twanged your heart, I mean, you could really tell that they were in love, you know? Anyway, it's rated R, I guess, but I didn't know that. It looks like it should only be PG-13 or something. I enjoyed though, having never really seen Joseph Fiennes or Gwyneth Paltrow act before.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Many good pieces have come out of John Williams, this is no exception.
B00005O5N1|5.0|This is a wonderful gem of a movie. Based on excellent material in the first place - Bridget Jones' Diary (the book), which in turn is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice to some degree - its near perfect casting ensures its place as a romantic comedy classic. From the leads to the bit players, even the seemingly unbelievable, such as Bridget's mother, are entirely plausible. The main characters are rendered with somewhat more depth than is the case for most romantic comedies; for example, raffish though Hugh Grant's character is, he is not such a stereotypical rogue that he does not feel badly about hurting Bridget, even before realizing how much he cares for her. Colin Firth is a particular triumph and plays off Zellweger remarkably well - they're an unlikely enough combination to add just the right amount of interest and tension, yet not unlikely enough to make the outcome unbelievable. Mark Darcy's transformation is one of the more interesting elements of the movie. It's puzzling that Firth hasn't risen to leading role status more prominently, though this may be due more to his own choice of parts than anything else. Few actors are more artful at innuendo and the use of facial expression and body language than Firth; no jabbering on is required to understand his characters' struggles and true feelings. When playing smoldering (i.e., masculine) repressed roles he's at his finest. This is a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie with the happy ending so many long for during challenging times and the holiday season. With so many engaging and quirky characters, it pulls its happy result off in a way that makes it far more interesting than is usual for its genre.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I'm going to offer you a different perspective on Shrek: it's a great but amazingly overated movie.  The jokes are there (some of which, though, are too inside for many people unless you're one Jeffrey Katzenberg), the animation looks stunning, the voice overs have got to be some of the best ever for an animated movie, and it's got a central moral that touches on a subject that's been pushed aside in favor of drugs and violence, but, I believe, is equally as important.  Top honors especially to Mike Myers, whose irish ogre is absolutely perfect, as well as Eddie Murphy as the Donkey (great humor).  The problem with this movie was, although the moral was great, it seems to lack real heart.  Shrek seems to be deficient emotionally, though I can't quite pinpoint it exactly.  Maybe it's the ongoing parade of Disney-stabs that really gets tired after awhile (what six year old wants to watch an animated movie for hidden inside jokes?).  Or how the actual story is almost nada, giving up entirely to character development and well, stabs at Disney.  In the end, you're just not &quot;touched.&quot;  Clever ideas, good charcters, but Toy Story 1 and 2 are still better.
0553212443|5.0|Master storyteller and social critic, Charles Dickens, turns this social treatise on shortcomings of Victorian society into an entertaining and heartwarming Christmas ghost story which has charmed generations and become an icon of Christmas traditions.  Who, in the Western world has not heard, &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot;  And who can forget the now almost hackneyed line of Tiny Tim, &quot;God bless us, every one!&quot;  or his cheerfully poignant observation, that he did not mind the stares of strangers in church, for he might thus serve as a reminder of He who made the lame, walk and the blind, see.  Several movie versions: musical, animated, updated, or standard; as well as stage productions (I recall the Cleveland Playhouse and McCarter Theatre`s with fondess.) have brought the wonderful characterizations to the screen, as well as to life.  This story of the redemption of the  bitter and spiritually poor miser, and the book itself; however, is a timeless treasure whose richness, like Mrs Cratchit`s Christmas pudding, is one that no production can hope to fully capture.
0060920084|3.0|It seems that Bill Bryson is into the same things as me. In &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; he tackled my top hobby, hiking ridiculously long distances. In this book, he covers my other hobby, driving ridiculously long distances. Bryson's travelogue through small towns in 38 states is very observant and often hysterically funny. He's got good insights into the attitudes and friendliness (or lack thereof) of people in different regions of the country, and he writes thoughtfully on the destruction of America's small town charm by never-ending stretches of strip malls and fast food joints.<br />But even though Bryson is very thoughtful and funny, this book can really get on your nerves at times. This is because Bryson is an extremely arrogant and tactless man. He dislikes everybody with different backgrounds than him, and every place that is different from his home area. He calls people and even entire groups of people obscene names throughout the book. He's got a serious problem with fat jokes, obsessively ripping on overweight people in extremely cruel ways. (By the way, look at the picture of Bryson on the back cover. You can only see his head and shoulders, but he still doesn't look like the skinniest guy in the world). Bryson demeans people who choose to live in big cities, which he can't understand, and he demeans people who live in the countryside, which he also can't understand. He hates people who can't follow directions, but gets lost several times in the book himself. At the lowest points of the book, Bryson mentions how he wants to punch an old lady in the head for cutting in line, how he wants to whack a panhandler with a stick, and how he would like to slap a little boy in Vermont just for being ugly. And he's going to get in a lot of trouble if he doesn't tone down his descriptions of poor black people in the South.<br />Bryson also can't stand any of the places he visits. Through most of the book, he obnoxiously rolls into a location expecting simplistic stereotypes, then criticizes each place for not living up to his unrealistic expectations (a major problem in the section covering New England). He calls almost every small town backwards and boring without taking the time to explore, and passes judgment on large cities (Cleveland and Detroit) after driving right through without stopping. He even finds a way to hate the tremendous national parks out west, like Yosemite for having road signs that aren't descriptive enough, or Sequoia because he couldn't drive his car through a tree (and manages to insult the trees in the process). So I can sort of enjoy Bryson's books on a general level, but I sure was glad when he got back home and brought this book to a close.ic stereotypes, then criticizes each place for not living up to his unrealistic expectations (a major problem in the section covering New England).

B000003TA2|5.0|GOO is one of my favorite Sonic Youth Cds. Instantly catchy, irrestible melody, lyrics and heavy doses of coolness, sit back and let Kim and Thurston lead you away from the mundane with such fabulous songs as <BR>&quot;Dirty Boots&quot; reminiscent of songs off Dirty and Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star, this song showcases Moore's excellent vocals and clearly rocks<BR>&quot;TUNIC (song for karen)&quot; my personal favorite on this cd, this song is mythical in its wonderfullness and will send chills down your spine as Kim sings &quot;another greek salad, another iced tea, i feel like i'm disappearing, getting smaller every day, but when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way.&quot; this tribute to Karen Carpenter is impossible to describe but a magical music experience<BR>&quot;Kool Thing&quot; UNJUSTLY DISSED! This song is very cool, and when Kim starts chanting &quot;fear of a female planet&quot; and asks Chuck D<BR>&quot;are you going to liberate us girls from white male corporate oppression&quot; you'll groove.<BR>&quot;My Friend Goo&quot; though you may cringe at the first few listens, it will not be long before this song is blasting proudly from your rolled down car windows &quot;GOO GOO GOO&quot; irrestible. <BR>&quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; is an instrumental odyssey that you will revel in. <BR>I also really like the art and photos on this cd, all of the sonic youth cds seem to sport fabulous artwork, but the pictures of Thurston, Kim, and Lee are among my favorites, the height of cool.
0451169514|5.0|The first time I read this book i couldnt bear to go in a bathroom or near a storm gutter. I couldnt put this book down its just so entrancing.I especillaly like all the details that Stephen king puts in his books. When you read the part where there kids it feels like your a kid again he just describes it so well and you really get attached to the charectors.I recomend this to anyone who likes horror books or Stephen King books.
6302732875|5.0|I keep going back to this movie as an example of the best overall acting that I have ever experienced! This may have been Jack Lemmons finest hour. After watching the movie for at least 20 times it never fails to amaze me that each viewing provided before unoticed subliminal &quot;hints&quot; as to the main message of the story line. No main hero. No distractingly beautiful women. No physical violence. Who'd of thought it could keep you interested and entertained compared with the typical Hollywood fare? I watch this movie much as I would actors on a stage. The only problem is to realize that it's not real!
B00000JMQE|5.0|This film has to be my favourite film. It's so scary for a childrens film and the acting and the directing are fantastic for a disney film. Everything about this film is magical. If you haven't seen it, see it! It's worth your time. I know every single line in this film and I must have seen it over 500 times (seriously, I never get bored of it.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Whenever a comic to movie transfer occurs, an extraordinary amount of originality is required, or else the movie will simply (be aweful). Comic books are a very choosy medium that require the reader to fill in many of the mental gaps and assume a wide variety of odd comic book physics. These things, when translated into a live action movie, generally appear to be campy and unrealistic if not altered dramatically.<br />Thank god Marvel *finally* got that hint after a fleet of terrible comic book movies and gave the X-Men a new look and feel so that they work on the big screen. I'm not just talking about the costumes...I'm talking about the character attitudes, the character interactions, and, specifically, the filming of the action scenes.<br />Like the Tim Burton Batman films, this is comic book adaptation done well. The amazing performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and others outweigh the wooden and unengaging performances by some of the supporting cast (fortunately, they didn't give Storm many lines).<br />This will make a good movie franchise.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Buying this album was quite possibly the biggest mistake i have ever made, and ive made quite a few mistakes in my life.  This shouldn't even be considered music, I don't even know why im bothering to write a review on this, i shouldn't be spending any time even thinking about this album.  This is just pathetic, how can they live with themselves knowing that they make such horrendous &quot;music&quot;?
B00004Z459|5.0|At first glance, Linkin Park may look like your average rock-rap band.  However, they aren't.  The whole album is full of twists and experimentation, and they put a new meaning to the genre.  The songs are melodic, the rapping is actually good (especially A Place For My Head) and the lyrics are interesting, thoughtful and creative.  One of the best parts of the band is, however, DJ Joseph Hahn.  The turntable elements in most of the songs are fantastic and groundbreaking, and his solo track, the eclectic Cure For The Itch, is one of my favorite songs on the disc.  However, the best song on the CD is In The End.  It's got a haunting piano solo that weaves it's way through some amazing rap hooks before finally going into the breathtaking surge of a chorus.  Other standouts include the A Place For My Head and Crawling.  The latter blends synth pop verses with an onslaught of metal for the chorus, while A Place For My Head is introduced by a fast paced acoustic guitar solo and the launches into some of the best rapping I've heard (at least from a rock band).  If you're tired of the run of the mill rock acts out today, Linkin Park brings a new spark of creativity, experimentalism and I hate to say it, but fun to the genre.  Hybrid Theory is a must have.
B00005KB9W|5.0|This is a great album.  All 7 songs are awesome and every Bob Marley fan should have a copy.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I don't usually read Spin Magazine, but I found a copy in the laundromat and gave it a gander as my clothes were drying. There was a short piece about \\"The future of rock and roll,\\" as embodied in this band from New York. I was intrigued, since the writer described them as something orginal and great.... But I should have known better (instead, I bought the CD). This music is completely recycled and devoid of anything creative, daring, original or even pleasurable to listen to. After just a day of listening to it, disgusted with my purchase, my girlfriend suggested I give it a few more listens. Problem was, I had a headache all next day because these extremely annoying Strokes songs kept rattling around in my head (like a bad commercial jingle). <br />If this is the future of rock and roll then God help us, we're in for a truly boring and superficial tomorrow.

B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"All you people look at me like I'm a little girl...did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world.\\" Britney Spears sings on &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; off her third album self-titled &quot;Britney&quot; released November 6th. <BR>     This album is a reflection inside the mind of the pop queen herself because Britney co-wrote 5 of the 12 tracks. Not only does this CD show Britney's musical evolution into a new sound- making it funkier and edgier, but her vocals on this CD are also absolutely amazing. <BR>The best tracks are \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"Let me Be,\\" \\"Lonely\\" and \\"What its Like to Be Me.\\"<BR>        Britney's innovative CD by far surpasses her two previous albums. She recorded 23 tracks for &quot;Britney&quot; before choosing the best 12. The CD itself is approximately 39 minutes long and when inserted into the computer one may see the outtakes from Britney's new movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; to the tune of her second track on the album, &quot;Overprotected.&quot; Also included in the CD is a mini poster autographed by Britney, which is stapled inside the booklet. In the booklet, the lyrics are printed for &quot;I'm Not a Girl.&quot;<BR> Overall, &quot;Britney&quot; will probably be one of the greatest releases of the year, especially for a female artist. Spears proves she will always be queen of the pop world with this album. She is by far one of the most talented in the industry and is clearly taking pop music to the next level by experimenting with different sounds and styles.<br />Review of the First Five Tracks on Britney:<br />   &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; is not Britney's best on the album, but was a good first single because it showed off Britney's new style. It is a song about a love for dancing and music and was produced by the Neptunes. Britney is no longer a little girl so people are just going to have to grow with her as she herself grew as an artist on this track and on the rest of the album.<BR>    The second song on the album is&quot;Overprotected.&quot; It too has a great beat to it and might possibly be the third single off the CD. Rami and Max Martin wrote it. Martin also wrote Britney's biggest hit to date Baby One More Time... In Overprotected, Britney sings about herself being sheltered from the world and how she just wants to try things out for herself and not be told what to do. &quot;I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am - And I don't wanna be so damn protected!&quot; <BR>    The third track on the album is &quot;Lonely&quot; which is one that Britney co-wrote. Its a good song and sounds as if it was inspired by hip-hop and R&amp;B. Britney sings about not giving in and letting some guy back into her life who plays games because she is better off alone. \\"Think of all the times that I took you back...Ain't no way I'll be lonely...I don't wanna let you back in.\\" <BR>     &quot;I'm Not a Girl&quot; will be Britney's second single off the album and Dido co-wrote it. It provides for easy listening and is suppose to be the big hit ballad that goes with her movie. The song shows off Britney's voice. Britney even said in interviews that this song is the most personal for her because it is where she is at in this point of her life. \\"I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe in...I'm just trying to find the woman in me.\\" However, Britney contradicts herself with I'm Not a Girl because she is telling us she's not a girl, but then sings \\"...this girl will always find her way.\\" Therefore, referring to herself as a girl, which she also does on several other tracks throughout the album (including ones she wrote.) <BR>   The next song is &quot;Boys&quot; which displays Britney's nastier side. The Neptunes also produced this track. The song sounds like something Janet Jackson would sing. On the track, Britney sings about finding a guy at a club and wanting to leave with him and how sometimes all a girl just needs is a guy. \\"You're a sexy guy...I'm a nice girl...Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world.&quot; Britney then ends the song by saying, \\"Boys ...can't live with em' ...can't live without em'.\\"
B00003CXZ4|5.0|... but this film challenged my perception of, and thus my reliance on, memory -- so I can't be absolutely sure.<br />Even the DVD menu is constructed in a non-linear fashion. This is a very comprehensively produced piece of home entertainment.<br />This is one I will watch again and again.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon saves this movie from mediocrity. This is, in fact, a bland, hackneyed, completely predictable, badly scripted, and unoriginal flick that Reese Witherspoon single-handedly elevates to utterly delightful light entertainment.<br />I have been a Reese Witherspoon fan for a long time, though not always knowingly. About ten years ago I saw on cable a delightful movie about a young girl learning about love called THE MAN IN THE MOON. The young (14 years old) actress in the main role just sparkled, and although I didn't remember her name, I remembered the movie. Last summer, I was looking through my video store, saw the cover for the movie, and thought I would double check the name of the actress, to see if she had gone on to any sort of success. I was delighted and shocked to see that the movie had starred Reese Witherspoon.<br />As much as I have enjoyed her in PLEASANTVILLE and ELECTION, I absolutely didn't expect that she would be able to carry a film to the degree that she did this one. She did more than carry the film: she made a bad film good. And that is a rare achievement indeed. I really do think that Reese Witherspoon's best films are ahead of her. She has talent, charm, intelligence, and versatility.<br />So, I definitely recommend this film, but only for one reason: Reese Witherspoon. Besides her, there are just no reasons to see this film.
B00005LC6Z|4.0|The nightmare of Halloween continues in this chilling sequel. The knife-wielding psychotic left for dead in the original film returns with a thirst for vengeance. <br />This is a great sequel to HALLOWEEN. It has the original characters, unlike some films, and the story doesn't change, making the film a big amount of confusion. It all continues from where it started. After this sequel to HALLOWEEN, it starts to get bad though. That's why I would stick with the first two films. They're both pretty much scary, I'll tell you that. <br />HALLOWEEN II is always good to watch right after the first film, if you're up all night watching horror movies. It's a direct continuation. That's another thing that's great about HALLOWEEN II. It was made three years after HALLOWEEN's original release, and the producers managed to keep the right characterizations for the sequel. Michael Myers walks the same and kills in the same manner as he did in the first one. <br />If you feel like renting HALLOWEEN II, then make sure you rent it on the same night as the first HALLOWEEN. It will make a lot  more sense. <br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
0316776963|4.0|This is a review of the CD audio book version of ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. I want to say from the start that if you have the choice of reading the printed book or listening to a recording of it, I would strongly recommend the audio book version. I know hundreds of thousands of people have listened to books on tape or CD, but this was a first for me. And I can't imagine a better book to start off with. While I enjoy reading Sedaris on page, he is the perfect reader of his own stories. I wouldn't want to listen to him read Jane Austen or Tolstoy, but I also wouldn't want to hear anyone else read these stories.<br />Sound wise, the recordings are overall good. Several of the recordings are of live performances in front of crowds, and in many ways, these are the more enjoyable. I found myself getting more involved in the stories as the crowds did. However, in reading live, Sedaris sometimes sounds a bit strained and thin in his voice. Several of the stories were recorded in studios, and while his voice is much lower and less strained, the performances don't have quite the same degree of vitality as the live performances. I also found the music that accompanied some of the studio recordings to be a bit distracting.<br />As far as the stories themselves go, while a few of the stories come from the periods of his life that his readers have come to know from previous books, most of them come from adulthood, and even from his period of success as an author. Probably half of the stories come from the time he has spent living in France, apparently struggling against the limits of his own French (the title comes from a literal English translation of a statement he makes in a French class about his goals with that language). Whether one prefers this book to NAKED hangs upon nothing but one's own personality. I prefer NAKED, but prefer hearing Sedaris reading his work to reading it myself. I think the main thing is that the work is consistently good through all the books.<br />So, whether you read this yourself or listen to David read it to you, I heartily recommend this book.whether you read this yourself or listen to David read it to you, I heartily recommend this book.
B0000039LE|4.0|Young Jamie Lee Curtis is Laurie Strode in this powerfully made horror film that relates to PSYCHO. Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Sam Loomis - who's job it is to save the night from the one and only Michael Myers - a psychopath who recently broke out of an Illinois mental hospital.<br />First off, I would just like to tell you that HALLOWEEN is one of the finest horror movies ever made. It's my favourite film,... Michael Myers of HALLOWEEN still stands as one of the most original serial killers today in horror film history. And HALLOWEEN is considered as one of the best horror films around the world.<br />This movie is a great one to play on the night of halloween. Especially if you're young, in the dark, and alone. I can remember back in the days when HALLOWEEN was always on television on halloween night. Now days I can only find it on one of those special cable boxes. That kind of bothers me, but having those memories are great. John Carpenter sure has an amazing way of making films....<br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Off the top of my head, I can think of no other production in science fiction film that has engendered so much controversy over so long a period of time than &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.<br />Most Trek fans either grudgingly accept the film's presence, or outright despise it with such rancor that its a wonder the film is still in circulation in any form, let alone a new DVD.<br />Few fans can look past the expansive, sprawling, epic-like quality of the film, so unlike the original series in tone, pace, and styling. The metaphysical attributes of ST:TMP conjure up images of the rival series &quot;Space:1999&quot;, which to this day many Trek fans still love to hate.<br />Personally, I've always leaned more towards &quot;2001&quot; style sci-fi than the mindless action-fests that litter the genre today, so even as a Trek fan, I can more easily accept ST:TMP than perhaps some of my fellow Trekkers can. I'd be lying if I said ST:TMP was my favorite Trek, or even an understandable one. But I've always kind of liked it, flaws and all. The film is firmly rooted in the mid-70's, and even the name &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; brings to mind a grand, sprawling epic like &quot;2001&quot;.<br />The &quot;2001&quot;-effect is in full force in ST:TMP, especially in the opening sequence when Kirk is shuttling over from the space dock, and we first get to see the new Enterprise. The &quot;2001&quot; spacecraft ballet sequences were obviously an inspiration for this part of ST:TMP.<br />The attitudes about sex, especially where the Deltan, Ilia, is concerned, are also a bit dated. Most of her lines about other races being &quot;sexually inferior species,&quot; etc., have been cut in the new release.<br />The DVD, however, is not really all that special. While most of the newly added effects scenes are seamless, there are one or two points where the CGI Enterprise looks like a graphic from a videogame.<br />Best fix would have to be the moment when Enterprise leaves the drydock. The black armature rig that was attached to the secondary hull always bugged me in that sequence (used again in STII:TWOK), at it was seamlessly removed in this new version. Worst is the land bridge forming when the crew exits the ship to go see V'ger (the CGI Enterprise is obviously fake here, but still better than the lousy matte paintings used in 1979). We also get to see at long last what the V'ger ship really looks like.<br />The extras are a mixed bag. There are three documentaries that reveal little or nothing new, and in true Paramount fashion, are part infomercial for Trek merchandise. We only get to see snippets of the screen tests of Xon and Phase II, when we could have seen them in full. At least the trims and cut scenes from both the 1979 theatrical version and the 1983 TV version are present on Disc 2.<br />Best surprise? The original TV spots, being narrated by none other than Mr. Orson Welles! And they're sooooo seventies-looking, too!<br />As for the recut by Robert Wise, most of it makes sense. The film is tighter than ever, and plays better. Still, there were moments that shouldn't have been cut, or ones I just plain miss.<br />Case in point, when V'ger attacks the Enterprise. Sulu says, &quot;The new screens held!&quot; This always made sense to me, since we had a new starship with new tech, so new-style defectors were a natural. But this crucial bit was snipped in the recut, so now it doesn't make sense when the Klingons and the Epsilon Array are wiped out, but not the Enterprise.<br />Sulu fares the worst in other missing scenes, mostly to remove some of the moments with of Ilia. The nervous, fumbling Sulu showing Ilia the control system is gone, as is the moment when Kirk takes Decker off the bridge and Sulu asks a distracted Ilia to confirm a control setting. Sulu fans are bound to be a bit unhappy at the cuts.<br />Maybe the scenes make more sense to a Trek fan than to a great, (but non-Trek), director like the legendary Wise. Ormaybe it's just nostalgia on my part, having heard the dialogue so often over the years that I expect Sulu to say &quot;The new screens held,&quot; or for Kirk to repeat his command, &quot;Viewer off!&quot;<br />In the end, although I like the overall fix and updated effects, I find myself longing a bit for the 1983 version, even though I had to fast-forward through the endless fly-over of V'ger. In my opinion, the recut is both a great achievement that was a long time in coming, and its also a bit of a disappointment.<br />When all is said and done, the new recut is bound to keep alive the one thing about ST:TMP that has always been consistant... controversy.r maybe it's just nostalgia on my part, having heard the dialogue so often over the years that I expect Sulu to say &quot;The new screens held,&quot; or for Kirk to repeat his command, &quot;Viewer off!&quot;<br />In the end, although I like the overall fix and updated effects, I find myself longing a bit for the 1983 version, even though I had to fast-forward through the endless fly-over of V'ger.

Which makes this animated band not strickened to one certain type of music, but to everyones liking. Which keeps every song fresh and and never boring. Listen to the album all the way through. Some songs may grow on you, some songs will strike right away, and some songs, you may even find humerous. A very entertaining album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|shrek is a definitely best movie about love i ever see. in the movie shrek falls in love with the princess, when it happened i was crying like a baby, because i knew already that the princess would never fell in love with ogre. she asked him to remove his helmet so she could kiss him, it was the most intence moment in the movie for me, i was screaming don't do it shrek don't do it man, tears was coming down like crazy i even stopped picking my nose. this movie could be compare to such classics as the umbrellas of cherbourg or platoon. but don't be fooled even for a second shrek is a very smart ogre when it comes to love games that is why he lives with donkey...  i was crying throughout all movie, this movie let you get in touch with something inside you, i don't know what is it, but i know for sure it doesn't smell good. when princess revealed her secret to the donkey about her being f----ng ugly i couldn't take it anymore and i had to go to that sacred place called bathroom. i was crying so loud about shrek and princess not being able to stay together that almost forgat to pull my pants down. finally when i finished &quot;crying&quot; i was watching shrek again. shrek kissed princess and she turned into ugly ogre, i knew now shrek stands a chance. burst of laughter came out of my mouth and i even     f----d. yes shrek and princess will stay together. they will wake up to each other every day of their life. this movie teaches not only that ugly people should stay together but also it teaches us that if girl lives with seven men like a princess and seven dwarfs it doesn't mean she engaged in the oldest profession ever. love this movie. one thumb up...if you know what i mean.
B00004Z459|5.0|this album is in perfect balance. Hard and soft are perfectly mixed here, while keeping the same atmosphere, impossible to get boring. All the songs are wonderful.
B00005LC3Y|1.0|I held off buying the 'normal' edition of FMJ for the very reason that I wanted a widescreen version. The Amazon specifications for the Limited Edition clearly state:<br />&quot;Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Box set&quot;<br />After, pre-ordering, and waiting months and months, I finally received my Limited Edition yesterday. And guess what?<br />It's still NOT WIDESCREEN!<br />I'm highly disappointed that I was mislead on the feature set. If you want a widescreen version of FMJ, don't buy the Limited Edition, despite what the specifications say.

B000002LND|5.0|Reading the other customer reviews of this CD, I was amazed by the number of remixes/edited songs mentioned. Perhaps my past ignorance of how Madonna songs sound made me imprevious to these versions. I think it's a magnificent CD that I can listen to over and over again. And seeing as how I haven't heard the original versions (supposedly) of said remixed songs, I'll be content with these versions which I am now familiar with.<BR>Great collection, well worth your money simply for the pop culture lesson taught.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I am a die hard fan of Lenny Kravitz, he is truly the greatest Rock Artists EVER!  If you're<BR>never heard Lenny, (same on you if you haven?t) you MUST get this CD!  They are for sure his<BR>Greatest Hits!<br />My all time favorite is American Woman, as is with allot of fans.  All are worth listening to all the<BR>time!  Lenny gives you a good rock song, but not too harsh, and he leaves you feeling good!  <br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE!
B00003CY0V|2.0|This movie was AWESOME....LY TERRIBLE!!!  Great opening, mild ending, overall 10-15 minutes of good footage.  The rest is ...  Some megalomaniacs who love Rambo and other ... fast movies might enjoy this one.  Anyone with half a brain will be bored out of your mind for the interlude between the beginning and the ending.  Other than a rather random 'boobing' the movie is quite dull; I'd recommend renting Memento, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Hannibal, even Happy Gilmore, don't touch this one with a 50 foot clown pole.
0767834976|5.0|Whatever the critics say, I gave this movie five stars, because it is one of the best Scwharzenegger films ever.<BR>I've watched it for more than 15 times and still discover nice details, funny lines and action !<BR>To Be Or Not To Be ... Not To Be (-Schwarzenegger)
B000002JEV|5.0|when i first popped the first cd in my cd player i was really surprised. i didn't expect much from it for some reason, but whatever reason that was, it was wrong. this album revitalized my enduring enthusiasm for led zeppelin, the band that could play the same song several different ways.<BR>speaking of playing the same song different ways, bbc sessions has 3 versions of communication breakdown, 2 versions of you shook me and i can't quit you baby, 2 versions of dazed and confused and whole lotta love, i think i covered everything. :O<BR>if you're a new zepp fan, then you'll love the rhythm and ferocity at 80% of their tunes on here - it harkens back to their early days of their first 4 albums. <BR>it also contains the phenomenal, The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair and Travelling Riverside Blues! Truely missed classics, not on any lone album (i do think they are in one of the box sets). <BR>trust me, if you're looking for a great rock album from a band that you thought you heard it all from, then pick up this album -its a welcome breath of fresh air.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Normally I stay close to the music I know and love: The Doors, Hendrix, Joplin, Led Zeppelin.  So much music on the modern scene is trite, hypocritical, and shallow.  But it was this CD that really lead me to eat my share of crow because from the first moment I heard &quot;Barely Legal&quot; I was a fan for life.  The music itself doesn't sound tired like others do, it sounds new and fresh.  The guitar work is mind-blowing.  The lyrics are phenomenal, the singer's voice a throwback to when music was self-expression not an industry.  And in the end it all comes down to this... I heart The Strokes.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This my friends is a treasure.  Even though I have not heard one Rush album I dislike, A Farewell to Kings is the album that establishes the band's signature sound.  It shows the band moving ever so slightly away from the realm of hard rock and more into the keyboard friendly 80s.  However, AFtK is not what you would call a &quot;wimp out&quot; album.  If anything the riffs are just as heavy as ever and the song structures are more innovative.  AFtK contains these six brilliant songs:<br />1.  A Farewell to Kings - It stars out with a beautiful classical acoustic guitar intro before kicking into gear.  The lyrics are about how our descendents will view us.  By the way things look in the song, not too good.<br />2.  Xanadu - An eleven minute epic about someone who seeks eternal life and finds it.  The only problem is that the person cannot leave Xanadu without losing his immortality.  Has nice bells and oriental keyboard effects.<br />3.  Closer to the Heart - Probably the most famous song because of repetitive FM radio airplay.  But still a great song with a message about everyone's role in society.<br />4.  Cinderella Man - An optimistic and funky song that really shows how well the band plays.  I'm surprised this song didn't get more airplay.<br />5.  Madrigal - Maybe the least popular song.  And I think the reason most people don't like it is because it doesn't rock out.  It is a love ballad penned by Peart with medieval imagery, the way all songs should be.<br />6.  Cygnus X1 - This clocks in at ten and a half minutes and is the first part of the Cygnus story.  The second part is on the next album HEMISPHERS.  Part I deals with a space traveller whose ship is sucked into a black hole.  Perhaps the most complex song the band has ever accomplished.<br />Only one more thing to say before I submit my review.  If you have any intentions on buying this album, you should also buy HEMISPHERES as well.  The Cygnus story is told in two separate parts on both albums and it can't be called complete if you only own one.it can't be called complete if you only own one.
B000000993|5.0|Definitely one of the best CDs out there, probably Tool's best CD.  Aenima and Lateralus come VERY close though.  This is easily the best CD I have.  The booklet art is a little strange, but I love each and every song, from Intolerance to Disgustipated.  These are my ratings for each song(out of 10 except for my favorites): <BR>Intolerance(10.0), Prison Sex(10.0), Sober(10.5)-one of my 3 faves on this CD, Bottom(10.0), Crawl Away(10.0), Swamp Song(10.0), Undertow(11.5)-My personal favorite, 4 Degress(10.0), Flood(10.0), Disgustipated(11.0) well i guess thats it.  Enjoy this CD as well as Tool's others, all of which I recommend to anyone.
B000002A3T|4.0|Even with the full-fledged return of keyboardist, Richard Wright, Pink Floyd is not truly Pink Floyd without their driving force, former lyricist, Roger Waters who resentfully left the band in 1985. That aside, 1994's the Division Bell is quite a pleasing album. Although Waters will always be the quintessential Pink Floyd lyricist, guitarist David Gilmour, with help from his girlfriend and former journalist, Polly Samson, is not bad at all. (\\"Not life devalues day by day/As friends and neighbors turn away/And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone/Now frontiers shift like desert sands/While nations wash their bloodied hands/Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey \\"). Wright's return puts the band back into shape musically. The silky, cloudy sound of his keyboard and synthesizer interacts beautifully with Gilmour's punchy guitar on the instrumentals, \\"Cluster One\\" and the Grammy-winning \\"Marooned\\" as well as the considerable wordless portion of songs such as \\"High Hopes\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life,\\" which features Gilmour's most riveting guitar solo since his masterpiece on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" from 1979's The Wall. In general, a warm, fluid sound, reminiscent of 1975's Wish You Were Here, echoes through the Division Bell. Meanwhile, the candid, reflective sentiments of songs like \\"Lost for Words\\" and \\"Poles Apart\\" rebel against the long-held idea that Floyd are soulless stadium rockers. Despite the fact that years of animosity drove away a vital component of Pink Floyd long ago, the band's current line-up managed to record a very welcoming, enjoyable album with the Division Bell.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Let's face it...whittling 15 or some albums to a 2 disc set is a daunting task, especally with the material that Pink Floyd has generated over the years. Things will be left off. Having said that, it'll be nearly impossible to make everyone happy with &quot;Echoes&quot;. But it still serves well as a good cross section of their career and as a primer for those who may somehow still not know who Pink Floyd is.<br />Fortunately, this compilation was not slapped together hap-hazardly by the record company. The collection as a whole is beautifully mastered under the watchful eye of James Guthrie &amp; the Floyd themselves. All tracks from the original masters were processed with custom-built equipment. Thus, the sound is equisite. The seques and flow of tracks normally associated with Floyd albums is still intact, and good edits of the songs all around. The edit of &quot;Echoes&quot; is done well (it still clocks in at over 17 minutes), and a new mix of &quot;Shine On...&quot; is effective. The tolling bell at the end of &quot;High Hopes&quot; changes to a bicycle bell to introduce &quot;Bike&quot;. All in all a fine sonic mix.<br />Now to the selection of songs. Naturally a large selection of tracks from &quot;Dark Side...&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; (but suprisingly no &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;). But happily there is a nice selection of Syd Barret era tunes, although the inclusion of &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; over some other &quot;Piper...&quot; songs is questionable. Plus, at last, the first CD release of &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; from the &quot;Wall&quot; soundtrack makes it worth the price of admission alone for Floyd enthusists. There's a good smathering of post-Waters Floyd for good measure, although the inclusion of &quot;Marooned&quot; from &quot;Divison Bell&quot; seems pointless. But nothing from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; (&quot;If&quot;), no &quot;Free Four&quot;, and the decision to include &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; as the onlysong from &quot;The Final Cut&quot; to be represented is apalling given the far superior tracks they could have chosen.<br />Anything short of a fully annotated career retrospective box set (&quot;Shine On&quot; doesn't count, dispite it's great packaging) won't be able to fully represent Pink Floyd's vast welth of great material. But &quot;Echoes&quot; still works as a great collection of the works of one of the most sucessful and innovative bands in rock history. Still the best sonic head trip around.
B000002AZZ|4.0|\\"You were Marlon Brando, I was Steve McQueen/You were K.Y. Jelly, I was Vaseline/You were the father of modern medicine, I was Mr. Clean/You where the (...) and the beast of Babylon, I was Rin Tin Tin,\\" Leonard Cohen sings on \\"Is This What You Wanted,\\" a song that displays the much-needed dose of humor added to his lyrical exercises in regret and self-depreciation on his fourth album, 1974's New Skin for the Old Ceremony. New Skin's more varied instrumentation, looser vocal approach and added wit make it Cohen's best album yet. Although he was always a finely skilled and richly tender poet, one could only endure so much of Cohen's earlier albums as spirit-stomping and disheartened as they were. Although the main subject matter of New Skin is still grief, Cohen confronts life's tragedies with a different approach. He abandons the mournful wailing of songs like \\"Bird on a Wire\\" or \\"Stories of the Street\\" and the somber expressions of \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" or \\"The Stranger Song\\" and dons a type of charisma, classified somewhere between crooner and beatnik, and stands in a mock-confrontational pose, challenging both the complicated nature of society (\\"A Singer Must Die,\\" \\"Field Commander Cohen,\\" \\"There is a War\\") and distressing predicaments with another cast of abusive, self-destructive, yet intoxicating women (\\"I Tried to Leave You,\\" \\"Chelsea Hotel #2,\\" \\"Leaving Green Sleeves\\") with a fistful of clever irony and satire. Cohen's tongue being placed in his cheek does not, however, equal the complete loss of the intimate, folk rock beauty of his music. \\"Who by the Fire\\" is as striking, moving and poignant any song the man has written and \\"Take This Longing\\" is one of his most ardent, elegantly expressed requests. Generally, the album keeps the solemn and dignified air of Cohen's previous works. Its added whimsical flair only makes his music more entertaining and invigorating.

B000002C1W|2.0|After the departure of Syd Barrett in 1968, Pink Floyd's two driving forces were lyricist/bass-player/conceptualizer, Roger Waters and guitarist/composer, David Gilmour. So it was inevitable that the first \\"Pink Floyd\\" album without Waters, 1987's A Momentary Lapse in Reason, was going to essentially be Gilmour's third solo effort. The only question was how badly Gilmour, obviously only wishing to keep the attention and revenue drummed up from the Pink Floyd logo, would tarnish band's name. If only he had kept the sober, wintery feel of his two previous solo works then perhaps Momentary Lapse could have been a somewhat decent album. But no. Like so many of his aging peers, Gilmour, along with drummer Nick Mason, producer Bob Ezrin and a small army of session musicians, had to pander to in the super slick, mindlessly sanguine, yuppie style of that utter waste of a decade, 1980s. \\"On the Turning Away\\" and \\"The Dogs of War\\" call up that horrid decade's flaky, unconvincing social consciousness. \\"One Slip\\" is a boring, overintellectualized ballad like those of Tears for Fears. \\"Signs of Life\\" and \\"Terminal Frost\\" replace the warm, lush surrealism of Floyd's earlier sound with drippy new age music. The ultrasynthetic sound, with its obligatory guitar solos and deep drum indents, brings guilty pleasure at best and nostalgia for a decade hence at worst. The album would be a total waist if not for \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"Sorrow.\\" On these fantastic tracks, Gilmour's guitar throws around some serious muscle and nicely leads the thickly layered sound into a sense of fanciful electric, splendor. Without these two, however, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is just another throwaway album from one more band coasting on reputation and catering to a new unexciting, adult contemporary audience.
B000002HMH|5.0|If a sell-out is a band that just put their well respected name on to poor quality material then metallica are quite the opposite - this is a high quality cd that allows metallica to display their true amazing musical talent - it shows that metallica can play heavy, emotional, bluesy, fast, slow and very, very powerful rock music. Metallica burst out onto the world scene as one of the most original bands creating thrash, classy metal in the 80's and they made 4 great album doing this so why carry on doing the same stuff until they fade away. luckily they did not, metallica are not sellouts. their music has matured and they have produced a just as heavy cd as before yet just slower. The 3 albums - black, load and reload promoted metallica from being a great heavy metal band to a legendary hard rock band. On load hammet is allowed to show his amazing technique and hetfield is allowed to show his deep, moody, powerful yet melodic voice (this album helps put hammet up there with the best guitarists of all time - including clapton,  young, hendrix, jeff beck etc.). I love the way how hetfield's voice and hammet's guitar are constantly competing for the front seat throughout this album. Hetfield and Ulrich have allowed Newsted and Hammet to play how they like on this album. The best 2 songs are the emotional bleedin me and outlaw torn (both of which would rate in my top 5 rock songs alongside fade to black, stairway to heaven and back in black). The solo on bleedin me is simply amazing, hammet's guitar breaks out from hetfield's characteristic roar and you just want to keep rewinding and play these few minutes over and over again. And when you think the outlaw torn has finished and you just want to hear more, you do! a 2 minute solo builds up to finish the aibum. Other highlights are ronnie, king nothing and thorn within. However even though i've only mentioned 5 songs, there is definetly no filler here - each song is different and is a  classic.<BR>There are great lyrics, beautiful, powerful solos that vary enormously in style, and classic traditional heavy riffs. All those who say this is a bad album only say so because it is not thrash metal, it is not a bad album but an absolute classic with not 1 but 2 legendary songs. If you like quality hard rock then you won't be dissapointed with this album. However if you are only a heavy metaller then this may not appeal to you.
0800141660|5.0|Originally I thought it would be a bored movie, but it's much better than what I expected ! It's an old movie...wow... been 5 yrs from now.but I really suggest u to see this film, it's great and give you a fabulous inspiration!
B000007OY0|5.0|This is one of the best films EVER, if not THE best.  Truly an inspirational work of art.  I just cannot believe its poor performance at the box office nor at the Oscars in '94.  I also cannot believe some of the comments uttered by critics against the movie, and would like make clear my views on the film.  First of all, how could you say that the movie is only an unoriginal prison film with an innocent victim?  The truth is, it is much more than just that.  It is about courage, determination, hope, and making the best of what one has, no matter how little that is.  It reminds us that good things happen to good people, to people who put their trust in the Lord.  Also, don't complain about it having too much violence/cursing.  As Red Redding says, prison is no fairytale world.  Is there any penitentiary in the world with no violence, where all inmates are perfect, and can read and write English elegantly?  There are just some words that they need to use to get the message across to others and us as an audience.  Next, why would you say that Tim Robbins is monotonous, when the character he plays (Andy Dufresne) is exactly that?  Andy is quiet-spoken, intelligent, kind at heart, and very touching.  In my opinion, all the acting was perfect to a tee, including Robbins'.  Finally, what about the music being too grim and bleak for us to bear?  That is exactly the feeling Thomas Newman wished to portray, and it fits the film perfectly.  The music is subtle, quiet and solemn, but also contains magnificent, heroic sections which are quite beautiful contrasts.  It should not be listened to alone, but rather only with the movie.  That is when the sound is most gripping.<br />    As you all know, there are two things which you can do with your life - get busy living, or get busy dying.  Well similarly, there are two things which you can do with this movie - watch it, grasp its true meaning, and admire it, or just watch it mindlessly without understanding its significance to ourlives.  I give it six out of five stars.  A movie that will really hit home and can be appreciated by anybody - anyone with a heart and a brain, that is.
B000005RR0|4.0|The other reviewers have already mentioned that there are some<BR>obvious ommissions and some hard-to-explain selections, but the<BR>biggest problem with this CD is that the sound quality on some of <BR>the tracks is much worse that it should be. For a CD that claims<BR>20-bit mastering, the result is a bit below expectations.<br />The Stones really need to come out with a multi-CD set that picks<BR>up where &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; left off...
B00003CY0V|5.0|this movie was cool like when the the explosion went all slow mo and stuff...um...yeah anyway the characters were cool and the story line was awsome and better yet neither the bad guy or good guy lost, the special effects were really good and explosions were well done, john travolta is just awsome in this and so is whats his ummmmmm???? face, anywho this is a cool movie andyou should buy it or at the bare minimum rent it and then buy it!!!!!!
B000003S09|5.0|My step-father was a musician and even though his tastes were a little suspect he did hit the nail on the head more times than not. He introduced me to bands like jethro tull, King Crimson, Yes, Queen, gentle giant, ELO and early genesis and he has been a key influence on my purist attitude towards music in general. When we were subjected to awful top 40 in the mid to late 80s my step-father held the  keys to which you could escape and still appreciate the splendor of bands via his cd collection. I borrowed a few of  his silver darlings and became enchanted by Stand up-Jethro Tull, Fragile-Yes, A day at the opera-Queen and Discovery by ELO.  THan there was King Crimson. Ahhh...it was like being transported to a new world where sounds ruled the planet. I heard ITCOTCK on vinyl and felt an immediate shock. 21 Century Schzoid man was King Crimson foretelling the future of what was to come. That song is the father of such hits as Head like a hole-NIN, Smells like teen spirit-nirvana. You get the point. I have been hearing some gripes of the longevity of some of the tracks but keep in mind that its all necessary to complete KC artistic vision. Moonchild doesnt iritate like it does most people to me its all part of the plan. When your  experienced enough to be able to get under the skin of music than you will be able to tell what is BS and what the artist is trying to feel and communicate. My whole life has been music and I have partaked in just about all areas you can with it except the fame part. Anyway ITCOTCK is essential. Any musician worth his hours spent honing his craft will tell you proper. The album is unbridled brilliance, ahead of its time its scary and it grips music by the throat and demands its attention. A rare thing indeed but magical when it happens.
0553269631|5.0|I am always amazed how books, such as The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, improve with age. I first read it in high school and was bored. Now I have reread this book as an adult. It touches my heart and soul.<br />The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is so well titled. It encompasses lonely souls who cluster around John Singer, a deaf mute. Singer losses his deaf mute roommate and companion, Antonapolous, when he is committed to an asylum. He is now alone… isolated. This change operates as a catalyst for the rest of the story.<br />Published in 1940 before the creation of political correctness, its characters explore fascism, communism, racism, and poverty. They are misfits, isolated even when together in the same room. After his friend is committed to the asylum, John Singer takes a room with the Kelly family. The various characters that populate the novel visit John Singer in his room. They talk to John Singer, who can understand them through lip reading. Each character finds in John Singer what he/she needs to find… a sympathetic heart. But none of the characters understands or knows John Singer. He has no one to talk to; no one who to understand him; no one to help fend off his own loneliness. For John Singer, there is no sympathetic heart. <br />For vacation, he visits Antonapolous is the asylum, where his insane friend cannot care about him. Singer responds to Antonapolous in the same way as the visitors to his room respond to him. He talks to him using sign language, but Antonapolous does not talk to him. He finds in this friend his sympathetic heart. This relationship parallels to his own position with the characters who visit his room.  The novel reaches its climax when Antonapolous dies, and Singer can no longer find a reason for living.<br />This is a beautifully written book that takes the reader into the South in the 1930’s with a truth that is hard to find in most contemporary novels. I highly recommend The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.

I can understand the safety issues, and wouldn't recommend doing anything beyond your capacity; but I have to say, this video really does the trick.  It's challenging and it's not time consuming.  Breaks up the monotony too.  I really feel the burn the next day!  It's a little funny too, watching her and her perfection!  Was it made for me or men??  Who cares, it works.  I will never throw this one out.  Hope the next one is just as challenging!
B00005ABX0|4.0|I remember listening to this album when I was fifteen years old and it intrigued me because it wasn't a sunny California type album, but there were moments I really loved. It was more of a winters day piece with songs like 'Wind Chimes' and 'Whistle In' confusing me but staying with me for a long time. Twenty years later I bought the CD and I realise what a brilliant, if uneven, bit of work this is. The harmonies are first rate and some of the ideas are 'out there' but demands patience. If only the unreleased 'Smile' was a reality, the course of rock history could have changed in 1967. The alternate takes of 'Good Vibrations' see the mad genius Brian Wilson in full flight. See what you think!

B00000J7SS|1.0|It infuriates me that apparently nobody seems to notice...or nobody cares...but if you've ever heard the original version of this album on vinyl, or on the original CD release, you know that the echo on \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\" was originally one of the highpoints of the entire album.  I mean, it was even mentioned in the liner notes.  In this remixed version, however, the echo effect is hopelessly out of sync, rhythmically incorrect, and sloppy sounding.  <br />The (...) who remixed and remastered this important work of art should be ashamed of themselves.  It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version.  And now of course this is the only version you can find (on disc anyway).  If they weren't smart enough to get it right, they should have left the track echo-free.  Miles would be furious.  <br />Why not just paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?
6303269842|4.0|This movie is very entertaining and fun to watch.  No real thinking is required, just good clean fun.  Jodie Foster and Mel Gibson make a great team and the story line is very well written for a light hearted western with a bit of comedy thrown in.  The villians are mean, rotten and ugly, the heros not what you always expect them to be and the story while not exactly a puzzle, isn't just a obvious &quot;oh, I knew that would happen&quot; plot.  This movie gets a smiley faced recommendation.

It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version.  And now of course this is the only version you can find (on disc anyway).  If they weren't smart enough to get it right, they should have left the track echo-free.  Miles would be furious.  <br />Why not just paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?
B00005PJ8I|5.0|Although a long movie that has a lone actor in much of the film I was thoroughly engrossed the second time watching.  It is definitely a &quot;thinking movie&quot; and comes close to being a romance although there isn't enough time to really develop relationships with other characters.  A very challenging premise, this movie could have easily turned out to be a boring disappointment, but the challenge was met and the film shines.<br />Hanks must act with himself and develops a relationship with &quot;Wilson&quot; on the island, which turns out to be an experience well worth watching and reflecting about.<br />Man is not programed to be alone, he(we) cannot stand isolation and must find a way to relate to someone (or something).  Hanks performance is very convincing and this film is a very strong recommendation.
B00005OM4N|5.0|&quot;All you people look at me like am a little girl.&quot; is what the reigning Queen of Pop sings in the beginning of the smash I'm a Slave 4 U. This song Written by the NEPTUNES shows Britney at her best. She went from the little girl in the school outfit to the club loving girl. This CD  is the best out of them all. Yes I'm a HUGE Britney Fan.  These songs at first listen are a little weird but after the 2nd time they ROCK. The stand out tracks on the album are: Slave, Overprotected,Not A Girl(from her movie CROSSROADS which looks amazing), Boys, Cinderella, That's where you take me.<br />Give Britney A Chance, even if U think she dresses not the greatest doesn't give u  the right to think Brit can sing. She can and she'll be still having Number ones when the others are trying to get other labels to release them.<br />BRITNEY: A++++++++- BEST CD OF 2001!!!!!<br />like that!
079213690X|5.0|It is hard to recall any really bad movies that Mel Gibson has been in, and this is no exception, the only question being; &quot;Is it his best?&quot;  Perhaps...<br />In an interview about the film I learned that after Gibson read the script he decided that he didn't want to merely act in the film, but direct it as well.  The script was written with the historical William Wallace in mind, but as it turns out, the history is a bit shady, so most of the film is fiction based on a few known facts and a lot of legend.  But it doesn't hurt the story in the least.<br />Besides the cinematography which was fantastic, the script which was captivating and the costumes which were amazing; the film delivered some very strong object lessons in love, morality, loyalty and justice.<br />In the movie 'The General's Daughter' the question is raised &quot;What could be more terrible than rape?&quot; and the answer is &quot;betrayal&quot;.  The same brutality and utter destructiveness of betrayal is shown in Braveheart and its power is graphically displayed.  The movies power is in being able to take the viewer on highs and lows, to make us see and feel the anger, pain, love and victory.<br />The other important message about family, loved ones and community and the importance of protecting them, even with the cost of one's own life cannot be understated.  In America after 9/11 we realize that danger is close and that peace and justice often come with a bloody price tag.  I never felt that the film gloried war or death, and it certainly was very graphic, this isn't a film for the young, but it did a good job of showing the hearts and minds of the warriors and the strength that allowed them to fight for what they felt was right and just.<br />The call of Braveheart, &quot;Freedom&quot; is a timeless message and this movie is a timeless story.  It can be watched over and over again.  Highly recommended.
0345357116|5.0|In this book you will find the revised and expanded version of the stories of the Silmarillian, as well some significant backstory for Galadriel.  There are also Gandalf's account of the hunt for the ring as well as Gandalf's account of how he came to bring 13 dwarves together with Bilbo--stories that were cut from the Lord of the Rings.  You will also find an expanded history of N&uacute;menor.  Truly excellent!  DON'T read the Silmarillian without following it up with this book!<br /><br />Update:  This book is also published as Unfinished Tales & Unfinished Tales of N&uacute;menor and Middle-Earth!
630382790X|4.0|I was never much of a NASA or astronaut fan (although I love science fiction) so I may not have been impressed as some one that is or that followed the real story when it happened (I was just a little kid).  But I thought that this movie was very engrossing and I did care about the characters (which is always important in any really good movie). I would have enjoyed the film even if it was completely fiction.<br />Hanks is great in all he does and with the combination of all the great talent and the very believable special effects in this movie it is a good strong recommendation.
B00000J9HF|5.0|It is hardly surprising to find myself deeply moved by the perfomers on the recording. They are among the finest, and Giulini is a conductor who can perform Verdi with no serious rivals. The understanding between the musicians and the work is clear and beautiful. Cotrubas could hardly be more poignant and lovely a Gilda, and Cappuccilli's Rigoletto is one of the most endearing, suffering, witty, and well-rounded portrayals of this character that I have ever heard. The voices of those two performers is enough to make anyone listening freeze in one spot and only later begin to wonder why no one sings like that anymore. Domingo performs well, but this recording is somewhat early in his career and his distinctive voice is not quite at its prime. It doesn't matter: he is not the star here, and it is nice for once to hear him humbled by the voices around his. This is probably the best recording of this opera available.
630339406X|5.0|Still my all time favorite Tom Hanks movie, this movie really is magical.  It takes a really great actor to pull off this kind of switch, adolescent boy becomes a man after wishing he was &quot;big&quot;.  The story is masterfully written and expertly acted.<br />Hanks is able to pull off getting a job, getting promoted and finding a beautiful girl friend, but like many of us &quot;real adults&quot; we find that being a man isn't always what it is cracked up to be.  Loneliness and frustration set in and we know something is wrong with our world.  Hanks portrays the struggle in a way that comes across as real and when he tells his girlfriend that he is &quot;just a kid&quot;, well the humor is doubly ironic.<br />Both an entertaining movie for adults and kids, a good family library film, highly recommended.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was looking forward to this movie long before it came into theaters because of the previews. Then, I went to see it. I hated it, from start to finish. There was not one thing I liked about it other than the songs done by Ewan Mcgregor. Who knew that he had a great voice!?! Everything was too loud and flashy. All the songs had been done before; none were original, that I could tell of anyway. It seemed extremely cheesy and overdone and stupid. I was very upset, because I had bought the sound-track right before I went to the movie. I started listening to it, and the more I listened, the more I wanted to see it again. So, I went back. From the beginning, I began to notice things I had not before. It was amazing. I became one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything that I hated the first time, I loved. The overdone songs were pieced together brilliantly; the loudness, brightness, and over dramaticness fit together perfectly into a beautiful array of art and passion. Without a doubt, it is the most uncomon movie I have ever seen. Not everyone will like it, but give it a chance. Probably a couple chances before you judge it or cross it off. It is truly beautiful. Probably the most gorgeous (as far as props and setting, not nature, etc.) movie I have ever seen. I can not wait to own it on DVD!!!
6303402348|5.0|A triumph in film making and feel good story telling.  Forrest over comes challenge after challenge and shows such grace to others it is hard not to completely love him.  Hanks showed that he is one of the greatest actors ever to hit the screen in this movie by portraying Gump in such a way that the viewer loves him and  knows him but never feels pity for him even though his circumstances may seem to warrant it.<br />Gump gives us a vision of true loyalty in friendship, he is patient, kind, doesn't hold grudges (doesn't keep accounting of wrongs suffered), he believes all things and hopes in all things.  This movie is very enlightening and a true pleasure to watch.<br />It is fun to watch, it is entertaining, it is a good family movie (older kids) and it is definitely a &quot;thinking movie&quot; and a challenge to how we all live.  Very highly recommended.
156224003X|5.0|!!!!!!!!WERNER'S IDEAS WILL NOT MAKE TRUE SENSE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO GIVE THE EXERCISES A TRY AND NOT GIVE UP ON THEM!!!!!<BR>I couldn't begin to tell you how important this book has become to me. i am 18 years old and played guitar 5 years during middle and high school. i was frustrated in the guitar and never felt like i was as good as other people, or i didn't have what it takes to be good. so i basically quit playing. so after two years of not playing anything,i picked up the piano, which was sixth months ago. and this is what led me to Effortless Mastery. i got the book and read it and it made more sense than i could tell you. i got serious with trying to use his techniques and i felt myself improving unusually well. music had a whole new feel to it, almost like the more i let myself go into &quot;the space&quot; the more music i realized was out there to be played.('Werner talks about the body as a vessel for music located in the soul). Anyway here is my point, i randomly one night picked up my guitar and started playing it. It was no ordinary feeling. The guitar was my &quot;new&quot; instrument to play. In only TWO months i have improved more than ten times the amount i improved earler in the 5 years of frustrating playing (trying to force the music out, instead of letting it come out by &quot;ITSELF&quot;) And I love playing again! even listening to music is better, and the most exciting thing is that music only gets better from here on! I hope to meet kenny werner someday, i could not thank you enough!

B00005OM4N|5.0|Oh definetly britney has done it a 3rd time. With more variety  than oops... and less filler than baby... britney really shows she has matured. jumping from a heartbreak, \\"take me back i love you and i want you\\" track to a \\"get the -bleep- out i'm sick of your ...\\" song. tracks like the max martin \\"overprotected\\" and \\"cinderella\\" which britney co-wrote and \\"bombastic love\\" are more of the britney we know, but with an added rocky flare. the 2 neptunes penned tracks, \\"slave 4 u\\" and \\"boys\\" add a funky, r&b beat to her fantastic voice. usually w/ her previous albums, the singles have tended to fade off as they go on, eack track could be released and have the potential to reach #1. tracks such as \\"lonely\\", \\"let me be\\" and \\"that's where you take me\\" display britney's effort at writing songs which i must say is done wonderfully.the, soon to be, hit, \\"not a girl, not yet a woman\\" is one the lines with her previous monster ballad, \\"where are you know\\". and of course, we knew it would happen sometime, britney and justin team up w/ wade robson for a great rock influenced track called \\"what it's like to be me\\" although it sounds as if it would be a ballad, it is quite the opposite. britney, w/ the exception of max martin, justin, wade and the neptunes, gets help from the likes of dido and rodney jerkins (satisfaction) on her third release. definetly a great girl power album that the guys are sure to like too.

B000003TA4|5.0|there are very few albums in the world that do not have even one bad song on them. Nevermind is one of them. It is probably one of the only albums without any bad songs on it that was written and performed by a man les than 25 years old with some of his high school friends. Kurt Cobain was a prodigy and a godfather to generation X, while living his own life of peril and fighting a losing battle with self-destruction. There will never be anyone like him, and no one can ever fill his shoes for Frances Bean. Nirvana was one of the only good things that happened in the 90's. buy the album and you'll understand.
B0000009TT|5.0|The story behind the creation of this collection is almost as legendary as the man who created it.  Suffice to say, it was originally intended as a 4-disc vinyl release, ran into some complications, and was delayed by a mere 20 years.  These complications resulted in Frank Zappa's suing a VERY LARGE RECORD COMPANY for about 3 million, the material being released across about 5 albums (three of them against his wishes), and, in an act of revolt, Frank's broadcasting of the album in its entirety on LA's KROQ, during which he actually encouraged listeners to record it.<br />Until RYCODISC's CD version came out around '96, the only way a person could hear the album as Frank had intended was if one could get ahold of the recording of this famous broadcast.  Had it been released when it was supposed to, L&auml;ther would have qualified as the ultimate work of this sorely-missed musical innovator.  Zappa's wildly diverse compositional capabilities are represented more comprehensively here than on any release; from live rock performances to symphonic and chamber works, from dialogue snippets to tape-manipulated musique concrete, this is the full spectrum of pre-digital FZ at the peak of his powers.  Nobody could touch this man in the 70s.<br />As many of the songs were a bit new and rough at the time of these recordings, Frank produced more polished and extended versions in the later albums &quot;Zappa in New York&quot; and &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot;, so his reticence to release this collection during his lifetime is certainly understandable.  However, if you have not yet heard &quot;Studio Tan&quot;, &quot;Sleep Dirt&quot; and/or &quot;Orchestral Favorites&quot;, you can get them all in one tidy remastered package (without the annoying vocals that were added on &quot;Sleep Dirt&quot;) and enjoy them in one seriously eclectic listening.<br />I'm a firm believer in cheating with Desert Island Picks, by choosing box sets.  If I had the choice of one Zappa release to sustain me in isolation, I would not have to think for very long, because L&auml;ther has it all.  The ultimate FZ representation, hands down.isolation, I would not have to think for very long, because Läther has it all.  The ultimate FZ representation, hands down.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor was a top notch movie that did bad in the box office because people listened to reviews that were poorly stated. You can tell that the worked very hard on the movie and it has wonderfully choragraphed computer graphics that really makes you feel like you are there most of the time. I warn you that even though it is based on the bombbing of Pearl Harbor more than Titanic was based on the ship, the love story is a big part of the movie. It is a beautiful love story but some aren't into that. All in all, it was a wonderful movie.
B000002N9L|2.0|Just another bunch of forgettable throwaways. I don't even remember any of the songs on this CD and this is coming from someone who can remember every note, drum loop, guitar riff from his previous material. It proved that the good times had passed and are to never return.
B00005OM4N|3.0|There are two dynamics driving Britney Inc. these days.  The first is her record company and the second is Britney Spears herself.  Both realize her lasting potential, however are progressing towards it in different ways simultaneously.  One wants immediate attention of the growth (Britney), and if it is was up to her, this cd WOULD BE MORE SOULFUL, while the other (record company) wants pace and progression as to not alienate her current younger fans (who ultimately make their buck).  So, what happens?  They compromise of course!  This is not necessarily good, especially if Britney Spears tries to stand up for herself and associate COMPLETE truth in her record.  Sure, there may be truth laced in her poppish songs, such as &quot;Overpotected&quot; and &quot;Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, but it's not PRODUCED in the way a real soulful artist does it these days.  The cd as a whole sounds overproduced and her vocals are often drowned out by the &quot;pop feel&quot; of the music, and the serious messages are never 100% delivered.  There's that compromise: sing about growing up, but not really, keeping it light.  The pessimist will say that Britney's a fake, has no soul, while the optimist will say that Britney's bit-by-bit getting there.  I personally am an optimist, because I think that Britney Spears isn't allowed to give her &quot;all&quot; yet because of her record company purely because of marketing.  However, if you look at the root of her BETTER songs, &quot;Let Me Be&quot; and &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot;, there IS evidence of maturity in her deliver.  However, the over-preached gospel of her newfound change in life is too much with the cd's overall beat and lightness.  Get this cd if you are willing to open up, but it may frustrate you if you aren't ready for it.  Not a complete miss.
B000002KHY|5.0|This is quite simply the best compilation you can buy.  You will relate to JT's elegant style and warm soothing voice. You'll enjoy this cd relaxing with a bottle of wine, reflecting on current events.  The music is timeless.  Unfortunately, no one has built upon JT's craft.  It is hard to even name a current acoustic guitarist singer/songwriter with any widespread recognition.  There have been women who have come along and explored this style (Jewel, Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge) but few men. As a singer/songwriter myself with my first cd &quot;Just Taste It&quot; recently released on Amazon.com, JT has been an inspiration.  He reminds me to keep it simple and intimate.  You never hear JT force a song. He just seems to let the music flow through him and evolve naturally. I'm partial to &quot;Shower the People&quot; and &quot;Something In The Way She Moves&quot;.  The latter of which was used by a friend of mine to serenade and propose to his fiance.  If you haven't been exposed to JT before, do yourself a favor and purchase this cd. <br />Best of Luck - BLAIKE
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one (amoung a select few, NOT NIRVANA) of the most important bands to come out since the 80's. I remember a friend turning me on to Opiate when it came out and being totally blown away by it. I felt a little (just a little) let down with Undertow and then came Aenima, I was blown away again(a totally distinct album/experience in a sea of (...))<br />Now we are given Lateralus, a simply amazing album. Tool makes an effort to give you a complete album of music, no just a few hits with \\"filler\\" songs as most bands do today. In a weird way Lateralus is a back to basics, a simpler album compaired to Aenima, with more direct \\"riffs\\" in the songs and less \\"ambiguity\\", however they are still the tight musically superior band they've always been.<br />So lets cut to the chase, if you like music with a conscience (heavy or not), if you like great \\"hard rock\\", if you like songs that are haunting and memorable, if you like albums that are more of an experience rather than just a hit song or two, then buy this and support a band that deserves your support. There is a reason their fans are so loyal.
6305971951|3.0|This is a good idea for a sci-fi adventure story. But the effects and quality were kinda [bad]. And there were some things that were kinda confusing and didn't make any sense. I like the idea of men from the past accidentally getting sent into what is considered the present to us. But their electrical connections were not necessary. That's what I thought at least. And there didn't need to be what was shown in the vortex hole. Plus what happened when they arrived. Being shot at by a helicopter and then it just all of a sudden blowing up. Also, the 40's was kinda boring and hard to follow with what was going on. But I see showing the pasttime was necessary to explain how men from there had in mind that all taking place was normal and arriving in the 80's all taking place was weird. But I also thought what was the point of having that one guy come through if he was going to get sent back so soon. This is an okay story. But if I had made it, I would have given it a lot of improvements I think are needed.

B00000JGEI|4.0|Arnold is back! And this time he's a good guy! I think T-800 makes a better hero than a villain. This time the bad guy is a very hard-to-kill cyborg, T-1000. More advanced and much more skilled at defeating Arnold's techniques. This time the evil cyborg is sent back to kill John Connor when he's a kid. Before the evil version of T-800 was sent back to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, so John would not be born and living to command the army of the future to gain confidence in stopping the machines trying to wipe out humanity. T-1000 is more powerful than T-800 and a much better fighter. But the story goes as follows, good guys always win. Such a shame Arnold had to destruct himself in the end. But this is an exciting action movie. Not quite as good as the first. But great and much better special effects. The quality was much better due to the fact it was made at a time technology was more advanced. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor. But this time she's a lean, mean fighter who's not going to take anyone's nonsense. Unlike before where she was an ordinary girl who was an easy target and had to be guarded by the hero from the future. But in this stoy, she can take care of herself. It's her son who needs the bodyguard to protect him from evil. A human being could not have done it against this villain. It took a machine to stop another. I hope they make a Terminator 3 sometime to continue the story.

B00005B238|5.0|This is a great movie. Like it a lot. Much better than the stupid sequel that follows it. But I do not agree that this is Arnold's greatest performance ever. It is one of his best though. I like the idea for this action adventure sci-fi story. Men going to the jungle in South America and rescuing hostages taken. That's what they think they are heading into. But what they don't know is that an evil alien who snacks on human beings for prey is watching and planning on them being his next meal. All of them are very unlucky except one man-can you guess? Of course-the one and only Arnold Schwarznegger himself. Always considered to be the action hero who saves the day. But in real life there is no way one man could take out an impossible-to-defeat monster like this. Not even Arnold. It would take an entire team of army men. But I like the story line of this movie. There was no need to make a sequel to this. Or they could have at least made it a serious movie similar to this instead of a retarded one taking place in the not too distant future.

It's always hard for a band to follow up an epic album but Depeche Mode was smart enough to let time get its share and change direction and make a mature and well written follow up album.<br />Ultra has lyrical qualities as well as Dave Gahans wonderful singing voice.

B00005OM4N|4.0|although thoroughly unimpressed with slave 4 u i had bought her other 2 albums and liked them so thought 'why not for old times sake?' let me just say that the 2 songs written by a duo (?) i have heard named The neptunes (?), were a big mistake for poor old britters and were the low point of the cd. not a girl, not a woman, just another slushy ballad (compulsary to have at least 1 on any pop album) is, to say the least, not the most spectacularly sumptuous song ive ever heard, merely this albums equivalent to 'dont let me be the last to know' and ' bottom of my broken heart'. overprotected, lonely and anticipating go back to the plain old 'britney pop' and bear a resemblance to her previous chart toppers. let me be and bombastic love take up the usual rnb section of any pop album. that leaves the inevitable ballad/ album-fillers, including a semi duet track with justin timberlake to finnish it off, and my personal favourites cinderella (tacky pop with a catchy chorus) and i love rock n roll (cover).<BR>Afar cry from baby one more time, the real downside to britneys new album is not really the album itself but the new image (just look at slave 4 u video as an example), which takes everyone on a ride with the dirty nasty girl in britney. As 90% of her fanbase stretches from 5-16 year olds, that leaves 10% of the fully matured population who will allow themselves to accept the new 'britney'.<BR>i chose to ignore slave 4 u and its video, and knew this album would have some of the britney we all know and love left in it, i was right, and in the end it really is the music that is most important.

B00003CWPQ|5.0|This movie as no other showed us the truth about marrriage. Here they are-a happy couple,gret daughter,tons of money and yet something is amiss and we can't tell what for a long time and some people can't even tell after they have seen the movie. What is missing is excitement in a relationship which is normal for most of the married couples. The spouses have gotten comfortable to the point of dressing and going potty in front of each other. While to some it seems normal-they are so into each other, they don't care, the truth is, little things like these kill relationship. Gone is excitement,gone is magic. You know the person inside out and while the feeling of comfort is great, it also brings on boredom. And when people are bored,they start looking for entertainment. The famous English writer, Oscar Wilde said that for one to be in love, one should never marry. We think that marriage is the ultimate proof of love-you want to spend your life with one person. Yes,a lot of things are gained when you are married-that wonderful feeling that when the weather ia bad and there is a good movie on TV you can just hug each other and watch it together.Kids-they are wonders.  But also a lot of things are lost-anxiety of the next day, desire to look attractive for a partner,etc. Kubrick highlighted all these things in a movie and that's the reason for the husband's adventures. What made this movie great was the poignant part when he comes back home safe and glad that he still has his family. He had the taste of the other side of life and he realized that he does not want it. This is the concept of the road never taken-don't we all wish to know how things would have been like if we chose another way instead of the one we live by now? That one night gave Cruise to see what it's like.<BR>It's understandable that half of the theater walked out-why bother to think about these things on Friday night when your belly is full of bear and your life is great. Or does it only seems great?
B00005ASOI|2.0|DO NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE HYPE!  Trust me.........<BR>The movie appears to have good direction, but where it was being directed I don't know.  The story line is not so bad, however the suspense is just NOT there.  I admit I jumped once (in the begining) but that was all.  I even fell asleep!!  AND when I woke up, I realized I didn't miss much.  To make matters worse, when the opportunity for suspense finally occurs, the movie ends abruptly (A MAJOR LETDOWN).  I would compare this movie with the late 70's tv flick \\"Satan's School for Girls\\".  So if you liked that, you will like this.  If you did, chances are Charlie Browns The Great Pumpkin gives you nightmares and only then can I understand the positive reviews for Suspiria.  I like horror, but this movie didn't have it.  It had a great score, great set design, even the filming was good, but in comparing to great classic horror films, such as Psycho, Halloween, The Excorcist, it is NOT near the classic the other reviewers lead you to believe.  Do I regret seeing it?  No.  Do I regret buying it?  Yeah.  If you HAVE to buy it, buy the VHS at [dollar amount]!!
0385505833|5.0|Don't let the holidays season pass by without first reading this delightful story by Grisham.  Entertaining characters and a realistic portrayal of how materialism has overcome Christmas.  The Krank family will take you on a hilarious adventure from a different perspective that will keep you turning the pages until the very end.
B000000OUE|5.0|this is a superlative mixture and represents mr zombie's influences, from leonard cohen to liberace. Mr Rob (or Rod to his friends) comes out of his shell with this opus, and fires both barrels of chocolate covered poo directly at the audience. no mere contemporary of al jorgenson's, he appropriates the whole show and runs with it way beyond what Ozzy started. from his rad tats, to his way with a woman, Hot Rod herman really delivers the goods judas priest style with this one. One can only wonder what is ahead with mr Z driving the dragula mobile. if this superlative work is any indication, it is sure to be ham handed sandwiches, cherry charlie chans, and a big ole doss of american pie.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Listen, I generally get lousy ratings for my movie reviews, so I am prepared for this.  That being said; here goes.<br />A THINKING MOVIE, NOT A RELAXING ONE:<br />If you like a movie that makes you put your head in gear, this is it.  Pay attention very closely to what goes on in this movie.<br />I plan on watching it again and again, because there is some loose threads that just don't fit.<br />UNUSUAL PRESENTATION BUT DONE REALLY WELL:<br />Are you a Pulp Fiction or an X-files fan?  You might really like this.  No, no aliens, just an unusual story line.  I have to be careful not to ruin it for you.  This movie is not only different in that it is about a guy with short-term memory loss, but it is presented differently.  In a way you as the viewer are forced to piece together the movie, just like the main character does in his notes.  It is really well done.<br />BASIC STORY LINE:<br />In a nutshell, Lenny is a guy that has short-term memory loss.  Leave the room after talking to him for 15 minutes and he will forget who you are.  He remembers his past, his wife, her attack. Everything is up for grabs after that.  However, he wants his revenge for her attack.  This is his theme and his tatoos help piece together this puzzle.<br />ACTORS:<br />Guy Pearce memorable in L. A. Confidential as the rule-stuck young cop is almost unrecognizable in his bleached-blond look as Lenny.  He does an admirable job showing the confusion of a young man with a brain disorder that literally forces him to live in the moment.  Notes, tatoos and Polariod photos take the place of his memory.<br />Joe Pantoliano from the Matrix plays Teddie, his sleazy accomplice, providing confusion and direction.  Carrie Anne Moss also from the Matrix is Teddie's counter-balance.  Who does a guy with no memory trust?<br />NOT A MOVIE TO RELAX BY, BUT UNIQUELY ENJOYABLE:<br />If you want to think, this is a great movie.  If you want to coast, watch something else and save this when you want to get your mind in gear.  Some people like movies like this, some people hate them.  It may also just depend on your mood.<br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GIVE IT AT LEAST 1/2 HOUR:<br />When I first started watching this movie, my thought was, it was kind of tedious.  Great a weirdly unfolding movie.  Then when a couple of things happened that I didn't expect, it really got my attention.  Give it at least 1/2 hour to get yours.<br />Enjoy.Some people like movies like this, some people hate them.

6302732778|5.0|Okay...so I'm the odd man out for liking the voiceover of Harrison Ford on the original.<BR>My wife and I saw it on the big screen during it's original release and walked out loving this movie, forever!   The original gives  a touch of the stylistic film noir, with a traditional detective voiceover,  in an incredible, though dismal, futuristic setting: Huxley meets Orwell.    The rainy, steamy environment reminded me of city life in Japan, complete with  misty, summer fog reflecting the glow of neon.  <br />I like the voiceover similar to appreciating Martin Sheen's voiceover in Apocalypse Now.  It's like visiting a foreign country and having a guide taking you through the unfamiliar streets. <br />The ending?  Well, let's not talk about the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it.   <BR>    <BR>Either version is worth seeing, but I still prefer the original.  This movie is in my top 10.
B000001GPX|5.0|As a college freshman some 25+ years ago (who had played nothing but rock and roll up to that time), I asked my Music Appreciation professor to recommend something that would knock my socks off (I was bored!). He was an old jazz and dixieland cornet player from back in the 40's and 50's. He placed this recording in my hands and said, &quot;Put on your headphones and just crank it up! Beethoven was the rock star of his generation. This should do it for you.&quot; Talk about being blown away! I could not believe that classical music could do that to me. The next semester, I was a music major! Every other recording of the 5th that I have heard sounds heavy and plodding in comparison. This recording IS enery and power! My old vinyl is worn out. I was so happy to see this recording available on CD. Two words: Buy it!
B00004TR2G|4.0|I am always in favor of complete scores, not matter how long they are.  However, here is one case I'm not completely satisfied with, and that is because I have grown used to listening to the original release of &quot;Jaws&quot;, a CD that presents the score in a concert arrangement.<br />When Decca decided to release this &quot;anniversary collector's edition', produced by the same duo who gave us two other Williams works, I felt curious about it, but not excited.  That's because the expanded edition of &quot;E.T.-The Extraterrestrial&quot; is presented with all the cues as heard in the film, but without the concert arrangements of the original album.  That meant they were going to do the same thing with &quot;Jaws&quot;.  Thank God for their collector's edition of &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot;, which has the complete music; on the original release, the music is heard with bits of music here and there -arranged to make sensible tracks-, and they weren't presented as arrangements.<br />&quot;Jaws&quot; is still a great classic by John Williams.  The thunderous shark motif still alerts us that the killer fish is coming.  I am pleased to hear the tracks 'Man Against Beast' and 'Blown To Bits' because they keep the same mood as the arrangements from the original release.  I wish I could say the same thing about 'The Great Shark Chase', 'The Shark Cage Fugue', 'Montage', and 'Out To Sea', all of them make me long to keep on listening to the original album.  Please forgive my repetitive use of &quot;original album release&quot; and &quot;concert arrangements&quot;, but that's the way I feel.  And I don't want to forget the somewhat controversial yet fantastic 'Shark Attack', which had people wondering where this track is played: Personally, I think it's played on the scene when the shark swallows Quint.<br />This anniversary collector's edition is good because it contains the complete score as heard in the movie, and it makes a fine companion to the original album release -forgive me, I did it  again.  It's just that I still prefer those concert arrangements -sorry again.nal album release -forgive me, I did it  again.  It's just that I still prefer those concert arrangements -sorry again.
0385505833|4.0|I read this book over two days, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was very charming and quite funny. Classic &quot;how fast can gossip sweep through the neighborhood&quot; and it reminds me of my town. Be sure to pick this one up. It will surely put you in the holiday spirit.
0618002227|5.0|I agree that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I will not say that I disagree with so-and-so's review on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.  <br />I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.     <BR>Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing. And I am looking forward to the movie, it really does look amazing!
B00005QDW5|1.0|I need to start out by saying that I am the biggest Pink Floyd fan in the world....  Before disbanding in the early eighties, only one song off of all of their albums was ever released as a single.  Their albums are concept albums (at least as of 1973).  And before the concept albums, their music was utterly different in its psychedelic qualities.  Their first album was completely different all together, with a different leader and song writer (Syd Barret).  The Final Cut is also different than anything else, as it is basically a Waters solo album, and Momentary and Division are both Gilmore albums.  Sticking all of these songs together on one cd defeats the whole purpose of the band, and they are probably throwing up right now knowing that such a piece of crap is being marketed.  How do you listen to \\"Sheep\\" outside of Animals?  Anybody who is not a fan and truly cares about becoming one needs to start by buying an accessible concept album like Dark Side or Animals, and then move to the more obscure.  Any true Pink Floyd fan would burn this cd at first site.  Either you are one or the other.
B00003CXMG|1.0|I bought this movie with the expectation it would be good to have in my D.V.D collection.I am leaving right now to trade it in at a video store and hope to get at least 7 dollars towards the purchase of something worthwhile like \\"Bio-Dome\\" with Pauly Shore.This movie is not interesting at all,the plot is boring,the characters are dull although the ending was good because I knew it was over....
B00004RF9B|2.0|I don' t want to spoil anybody's fun here (enjoy it, folks!), this is just for those who only saw it many years ago (like I did) and are still unsure about purchasing.<br />&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; has three things going for it: The terrific electronic soundtrack, the sets and Robby the robot - who gives the only memorable performance. The acting is wooden otherwise (though I liked Anne Francis a lot in &quot;Bad Day At Black Rock&quot;), the direction uninspired (by the man who gave you &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;). Obviously prepoduction costs got so out of hand that the studio saved money on actors and director. (Try to imagine Robert Wise as director ... or better don't.)<br />The story: a scientist's subconscious gives birth to a monster that roams the planet, while (or because) his innocent daughter falls in love with a space commander and encounters the marvels and perils of puberty. Don't let any Krell hear that this is to be considered an intelligent plot - this is pure fairy tale, with all its innocent wonders, but also all its naivity and restrictions. The erotic implications - and we're talking about the main subject here - are so much suppressed (because of aiming at a younger audience) in favor of technical Schnickschnack and pseudo-scientific explanations that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; doesn't reach the erotic dreamlike qualities of &quot;King Kong&quot; or &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;. Critical for a film whose complete first hour consists of exposition.<br />Fair enough to say that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; inspired numerous space operas and SF TV series, it even contains a shot that bears remarkable similarity to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssee&quot;. (Compare the interior shot of the Krell's subway glider with the scenes in the space pod in the last act of &quot;2001&quot;.) Robby the robot reappeared in &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot; and (slightly altered) in the Czech &quot;Ikaria XB1&quot;, a serious, &quot;adult&quot; spaceadventure released with 20 minutes missing as &quot;Voyage To The End Of The Universe&quot; in the US.<br />Picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer deserve an A, despite some spots during the reel changes of the celluloid original. You also get a widescreen and a fullscreen version on one disc, although probably hardly anybody cares for the latter. No extras except for the movie trailer, but thankfully no 10 minute long trailer show of contemporary releases before the start of the main movie, either (hear that, MGM Midnite Movies?).<br />This is the right stuff if you liked &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, &quot;This Island Earth&quot; or George Pal's movies. If you tend more towards &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, &quot;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&quot; or the &quot;Quatermass&quot; series, think twice.
B000059MEK|4.0|I've liked Daft Punk's music ever since I heard the song &quot;Around the World&quot; back in 1997 I beleive.  Although &quot;DISCOVERY&quot; is the first CD that I have purchased of their's, I am very impressed. HARDER, BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER is really the song that made me go out and get this CD. I can't get enough of this song. When I hear it on Chicago's Energy 92.7&amp; 5 radio station, I can't help but bobb my head to it, but to tell you the truth, this CD as a whole has great dance music.  I don't find myself skipping throught songs like you may on some CD's.  All songs are quit good.  I highly recommend buying &quot;DISCOVERY&quot;. You won't be dissapointed.  If you are......then maybe you're better off shopping in the &quot;Compilation Section&quot;.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd. I just purchased it and I am listening to it right now. I love rap and punk so this is great for me, though many argue &quot;its not true punk&quot;, yeah yeah yeah, whatever. One thing I like about this CD is that its not screaming curse words at me...well, thats what my parents like about it. I love everything from Missy Eliiot to Sum 41 to Nsync so I have a wide variety of tastes.<br />1. Papercut- Overall a good song. I didn't like the video, but that's different. I really liked the beat though, it got my head bobbing within seconds. 8/10<br />2.One Step Closer- First Linkin Park hit, actually sounds alot like papercut, but a little catchier.

With You- I just plain don't like this one. Lots of yelling, which is ok sometimes but it just doesn't work for me this time. 7/10<br />4.

B00003W8NM|5.0|I don't know what else to say that has not been said before. I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time and not sure why. I must say after watching the Fight Club, I found it one of the most interesting films ever. The story, camera and acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were excellent. True there is violence, but it was the right amount given the story.  Absolutely one of the top 20 films of all time. Watch it you'll not be disappointed.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Okay, I had to weigh in because two NEANDRATHALS have their albums for sale used.  What kind of freaks are you?  This album is incredible!  I've loved PJ since &quot;To Bring you my Love&quot; when SPIN kept drooling over her.  I bought &quot;To Bring you my Love&quot; without hearing a single song and have been in love ever since.  &quot;Stories from the City&quot; is her triumph.  Wow!  My husband, who would not listen to PJ Harvey no matter how I tried, also thinks this album is the best ever.  I can listen to it 3 times in a row and never get tired.  Buy it!  And to the people selling it:  I hope you have two copies, because if you don't, I'm coming to your house and taking your copies because you don't deserve to own them!

0451450523|5.0|&quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is the quest of a nameless unicorn for others of her own kind who have mysteriously vanished from existence, apparently driven into the ocean by the Red Bull and kept by Kind Haggard.<br />Shortly after leaving her forest, the unicorn is captured by Mommy Fortuna, a sorceress who claims such imaginary animals for her midnight carnival. The unicorn is soon released, however, by Schmendrick the Magician, Mommy Fortuna's hapless assistant. Together they continue the journey until they meet their third companion, Molly Grue.<br />The threesome then approach Hagsgate, the pitiful town owned by King Haggard--who lives a short distance farther in his cliff-side castle with his adopted son, Prince Lir. But before they have a chance to enter the castle, they're attacked by the Red Bull, who has come to collect the last unicorn. In an unexpected turn of events, Schmendrick transforms the trapped unicorn into a beautiful young woman (Lady Amalthea). The sudden change fools the Red Bull and protects her for the time being--just until they can search the castle for the other missing unicorns.<br />&quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is one of my all-time favorite books. I saw the animated movie first when I was very young--shortly after it was released in 1982-- and later decided to read the book when I was about 9 or 10. Although the book is fantastic, I though the movie's ending was much better than the book's. There are a few other things I prefer in the movie, but I still really love the book. I highly recommend both to anyone who loves unicorns.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was one of the best books that I have ever read.I had to read the book for school and at first I thought it would be very boring because normally, school books are. The Giver made me see things in a whole new perspective. Jonas' world is one without weather, feelings, color, animals or diseases. Nobody ever feels pain or experiences bad weather. Jonas realises this when he becomes the receiver of memory. He starts to see the Giver who transfers memories over to Jonas. Memories about color, kittens, Christmas, warefare and more. For the first time, Jonas sees how limited his community is and becomes very angry. He cannot understand why nobody can experience colors or choice. Everything is done for them, including their jobs and who they marry. <BR>     Lois Lowry writes the most extrodinary and breathetaking book I have ever read. I urge any and everyone to pick up this amazing book. It will definitely be worth your while.
B000005IS1|4.0|The MC5 did epitomize the wildness of the late 60's and particularly of Detroit rock.  One tends to forget how crazy a time this was.  With the exception of the final song, Starship, the album still packs a tremendous charge even after 30 plus years.  Starship, while it brings back fond memories of the psychodelic era, is a little tough to sit through now.<br />A minor clarification to one of the earlier reviews, is that the Detroit riots occured in 1967 the year prior to the Detroit Tigers championship season.
0385505833|2.0|I couldn't get past the premise of this book. There is a world outside of celebrating Christmas, without taking cruises, or getting your feet wet and cursing white chocolate. I'm sure there must have been some Wassermans or Feinsteins in the neighborhood who were likewise not displaying the huge Frosty on their rooves. Since I never believed the premise, much of the humor eluded me. I suppose Grisham could be using the Kranks (Yiddish word, that, by the way) to symbolize the psychic pressure some people feel to be &quot;merry&quot; at this time of year whether they feel so or not, so the literal compulsion is merely a metaphor; if so, though, it escaped me.<br />Instead of getting mauled at the mall and the grocery store right before Christmas, most of us non-participants plan ahead, and stay away from all shopping venues the week or so before. It seemed to me that the inevitable magnetism of Christmas was not some mystic power, but the result of poor planning.<br />So why did I read the book? The title was appealing-- I don't &quot;skip&quot; Christmas, in my mind: it's just another day. I thought a book about people tossing away the hype and trying to rediscover quietude, which even for non-celebrants is hard to find the more hassled and harried your co-workers get, would be nice. Instead I had Rebel without a Candy Cane-- which is another thing: Luther Krank is thoroughly unlikable. Perhaps if I had liked him I would have had an easier time suspending my disbelief through this outlandish premise.<br />I doubt it, though.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Many of you know that this was supposed to be a big epic and all. But who needs another one of those with the cute cuddly sidekick who has the perfect wisecracks? This film is needed in anyone's collection. It's incredibly funny. David Spade's remarks are incredible and funny. The head shaking of &quot;Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh&quot; make me laugh everytime.<br />And, indeed, it does have some heart in it too. My love for Disney has been rebuilt with this movie. And while you're not laughing at the great one liners and animated slapstick, you'll be noticing the bright, simplistic visuals.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb applies his wit and intellectual rigor to debunk the  myths concerning &quot;superstar&quot; traders, &quot;normal&quot; market dynamics, as well as our perception of our own successes and failures.  The book succeeds in rendering to the reader a vision of current events unfolding as but one manifest outcome from a manifold of potential probabilities -- from market events to one's own career path -- as if he sat upon Taleb's probabalistic mountain-top.  <br />The book is highly readable and will provide a great deal of enjoyment to those who have spent any time on wall street with their critical faculties intact.

I bought this album expecting to hear something a little different, because of the &quot;state of the art&quot; digital remastering. Not trying to be negative, but it sounds no different than the original! A bit disappointing, considering CD's nowadays ain't cheap.<BR>That's really my only complaint. The bonus tracks are nice to have, and I even already knew Rebbie Jackson's version of Fly Away (which is available on her 1998 Yours Faithfully album with Michael on back-up vocals). Generally, this album sounds like it's from the 80's, but there's nothing wrong with that. Bad is an album to be looked upon with fondness.
6300216365|5.0|How I love and admire this film... this is the kind of film 90's date films try to be. I consider it a feel good movie/great comedy. This movie has the most amazing funny lines around. Woody is instantly likable in the film. So is Diane Keaton. It's also impeccably directed - very good direction. All the references to Casablanca are outstanding, along with the ending. Any Woody fan or.. well, ANYONE and everyone should see this movie. It's on DVD, so buy it already.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Everyone in the world thinks When the Pawn... is an awesome artistic, lyrical, and musical breakthrough; I don't think I've read one negative review- on Amazon or elsewhere.  But here's what each song means to me<br />All I Need is a pretty scary tune that like another amazon reviewer mentioned, is somewhat contradictory, since the lyrics indicate desire (the chorus screams: you're all I need!) but the music is wrenching and herky jerky and rather unpretty.  A great song though.<BR>To Your Love could be a lyrical continuation of Sullen Girl from Tidal minus the rape metaphors.  It's basically an apology from Fiona to a lover, explaining how sorry she is that she's so tortured and hard to understand.<BR>Limp- I didn't realize this until recently but Limp is lyrically about a guy who Fiona threatens with impotence (get it: limp? lol)-that is, if he continues to need her &quot;shame to reclaim your pride.&quot; It's probably the first song you'll like. <BR>Love Ridden- A sorrowful song with a heavy emphasis on piano and string about the ending of a relationship.  &quot;Love Ridden I've looked at you with the focus I gave to my birthday candles.&quot;  Gorgeous poetry meets skilled piano meets Fiona's luscious voice.<BR>Paper Bag- This song was nominated for a Grammy but lost to the talented but annoying Sheryl Crow.  It is a truly magnificent song, based on a brilliant poem.  Clever and inspired.  Does music get any better?<BR>A Mistake- one of her songs that reveal Fiona's personality in greater depth.  She explains a longing to do stuff wrong, to make people po'd, to make a mistake.  She also claims, &quot;I'm no good at math.&quot;  Yeah right.  There's no way someone who writes songs brilliantly and plays the piano, the hardest of all instruments, would be bad at mathematics but there's Fiona's personality- underestimating herself and thus winning the listener's appreciation. <BR>Fast as You Can- It's one of those songs so unconventional and complex that it makes you wonder how someone could write it.  Where the melody began and so forth.  The video's awesome.  The song's catchy.  Wow.<BR>The Way Things Are- the opening guitar riff of this song speaks volumes about how downtrodden and miserable this song is going to be.  The rest of the music is minor and depressing.  The lyrics are about how it's easier to be miserable and static than get off your butt and become happy again.  Anyone who's gone through depression should immediately identify with this song.<BR>Get Gone- Fiona's talking about being stuck in a bad relationship with someone who is mean to you.  I love this song because of the original music, the direct and identifiable lyrics, and the way she is so angry yet so vulnerable while she sings it.  <BR>I Know- The end to the album.  It is exactly the way an end should be.  It's a slow pretty song- beautiful really- about optimism in the face of a relationship that probably won't work out too well.  It's uplifting, sad, romantic, and a lot longer than the rest of the songs.<br />Clearly, this is my personal favorite album of all time and definitely the best album of all time from a female artist.  If you're thinking about buying When the Pawn... which I can't recommend enough, be warned: You may become obsessed with Fiona Apple!
B000007T2Z|5.0|What sort of people would open their first album with something like Dead Flag Blues.....Think about that.The first thing that we the public should hear is this haunting,bleak sound poem about &quot;the end of days&quot;.What an absolutely stunning and audacious thing to do. Here then is the Godspeed manifesto.<BR><BR>Although this is not as musically adventurous as the later &quot;skinny fists&quot; when we arrive at the point 16 minutes into the final track Providence and we are asked &quot;Where are you going&quot; It is a fundamental question and a moment of real truth.<BR><BR>Once you play this music in a room...that room can never be quite the same again...something will be different.<BR>Five stars...HIGHLY recommended.
B00005BL2A|4.0|The reviewer 'Ian creamer' said &quot;Track 5 seems to pay homage to the new goth generation of N.I.N. and Manson-unfortunately they seem to have influenced D.Mode on this occasion rather then vice-versa.&quot; NIN and Manson are not goth. People who don't know what goth is usually think they are. Any real goth will tell you this.
B00000ING2|5.0|I still don't understand the disapproval of even Coen fans to this movie. What's so wrong with it? It's classic 50's-era screwball comedy, with beautiful visuals and a feel good atmospehere. I consider Tim Robbins a great actor (and director) after seeing this, the Shawshank Redemption, Bob Roberts, and The Player. The sweeping score is moving, and elevates the action on the screen in a new height.<br />It begins on an anynomonous note, and ends on a more happy note. The usual 'substance over story' quote used for the Coens is wrong; their writing isn't like other films. It can be deadpan and odd, and it's perfect as it is. It's astonishing that it only made two million (!) dollars at the box office - while Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink made more at a limited theater run (I guess it's understandable. Both films are better).<br />It still deserves more of a widespread audience.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd has to be, without a doubt, the best cd I have ever heard. Britney's new edgy sound is great. This cd is a mix of r&amp;b and rock. My personal favorite is number 12 &quot;What It's Like to Be Me.&quot; She sounds awesome b/c it's kinda of a rock song. Other major standouts include &quot;Loney&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot;,and &quot;Let Me Be.&quot; Here is a rundown of all the amazing songs.<BR>1.I'm A Slave 4 U- 5 stars*****<BR>2.Overprotected- 5 stars*****<BR>3.Loney- 5 stars*****<BR>4.Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman- 5 stars*****<BR>5.Boys- 5 stars*****<BR>6.Anticipating- 4 stars****<BR>7.I Love Rock And Roll- 5 stars*****<BR>8.Cinderella- 4 stars****<BR>9.Let Me Be- 5 stars*****<BR>10.Bombastic Love- 5 stars*****<BR>11.That's Where You Take Me- 4 stars****<BR>12. What It's Like To Be Me- 5 stars*****<br />Overall,&quot;Britney&quot; is an excellent buy. Anyone would be proud to own it. It's her best cd to date. I just saw her in concert and omg was it amazing. The dancing was great and she had all different funky outfits but i don't want to give it way.
B0000524CY|5.0|Not only is &quot;The Exorcist&quot; the scariest movie of all time, is is one my favorite movies of any genre.  Although it does not share the same psychological suspense as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a very tense film, as well as a horrifying look at pure evil.  As William Peter Blatty [the author and producer] says on the documentary, you take out of this movie what you want to.  If you can look beyond the sometimes over-the-top demonic posession horror, the story is brilliant, and the movie is very tasteful in the way it represents itself.  A major triumph.<br />About the &quot;Version You've Never Seen&quot; aspect...  The added scenes are not too spectacular, many of which could be seen on the documentary.  Some added scenes, such as the opening shots really added to film, and others [such as the highlights of the demon face] did not seem to really add much, but were still interesting additions.<br />Of the 3 DVD releases of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; [First Release, 25th Anniversary, &quot;The Version You're Never Seen&quot;], the most recent 2 both have their qualities, and are the better versions to pick from.  The 25th Anniversary has an excellent 74 minute documentary &quot;The Fear of God: The Making of 'The Exorcist'&quot;, full of interesting tid-bits of information including the rumored cursed production problems and intriguing 1998 interviews with members of the cast including Linda Blair [Regan McNeil] and Ellen Burstyn [Chris McNeil].  It also has a commentary track with both the director William Friedkin and the writer/producer William peter Blatty.  The latest DVD, this version, &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; not only has an incredibly restored Dolby Digital soundtrack, but an unbelievably clear [especially for 1973] restored picture.  Like the other DVD it has a commentary track, only it has just the director speaking, no Blatty.  Director Friedkin goes on and on as if it was a TheatreVision videofor blind people; describing what is obviously happening on the screen.  The few reflections he makes on making the film and why [now added] scenes were cut out are not even worth waiting for if you have to listen to his audio book-like commentary the rest of the time.  I suggest you rent the Anniversary edition to watch the informative documentary, but  purchase the restored version to have in your collection.
B00005LQ04|4.0|Stunningly photographed and outlandishly set-designed, SUSPIRIA has an opulence and elegance that you don't normally find in a slasher horror film. Its predominately female cast and a virtual lack of sex and nudity are also quite unusual in films of this type. Yes, it does have a few horrific murder scenes that would have gotten the film an X rating (this Anchor Bay DVD is unrated and uncut). But the majority of the film takes the \\"high road\\" in horror film-making -- rather than drenching you with blood and guts and wall-to-wall violence, it stirs up creepy atmosphere, builds up suspense, and punctuates them with shocks that are created with originality and brilliance.<br />The DVD's THX-certified video transfer is SUPER, with sharp picture, rich colors, and fine details. The Dolby Digital and DTS English surround soundtracks are clean and strong, but channel separations are sometimes quirky. There are no subtitles of any language. But it does have English closed captioning.<br />Anchor Bay released 60,000 copies of the 3-disc Limited Edition, which includes a second DVD of a new 52-minute documentary, and a music CD of the movie's music soundtrack. The documentary is essentially a collection of interviews of the cast and crew, who talk about the conception of the film (\\"Snow White\\" was an inspiration), the score, the style of the film, and their favorite scenes and anecdotes. The first disc contains the other extras: 2 trailers, 3 radio spots, 1 TV spot, about 100 stills, a music video of the movie's theme music performed by Daemonia, and bios of the director, writer, and star. There is also a 30-page DVD booklet containing an essay on the film and an interview with star Jessica Harper. Also included are replicas of eight of the production stills.
B000053ZRR|5.0|I must say that this concert rocks!!  Bon Jovi sounds their best here.  Surprising, since when they came though Dallas they did not sound all together.  I'm not sure if it was because it was at the end of the tour and they were just tired which would be understandable; or if it was just me being angry that they were out of the loop for so long.  This DVD has an amazing version of Runaway and wow Bed Of Roses is so beautiful it almost puts me in a comatose state!  The sound quality is superb here.  I played a trick at a party I threw and told everyone I was putting in Shrek and instead put in Bon Jovi.   When the sound clip Living On A Prayer came on, everyone went nuts and sang with the tune! When around twenty people who were tearing up my apartment stopped, sat down, and watched the whole show it tells you something!!
B00005QCVT|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's tale of drug abuse awakens a genre that has been beaten to death with fresh terifyingly new imagery that will make you want to curl into a fetal position on the floor after you watch it, it's that powerful.  Every conceivable detail to the camera angle, the dialogue is worked on to pure perfection, but what really puts this movie over to top is the score composed by Clint Mansell.  The haunting tension building summer overture sets in the first few minutes the dramatic tone of the movie.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, or the conservative type, or the conventional mainstream movie goer, but if you can put this in your DVD and sit with an open mind, you will enjoy this film.
0679879269|5.0|For whoever thinks this book is sacreligous nonsnse, shame on you. Phillip Pullman is trying to express his ideas on what God is and what angels are and things like that. whoever said Pullman is sacreligious should be more open about religion and other beliefs.<BR> Rarley has a book ever made me cry. in fact this is the only book. when Lyra left pan, i was in tears. when she and will parted, i was devastated. for anyone who thinks Will jumped Lyra and was rude, well, it was a mutual decision, and they both realized that they loved each other. what did you expect him to do? say, &quot;I want to kiss you now. may i?&quot; <BR>  This book is definitley my favorite in the series. it kept me captivated to the point when i couln't put it down.

6304258984|5.0|Feel like just sitting on the couch and killing a few hours with a video? The Rock is a great movie to just sit back and watch over and over. While the plot is thin, isn't it always with an action film? It is Unconventional Warfare (chemical weapons and the SEAL/Marine Recon team) that is believable, unlike, say, the Under Siege series. I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen this movie and always remember classic quotes like &quot;Glass or plastic?&quot; and &quot;Ah'll take pleasure in guttin' yew, boa. Lot of teenage I'm-angry-at-my-father-anger here...&quot; Great performances by Connery in the role of an untried SAS spy (slightly unbelievable), Nick Cage (FBI Agent Stan Goodspeed, Chemical Weapons expert) and Ed Harris (revolting Marine Commander.)
B000002UY5|5.0|Many other reviewers have covered my feelings about Shannon Hoon, so I'll just get to the point. I am a young and new fan of Blind Melon. Shannon had already passed on by the time I started getting into music, but I can see why so many people were devestated by the news. Blind Melon is awesome. Anyway, getting to the album, this album is a collection of great songs, with no dud songs. (by dud songs I mean bad songs by good bands) &quot;Soak the Sin&quot; Gets you right into the Blind Melon mood. A rock song, but not a hard one, this is one of my favourites on the album. &quot;Tones of Home&quot; will bring older fans back to their days of love concerts and mary jane. For me it's just a great old fashioned song. The intro for this song is one my favourites. &quot;I Wonder&quot; is a great softer song about challenges and internal struggle that can be quite a motivator. &quot;Paper Scratcher&quot; is an awesome rock song that I look forward to when listening to this album. It's a great pick-up after the sad &quot;I Wonder&quot; This song will put you in a good mood. I think this song would be really popular nowadays. &quot;Dear Ol' Dad&quot; is another old fashioned but really good song. It's one of those songs that kind of drags you in while you listen to it, and you get right into the mood. &quot;Change&quot; was obviously written for a reason. A powerful, meaningful, but sad song, this will make you think. On the down side, this song kind of saddens me. Luckily, the next song up is &quot;No Rain&quot; possibly the happiest song ever written, though the well written lyrics make me think that wasn't the intent. Still, you can't help but smile and sing along with this song. &quot;Deserted&quot; is another one of my favourites. Another self-searching song, but not a sad one. This one makes you take problems seriously, but still with optimism. Mainly a rock song with some cool, different parts. &quot;Sleepy House&quot; is a cool-down song. The lyrics are really nice andcalming too. &quot;Holyman&quot; is a nice partner to &quot;Sleepy House&quot; because it starts out calm, then kicks up and gets more preppy. All in all a good song. &quot;Seed to a Tree&quot; is another of my favourites. It's a great example of Blind Melon's hardcore rocker side. This song is mostly about accomplishments and how it's possible to achieve goals. &quot;Drive&quot; is a sadder, softer song about a guy who sets many goals, but has no ambition, and ends up wasting his life. &quot;Time&quot; is an awesome song reflecting the roots of Blind Melon, and closes the album in a way that makes you want more. The awesome gutiar and vocals make this song explosive. &quot;Time&quot; might be my favourite on the album, but for me it's hard to choose from &quot;Soak the Sin&quot; &quot;Paper Scratcher&quot; &quot;No Rain&quot; &quot;Seed to a Tree&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;
B000002UE9|5.0|After their multi-platinum debut, Poison took an even tighter grip on their 80's fame with Open Up and Say Ahh...<br />Featuring the Bands most successful hit of all time &quot;Every Rose Has It's Thorn&quot;, this CD rounds out its place in Hair-Band history with &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; and Nothin' But a Good Time&quot;. I believe this is their best work to date...<br />~Shadow~
B000002TQV|5.0|What if you vacuumed your living room and then cleaned the bathroom, all while drunk on absinthe? Then you would be too far gone to appreciate this album, but it would make a good story.
B000002BUY|4.0|I'll admit it right away.  I did not have the foggiest idea who Incubus was until the single &quot;Pardon Me&quot; was released off 1999's Make Yourself.  But it didn't take long for me to realize that I was in love with this band, and so, of course, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is now a permanant fixture in my CD player.<br />Those who know Incubus only from Make Yourself and Morning View may not recognize them here.  The rap-metal category they now shun defined their sound a mere four years ago, when S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was released.  This album is considerably harder and perhaps a bit less refined than their current radio-friendly singles are.  That, and the fact that several of the songs deal with themes unacceptable on the radio until Afroman came along, are probably why so many of us did not know Incubus prior to Make Yourself.<br />While the band was young and unproven, they still managed to create a work of art.  As a matter of fact, it is the youthful discontent and idealism that makes this album so great.  Songs like &quot;Vitamin&quot; and &quot;Idiot Box&quot; are not only musically intriguing, but poignant social commentaries.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E. has more of a jazz/funk influence than the newer albums, as evidenced in &quot;Glass,&quot; &quot;Summer Romance&quot; and &quot;Deep Inside.&quot;  <br />After S.C.I.E.N.C.E., lead singer Brandon Boyd got a shave, lost the dreads, and became a heartthrob (whether intentionally or not is anyone's guess.)  Besides the physical change, the music changed to feature his outstanding voice.  Also, the band acquired a new DJ following this album, giving Incubus the distinct sound they have today.  However, the social commentary and staunch idealism seem to diminish with each progressive album.  I love the Incubus that MTV has recently discovered, but no collection would be complete without this milestone record.  Incubus is one of the few bands whose past is as promising as its future.
B00005R23S|5.0|An incredble video - sound quality and picture the best I've ever seen! It's a treat and a gift to be able to have this - thanks Bruce for giving this back to us!  This video is a MUST for the hardcore and casual fan alike! <br />One small complaint - some of the BEST stuff was left off.  Just watch the snippet of Blood Brothers and Back in Your Arms Again.  Makes you want the whole thing!  And Blood Brothers and especially the E-Street Band chant that happened the last night of the tour 7/1/00  underscored the entire 2 years of the tour!  This stuff should have been included!<BR>Also: why on earth was the song order shuffled around?  It makes me think that the person editing this video didn't have a clue about the tour! (Bruce, you didn't do this did you?)  As you watch it it's obviously the songs are out of order - in one Bruce is soaked with sweat - then the next song comes up and he's bone dry!  Because of this you don't get the true 'concert experience' because it doesn't seem to flow.  OK, those of us who were there for multiple shows can tell you which song was recorded which night, just by looking at the color of the audience wristbands and who's in the first row! But if you're watching for the sheer enjoyment of a concert video - the obvious 'out of sequence'material is very distracting.<br />It seems to me that the DVD was produced for the widest audience in mind, the'hard core' fan (like me) and the casual fan who mainly listens to 'Greatest Hits' - and from a marketing standpoint I can understand that.  But I would have rather seen the 'interviews' and the 'pictures' from disc two replaced with the entirety of the last half hour of 7/1/00 - which was THE most powerful concert experience many of us have ever had the honor to attend.
B000002GDJ|4.0|That's not to say that their first album was a runaway smash or anything but more that the second album is actually better. Yes, everyone has heard &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; numerous times I know. It's still a good tune and a fitting one to begin the album. The title song is also a rocker as are &quot;Deathwish&quot; and &quot;It's Alright for You&quot;. In the latter, the rapid fire vocals by Sting really make the song. &quot;Bring on the Night&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; are of a slightly slower tempo and in keeping with &quot;Be My Girl--Sally&quot; from the previous album, there's a goofy, novelty-ish song in &quot;On Any Other Day&quot;.  Not that any of the songs are bad, but the final three are somewhat weaker than all of the rest. No matter. I always enjoy breaking this one out and listening to it every so often. You will too.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Like many other 30something year olds, George Lucas was the author of all my childhood fantasies. I saw Star Wars Episode IV when I was 6 and was completely blown away. No movie has ever had the same impact on me. With the release of Episode 1, George Lucas had the daunting task of trying to recreate the experience we all had in 1977. There is no way this film (or any film) could live up to those expectations. I have chosen to view Episode 1 on its on merits and find it to be brilliant, wildly entertaining, and ground-breaking in its use of computer generated effects. The DVD is the best I have ever purchased. It provides a plethora of extras which are extremely insightful and enjoyable. I know there are many Phantom Menance &quot;bashers&quot; out there, but true Star Wars fans will &quot;get it&quot;.
0345440757|3.0|What distinguishes this book from other childcare books is the author's emphasis on learning to empathize with one's child in order to better meet his/her needs. In this, the book truly excels. There are also some very useful ideas regarding schedules and activities.<br />Where the book falls short, however, is in its portrayal of new parents and the tone it takes in advising us. With the exception of one &quot;mum&quot; (who follows the author's method to the letter), the author seems to see new parents as bumbling morons who couldn't find their own tushies, much less their babies', with two hands. That is, of course, until the Baby Whisperer rescues them. It's too bad this book -- like most childcare guides -- treats parents like dolts, because it contains some valuable insights which will be lost to those who become too annoyed to keep reading. Unfortunately, it slips into condescension just often enough to be fairly irritating to a sleep-deprived parent like me. (I assume this is the audience the author is trying to reach.)<br />The worst moment is when the author asserts that women who breastfeed longer than a year probably do so in order to keep their children dependent, since these mums secretly like being the only ones who can comfort their babies. I find that downright offensive, and I'm not even all that wild about breastfeeding.<br />Also troubling is that the book does not acknowledge that some babies -- i.e. those with severe reflux and other digestive disorders -- will often be unable to conform to the schedule the author advocates. Attempting a schedule may be helpful even for these children, but one needs to acknowledge that there will probably be no &quot;three-day magic.&quot; A significant minority of babies have chronic digestive problems that happen because their systems are immature -- not because of anything the parents are or aren't doing. For these children and their parents, the schedule for many days (and nights)during the first year willinclude a lot of time simply trying to make the child comfortable. On these days, no one will care whether sleep comes after eating or after activity. <br />The bottom line is: read the book, take what helps you, and ignore the rest. You know your baby better than anyone else. Here's hoping someone will someday write a childcare guide that respects both parents and babies.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd is not a greatest hits band.  It would be impossible to summarize their brilliant career in only two cd's.  All the albums from Meddle to The Final Cut need to be listened to in their entirety to truly appreciate the work.  However, each album does have its highlights, and those are nicely presented here.  Since I already own all the original albums, I only picked this one up for the unreleased track &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;, and it also makes a great cd to play in the car, rather then taking 5-6 cd's.  Hopefully beginners will listen to this album and from that, they will buy the original albums.  But to capture the true, &quot;best of&quot; Floyd, they would need to release another 2 CD set.  Here are my choices for a 2nd best of:<br />1.) Interstellar Overdrive 2.) Lucifer Sam  3.) Let There Be More Light  4.) Apples and Oranges  5.) Julia Dream  6.) The Nile Song  7.) Green is the Colour  8.) Granchester Meadows  9.) Careful With that Axe, Eugene  10.) Point Me at the Sky  11.) Fat Old Sun  12.) Childhood's End  13.) Free Four  14.) The Gold It's In The...  15.) Brain Damage  16.) Eclipse  17.) Welcome to the Machine  18.) Have a Cigar  19.) Dogs  20.) In the Flesh?  21.) Mother  22.) Young Lust  23.) Run Like Hell  24.) The Final Cut  25.)

B000056K04|4.0|I am 13 years old, so my music tastes are usually more rap/r&amp;b oriented.  I usually think of DMB as &quot;old people music&quot;.  This is really good though.  I know a lot of the older fans probably hate this album because there are more radio friendly songs on it.  My favorite song on here is &quot;I Did It&quot;.  I just think it sounds really funny and it gives me weird images in my mind.  I used to really like &quot;The Space Between&quot; but that was so overplayed that now if I ever hear it on the radio, I automatically change the station.  The last song on here that I really like is the title track &quot;Everyday&quot;.  For you hardcore DMB fans out there, this is much more like their earlier work because its a good song, but it's really long.  In conclusion, if you're not willing to accept ANY change in DMB's music, than don't buy this.  If you're willing to expand your mind a little bit though, this album is for you.
B00005OM4N|1.0|At first, Britney's (admittedly familiar) \\"not-that-innocent\\" mantra is exhilarating: The aforementioned leadoff track, \\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\\" is one of the year's most fascinating slices of ear candy, lacking a clear chorus or an easy groove to latch onto -- it's a really great example of how pop minimalism can transcend the guilty pleasure aesthetic. Its likeminded successors, \\"Let Me Be\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" are among Spears' first solidly great songs, with crystal melodies riding light two-step beats to the simple pop nirvana she's perfectly capable of reaching. <br />But where 'NSync layered similarly forward-thinking production tricks with a glossy sheen throughout Celebrity, too much of Britney is dictated by Max Martin's teen-pop formula; those same staccato synths and hollow statements that defined her 1999 debut run rampant on such tracks as \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Bombastic Love.\\" There's an overwhelming sense throughout the 12 tracks that the non-singles exist merely as filler -- and they come and vanish as such. <br />The problem, though, is that the marquee tracks don't have the sugar rush \\"Baby One More Time\\" or \\"Lucky\\" had: \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" co-written by Dido, is a ballad Spears doesn't have the voice to pull off. And fans expecting redemption on \\"What It's Like to Be Me,\\" co-written by boytoy Justin Timberlake, won't find any revelatory gender bending -- it's a mess of grunts and squeals that suggests Spears isn't fighting the power just yet.<br />Brad Cawn(...)
0767817486|5.0|Although the film is manipulative (as most films are in their own way), it's pacing and haunting music score make it worth seeing and ultimately adding to your archives. The movie is not as faithful to the story as it could have been, but this is great film-making by Alan Parker. The cast is outstanding and the script riveting. A must see. It does not glamorize drugs or <BR>imply the original arrest was unjust.  My only complaint is that it is in mono and the color transfer is poor.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album has to be my favorite out of all U2 albums. If you've never heard U2 (hard to believe) or want to know which one to buy out of all of their CD's I'd definitely recommend this one!
B00000JCOV|3.0|This album has more diversity of Slipknot. Some songs bring a hard punk edge to them (i.e. &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;), have cool sounds (i.e. [sic]), and not excessive volume-11 sounds. It also shows them a hip-hop side, but in a good way. Corey's voice shows that they're still rock, but I like their groovability in each song. The drumming isn't really high-quality, but I like the sounds of everything else on this album. If you want to buy ANYTHING by Slipknot, stop by with this one. Corey even sings on this one sometimes, which the first two singles show. Shows all their influenced sounds. Hopefully, they decide to go back to this sound. If they do, I'll like them much better. If they use the Iowa sound, I hope they're forgotten soon enough. But this one's the enjoyable one.
B000002J1O|2.0|Simply didn't care for it.  Only 1 or 2 tracks really stand out. Trick of the Tale is much better.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's The Bends was appropiately titled, due to how it worked for their success. The bends is what deep-sea divers get when they rise up to the suface too quickly and stuff happens to their blood (mainly where it goes). Radiohead had been seen as a flash-in-the-pan band since they kind of started post-grunge with Pablo Honey. The album agreeably isn't near Radiohead's best. This album is one of the most influential of the Brit-pop scene, and evidence of why Travis and Coldplay sound the way they do. &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; is my personal favorite, and possibly the most complaintive of the album. Uses many metaphors, making it even cooler. &quot;Sulk&quot; shows the groove that the members put in the song, and is a very enjoyable listen. &quot;Bullet Proof...I Wish I Was&quot; shows a much softer side of Radiohead.<br />This is also RH's last natural album, and especially natural compared to Kid A and Amnesiac (although they're great too). With The Bends, you hear great acoustic guitars, Thom at his best-sounding vocals, and a very enjoyable album. Melodic, which is lacking so much lately. I suggest you buy it.
0679879269|5.0|It's rare that an author can pull a series together in the end, and have a happy ending, yet, not one that is not fairy tale, everything as perfect as can be. Pullman managed to do this, and I respect and enjoyed this conclusion to The His Dark Materials Collection even more because of it. This series had me hooked from the very start, Pullman never writing a word that would not be crucial to the plot at a later point, and drawing it to a conclusion that made me cry, but left me satisfied in the end.  This is not a series for the easily offended, because as you can see, some feel it is a bash on Christiany, (I didn't feel that at all however) but if you do read it with an open mind, you will not be dissapointed.
B00005A46T|1.0|Why? Just why? On their debut, they showed some promise that would have been worth hype of their album. Everything is either the same or worse. Unlike the first album which you could tell what Corey was saying, now you only hear screams that don't sound like words. Also, the guitar riffs are pretty pathetic also. It's all \\"lets play the same chords over and over again so we'll sound HEAVY\\". This is the biggest blunder of the year. What also amazes me is that there's 9 people, yet a title is \\"People=Sh*t\\". First of all, the title shows you that this album was just made for screams. Secondly, their songwriting wasn't so bad on their first album like this one. All pointless themes. I'd rather pick up System of a Down or Rob Zombie than this. Although not quite as bad as Drowning Pool's debut, I can't stand it. However, don't be surprised if you see many teenagers who like to listen to music in \\"volume 11\\" formula. Watch 20 years from now, then you'll be trashing this (...).
0792156684|1.0|I can't believe that this is the most popular movie of all time...  The fact that this movie won eleven Oscars is the real American tragedy. ...This movie is right down there with The Matrix and Gone With The Wind.  Leonardo di Caprio is the \\"star\\", Kate Winslet is the \\"body\\", and James Cameron is the \\"mastermind\\" behind this whole debacle.  This is another example of cheap Hollywood commercialism.  How many times are movies going to exploit great tragedies...?  The only good part about this movie is that Leo dies.  But even that's a jip because his death isn't nearly as painful as three and a half hours of this movie.  If there's one movie that I'd destroy forever, this is it.
B0000027RL|4.0|Pearl Jam showed us how great of a grunge rock band they were in their early days with Ten. This is one of my three favorite PJ albums, as I don't really care for the rest. Just about every song here is known from the official alt-rock crowd, and this helped the genre get more modern rock stations. The singles &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, and &quot;Once&quot; are all highly known and are singles from this album. This is more of an album feel than a singles feel, a good thing. Shows a big '70s influence, but in completely different ways then Nirvana managed with any of their albums. Lately all their 2000 bootlegs have been released and not enough time for another album released, but this one is more mainstream, and definitely more mainstream than the indie Binaural. There are so much classic riffs on this album, and a hard album to be forgotten or missed. As I said, listeners of grunge, alt. rock of the '90s and rock stations probably do own this. Worth it, too.
0792844890|5.0|Anyone who didn't laugh through this movie needs to check for a pulse.  This hilarious Star Wars parody is one of the brightest comedic gems of all time.  This movie has SO many memorable lines (&quot;Go back to then.&quot; &quot;Then?&quot; &quot;Now.&quot; &quot;Now?&quot; &quot;Now.&quot; &quot;I can't.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;We missed it.&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;Just now.&quot;  &quot;When will then be now?&quot; &quot;Soon.&quot;) and scenes (the Planet of the Apes parody) that it a classic.  Anyone who disagrees should go back and see this movie again.
0385505833|5.0|An extremely funny look at how Christmas really has gotten out of hand.  It makes you think of how much you really spend on gifts and that perfect outfit for the holiday office party.  Luther and Nora are the typical couple who decide to skip Christmas and take a cruise.  A real pick me up in light of recent events and it is laugh out loud funny.  A great gift for the hard to buy for person.  Even if you are not an avid reader let this be the first book you have read in years. A very quick read at 175 pages you can read it in one sitting.  If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, get the CD verssion for your road trip.  That's what I am doing for my parents.  A real change for Grisham who usually rights legal drama.  What a perfect book for the holiday season........I have to go shopping now......BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005OAJ1|5.0|THIS CD IS GOD! BUY IT NOW OR LEE WILL COME AND FIND YOU!
B000002N1E|5.0|Of the horribly inconsistent albums Prince released throughout the 90s, he achieved gold with 1995's \\"The Gold Experience\\".  This 18-track opus takes us through his \\"experience\\" with the aid of a female NPG Operator as our guide.  It's a return to the old Prince we enjoyed and here's why:<br />The songwriting:<BR>Divided into four of Prince's favorite subjects: sex, love, deception, and self-knowledge.  The album starts with the raunchy but inventive gutter feminist lyrics of \\"P Control\\".  In \\"319\\", pinup photo shoots never sounded more erotic yet puerile.  He also shows that he hasn't lost his caring romantic side in \\"Shhh\\" and in the hit single \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In the World\\".  In \\"Billy Jack B---h\\" and the ballad \\"I Hate U\\" Prince becomes a misogynist, denouncing his women for being unfaithful.  The social-political awareness in \\"We March\\" and the mundane metaphors in \\"Dolphin\\" are a tad cliché, but the songwriting overall is wonderful.<br />The music:<BR>While I admit that it's not musically groundbreaking, it was up-to-date for a mid-90s album.  The tracks are mostly uptempo rock and R&amp;B numbers.  But the best part about this album is that Prince once again does his killer guitar solos in each song.  The electric guitar solos in the high-octane \\"Endorphinmachine\\" and \\"I Hate U\\" are awesome.  Other favorites include the guitar portion of \\"Dolphin\\" and the horn and bass in \\"Billy Jack B---h\\".  Production-wise, it's Prince at his finest since \\"Sign O' the Times\\" and even funkier than the \\"Love-Symbol Album\\".<br />The vocals:<BR>Prince sings, he yells, he raps (effectively in \\"P Control\\" and \\"Now\\") he screams to the top of his lungs like a woman, he's full of energy.  You could tell he had a great time recording this album.<br />It's shocking that this album was such a commercial failure despite being a critical hit.  And it's even more unfortunate that most music stores don't carry TGE anymore, it's a must-have from his 90s work.  Prince is a musical genius and icon stuck in his own self-indulgence; hopefully he'll someday have that drive again to create another album as consistent as this one.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is a great album!  My favorite tracks are &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, and the fabulous &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; and soon to be your favorites.  If you are a fan of Britney, you will not be disappointed.  Britney's music just gets better and better.  Pick up a copy of this album.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I first heard of Sade back in 1984 on a music program called Top 40 Videos. They were showing the song that began her western exposure called Hang on to Your Love. It was very silky and soulful. But it was Smooth Operator that made her a chart topping success. Her exposure lead to a singing role in the musical flop (but guilty pleasure nonetheless) Absoulte Beginners where she performed a jazzy number called Killer Blow. Sade is truly a musician with a gift. Her voice is enchanting and the lyrics are inviting. The Greatest Hits CD has a lot of great numbers and none of them are too harsh for the ears. Like many musicians who hit it big in the 80s and early 90s, Sade has sadly been demoted to adult contemporary and smooth jazz radio playlists. This music is perfect for mellowing out or cuddling with another. Sade is a classy lady with a lot on her mind, which she puts in her music. No doubt about it, this CD is king.
B00000DR5I|5.0|I adore this album. The two tracks presented are almost mirror images of each other. Part one opens with gentle, sporadic organ sounds but then suddenly opens out into a heavenly wash of sweeping synthesizer chords, with what sounds like a seagull crying overhead. This eventually fades into Part one's central &quot;sequencer&quot; section. Motivic, repetitive, and pulsing. Building repeatedly to small climaxes. This kind of music first appeared on side 1 of 1974's Phaedra. It's as though TD realized that side 1 of Phaedra was infinitely better than side 2, and tried to correct this by making a more rounded album in Rubycon. Part one ends with a haunting, eerie motionless section, setting the scene for part 2.<br />Part two begins with some of the most generically frightening music TD ever produced. Wailing synths rise and fall in pitch, giving the feeling of being inside a haunted house at a fair. Soon the synth sound is replaced by human voices in a demonic choral section that takes you out of the funfair and somewhere far darker! This music puts shivers up your spine if you're listening after dark with the lights out. Then comes part two's central &quot;sequencer&quot; section. Much darker than that in part one, but also much more syncopated. This is the &quot;dark side&quot; to part one's &quot;light side&quot;. Just when all seems hopeless however part two fades into one of the most beautiful endings to any of their albums, a gentle dreamlike wash of sound and harmony reminiscent of the beginning of part one (although musically very different). <br />So there it is. Tangerine Dream's most perfect album? In my opinion it quite possibly is. It is the only time that they have ever created an album that plays like a symphony, in that both movements are well structured and work well separately. Yet when heard together they form a wonderful journey into the heart of darkness. And back.
B00000JNO2|4.0|Die CD ist schon alleine anschaffenswert wegen dem Titelsong &quot;Gimme back my bullets&quot;, meiner Ansicht der beste Song der Gruppe nach &quot;Sweet home Alabama&quot;. Obwohl im Gegensatz zu letzteren kein Single-Hit gewesen, konnte man ihn um 1978 häufig in Musikzusammenstellungen im Radio in Deutschland hören. Besonders das wehmütige Keyboard gefällt mir an diesem Song, etwas mehr Keyboard hätte vielleicht auch manchem anderen Song der Band gut bekommen.<br />Die anderen Tracks sind auch recht gut, besonders &quot;Searching&quot;. Anschaffenswert sind auf jeden Fall noch das Live Doppel Album &quot;One more from the Road&quot; und &quot;Second Helping&quot; und &quot;nothing fancy&quot;.
B000002HPV|5.0|First of all, there is nothing that can be said about this album that will do it justice.  Homogenic has become so integral to me that I hesitate to write a &quot;review&quot; - so I'll call it My Experience Closing My Eyes and Being Taken Over by Beauty.  Even from the first time I heard it I was blown away.  I'm writing this because I feel that if more people listened to Bjork's work, people's expectations of music would be heightened, thus resulting in a decrease of the boring, transparent fluff which always seems to dominate the industry.<BR>There are ten overwhelming tracks on Homogenic, ranging from slow, weaving ballads to raw, defiant, screaming on top of harsh techno beats.  You'll hear strange and unusal sounds all throughout the album that will tease your ears under her *Venus* voice, such as something that sounds like a cat purring(?) and a koto or a zither (?) in &quot;All is Full of Love&quot;.  The keyboard sounds at the beginning of &quot;5 Years&quot; remind me of early video games.  &quot;5 Years&quot; begs to be played at the loudest volume possible, by the way.  There is also an accordian and an organ scattered about on a few tracks.  The main sound is a combo of strings and electronica.  While the percussion is rhythmically uncomplicated, Bjorks singing is always playing around the beat.<BR>       Musically it's a dark, kinetic album.  Lyrically, it tells stories that takes you on journeys of love, confusion, and more.  Dark, yet playful is Bjork. &quot;The devil collects it, with a grin, our love, in a ball of yarn.&quot;<BR>Get this album if you are ready for something intense and hopefully, personal.  Highest recommendation.
B000002P74|4.0|Mit &quot;Sweet home alabama&quot; wurde ich Mitte der Siebziger Jahre auf die Band aufmerksam. Es dauerte lange, bis ich durch das Radio den Bandnamen &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot; erfuhr. Der erste Song ist natürlich der mit Abstand beste und populärste, was die Gruppe je gemacht hat. Ich glaube, es gibt auf der Welt keine Person, die ihn nicht aus dem Radio kennt, fast jedem (außer Neil Young?) gefällt ihm, so mitreißend ist er.<br />Außerdem besticht das bluesige und traurige &quot;Ballad of Curtis Low&quot; und &quot;Needle and the Spoon&quot;. Der Charakter der Platte ist bluesig und typischer Südstaaten Sound. Auch das Cover und die Bilder sind gelungen, besonders &quot;far out&quot; sieht Ed King aus mit seinem Hut, gutes Foto. Der Mann, der bald die Gruppe verließ, hat übrigens das bekannte Gitarrenwerk von &quot;Sweet Home&quot; komponiert.<br />Die Gruppe war um Ende der Siebziger sehr beliebt in Deutschland. Das war eigentlich ein Qualitätsbeweis für Lynyrd Skynyrd. Die Zeit um 1975-78 war wohl nicht die Sternstunde der modernen Musik: Die alten Gitarrenorientierten Gruppen wie Led Zeppelin, Bachman Turner Overdrive wollte niemand mehr hören und waren aus der Mode. Jeder, der Erfolg haben wollte, mußte seinen Tribut an den Disco-Sound leisten, der die Hitparade 1975 schlagartig veränderte. &quot;Young Americans&quot; von David Bowie oder &quot;Miss You&quot; von den Rolling Stones sind nicht unbedingt das beste, was diese beiden Stars gemacht haben ...<br />Und da kommt plötzlich Lynyrd Skynyrd mit einem Image wie zu alten Hippie-Tagen: Extrem lange Haare (Die Fotos von Artymus Pyle!), Lange Bärte wie MC-Clubs (der Bassist Leon oder Ed King) und ein harter gefühlvoller Südstaaten Sound der auf drei Gitarren aufgebaut ist. Die Gruppe war wirklich super, ihre Musik klang sehr ehrlich und geradeheraus ...<br />Die CD ist unbedingt anzuschaffen, weiterhin &quot;One more from the Road&quot; (eine der besten Live Doppel LPs der Siebziger mit &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, &quot;Slade Alive&quot; oder &quot;Alive (Ramones)&quot;, weiterhin &quot;Gimme Back my Bullets&quot; und eine Platte mit unveröffentlichten Aufnahmen, die ca. 1980 herauskam ...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento, though under-rated and not popular, was possibly one of the best films of the year 2000.  Guy Pearce plays Leanord, a confused, but earnest man who's sole purpose in life is to find his wife's murderer.  His handicap--the disability to form new memories--severely impares his search for the murderer.  He doesn't know where he is, he doesn't know how he got there, but he does know what he wants to do next.  So Leanord gets tattoos and writes notes to remind himself who he's searching for and important things that he has discovered.  &quot;It's like waking up,&quot; he tells people who ask what it's like.  Leanord's major problem in the search is the people he meets.  His &quot;buddies&quot; take advantage his memory-loss, and Lenny falls for it sometimes.  Natalie could just be using him to kill Teddy.  Teddy could just be using him to kill Natalie's husband.  What makes this movie so interesting is that contrary to most omnipotent audiences, the audience for this film does not know what's going on.  We know as much as Leanord, if not less.  This film leaves everything up to our own reasoning skills.  Nothing is solid.  &quot;The memory is an interpretation, not a record.&quot;  In the end, we don't even know if Lenny has the right reason for this search; does his wife live or die?  <BR>      To top off this confusion, the movie is completely backwards (except for sporadic B&amp;W clips).  The ending is already known, it is the beginning that this movie is searching for.  Along with the plot, the cinematography is superb.  With bone-chilling images of his wife's murder, and records of Leanord's distorted memory, the camera really conveys Leanord's deep confusion.  I recommend this to any film-noir lovers!  If you're sick of seeing movies like American Pie and Scary Movie, Memento is a fresh change of pace.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Why are people giving this DVD three star ratings?  I realize the situation with needing to have a PC for the games, but SHREK deserves more than that!  I also heard a review(s) saying that the language was another reason.  Not to offend people, but I am currently in 8th grade, and even the 6th and 5th graders have heard MUCH worse language and humor than in SHREK.  Now to the actual content of the movie....<BR>It was unbelievable how different the movie was than what I thought it would be, despite how my friend tried to convince me.  I saw it with her though, and was completely surprised!  The storyline is not run-of-the-mill, and the actors seemed born to play their roles.  At first I couldn't get over SHREK having a British accent, but then it seemed as if it was one of the most natural things in the world.  Of course you know that Donkey is going to be quite a humorous character because of Eddie Murphy speaking him, but Mike Myers still becomes the real star of the movie.  Usually in movies that are based off of fairy tales the creators make the heroine helpless and dependent on the hero.  I enjoyed Princess Fiona because of her fiery self, and her independence.  Lord Farquaad was my favorite character because (as I heard in the DVD) of all the creatures he was throwing out of Duloc, he would consider himself one of those people!  He just can't get over how great he thinks he is, and him being so short gives the movie more humorous gags.  <BR>All in all this is a great movie, and I believe everyone would be better off seeing it.
B00003CXRP|1.0|Anything you can imagine happening on a deserted island, that's what.  Very predictable and, while I think Tom Hanks is great, this is just him being Tom Hanks on a tropical island, so what if he gained weight and grew his hair out for the role?  Sorry, but I just found this movie irritating. Don't get me started about Helen Hunt - talk about lack of chemistry.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is my new favorite film.  It's filled with dancing, music, and color.  The actors did an awesome job aswell.  It was a great suprise to find that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing.  I was very impressed.  I would recommend this movie to anyone,  especially those involved in music,  theatre,  and drama.  I also recommend the soundtrack.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek was a fantastic movie. The animation was superb, I even forgot sometimes that it was animation. The storyline was hilarious and the music was great, Will see it many times over,
0440224764|4.0|I thought that The Partner was an entertaining novel.  It is about the scheme of Patrick Lanigan.  He fakes his own death to steal 90 million dollars from his old firm.  Patrick then moves to Brazil and changes his name.  Patrick meets a woman and falls in love.  Patrick's life is going great, or so he thought.<br />Four years later, Patrick's past catches up with him and he is brutally tortured.  He is then delivered back to the United States were he soon becomes a famous man.  He finds himself a lawyer and attempts to drop all the charges on him.  Patrick's freedom relies on the truth, what really happened.<br />If you enjoy a good story, then you will enjoy this book.  It isn't really action-packed, but it has a good plot.  I wasn't particularly fond of the ending.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This album is pure perfection! The sound quality is awesome! They really did a good job on making it one continious mix, I was a littled worries about this but they did a great job, and the song that wasnt on the wasll album is great, I had hearf it before but didnt really pay attention to it and now that I have it blows me away! The barret songs are a lot better quality wise! I reccommend every person in the world to buy this album!
B00003CY0V|4.0|This is one of those films that do some things really well and others terribly.  The story is a slick action techno-thriller, although it is not particularly original.  It is essentially \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" meets \\"The Matrix\\".  A mysterious cyber terrorist known as Gabriel (John Travolta) is recruiting renowned hackers to pilfer $9.5 billion from a secret fund of a long defunct FBI black ops group.  Stanley (Hugh Jackman) is a brilliant hacker, recently busted and forbidden to touch a computer as part of his parole.   He is lured into the plan because he is promised that he will be able to be reunited with his daughter, whom he is prevented from seeing by court order.  The sticky part is that to access the network, they must commandeer a computer in the World Banc which requires taking over the bank and holding hostages while Stanley does his magic.  The plot has a number of surprises as it twists along, keeping the viewer thinking and engaged, although it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief in many parts.<br />Joel Silver (of \\"Lethal Weapon\\", \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Matrix\\" fame) produced this film, so it was a given that it would push the envelope on action and pyrotechnics.  He hired Dominic Sena to direct, still juiced from his success in \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds\\".  Clearly Sena brings great enthusiasm for the action genre, which was responsible for putting him on the map.  From that standpoint, the film is a complete success.  The action sequences are intense and the visual effects are outstanding, including explosions in panoramic slow motion and a flying bus.  Sena also does a good job developing the characters, peeling away Gabriel's motivation slowly and keeping the viewer guessing as to whether he is good or evil.  I was also impressed with Sena's visual interpretations, giving us interesting angles, rich blends of color and extremely innovative lighting.<br />On the unfortunate side, we have the shameless sexploitation of Halle Berry and other female characters for the sole purpose of pumping up the box office with the 18-45 male demographic.  We are insulted with such unrealistic scenes as Stanley trying to break into the DOD computers in 60 seconds while being fellated and having a gun to his head.  Berry is forced to do a completely gratuitous frontal topless scene (twice), and numerous scenes in various states of undress to land a role where most of her best lines involved references to the male organ.  I have no problem with explicit sex if it bears some relationship to the story, but this was unabashed objectification of women, having no reason for being there other than titillation.<br />Another thing I found particularly ironic was Travolta's opening dialogue discussing the lack of realism in Hollywood films within a film that in many ways typifies the very aspects of filmmaking he is reviling.  I'm not sure whether Sena and Silver were poking a little fun at themselves here or just didn't realize that this film really didn't differentiate itself from the criticism.<br />From an acting perspective, John Travolta finally re-enters his own body after two consecutive abominations (\\"Battlefield Earth\\", \\"Lucky Numbers\\") where he seemed to be inhabited by some nefarious being with no acting ability.  Travolta returns to his brilliant bad guy form reminiscent of \\"Face Off\\" and \\"Broken Arrow\\", only here he is even bolder, more arrogant and utterly remorseless.  Hugh Jackman turns in his best performance to date as the cyber jock.  Jackman exudes maleness without sacrificing the softer side as seen in the touching scenes with his onscreen daughter Holly (eleven year old Camryn Grimes).  Jackman also gives a virtuoso performance trying to crack the government system in a scene where he is the equivalent of Jerry Lee Lewis on a computer keyboard.<br />Don Cheadle turns in another solid performance as the FBI assistant director.  Cheadle always impresses me with his dramatic skills.  Hopefully he will land some meatier roles.  Finally, there's Halle Berry.  Berry is a skilled and beautiful actress who has a lot more talent to offer than was tapped by this film.  Here she only had to be sexy and talk trash, the first being automatic and the second requiring no special skill.  It is a pity that she is relegated to parts such as this and her role in \\"X-Men\\" to get work after turning in such a brilliant dramatic performance in \\"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\\".<br />This film features some promising direction by Sena, excellent performances by Travolta and Jackman and some top flight action sequences, but suffers from a derivative and overly fantastic story and a profusion of sexual non sequiturs.  However, even with its drawbacks I rated it a 7/10.  Action junkies will definitely get their money's worth.
B00005MM83|5.0|at the end of the very first scene (played in reverse), my friend and i looked at each other, jaws agape, and thought simulataneously &quot;this is going to rock.&quot;<br />this is one of the most original, well directed, and well written movies i've ever seen.<br />this is the kind of movie where you have to watch more than once - not because its confusing (which i suppose it can be if you dont pay attention), but because of the close attention to detail that the director put into the film. obviously there is the progression of picture taking/caption writing, and his facial wounds. but look closer:  one of the first things i noticed watching the movie was that the car gets a little cleaner in each time jump. little things like that add so much to the overall effect.<br />walking out of the theater, i decided that it automatically made my top 10 list of coolest movies ever.<br />i recommend that everyone at least rent it; it was absolutely fantastic.
B00004YW6I|2.0|because I have always been a huge fan of PJ Harvey.  But I was bitterly disappointed by this album. The only two songs I like are 'Good Fortune' and 'This Mess We're In'.  Unlike all the other music on this album, they sound like songs where all the parts actually come together, and they each capture a feeling in the way only PJ can.  They have the feel of PJ moving forward, hanging on to that essential PJ-ness, but creating new styles, new sounds.  Unfortunately that can't be said for the rest of this ultra-bland album.<br />Previously PJ's sound was uniquely hers. Now she sounds like any female rock singer.  I am not a fan of this brand of blah-rock... deep female voice over slow tempo crunching guitars.  Once PJ Harvey's music seemed to use rock to propel an amazing expression of feminine longing and scorn, and original diverse melodies sung with a vulnerable rawness.  Her lyrics were genius, capturing all avenues of the female psyche and heart in a way Alanis could only dream of.  On this album they are banale and self-indulgent.  There are still occassional glimpses of her mastery with words, but unfortunately there are also some lyrics that are just plain awful.<br />It feels as though the quest for art in her music has been abandoned, and she has instead settled for just singing about whatever she's doing or feeling.  That is the difference that struck me here.  On the album Dry, each is an amazing song in itself.  On this one, she is just singing.  Albeit with her amazing voice.  But even that is hard to listen to over dreary and unappealling chord arrangements.<br />That critics could praise this astounds me, and especially that they compare it to Dry.  It is missing that spark, the wit, the genius of Dry.  It makes me wonder if they ever heard that in the first place, or if they ever appreciated the story-telling perfection of her lyrics. I can only postulate that all they heard in Dry was a fabulous voice over a guitar sound they like.  It seems impossible to me to liken the two works if you have an appreciation for what really made Dry so great.ible to me to liken the two works if you have an appreciation for what really made Dry so great.
B00003CXXI|1.0|Allow me to make my point right off the bat - i HATED this movie.<br />it was horribly predictable, trite to degrees that i had not had the displeasure of witnessing until then, and most importantly - it WAS NOT FUNNY.<br />ok, predictability isn't a huge deal: lets face it, its a kids movie. there aren't going to be plot twists to deal with. but come on, didn't everyone see the whole hackneyed 'moral' coming a mile away? the whole judging a book by its cover/beauty is in the eye of the beholder theme is horribly overused and resolution was pretty apparent from the start. it was just a matter of sitting and groaning through the tripe that led up to the end.<br />why does everyone think this movie was funny? it WASNT. AT ALL. and before everyone starts getting upset about having no sense of humor, or relaxing because its a kids movie, i'd like to say that i liked Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Chicken Run (and all of the Wallace and Gromit movies), and absolutely LOVED Toy Story 2. honestly, when i went to see TS2, i was like &quot;ok, it'll be cute like the first one.&quot; much to my surprise (and delight) i was stomach hurt from laughing so much. i was rolling in the aisle. it was an absolutely marvelous movie.<br />but shrek wasn't funny. at. all.<br />scratch that, the only remotely funny parts were not the sexual innuendos, but the fact that when shrek made the innuendos, the rest of the characters didn't get it. example: <br />shrek (looking at the prince's tower): do you think he's making up for something? *wink* *wink*<BR>other characters: what?<br />that was a little funny. but everything else? NO!! the jokes weren't funny and eddie murphy was just annoying.<br />so please please PLEASE wake up! this movie was terrible!
B000001E7T|4.0|After saying terrible things about 'Stories From the City...,' I had to review this album to proclaim my love for PJ at her best.  I always think of this album as being the most perfect expression of femininity.  Not femininity washed down and sugarcoated, but the true essence of being female.  Loving, yearning, strong, angry, desperate, passionate. More honest than 'ballsy' expressions of women trying to show they're as strong 'as a man' - simply all woman.<br />C'mon Billy and Down By the Water are my favourites.  The Dancer is also very beautiful.  There are a few songs that can be a bit grating, and are not the type you hear to at any time, but are still interesting to listen to.
0345363132|5.0|I came across this book purely by accident at local yard sale.  Being a fan of Shakespeare's &quot;Richard III,&quot; I was intrigued by the author's assertion that Richard was not the much-maligned hunchback who killed his nephews. I ended paying 25 cents for a well-worn book with no cover, and it was the best investment I ever made in a book!  The action and story catch you from page one, and the plot moves at a great pace with only a few minor bogged down areas.  By the end of the book, I was a convert.  I fully believed the author's assertions that Richard's history was maligned by successors who were trying to cement their control in England.  I've purchased a new copy since and have passed it on to several friends.  BUY BUY BUY!

B00003CXC6|4.0|This film is famous for portraying the same crime from the point of view of the three people involved plus a witness.  In fact, the word &quot;Rashomon&quot; has actually come to mean a situation in which different accounts of the same story vary wildly.  WHAT IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED is the framing device used to narrate and comment on these different versions of the incident.  Strangers taking refuge in a temple from a rainstorm relate the four stories and wax philosophic on the nature of humanity.  These scenes definitely become preachy at times, but they're completely necessary.  Without them, it's a gimmicky movie about memory and the subjective quality of experience.  With them, it's about the nature of humanity and our hope for the future.  Also the temple scenes are a needed buffer between the flashbacks.<BR>About the acting, as many have noted, the actors in the flashbacks DO do a caricature of their own roles.  What many here seem to have missed is that this is on purpose to exaggerate each storyteller's viewpoint and to change the tone in each account.  As a counterpoint, the actors in the present are almost overly somber.<BR>A twist at the end in the temple reminded me of the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It actually struck me as a bit too deux-ex-machina, but Rashomon will always be a classic, and deservedly so.

B000003BEM|5.0|Beggars Banquet, the last album with all 5 original members. The 1st of the so-called &quot;big four albums&quot; wich includes Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile On Main Street. This album is perfection. It has the power to cool you out or get you rocking. Beggars Banquet is by far, one of the greatest sounding albums of all time.<br />The 1st track, Sympathy For the Devil, is simply marvilous. Many felt the title meant devil worshipping and forever sealed the Rolling Stones fate of being Devil worshipers. But in this song, it is clear that mankind is the devil. This song has the best bass ever, the greatest solo ever, and the greatest lyrics ever. Mick's singing of &quot;I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for 10 decades, for the Gods they made&quot; is really haunting. <br />No Expectations and Dear Doctor are great blues/country songs that the Stones pull of very well. Parachute Woman is great with Keith and Brian doing some outstanding guitar work. JigSaw Puzzle is absoulutely beautiful. Mick's vocals are great and the lyrics, again, are fantastic. Street Fightin Man is a classic rock tune. It was originally titled &quot;Pay Your Dues&quot; with different lyrics. The lyrics were changed durring the London riots at the time. <br />Prodigal Son is one of the greatest blues songs you'll ever hear the Stones playing. I rate it higher than Little Red Rooster, and Love in Vain. Great beat, great guitar picking, Mick's vocals are absolutley spledid. Stray Cat Blues is excellent. It starts off with Keith's sporadically firing and some faint murmors by Mick, and Explodes when Mick starts singing. You'll be singing to it even if you don't know the lyrics. <br />Factory Girl is probley the weakest of the songs here (greater live versions do exist, particularly on Flashpoint), but it is still very listenable. Then it ends with a little recognition from Mick and Keith to the &quot;hard working people&quot;. It starts off with Keith's vocals for the 1st verse, and Mick singing the rest with Keith's backing vocals audible.<br />Overall, this is one of the greatest ablums ever, by the Rolling Stones, or any other group. Mick, Keith, Brian, Bill, and Charlie manage to pull their wait around quite effectively. I have a sever tendency to skip forward to the next track, but with this album, I can listen to the whole thing from Sympathy For the Devil, to Salt of The Earth and still have a big smile on my face. Thank You Mick, Keith, Brian, Bill and Charlie for blessing us with such a great album.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is Britney's best album ever. She was very smart in going the more r&amp;b/pop way instead of sticking to bubblegum pop. She is growing and so are her fans and you can tell in her songs. My personal favs are: &quot;overprotected&quot;,&quot;anticipating&quot;,&quot;let me be&quot;, &quot;that's where you take me&quot;, and of course &quot;slave4u&quot;. Some songs could have been left off like &quot;lonely&quot; and &quot;what's it's like to be me&quot; but overall excellent. Some of her younger fans might be disapointed in the change for there are no childish songs like &quot;soda pop&quot; or &quot;lucky&quot; on the cd. If your 16 to 21 you'll love it!! i know i'm about to listen to it now....

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is the sory of a general named Maximus. (...)Russel Crowe was great with his ability to be calm one minute and be enraged the next. Joaquin Phoenix plays emporor Commidus and does and great job counter-acting maximus. (...) I liked the gladiator named Juba his frendship with maxiumus really helps move the movie along. The Coliseum looks great amd up to scale. Walking through the \\"streets of Rome\\" was great because it really did show the spectacle of gladiator game back then.<br />(...)Oliver Reed who sadly died during the making gave a nice preformance has the sort of ringleader of the gladiators. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was a little anonying at times. and Connie Neilsien looks beautiful as Commidus's sister Lucilla.<br />People blast this movie because it is historically inaccurate. thats nonsense if you want to learn about true history watch the history channel! Yuo go to the movie snd by dvds to be entertained and gladiator gives you that and more.
B00005OWIU|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!<br />I have read all four books-Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azcaban, and Goblet of Fire.  When I first heard that they were doing a movie for the first book, I went on the internet and found as much info and pics as I could find.  I did. Then I watched the first trailer, then when the 2nd came out, I watched that, and when the third came out not to long ago, I watched that.  Then I started seeing scenes on TV.  Then I heard that they were coming out with a soundtrack.  I was pleased.  I went on the internet (...) and found info on the soundtrack and listened to bits and pieces of te songs.  Then I went to this website and someones review said to go to (...) to listen to the first 30 seconds of each song.  I did.  I loved each song.  My faavorite was Hedwig's Theme.  I liked Voldemort song because you could tell the scene in which this song is played is dark and spooky.  All of the songs are great.  Most of them are calm and soothing songs.  I don't have the cd but I have neard bits of each song and think it is great!!!!!!!!  (...)  I have kept all of the newspaper articles about Harry Potter.

B00005JKHP|5.0|I'm going out on a weak limb here, teetering above the highly opinionated legions of Star Trek fans and definitively calling Robert Wise's \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture The Directors Addition\\" the finest of the Star Trek cinematic offerings.  Before you reach for your mouse in disgust, consider the following:<br />As most Star Trek fans know, \\"The Motion Picture\\", was a rushed affair at best, upgraded from a new television series to a $40,000,000 feature film designed to cash in on the success of \\"Star Wars\\".  Behind the scenes in 1979, it became clear that the original special effects unit hired by Paramount would not be able to deliver a single optical shot in a film with 500 such planned shots.  Enter Douglas Trumbull (\\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Silent Running\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\") and John Dykstra (\\"Star Wars\\".)  They have nine months to complete all of the optical effects for a non-negotiable December release date.  Trumbull and Dyktra's previous films are wildly different from each other and yet they combine their talents, handling the parts of the picture they are best suited to.  Dyktra's group does the terrific opening sequence of the Klingon Battle Cruisers being wiped out.  In contrast, Trumbull's group handles the poetic Enterprise inspection by Kirk and Scotty.  Not only do they complete the picture, but they also deliver some of the most astonishing visuals in the pre-computer era.<br />Many fans and critics were not kind to the film, saying the effect sequences occupy too much screen time at the expense of character development.  I disagree.  The exploration of Spock's quest for perfect logic and Kirk's obsession with the Enterprise, provide far more intriguing story telling than the later films. The central theme of a machine reaching consciousness and possessing all the secrets of the universe, but needing a human element to evolve is deeper stuff than 90 percent of other Hollywood offerings claiming to be Science Fiction.  The director's addition wisely trims some of the optical sequences. As director Wise states in the commentary, of the 60 plus films he has directed, Star Trek was the only one released without audience preview response.  The audience would have demanded more character and less special effects.<br />Additionally as Director Wise also states in the DVD commentary, the starship Enterprise is as central a character as Kirk and Spock.  I think this is an important point often neglected in the later films.  We see vast portions of the ship, from the engine room to the redesigned bridge.  I would argue that the subdued lighting of the bridge, and other interiors, give the best feeling of any of the films that we are on a huge star ship hurtling through space.  Some of the orange upholstered box furniture is a little dated, but over-all the production design holds up well.  Also, in this film you get the feeling of a complex machine bustling with critical human activity.  In the later films you get the felling that 10 people run the ship.  <br />Star Trek TMP is really the only true \\"hard\\" science fiction offering of the series.  It has much more in common with Stanley Kubrick's brilliant \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" than \\"Star Wars\\".  2001 is a superior film, but at least in this Star Trek I don't find myself cringing with some foolish time travel plot or comical villain.  All the concepts are firmly grounded in science and Isaac Asimov is even listed in the credits as an advisor.  The V'Ger craft still manages to provoke a 2001 like awe and I love the surreal leering mouth, and eyes during the V'ger fly-over.<br />Now to the DVD directors cut.  Wise's new cut is a much tighter and more enjoyable film.  This film has the best cinematography and production design of any of the series.  The visual transfer is superb and the new 5.1 sound Dolby Digital sound mix totally immerses you in the film.  As in the original, Gerry Goldsmiths score is terrific.  The new effect shots are almost indistinguishable from the original film. In contrast I found the added shots in the special addition \\"Star Wars\\" distracting.  The new shots in Star Trek are designed to complete concepts in a rushed film.  The new approach to the V'ger brain complex, the full V'ger exterior and the redesigned planet Vulcan sequence are high points.  The DVD extra's are enjoyable, particularly the commentary during the film by Wise, Trumbull, Dykstra, Goldsmith and actor Stephen Collins who plays Will Decker.  You get the feeling of what a difficult film it was to make.  Bob Wise recounts flying to the Washington DC premier with the still wet prints with him on the plane. <br />Forget the original theatrical release or the re-cut TV version.  Remember this is the only Star Trek film with Gene Roddenberry's personal attention and it shows.  The director's cut should be the final and definitive version of this film. This DVD should be a welcome addition to anyone's serious film collection. \\"The Human Adventure is Just Beginning.\\"
B00005QB9A|5.0|I origonally saw this film in Hong Kong and loved it.  But when I recommend it to others, it was like it didn't exsist.  The only place people could find it for rent was in Canada and Japan.<BR>  This movie should've been &quot;best pitcure&quot; of '98.  Not to mention it's supurb sound-track, wounderful set disigns, and great acting.
0553106635|5.0|I can't wait for the next one to come out.  This one was great.  It continues on the story of the Starks, Lannisters, Daenerys with her dragons, and everyone.  It keeps you on your toes and wanting more.  It keeps you guessing.  You get in to the characters and everyone almost seems real, so that when something happens, it'll either shock you, or make you happy.  A wonderful book.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was not just another sappy kids movie.  It's a promise that SHREK won't put you to sleep.  I think it did better than Monsters Inc which was also good but not as funny.  The graphics were excellent.  It's good for people young and old except for those who claim to have virgin ears.  I would reccommend this DVD to anyone who likes to laugh.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Before seeing this film I had read all the reviews saying how fantastic it was.  Well, it isn't fantastic, and anyone that describes it is fantastic is highly disturbed.  For this is one of the most gruelling things that I have ever had to sit through.  It is explicit, upsetting and totally unforgettable.  But fantastic?  Jurassic Park was fantastic, this is on a higher plain.<br />Although the film doesn't really have a message to it other than 'drugs are bad', it thankfully shows both the highs and the lows of the drugs.  This is in sharp contrast to other drugs movies such as 'The Basketball Diaries' that seems to consist almost totally of lows.  It also shows that ecstasy, heroin and cocaine aren't the only forms of drugs on the market.  For example, the same cut shots and editing are used when Harry shoots up as when his mother switches on the TV, eats or drinks her coffee.  The point being that there are plenty of legal drugs on the market that have an equally destructive effect.<br />Finally, the explicit nature of the film: I found myself squirming in my seat a couple of times and there's no doubt that there are some pretty horrific scenes here.  And as for the incredibly explicit sex scenes, it's difficult to call them exploitive when they so clearly show the degradation that the character has gone through to reach this stage.  This film is not for the weak-willed.  It is upsetting and mesmerising in its sheer grotesqueness.  Yet it is also an unforgettable, important piece of film-making.
B000000OQF|5.0|If you want real rock n'roll then look no further than this awesome CD.You got Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine,actually all the tracks are great. Oh, can't forget Paradise City.After you buy this get Use Your Illusion 1 and 2,Lies,Live Era, and Sphagetti Incident. There is no band like GN'R.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Considering the undeniably interesting and original premise (guy with no short term memory goes in search of wife's killer) and the film's rave reviews, its perhaps surprising that this film didn't do better.  But then again it didn't contain Hollywood superstars, and before anyone mentions Blair Witch, a hugely successful (and fake!) marketting scheme.  More importantly, it's an adults' movie, which of course means that it can never be a box office success.  Although maybe those times are changing with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia' doing so well.<br />Anyway, the movie itself is told backwards.  Here the end is the beginning, the audience gets to see who Pearce took his vengeance out upon, and we backtrack to the beginning to find out the real conclusion.  This twist is ingenious, but makes for frustrating viewing as you try to grasp what's going on whilst watching the action at the same time.  This is a must-see-twice movie if ever there was one.  The acting from every quarter is wonderful, hopefully setting up Guy Pearce as a major star .  Come on Hollywood, the rest of the stars of 'L.A Confidential' are doing well!  Carrie-Ann Moss proves that there's more to her than rubber suits and special effects and Pantoliano gives a magnificent turn as Teddy.<br />So what makes the movie special?  Well, it's intelligent for one.  There's a neat little subplot that tugs at the heart strings.  Plus the director manages to extend empathy towards all of his miserable characters, imbuing them with life rather than using his supporting cast as mere cardboard cut-outs to help make the lead look good.  But what is the film about?  Any number of things really.  It challenges its audience's ideas of memory and its reliability as well as showing just how bland and easily forgettable most of today's movie fodder is.  This is a film to end all films: it makes you think, cry, laugh and sit at the edge of your seat.

0316776963|1.0|From reading the reviews for this book it is clear that this book isn't funny to everybody. I was expecting at least a couple of laughs out of the 270 pages, but it never really happened. This book is written as an autobiography about someone to whom nothing significantly interesting happened in his entire life. The book is composed of banal anectodes that could happen to anybody but that nobody would ever think of writing a book about. The first part of the book is definitely not funny, whereas the second part is slightly better. I got this book as a present and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my own money on it. If you want to read a biography, read one about someone who lived an interesting life!
6305171769|5.0|This movie is definately the best sequel of them all. Updated but not over glamourised Halloween H20 manages to live up to the first film in its terror, shock and great casting. Has a great atmosphere all through out and keeps you hooked until the climatic ending!! Flashbacks and elements from the original make this movie even more juicy and terrifying. If its Halloween then you gotta expect Michael Myers to pay you a visit!!
0385505833|5.0|Great short story to read. Fast and good.
B00003CXN3|1.0|I rented this film because I had heard so many positive things about it and the cast list was incredible. Boy, was I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Traffic follows 3 different stories that are all circled around the topic of drugs. The only story I found interesting was the one about the daughter of Michael Douglas' character (I was so bored I didn't bother to catch any names), and that was the story they spent the least amount of time on. The rest of the time we are supposed to feel sorry for a bunch of murderous mexicans trying to smuggle heroine over the border who are torturing some assassin for no reason. Some other guy gets shot by another guy and then 30 minutes later he is trying to save his life. It makes no sense. This movie is vERY long, and very drawn out. The directing is horrible and the use of solid colors instead of real-technicolor (I.E. Yellow, Blue) is really annoying and pointless. You will never be more bored in your life. It was painful to sit through, and I was hoping the ending would pay off. But it didn't. I don't recommend this to anyone for any reason. To think I rented this over Leprechaun 2.
B000055ZB8|5.0|I bought &quot;Nosferatu&quot; on Halloween night, to screen a double-feature with &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;.  This turned out to be a terrific idea and caused me to wish, for the first time since childhood and my array of Star Wars costumes, that Halloween came eleven or twelve times a year.<br />&quot;Nosferatu&quot; may be 80 years old, but its influence is, amusingly enough, going to be eternal.  The &quot;Symphony of Horror&quot; special edition DVD is absolutely a must-have, with three audio tracks that basically create three different versions of the film, and with three excellent mini-features.<br />The basic audio track is an organ score derived from early-19th-century Romantic composers.  Married to the film's flickering tinted images, this makes ideal Halloween (or, indeed, any post-midnight) viewing.  The second audio score is more experimental, more modern, and much, much more fun.  Whereas the organ track basically lies underneath the movie and provides a traditional (if static) experience, the &quot;Silent Orchestra&quot; compositions give the undead film a new life.  This rock-jazz-classical track positively breathes in the way that Dracula never could.<br />The final audio track is the commentary by German film expert Lokke Heiss.  Don't be fooled by the man's voice and delivery, which is about as dynamic as balsa wood and interesting as an American cheese sandwich on white bread.  He cites both scholarly film treatises and Stephen King as he discusses Murnau's influences, the film's light-dark composition, and the use of mirrors and windows within the movie.  This is a terrific commentary track in that it increased my understanding of the move ten-fold.  Pity they couldn't have had someone with an actual voice (like Christopher Lee) read Mr. Heiss's words.<br />The featurettes range from cute to weird.  Weirdest is the &quot;Nosfera-Tour&quot;, ten minutes worth of home movies narrated once more by Heiss (oy vey) as he presents pictures ofwhat the film's &quot;Wisborg&quot; looks like in the year 2000.  The &quot;Phantom Carriage Ride&quot; is very eerie, spotlighting as it does one of the truly *bizarre* moments in the film.  Finally, the art/photo gallery is splendid, one of the best galleries I've seen on a DVD.  The real treasure comes at the beginnng -- the charcoal drawings that were producer Albin Grau's original renderings of Nosferatu.<br />The DVD packaging -- cardboard case with plastic snap -- may be cheap, but it contains within one of filmdom's finest moments, and provides far more than just 81 minutes of enjoyment.  Highly, highly recommended.
6302054982|5.0|Martin Scorsese has the unique talent of making a scene beautiful and disturbing at the same time. One sequence, probably one of the most memorable in all cinema history, is the \\"Layla\\" scene. For those who have seen it, no explanation is needed. What one sees on the screen is repulsive, disgusting, but at the same time, it is beautiful. The movie has too many cuss words and too much violence, but all of that can be forgetten because the director keeps such intensity that one is simply swept off their feet.
6305177473|5.0|The parent trap is a great movie for several reasons; just like the original movie the main caracter is played excellently by Lindsay Lohan. The other actors are of equally high standard, specially Elaine Hendrix as the bride to be and Lisa Ann Walters as the &quot;butler&quot; of the father. Lisa Ann Walters outclasses her predecessor in the 1961 movie. Director Nancy Meyers has a keen eye for detail which shows in scenes with some great nonverbal communication, for instance the conversation in the garden between Elaine Hendrix and Lindsay Lohan. Dennis Quaid is very convincing as a father with his legendary broad smile and Natascha Richardson is great as the british mother. Another aspect is the way some &quot;adult&quot; items like divorce and seperation are dealt with and yet arevery acceptable for kids. Very moving moments, like the moment Annie reveals her true identity to Chessie (Walters) are pared with hilarious reactions where Chessie shows her affection by offering in the midst of tears to cook something special, while at the same time not degrading the emotional content of that moment. The same goes for Hallie in London. The music is very functional and thanks to VHS a treat to listen to. Visuals are wonderful too. Elaime Hendrix has had the opportunity to play a much more sophisticated opponent making the movie more fun to watch. All in all a must see family movie, perfect for anybody.
B00005OM4N|5.0|When I heard Britney Spears had a new CD coming I thought it would be another teeny bopper like the previous two. Don't get me wrong I loved those CDs but it was time for Britney to get out of radio Disney for a while. This new CD brings her to a higher and more respectable level &quot;I'm a Slave for you&quot; simply describes her love and passion for music the rest of the songs show how much talent she's got. Even though she may not yell as loud as Christina or Jessica, Britney defenetly has the beat both of them are missing, so in other words Ms Spears has done it again!
B00000IAU3|5.0|This girl is sensational. I've read the other reviews comparing Dido to Sarah McLachlan, but in my opinion: She stands alone as a unique artist with an incredible soul to share with the world. Her lyrics are poetry, and the music has beat. &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Here with Me&quot; are just two great songs that we've heard around; but this entire album has the same bittersweet and heartfelt emotion. Clive Davis definitely had insight when he signed Dido up for Arista Records. I've listened to this album everyday since I ordered ordered the tape a few months ago, and I still haven't gotten tired of it.<br />I read other people's reviews and appreciate them, but never thought I'd write a review myself - until now. So take my opinion for whatever it's worth, but Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot; is worth the money and the all the hours of play that you can get out of the CD. <BR>Enjoy!
B00005NI5Y|4.0|&quot;Love and Theft&quot; is a big shock after 1997's &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; which made &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; look hopeful. With &quot;Love and Theft&quot; returns to the silly playful mood of &quot;Freewheelin' Dylan&quot; with the exception of &quot;Mississippi.&quot; &quot;Love And Theft&quot; is probably Dylan's best album musically since &quot;Oh Mercy.&quot; The musical style goes back to the roots of American music from blues to swing. &quot;Love and Theft&quot; features &quot;Mississippi&quot; which already I can say is one of Dylan's best songs up there with &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; and &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; It doesn't really fit the mood of the rest of album. It sounds like it belongs on &quot;Time Out Of Mind.&quot; When I first got the album, I just listened to the song over and over. It makes the rest of the album seem silly and a bit quirky. I would've liked to see a few more serious songs to balance the album out. Nonetheless, &quot;Love And Theft&quot; is well worth getting. It may not have a big message behind it like &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; but it has some awesome music on it and it's not so depressing.
B00004Y6RO|1.0|Okay, I know I am going to take a lot of ... for this review because legions of people follow this Des Moines band like mindless zombies willing to do their bidding. I liked Slipknot's idea about the masks the first time around, when it was called Insance Clown Posse. I did like wait and bleed, don't get me wrong or anything. I just have a hard time seeing why seeing a bunch of preppies in masks whinning about ... is so appealing. Bands like this are a dine a dozen, also if anyone has it read the Rolling Stone article they were on the cover of. I mean how arrogant is it to say \\"we rule your children, they do what we tell them to\\". Right there they wallow in the fact people love them for their total lack of talent. Now you can say this review wasn't helpful if you want, but remember Slipknot follower, the band ... and thats the bottom line.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Most of the songs sound the same, and there are too many of the same, and britney has a new vibe, thats horrible.  Britney, you gotta go back to the vibe you had on Oops I Did It Again.  Dont buy this cd, its not worth it.  Britney sounds horrible, and all the songs sound exactly the same.  The only good song is &quot;what its like to be me&quot;, otherwise the cd is horrible
0064409422|5.0|Death, that state of consciousness which seems to be most feared by men, often plays an important role in fantasy writing, albeit under various guises, as is evidenced by C. S. Lewis. In this book, Lewis presents the possibility and probability that Death may be Life, that Death may be Reality, that Death may be ALL.<BR>   In this tale, Lewis takes the very stuff of which Death is made and, by going beyond its form, on into its depths, sets it aright with all that is so that It, likewise, can be all that It is to all. In so doing, he allows each character to experience the wonders of Death and rebirth on his own level, according to his personal concepts, to his personal feelings, to his personal needs.<BR>   As viewed through Lewis's pen, Death is an &quot;adventure&quot; to which Lucy is attracted because of its depth, of its mystery, of its light, qualities which whet her curiosity.<BR>   Death is &quot;social justice,&quot; the law of the land, which requires punishment for transgressions perpetrated against authority, that law which is based upon &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot; This leads to an understanding of the Law of Karma, which states that each person is responsible for the results of his actions and must suffer the consequences.<BR>   Death is &quot;food for pride&quot; in the heart of the White Witch, whose very life is dependent upon the obedience of her subjects who must not question her commands.<BR>   Death is &quot;self-sacrifice&quot; in the redemption of Edmund by Aslan, who understands well the cosmic law of Cause and Effect and who, more than all, knows of Death's illusion.<BR>   Death is &quot;liberation&quot; for the citizens of Narnia, liberation from their instinctive fears which bind them to serve the White Witch, who provides for their needs while keeping them dependent upon her and thus ignorant of her true identity.<BR>   Death is &quot;cooperation&quot; against the forces of evil, once having realized the strength of group consciousness.<BR>   Death is &quot;the present moment&quot; in blessed forgetfulness of the past.<BR>   Death is &quot;rebirth,&quot; constant transformation.<BR>   In writing this tale, Lewis has given us another look at the meaning of stability versus change, of good versus evil, and of their relativity, all the while spawning the following equation in the mind of many: Reality = Death &amp; Rebirth.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Inspector Gadget would love this CD.  If that doesn't make you run out and buy this thing, I don't know what will.  IMHO, The Bends and Ok Computer are the top two Radiohead discs.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Not to say that I don't like any of her other albums, but is the album that I find myself listening to the most. It's just a feelgood album with alot of upbeat, dance tracks. I first received this album on tape when I was 8 years old, and I remember rewinding &quot;Borderline&quot; over and over again. I later on developed an appeciation for the other tracks on the album. I love listening to these old songs on digitally re-mastered sound. The bonus remixes are cool too.
B000002H97|2.0|People who are not familiar with Metallica may really like this record. But those who have listened to Metallica since 'Kill Em All' may very well find themselves disappointed. Their 2nd record 'Ride the Lightning' was a timeless masterpiece to be enjoyed again and again. This 5th record is simply tragic. Gone is the musical intensity and the killer vocals seen on earlier records. I am not so uptight that I'll deny that this record is a decent spare hour passer, but to call this one of Metallica's best efforts (to put it in civil language) is absurd. IT SAYS SOMETHING WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE ALBUM ARE NOT MADE UP OF PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS LIKED THE GROUP, AND THE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS LIKED THE GROUP ARE TRULY LET DOWN! I find it interesting that people try to excuse sell out records by saying that the group has matured. This is absurd. A compromise of  what they were good at for the sake of higher financial gain is the definition of selling out. William Shakespeare started out with mediocre plays like &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot; When his writing matured, he gave us the frighteningly intense masterpieces of &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Hamlet,&quot; and &quot;King Lear.&quot; Charles Dickens' early &quot;Old Curiosity Shop&quot; has some grand elements like the really likable villain Daniel Quilp and the eccentric but benevolent Dick Swiveller. But Dickens' writing matured to offer us the frighteningly intense &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; Going back to heavy metal, King Diamond started out with the o.k. &quot;Melissa.&quot; But his writing got more frightening, and his musical efforts got more intense, and he started using more musical resources. Just listen to his later efforts &quot;Them,&quot; &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; &quot;Abigail,&quot; and &quot;In the Shadows.&quot; The bottom line is don't confuse two things that don't go together. Maturing is maturing and selling out is selling out. I don't deny that this record has a sound that mayappeal to some, but if like me, you are a fan of older Metallica like &quot;Kill Em All&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; you may very well be disappointed. SUGGESTION: If you can, borrow this record from someone; give it a listen; then decide if you would like to buy it.
B000059ZT4|5.0|The first CD (original Jamaican mix) is not just different mixes, but entirely different performances for the most part. Most lead and background vocals are different takes, and many of the instrument tracks are alternate performances as well. Also, the two unreleased tunes are great. I prefer this disc for the more straightforward, unadulterated sound, and have lost all interest in the slicker Blackwell production.
0393317552|1.0|I'm a Cornell University freshman and i had to read this book.  Guns, Germs, and Steel really ruined my summer.  It's very long, repetitive, and not incredibly interesting.  I also had to listen to a panel discussion about it and participate in a small group discussion.  Every other student I've talked to agrees with my opinion, but hey, you might enjoy it if you like learning about the fates of human societies.
0345413377|4.0|If you're anything like me, a fantasy fanatic, then you'll know just how good 'His Dark Materials' Book I and II were.<BR>This however is mindblowing. From the start, where it takes off from where 'The Subtle Knife' (Book II) left off, it is adrenaline pumping. In the middle of the book, it IS a big book (600 and something pages.) It does give one or two chapters on some people from the church that plot to kill Lyra, although those chapters are short, they are incredibaly DULL. Anyway, this book gets very exciting. I did find the bits with Mary and the mulefa quite tedious, but thats my opinion. Now I shouldn't keep dissing this book when i've given it four stars!!!!!<BR>So the good bits. The way it's written is superb. When Lyra must travel into the world of the dead and has to leave her daemon behind, well, I was in tears! It's so heartwrenching, I was crying through the whole chapter, the pain Lyra had to go through is so real. Phillip Pullman is a VERY talented writer. Lets hope further books from him are just as excellent. Buy this book. But read the first two first!;-)
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's new album is a fun, addictive c.d. The songs I liked the best were Lonely, overprotected, Not a girl.., and That's Where you take me. If you like pop music you will defiantly love this c.d.
B00000K19E|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen (next to Eyes Wide Shut).  Keanu Reeves should not be allowed to act, period.  Granted the effects were good, because it wasn't seen before, the plot sucked, the acting was even worse.  This is one movie that I do not wish upon anyone.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Ok, just a point of clarification---this is NOT Enrique's &quot;second&quot; cd or his &quot;sophomore&quot; release. He has approximately five other previous cd's, with a couple of greatest-hits and remix cd's thrown in as well.  BUT, maybe because he only has one previous cd in English, that causes some confusion for others.<br />This cd is typical Enrique.  It has incredible vocals and musical arrangements, with broad-sweeping sounds at times.  It almost fills the room with sound and emotion combined.  Then, there are other times when the beats are simply too good to stand still.<br />If you like Enrique, and try to avoid the CONSTANT shake-your-bon-bon music of Ricky Martin (not that it's bad, but it's a little TOO much), then you'll like this one.  Not as tropical sounding as Marc Anthony, not as boom-chicka-boom as Ricky Martin.  Somewhere in between.  And it works, as always, amazingly well.<br />Those who already have his last cd, but want to look into getting more, check out his &quot;Cosas...&quot; cd.  It's all in Spanish, but VERY, VERY good.<br />Also, Enrique's younger brother has a cd out too.  It is very, very good.  If you can find it (it's kind of hard to come across), I'd recommend it.
0060278234|5.0|I loved this book. It's probably my favorite by Garth Nix. It had more action in it than the first book, Sabriel, did (probably due to this book's lack of romance, unlike Sabriel). I can't wait until Abhorsen comes out... but I'll keep reading Broken Sky until then...<BR>Hey, why does everyone keep saying that Sameth is stupid? I felt bad for him. Okay, maybe he was too afraid to become Abhorsen, but you can't blame him. *enough* Ahem. I'm writing a review. On with it, then!<BR>In Lirael, the two heroes, Lirael and Sameth (who is the son of Touchstone and Sabriel) are trying to find Hedge, and evil necromancer dude, and Sameth's friend (I think his name was Nick but I'm not sure). If you like fantasy, read it. If you like books, read it. JUST READ IT PEOPLES!!!!
B000002UVX|5.0|This is awsome!  Jimi Hendrix played with many different bands throughout his career, including Experience (Monterey Pop), Gypsy Sons And Rainbows (Woodstock), Band Of Gypsies (Fillmore East), and then it was the Experience again at the Isle Of Wight.  Of all these bands, the Band Of Gypsys is by far the most impressive.  With songs such as &quot;Machine Gun&quot; and &quot;Who Knows?,&quot; I was blown away.  Buddy Miles also sings on this album, and is very good.  Also about this album, for the first time we see just Jimi.  All he does is play -- not with his teeth, not behhind his head, no massive tricks, and no guitar burning.
B0000025F7|5.0|there is little doubt in my mind that this album is michael's best ever. say what you want about his recent output and his public image problems, but this man crafted (along with the golden hand of quincy jones) a disco and funk attack.<BR>my favorite track which gets little recognition is _get on the floor_ -- not sure what or why but this one hits be most when i pop the cd in.<BR>the rest of the album is great.. few times since have i come across an album which hits with each track, even though 6-9 aren't my usual favs but they still have that quality that makes them listenable (repeatedly).<br />to all who haven't i suggest listening to this soon. to all that have it already, keep on enjoying this album -- i know 10 years from now, as i dust the ages off my cd player i'll resume with the same energy with which i heard it first several years ago.
B000002MM8|5.0|Dead Can Dance have the gift of creating music that is both timeless, universal, and transcendent. Music/Art like this is rare to come by - art that can give you the experience of leaving your body, art that points to something greater than itself, something that cannot be described through words, and that only music and images come closest to. This album will always be one of my all time favourites and I would recommend Aion, The Sepent`s Egg, and Toward the Within equally if you`re new to Dead Can Dance.  <br />Also consider another duo from Australia named Trial of the Bow and their albums Ornamentation and Rite of Passage. You will love them.
B000002H33|5.0|I got this cd today, and it is awesome. Metallica at it's best. There are execlent song such as the Sanitarium, and Master of Puppets. From being stuck in a hell on earth, to being controled by a demented god it is sureal and oddly entertaning! Get this cd now!
B000002H72|5.0|Arguably the best album by arguably the best band of the eighties. The masters of the spiky guitar, in your face three minute pop song fully realise their potential on this album from which they never quite recovered.<BR>Frank Black's multi-linguism and Kim Deal's repetetive pounding bass (check post Pixies U2) never sounded so resonant. <BR>Every song is killer from the post Dali imagery of Debaser to the almost chirpy Here Comes Your Man.<BR>If you don't own this album, buy it; If you do go and listen to it NOW!!!
6302968135|5.0|Ok, for one thing, it's more then just 5 stars. Jesse Borrego (Cruzito) does an amazing job at his character. Watching him perform pushes me to WANT to become an actor. He transforms himself well, he changes from innocent to drug addicted, to clean and sober.<br />Benjamin Bratt (Paco Aguilar) does an amazing job, watching his character go from Bad-boy \\"el gallo Negro\\", to &quot;la oda.&quot; its just, Amazing to watch him for the years of his life, diss the cops, then just years after become one. Making a choice, deciding against FAMILY and LAW.... so yeah, question, if ya seen it, what would you do?<BR> <BR>Damian Chapa does an excellent job, watching his character go from Wero to CHICANO RULER.Besides, the fact each main character in this movie is just HOT! Even for being their age.;)<BR>Enrique Castillo is just awesome all around, this is an excellent movie! I can't stress that enough. <BR>This movie was thought out well, each and every character was played RIGHT and VERY very well, and I am still amazed. I've seen this movie more then once, and every time I watch it, I walk away completely amazed!<br />This movie, was like I said, written well, directed well, I'm a very critical person when it comes to movies, I pay more attention to the outer side of the scenes, to see the mistakes. I've watched this movie, enough to know, that there aren't any, or if there is, I haven't caught them yet. Well in other words, this movie is SMART. Flat out, in order to fully understand it, you've got to fully watch it. Its like a perfect soup, with each actors extra attitude to their character, their sound, their look, adds that extra spice to the recipe. So if you haven't seen it, see it. If you've got the movie, pull it out, and watch it. It's awesome. That's all I can say.<br />Hasta Luego!
B00005R23S|3.0|I heard from a good source that the DVD was supposed to be sold with a promo cd (included in the package)but it was not so.My disapointment was also due to the fact that the video has the same footage already seen on HBO and that some of the performances featured in the &quot;NY city serenade&quot; should have been shown in their entirety.The 3 stars are for the second DVD because of the never seen before footage...
6304779356|5.0|This has got to be one of the Top 3 best movies from the 80's.<BR>What a cast Joel Schumacher got for this flick. They all clicked together and I have to say that Lost Boys is Kiefer Sutherland's best role to date, with Stand By Me a close 2nd.<BR>I was not bored one bit from beginning to end, and watching it now will make you recognize everyone in the film. Too bad for the Coreys (Haim and Feldman), they can just sit there and watch what thier careers could have become after hits like Lost Boys, License To Drive. Diane Wiest is great in this as she always is in whatever she acts in, like Law &amp; Order. The music, together with the superb acting and some good laughs in this vampire movie will not make you want to fast forward but rewind, or chapter search for DVD, to some scenes to watch again. Thank god for DVD. Jason Patric's best performance to date as well. And watch for Alex Winter from Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure as one of Kiefer's bully Vampire buddies. Jami Gertz is sexy as ever like she always has been. What happened Jami after Twister???<BR>By this one on DVD so that it lasts because on VHS you will just wear the tape out from watching it again and again.I will bet the DVD will get rereleased with some extra stuff, the DVD now doesn't have any additives.
B00005NP04|5.0|I LOVE this CD!  But, it is a collection of her Greatest Hits.  I even like the new songs that are included.  I've been a fan for quite awhile - her voice blows me away.  I hadn't been married long when &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; came out.  That describes him; then there's &quot;Valentine&quot; &amp; &quot;There You Are&quot;.  They get to me.<br />I appreciate female singers that can &quot;belt&quot; - Reba, Patty Loveless, Trisha Yearwood, &amp; Sara Evans are a few, IMO, that sing with such power.
B0000024ZT|5.0|One of the greatest debut albums of all-time. Not only did &quot;Greetings From Asbury Park&quot; put unfashionable New Jersey back on the map, it also launched one of the longest and most important careers in rock's history. The 23 year-old Springsteen displayed a remarkable brand of lyrical verbosity not heard since the heady hey day of Bob Dylan circa &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. Of course, the imminent Dylan comparsions were unavoidable, but the ambitious young star refused to let the hype machine eat him up. While much has been made of &quot;Greetings'&quot; poor production, nothing could possibly detract from the quality of Springsteen's songwriting. Nearly 30 years after their release, songs such as &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; and &quot;It's Hard to be a Saint in the City&quot; still rank among the upper echelon of Springsteen's work. Lyrically, Bruce would never quite approach the lofty heights he reached on &quot;Greetings&quot; and its magnificient follow-up &quot;The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle&quot;. Colorful imagery practically jumps off the grooves on every track. From the wild verbal assault of &quot;Blinded By the Light&quot; to the poetically violent gunfight of &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot;, Bruce never lets down his guard. Zany characters with eccentric names like Crazy Janey and Mission Man pop up all over the place. The hastily assembled band, loose and ready to roll, so perfectly suits the rapid-fire vocal delivery of the raspy-voiced Springsteen. The whole experience is sheer unadultrated joy. Ironically, being the adventurous piece of work that it was, &quot;Greetings&quot; proved to be an abysmal financial flop. Practically no one outside of Philadelphia, New York or New Jersey was even aware of Springsteen. Within a few years that would all change. While Bruce would eventually become an international superstar, I personally believe that he would never again display the brilliant artistry of his first three albums (&quot;Greetings&quot;, &quot; The Wild, the Innocent&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot;). Bruce's current work lacks that urgent sense of abandon which made &quot;Greetings&quot; so darn enjoyable. In fact, fans only familiar with his post 1980 output may be shocked to realize that, once upon a time, listening to Bruce Springsteen was actually fun! &quot;Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; is more than just fun, however, it's the embodiment of the spirit of rock-n-roll. Great album. Highly recommended.
B00005OWIU|5.0|My 10 year old daughter is a HUGH Harry fan and when the CD came out, I immediately grabbed it!  Brought it home, popped it in and was transfixed!  My daughter loves the orchestration and dances around the room.  If you want to give your kids an &quot;introduction&quot; to classical....this just may be the one to start!
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles' best album? Probably not. That honor is reserved for &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Most eclectic? Nope, that would be the &quot;White Album&quot;. Most elaborately produced? Try &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Most famous record? Most influential? Bingo! That's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Not only the most influential entry in the Beatles' catalog, but also the most far-reaching and well known recording of the entire rock-era.<br />Volumes have been written about the phenomenom of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and the social impact it bestowed upon its release in June 1967. The psychedelic sound collages of &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; served not only as a soundtrack for the Summer of Love, but also influenced an entire generation of &quot;serious&quot; rock musicians. For better, or in many cases, for worse, rock was forever changed by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Superb musicianship and production became all the rage. Lyrics, which were actually printed on &quot;Pepper's&quot; jacket, were suddenly taken seriously. Critics took note and the bar was raised as countless artists attempted to create their own &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; -style masterpieces. Of course, many of these imitations were downright laughable, but nevertheless, a new genre known as &quot;progressive&quot; rock was born in the aftermath of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.<br />Ironically, when discussing &quot;Pepper&quot;, the album's great songs almost get lost in the shuffle. The title song, &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; are permanently ingrained in the heads of rock fans everywhere. However, for me, lesser-known jewels such as &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; and &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; are more enjoyable. They're lighter and more fun to listen to than their better know counterparts. The charging herd of animals which blasts through the tailend of &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot; is one of the most humorous moments in Beatledom. The perfect seque of a chicken clucking into the opening notes of &quot;Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)&quot; is a touch of genius. Ditto the gibberish tagged on the end of the album which, on vinyl, went on eternally. For me, these are the special touches which make &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; a unique listening experience. Overall, &quot;Pepper&quot; is truly a joyous musical journey --one which, like many Beatle records, occurred at the right time and the right place. It's almost as if the Beatles could read the collective mind of the world, giving people exactly what they needed, while uniting millions in the process. Boy, could the world use the Beatles now.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Sounds just exactly like the title mixed with the original sounds of Incubus, since they did their recording sessions in a beach house with a 'Morning View', hence the title. With their experimental-like intrumentations, great lyrics, and youth, I just hope they keep on coming with more amazing and refreshing work, especially with much more depth and artistic ability than most alternative-metal bands today. Enjoy Incubus.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down has released a great album.  The lyrics and their songs really gives these guys a sound of their own.  Their lyrics can be from dead serious to downright hilarious.  Needles, Prison Song, Chop Suey are three of my favorite songs.  I definately recommend this CD for anyone who liked their last one.

0316776963|5.0|This book was an absolute gem to read.<br />I read it on a train ride to NYC several months ago and found myself laughing -- and having to stifle my laughter realizing where I was.<br />There isn't one story in this set that won't bring a smile and faint air of recognition.<br />Enjoy...
0894803123|5.0|There is no way you will ever need more ice cream recipes. There are even some recipes for yoghurt and sorbet. The great thing about this book is that there are interesting stories about B&amp;J's lives and trials and tribulations while growing the company. This also would make a great gift.
B00005QDW5|1.0|Great.  Yet another Pink Floyd CD with Money and Another Brick in the Wall part 2 on it.  Tasty.<br />Has anyone else noticed that four out of Pink Floyd's last five CDs have featured Another Brick in the Wall Part Two?
0060934913|5.0|Great and entertaining read for any amateur cooking enthusist who has ever fantasised about being a great chef or owner of an upscale little bistro (Bourdain made me come to my senses about THAT fantasy...read the section about sunday brunch) Lots of nifty little facts and hair raising stories.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I'm new to the PJ harvey scene but I respond to her honesty and energy. These songs are great for their depth and power.  Her trademark sound is still there, but it's a little rounder in some spots and sharper in others. Great album.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I love to see a good actress really enjoying herself, but at the same time remaining in CONTROL of a part, especially in a comedy. Reese Witherspoon is incredibly good in this role of Elle, a spurned sorority airhead who decides to follow her former fiance to Harvard in order to get him to marry her after all.<br />The holes in the plot are easy to ignore because of her acting, which is fun and terrific. In fact, I bet even the men in the family could stand to watch this. It's &quot;cute&quot; but a guy could handle it. It's funny enough.<br />Witherspoon, wearing her absurdly inappropriate outfits and residing in her out-of-place, out-of-her-mind  Harvard Law Scool dorm room (she even has fuzzy pink fluff covering her princess phone) reminds me, in this role of Elle, of the fabuolous Judy Holiday or some of the other actresses of earlier eras who could immerse themselves so gratifyingly in a comedy that you would end up just relaxing and going with whatever the ridiculousness was.<br />And ridiculous this is...but it's really well done.<br />And the reason it's well done is Reese Witherspoon. Fun supporting cast too..especially that doll who played the beauty parlor buddy. What a sweetie.<br />I enjoyed this more than eating cotton candy, which is about the level of seriousness at which you should take it. It's all in good fun and for that it gets four stars from me.
B000002J2B|3.0|Boy Tony Banks' ego must have been running wild on this release. The man just blasts his keyboards so loud that Steve Hackett rarely got a chance to play some guitar solos. Heck you can barely hear Mike Rutherford at all on bass.<br />Anyway, song-wise there are some good moments but they pale in comparison to the previous release, A Trick Of The Tail. One For The Vine has a great keyboard solo in the middle but its way too long and lacks focus. There must be five or six different melodies on this puppy and really only two are fairlycaptivating outside of the solo.<br />Blood On The Rooftops and Afterglow are the two best tracks here. At least there is some balance between the instruments on these songs. Slumbers/Quiet Earth is somewhat interesting in the background and Your Own Special Way has a decent if not spectacular song structure. Eleventh Earl Of Mars has some good keyboard embellishments but some annoying synthesizer blasts. All In A Mouse's Night would have been alot better if Tony turned his synthesizers down especially at the end and let Steve Hackett crank up his guitar solo. Wot Gorilla does not develop the good original theme enough and relies on too many special effects.<br />By listening to this release, I can understand why Genesis went the pop hit machine route. Too much synthesizer and not enough focus were getting a little boring for Mike, Phil, and Steve. A change was needed which would later have mixed results.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is my favorite album, and I believe I would just perish without it, and every song is complete with its own quirks.<BR>1. Airbag: A trippy drum loop plus uplifting guitars makes for a sonic rush that flies through the ears.<BR>2. Paranoid Android: A masterpiece, in 3 parts that sound like their own songs. The speed changes constantly from normal to quick to slow and back around.<BR>3. Subterranean Homesick Alien (correct spelling?): Marshy guitars meet oddball lyrics.<BR>4. Exit Music (for a film): An powerful tear rendering song that goes from slow to the top of Thom's anguished voice.<BR>5. Let Down: Happy, uplifting, though a tad repetitive.<BR>6. Karma Police: Piano ridden with great lyrics.<BR>7. Fitter Happier: Chilling Vocal (If thats what you could call it) piece that makes a person think hard at what is being said.<BR>8. Electioneering: The albums rocker, with loud guitars and common drum beat.  <BR>9. Climbing the Walls: Eeerie vocals, eerie lyrics, and eerie music makes for an almost chilling experience.<BR>10. No Surprises: Beautifully carveed poppy music.<BR>11. Lucky: Anguished sound makes for a head trip.<BR>12. The Tourist: An awesome closing to the album leaves on a happy note and a valuable message of slowing down.<br />I think that OK Computer may be one of the best albums of the nineties since it fits the mood and atmosphere of the decade, and shows Radiohead's impact on music.
B00005K9LK|4.0|First, I should point out that my rating is an average of both the music and the sound quality:<br />First, the music--with the sole exception of &quot;Pain and Pleasure&quot;--simply flat out rocks. I don't need to say any more than that. If you're new to Priest, this definitely serves as an excellent starter. It rocks! 5 stars for the music.<br />BUT, the sound quality is a different story altogether. To all of you audiophiles out there, I'm giving you the warning right now: NOISE REDUCTION WAS USED!! I knew immediately upon seeing Jon Astley's name for the remastering credit that something wasn't going to sound right... I'm sorry to say I was right. For those of you who don't know, Jon Astley is a mastering engineer that has an evil and pathetic habit of employing noise reduction &quot;technologies&quot; to practically every project he gets his hands on. On some songs, luckily, you can barely tell he used it. However, if you listen through headphones, the use of noise reduction is all too obvious in both the intro vocals to &quot;(Take These) Chains&quot; (it sounds like it has some sort of metallic squeaking in the background) and in the first four or so bars of &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot;, particularly noticeable on the high-hat in the drums. And, just to be sure that this wasn't the way it was recorded, I compared the version with a vinyl copy my friend has. Nope--it doesn't sound like that there. This a terribly poor &quot;remastering,&quot; and I *VERY* highly doubt this reissue was even taken from the original master tapes. Where is a REAL mastering engineer like Vic Anesini, Bernie Grundman, or Steve Hoffman when you need him? I simply can't believe Sony would do such a blasphemous thing to the almighty Priest catalog. 3 stars for the sound quality. <br />So, there you go: 5 stars for the music + 3 stars sound quality yields a four star average.
B0000508U6|5.0|In the modern barrage of wannabe Pearl Jam bands and screaching Teen Princesses, Coldplay manages to offer something different, but still something that people more adapted to the mainstream radio stations can enjoy.  It sounds to me like Coldplay has mixed the quirky britishness and song structure of Radiohead and the lushness and lyrics of Duncan Sheik or Jeff Buckley to make an enjoyable sophisticated album.
B000056K04|4.0|The Dave Matthews Band wears its heart on its sleeve in the new album &quot;Everyday&quot;. With songs like &quot;Space Between&quot; and &quot;Fool to Think&quot; (among others). I think that this is an excellent portrayal of Dave and the Band's talent.  Simply due to the fact that they are able to change styles and genre of music so frequently and are able to do it so well. In the album Dave employs the use of an electric guitar which is done well.  Carter [Beauford] is so accurate and blends his trademark progressive style with the flow of the album well. Stephen [Lessard] also shows great groove with the band. Leroi [Moore] and Boyd [Tinsley] don't seem to be as utilyzed as much in this album though. None the less it is a great album.  In my opinion the only draw back is Dave and the band's regress from the traditional &quot;jam band&quot; sound.  If you are looking for the long drawn out epics (reminicent of the &quot;Grateful Dead&quot;), this album does not deliver.  But for a well thought out and brillantly written album, they do deliver.
6305878323|5.0|I was nine years old when Walt Disney produced the first movie I remember being a \\"must see\\": Mary Poppins.  After seeing it numerous times as a child, I bought the new DVD - thought I might enjoy seeing it again and sharing it with my nieces and nephews.<br />Mary Poppins retains the same magic and wonder that I remember experiencing as a child. She still remains this enigma - who was she really?  Where did she come from?  What was really going on between her and Bert? The movie answers none of these questions - it just lets them float in the air like it's magical heroine. And that's part of its charm.  The film seems to live by Mary's maxim: \\"I never explain anything\\".<br />Technically - the film holds up as well, even in this age of digital everything.  I was amazed to learn (in the \\"Making of\\" documentary that's included on the CD) that the film was shot entirely on the Disney soundstages in Burbank.  They never went on location; they never even went outside.  London is \\"painted in\\" in a series of beautiful matte glass paintings.  (If I remember correctly, even today, it is the largest number of glass background paintings ever used in a film.)<br />Julie Andrews, of course, is \\"practically perfect in every way\\" as Mary - a much more idiosyncratic character than the governess she famously played in \\"Sound of Music\\" a year later.  And that clear soprano voice - never showy, always in character - just lifts the film.  Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert - though accents are clearly not his strong suit.  But as a comic, a mime, a singer and a dancer he is charming as the Jack-of-all-trades friend of Mary.<br />The DVD looks great.  It's letterboxed - but it wasn't shot in wide screen format - so you don't loose much on your TV screen.  The colors are snappy and true.  There is a new \\"Making of\\" feature, produced especially for the DVD hosted by Dick Van Dyke and featuring interviews with Julie, and some of the other technical team that are still around.  There is some great home movie footage of the chimney sweep dancers rehearsing \\"Step in Time\\" outside in the California heat stripped down to their skivvies.<br />The one thing on the DVD I do NOT appreciated is a long series of promos for other Disney video releases that you can't cancel out of easily and skip to the film. I think it's rather shameless forcing kids to sit through those commercials to see their favorite movie.<br />All in all - a beautiful presentation of a classic film that adults and children can enjoy together.is some great home movie footage of the chimney sweep dancers rehearsing \\"Step in Time\\" outside in the California heat stripped down to their skivvies.  <br />The one thing on the DVD I do NOT appreciated is a long series of promos for other Disney video releases that you can't cancel out of easily and skip to the film.

630451087X|1.0|One thing that really bothers me is when people claim to get something more 'abstract' and then are seen or see themselves as more intellectual.<BR>  Lost Highway is one of those films where that happens. The movie is nothing more than a noirish episode of The Twilight Zone with a bunch of nudity and no explanations. It makes absolutely no sense unless you read about the movie beforehand to see an 'explanation' of the film. Yet, people still go on and on about how great it was. Despite the fact the already bad movie is filled with horrible, scarce dialogue. Horrible acting, general inaccuracies (huge archaic, gothic prison in LA, cops who can match prints while at the crime scene, false 'tidbits' used as fact to aid the story, etc.)and really obvious, obnoxious image systems.<BR>   I've seen reviews that have said &quot;if you're into being spoonfed your story, don't watch this&quot;. Well that's fine, but this isn't a matter of being spoonfed, it's a matter of someone trying to be so abstract that people feel dumb just because they don't get it. If you wanna look at something to find meaning in, go look at some abstract paintings, not a work of near unrelated sequential events that's filled with holes and is constucted rather poorly.<BR>   If anybody besides the 'artistic' director known for being 'out there' did this film, it would be considered complete (...). But it's David Lynch, he's weird and therefor, this is great. At least that's how many see this (imagine if a plumber previously flawlessly fixed three broken toilets and then actually broke a toilet in half the fourth time he tried fixing one? Would you blindly praise his work because he did a great job the first three times).<BR>   Don't buy this film unless you've seen it. And if you want to rent it, rent it at the library where it's only a buck. If you're looking for a great noirish thriller that actually makes sense and is told in an unconventional, intriguing way, go buy/rent Memento.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of seeing this remarkable achievement. I was over at a friends who had seen it on cable and he taped it immediately after seeing it once. My experience was love at first sight with a film that will captivate any audience, musically inclined or not. I still can't believe this film wasn't released in the US, I never even heard of it before, but feel lucky to have stumbled across it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A nourish thriller about a man who can only remember the last few minutes of his life and has to find the killer(s) of his wife. Only the story's told out of order and often repeats itself showing what you just saw(or thought you saw) in a new light. Similar to Pulp Fiction, but much more intense in that regard(and all regards, really). A very scary movie that chills you not because of potential danger, but because you'll have to imagine what you'd do if you were suffering from the disorder.<BR>   I didn't think I'd like this before I saw it. The description rubbed me the wrong way. But after viewing it, I thought it to be the best movie to come out in years. <BR>   This is a treat not only because it's so damn good, but also because it's so original and unconventional. Pick this one up.
B000053VAZ|4.0|Benny and Joon are Brother and sister, and have been inseperable since the death of their parent's. Joon is riddled with a mental disease that jumps and attacks her at the most inopportune times, otherwise it only tampers with her logic. Joon is more intelligent than anyone believes, it's just in her own way. Mary Stuart Masterson (Friend Green Tomatoes) plays Joon to the core, especially in a scene on a bus when her sickness overcomes her. At the same time she is able to show her romantic side, when she meet's the incredible character, Sam.<br />When Johnny Depp is at the end of his career (God forbid any time soon) he will definately be able look back and see a light. That light is Sam. With a mix of slapstick, and quotes from cheap flick's, Sam makes his way into Joon's heart. I agree with a friend and fellow reviewer of mine that the poker game was not quite delivered right. A sour play of poker, in Joon's hand's, causes her and her brother to win Sam in the pot. (Joon put's a green haired troll doll in the kitty, and her apponent put's in Sam, his cousin.)<br />Benny is Joon's brother and guardian. Between no love life, and Joon scaring away her sitter's, he has a stressful time keeping sane himself. But with the tragedy comes release when Sam enter's their lives.<br />What follows the (did-not-handle-with-care) card game is the real flesh of the movie. One of the best modern romances is captured here, and more interesting, it's believable. No moping or sappy stuff found in cheapened love films, but true and heartfelt love that is real and tender.<br />Even though the screenplay is terrific I personally think that the title is misleading. It's really about Joon and Sam. But, I understand that switching character names in a writer's mind is hard, and it is true that the starting backbone is Joon and Benny. Then again, who cares about the title. There are great film's that have titles that don't relate at all: Magnolia, anyone?<br />See and enjoy. It truly is one of the best romances. Equally it's one of the best comedy/drama's.ne of the best romances. Equally it's one of the best comedy/drama's.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Yep, Britney is back! and stronger than ever before. Britney's third album is her best work yet. Each album has gotten better and this is def. a step forward from Oops!...I Did It Again. The good thing is that she isn't using Max Martin as much, but even the few songs that he contributed sound different from The Oops songs. Britney has shocked critics and people with this album gaining critical acclaim from many. Britney wrote five of the songs on this album, and the thing is that those songs are the best on the album. From the sexy tune of &quot;Boys&quot; to the feel good &quot;Anticipating.&quot; Britney definitely has staying power. She has sold more than 40 million albums with only two albums, has a movie in the can, and has set records around the world. <br />Anyone can enjoy this album. Buy it for yourself and you'll be dancing in no time! Britney, you've done it again..and for that, I love you!

I sat down expecting a great movie and it was slow and kinda jumped around a little too much.

B000002KMV|5.0|Review from The Controversial Daily--dated 2001.<br />On the title track, which begans with a funky beat, he poses such questions as &quot;I can't believe all the things people say/controversy/Am I black or white/am I straight or gay?&quot;  &quot;Do I believe in God, or do I believe in me?&quot;  Obviously with the release of Dirty Mind, lots of critics and people were really wondering about him and had a few things to say.  Well, this is Prince's take on that.<br />His reciting the Lord's Prayer and his provocative utopian view is also included in the title track, which is the most potent and important track on this album:  &quot;People call me rude/I wish we all were nude/I wish there was no black or white/I wish there were no rules.&quot;  Given the traditional U.S. view of sex which has refused to get out of its Puritan shadow and covert racism, those lines are not to be laughed off lightly.  It makes me think, &quot;Well, sure, why not?&quot;<br />The irresistible &quot;Sexuality&quot;, a political disco number of the principles of the new breed leaders:  in their regime, one needs no money, clothes, anti-segregation anti-racism, anti-tourists, given that tourists are pocket-camera-visioned idiots, &quot;a bunch of double-drags who tell their kids that loving is bad.&quot;  He furthers his argument that &quot;no child is bad from the beginning, they only imitate their atmosphere.&quot;<br />&quot;Do Me Baby&quot; is probably one of the damn, hottest and sexiest songs he has ever written.  After the singing, he goes into a monologue where he is making love to a woman while the music plays.

B000007MVL|4.0|Kate's second album is mellower than most of her work.  Most of it is Kate's still-girlish vocals and her piano.  The sole exception is the frantic guitar rocker &quot;Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake&quot;, which is inbetween two lovely songs--&quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Oh England, My Lionheart.&quot;  &quot;Heartbreak&quot; contains a wonderful metaphor of spilling red beads to blood, and &quot;Wow&quot; is one of Kate's best singles.<br />&quot;Symphony In Blue&quot; is an interesting contrast between the calmer, sadder, and more tranquil blue modes and red modes, which are of love, jealousy, and sex.  She sees God as tempering the beast from red to blue, and guiding her towards her symphony, for which she is needed.<br />&quot;Oh England, My Lionheart&quot; is a wonderful love song to the country of Shakespeare, Peter Pan, London Bridge, a country whose arms warmly embraces her and that she never wants to leave, even when she's ready to shuffle off that coil.  For her, this is an England after the devastating effects of the Second World War, where clovers grow where air-raid shelters used to be.<br />&quot;In The Warm Room&quot; is an erotically beautiful song sensually sung from Kate's lips.  &quot;You'll fall into her like a pillow/Her thighs are soft as marshmallows/Say hello, to the soft musk of her hollows&quot;  Now that's just beautiful writing with wonderful similes.<br />The slightly bouncy &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; with a witty chorus of arsenic in the tea, (a nod to Arsenic And Old Lace surely), and mentions of cyanide in chocolate, belladonna in coffee, depicts all the ways the lonely serial killer disposes of whoever comes to visit her.

B00003CXXJ|1.0|Mike Meyers is great as sort of a Scottish ogre, and Eddie Murphy is fantastic as an annoying donkey. Yeah, I mean he is _really_ good. Very annoying.  A lot of the humor was a bit off color too.  Now I enjoy toilet humor as much as the next guy, but I don't know if being in the same league as Beavis and Butthead is really where they should be aiming.<br />Shrek likes to make fun of Disney movies, but it would have been nice if they could have had the quality of one.  For example, Eddie Murphy played an annoying dragon in Mulan, but the movie as a whole had a better story and was more enjoyable.<br />I guess the story was passable, but it didn't smack of quality like most Disney movies do.<br />As for the animation, I thought some of the scenery was good, but overall the character animation was poor. Any scene with a crowd reminded me of Scooby Doo. Really, I think a modern video card (say a geforce 3) could probably do a similar rendering job in real time.  Compare the animation on Shrek to Toy Story 2 or A Bug's Life -- much lower quality, less attention to detail.  Those were older movies, but still their animation held up and their stories were far superior in my opinion.  There really is no comparison between Shrek and Monsters, Inc.<br />Overall I was pretty disappointed.

B00004RD54|1.0|Let me explain.  The Velvet Underground were, and still are the greatest American rock band.  Period.  They released four musically brilliant albums without a second of bad material.  Then they broke up and Lou Reed went solo.  \\"Transformer\\" was a great album, with great tunes, and some really, really (...)great tunes (\\"Perfect Day\\", anyone?).  Then it was like he decided to stop trying altogether for about 11 years (until \\"New York\\".  Then he decided to stop trying until, well, he's still not trying).  This is one of the worst of his solo albums in my opinion.  I mean, what do you people hear that you like?

0060926317|5.0|When I read this book I was initially skeptical. But after a time, I found it very uplifting and enlightening.  Then I read of the controversy surrounding it. After doing some research on the web, I found many sites claiming this book to be a &quot;hoax.&quot; That is what fascinated me. Why would a book about a white woman traveling with traditional Aborigines be so controversial? The author even allows you to either take her story as fiction or not....But then why are so many groups so critical of her story?? So ready to discount it?? If it is just a work of fiction, why the absolute denigration of her story?? I ask, how could a health care worker from the Mid West concoct a tale with so much depth and insight? If she wanted to just make money, as some claim, why not write about encounters with aliens, or a 'how to get rich quick scheme  in real estate' (which seems to sell so well). I question those who dismiss this book as fiction...how can a story so rich in detail and emotion be so easily dismissed? Who are those critics and what do they have to hide?? Please read this book. So very few books these days are uplifting to the soul and spirit. It is a another step into that journey of understanding that we all seek. And those that dismiss this story as a hoax have many more miles to travel before they are able to see what this book means to their own soul and to the souls of all of us, forever intertwined,and always as One.

The story is about  the Joker kidnapping the police commisioner and shooting his daughter, but it really centers around the character of the Joker.  The dialogue fits the pictures like a jigsaw puzzle with clever word and picture gags that make you reconsider the potential of a comic book.  Also of value, there is an interesting flashback story of the Joker that you will only find in this comic.

0156013983|5.0|Le Petit Prince, published more than half a century ago, endures into the twenty-first century as a beautifully written children's novel and a powerful philosophic work that speaks volumes about love and friendship.  Written by Antoine de Saint-Exupery during World War II, Le Petit Prince was published as a children's story, but soon became recognized the world over as a profound introspective statement.  By using the novel as a type of allegory, Saint-Exupery was able to write a commentary on life as he had lived it.  The novel takes readers on a fantastic journey through the universe that, by the end, will have even the most hardened soul in tears.<br /> The novel, although simply written, is not simple in style or in taste.  Saint-Exupery uses powerful metaphors, similes, and analogies to address the very abstract themes of love and friendship.  By personifying many of the personality traits that make up a true friend, Saint-Exupery makes these complicated issues so simple that even a child could understand.  This is, of course, what Saint-Exupery had in mind all along.<br /> I loved Le Petit Prince and have read many of my favorites parts to members of my family and just about anyone else who will listen.  That is the magic of this novel.  Beautifully written and illustrated, it will have you coming back to relive the adventures of the little prince time and time again.  Through the eyes of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, this often-troubling world becomes a universe filled with the possibilities of true friendship and lasting love.

There are only a few acts and they are very short.  There are no acts in this show that aren't available in their full length in other videos or DVDs.  Even the soundtrack is copied from other shows, with the exception of \\"Journey of Man\\", which is a great song, but is much better (and is complete) on the audio CD.<br />There are a couple of pros, though.  The audio seems to actually be 5.1, not 5.0 as specified on the box, and the quality of the video is quite good, once you get past the fact that is in 4:3 format.  The scenery is spectacular, it is nice to see a rich background to the acts (as apposed to the scafolding of the big top).  And it is a cute story...<br />With a little more effort, this could have been great.  Unfortunately, it's, well... not...
B00000IL1K|5.0|What a stunningly, beautiful voice this talented singer has!  I have played this CD over and over again in the weeks since I bought it and probably will wear the CD out by Christmas - and replace immediately...<br />Sarah switches between a wide range of singing styles and in my view does so with grace and flair.  I disagree entirely with some comments I have read that refer to her 'sameness of tone' or 'small voice'.  She isn't an opera singer by profession, as far as I am aware, but by goodness she can hold a tune - I know 'cos I love opera and can spot the difference.  And yes, it must be said that the CD does have an opera feel about it.  But don't let that put you off, because Sarah puts heart and soul into some wonderful, hauntingly beautiful songs, which you will grow to love, regardless of an opera label.<br />You know that song from Titanic?  I hated it - fed up with hearing it... but Sarah's version of this is just breathtaking in my opinion.  She delivers this song with much more heart and passion, yet at the same time, purity and simplicity of voice, than I think Celine Dion did.  Anyway, can't get the damn song out of my head now... but thanks Sarah - absolutely wonderful!!<br />Buy this or you are mad!!!!
B00005A46T|1.0|I'd rather listen to a child beat on a wall through a terrible fit! That's mainly what this cd consists of. Loud pounding and relentless screaming w/out thought out lyrics from another wannabe \\"hardcore badass\\" band. Don't get me wrong, their first album I thought was great but it sounds like this album was just put together. I wouldn't rush to buy this cd. However the new S.O.A.D. cd really kicks (...)!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek proves once more that it's possible to have a successful animated(all be it computer animated) movie and target several distinctly different audiences.  This movie succeeds on practically every level.  In fact, the only thing I would have done was take out the very overused Smash Mouth song &quot;All Star&quot; from the opening.  It's the only thing that seems a bit odd.  But then again, if I see this movie again in 10 or 15 years, it may fit better for me personally.  In any case, Shrek has a stunningly detailed and beautiful look to it.  The scenes are really breathtaking as well as creative and functional.  Great voice talent all around, including Cameron Diaz, who suprised me with her commanding voice work in this film. This movie is a masterpiece and I know I'll enjoy it for all time.
B000001IQH|5.0|One of the best from some of the best. I started listening to rock at young age Nirvana and Pearl Jam were the bands that got me into it. then i headed into junior high where I fell in love w/ punk music. When i first heard &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; Iwas  hooked. I bought the cd and i don't Believe that it's  come out of my disc changer  yet. This is amust buy if you dont have it already!
080017948X|5.0|This ofter overlooked comedy is a true masterwork of director Harold Ramis.  Operating from a simple premis, we get a story that is not at all predictable, despite poor Bill Murray repeating his day endlessly.  Sparking facinating discussions about what anyone would do with eternity is just one joy of this film.  A special shout out to Chris Elliot, who plays the cameraman, and Murray's biggest critic.  Movies like this would fail without exceptional bit part actors, such as Chris Elliot.  The comic genius of Groundhog Day can really be best summed up by Phil Conners who, when trying to place a phone call and is told to try again tomorrow responded: &quot;What if there is no tomorrow...there wasn't one today!&quot;
B000002MP2|5.0|In 94'Iwas just starting junior high and I don't think there is one punk fan out there that doesn't owe it to bands like Green  Day, Offspring(while they were still on the Epitaph label), and Rancid(for me anyway) for getting them into the punk sound! This is truly music w/ it's own sound w/ catchy beats, energetic and well thought out lyrics accompanied by masterful riffs put that all together and you have a cd that's a must for any music lovers collection! Buy this cd and never be disappointed!
0743420373|3.0|The Millionaire Next Door is very informative on the subject of the spending habits of millionaires.  The book explains the differences between the two types of millionaires, UAWs and PAWs.  I do believe that I gained some understanding of what frugal and spendthrifty lifestyles are like.  I don't believe the authors portrayed the average accumulators of wealth enough, and I found there to be an excessive number of statistics. The Millionaire Next Door is fairly easy to read, but is a bit tiring and repetitive.
B000002KFJ|5.0|There are over sixty reviews of this album posted here as I write this. Why put up another? Because I love this disc!<br />This (released in 1975 and the sixth album from Black Sabbath) is a classic recording that simultaneously defines the heavy metal genre and warps that genre with progressive rock flourishes and baroque pseudo-classicism. This may sound pretentious but, in conjunction with the grinding guitar riffs that Tony Iommi all but trademarked and the haunted wail that is Ozzy's voice, the sound captured here is a shining example of the best that hard rock/heavy metal can be.<br />The album opens with a brief moment of background studio noise, a frightening squawk as if from some hellish bird of prey, and then a short countdown before \\"Hole in the Sky\\" erupts from your speakers with a barrage of sound and cryptic lyrics (\\"Hole in the sky, take me to heaven. Window inside, through it I'll fly!\\") that will leave your gray matter whirling. Track number two, \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\", is an instrumental interlude comprised mainly of Tony Iommi's classical style guitar noodlings that will allow you to just catch your breath before the epic \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" takes that breath right back from you with its pounding introduction and lyrics of cosmic love(\\"All I have to give you is a love that never dies. The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes.\\"). Themes of insanity (\\"Megalomania\\") and religion (\\"The Thrill of it All\\") echo through the rest of the album and the total effect is unforgettable and vintage Sabbath.<br />This is an album that should satisfy the simplest headbanger and the more discerning fan of heavy music. In short, this is Black Sabbath at their best.
0385505833|4.0|At about 176 small and well-spaced pages, this is no candidate for the Great American Novel, nor would it seem that it was meant to be. It serves its purpose well, however, as a page-turning and occasionally witty take on the American obsession with the externals of Christmas.<br />The ending may be a bit overly O. Henryish (or &quot;Capraesque&quot;) but I enjoyed the few hours I spent on it and was happy to loan it to other members of the family.
B00004TWZF|5.0|i was mesmerized by the movie. The music and the under water footage has a very calming effect on the viewer. The film explores new depths.
B00005O5CM|2.0|A slight but entertaining movie somewhat in the vein of Miss Congeniality for its intellectual depth, but maybe not quite as funny.  The double-sided DVD contains much more commentary and information than any normal human could stand to absorb, but if I were a student looking to learn about the movie industry this would be a good place to start.<br />For some reason, either the transfer to disc or the original print has strangely saturated colors that had me scrambling to adjust the color, tint, brightness and contrast on my television until I gave up and decided the effect, which I didn't like at all, may have been intentional, although the cinematographer's audio commentary didn't mention it.<br />People who live in Massachusetts may find the cheesy attempts to use locations in Pasadena to pass for Cambridge to be the most entertaining aspect of this film.
0767830555|5.0|Martin Scorsese's colorful masterpiece is one of the best films of the 70'es and one of Robert De Niro best films. This film may turn off some do to the violence. But for people who like strong stomic drama's this is a film for you. The DVD is very good and the picture and sound are perfect.
0807282375|5.0|I have enjoyed the entire series of 'His Dark Materials'.  The story is intriguing and thought-provoking. The characters have amazing depth and are so easy to relate to.  I gave this series to my husband, who has turned down all the kids' books I've given him before and even he has greatly enjoyed this series.  The story encourages readers of all ages to think for themselves, but most importantly to think about life and its meaning and importance. The most amazing part is that the book was able to encourage a spiritual perspective on life without isolating the story to one particular religious sect's experience. It's more about the human religious experience, which starts at a very young age, but so few kids books approach it.  I cannot sing this author's praises enough.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love the DVD, which is packed full of special features. Most of them are behind the scenes stuff, all of which is very interesting, (some, though, are a bit repetitive). Some DVDs have very simple, short special features, but this one has a very in depth look into Tomb Raider, from the beginnings of the video game to the gadgets you see in the movie. I actually found that what made this DVD great was not the movie per se but all the extras they've put on it.
6302517052|3.0|Gremlins starring Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates was indeed a very influential thriller thus creating Critters a kind of spoof more than anything else.  The first film is quite entertaining where we are more introduced as to what they are.  Funny lines support the film as well as a little thriller in it.  Quite a watchable movie but if your not into cheap low budget films miss it!  Not too bad though!
B000002HK4|4.0|A Change of Seasons is noteworthy for a number of reasons: (1) it re-unites Dream Theater with producer David Prater, who made their second album (Images and Words) such a pleasure to listen to; it's the first album featuring new keyboard player Derek Sherinian; and its selection of music is second to none.<br />This, DT's fourth studio album (1995), isn't quite as heavy as the previous release -- the bone-crushingly excessive Awake -- and that's a real blessing. Their talent shows through even more vividly because there are patches of intricate melody amidst the bombast that give one's mind a place to rest.<br />This album divides itself neatly into two halves: the 23-minute title track (sprinkled liberally with Carpe Diem -- seize the day -- philosophies)...and the live second half that's a feast for classic rock fans. DT covers Elton John's &quot;Funeral For a Friend,&quot; Deep Purple's &quot;Perfect Strangers,&quot; three from Led Zep (&quot;The Rover,&quot; &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;) and what DT calls &quot;The Big Medley,&quot; which is one cool song after another -- from Pink Floyd's &quot;In the Flesh&quot; to Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; to Genesis' &quot;Turn it On Again.&quot;<br />&quot;A Change of Seasons,&quot; the epic-length title track, is well-played, and shows more creative restraint than you'll find on Awake. I like it a lot.<br />...but I like the live cover songs even more. <br />One of the biggest challenges any band faces when doing covers is getting the sounds right, especially the guitar tones. Tackling the right notes and getting all the arrangements to sound similar to the original band is tough enough. But getting the right sounds out of the guitars and keyboards can be a real challenge.<br />Yet, I'll be darned if DT doesn't pull it off with their trademark virtuosity. Even guitarist John Petrucci's solo mirroring Brian May's in &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is almost note-for-note perfect.<br />You can tell DT was having a great time paying tribute to some of their favorite bands in the live portion of this CD. And their joy is contagious.<br />While A Change of Seasons will never be considered DT's best work, it's still one heck of a fun CD. I highly recommend it.
B00005OM4N|2.0|For me, this is a big disappointment.  I have both previous Britney albums, and have enjoyed them immensely, especially her debut album.  But this, what is supposed to be a musical departure, doesnt sound that different and certainly doesnt contain a lot of the melodies that attracted me to Britney in the first place.<BR>'Slave' is interesting, and yes, is a more mature style for her.  My favourite track on the album is 'Boys' but hey, there is such a similarity between this and Prince's 'Get Off'.<BR>A disappointing album, but I am not writing her off yet.<BR>One for the fans I think...
B000002JPA|5.0|This is my second favorite Dream Theater album after When Dream and Day Unite, their debut release.<br />On this release -- Images and Words -- the melodies are flawless, the music is uplifting, the musicianship is unbelievable and the vocals (supplied by new vocalist James LaBrie) are soaring but not irritating as they are on subsequent releases. (He tends to overuse a melodramatic breathy-ness, but at least he's hitting the notes he's reaching for on this album!)<br />I'm not surprised this album catapulted DT into the stratosphere. Every song is brilliant. The guitar tracks are more out front than on their debut (but not so far out front that they've become bone-crushing and lacking in melody) and the production is superb. The balance is perfect between heavy and delicate, dark and light. Kevin Moore's keyboard work is nothing short of amazing. Check out the gentle intro to &quot;Wait For Sleep.&quot;<br />&quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; the opening track, was a big hit at the time of the album's release (1992). But, for me, the stand-out tracks are &quot;Another Day,&quot; &quot;Take the Time&quot; and &quot;Metropolis - Part I.&quot;<br />I've been on a Dream Theater binge lately (spurred by the release of their new triple-CD Live Scenes From New York, as well as listening to DT drummer Mike Portnoy's side project TransAtlantic). I've been listening to their entire catalog in order of release. Images and Words, a CD I haven't heard in years, is playing at the moment...and I'm realizing anew just how incredible it is.<br />Images and Words is brimming over with energy and stellar performances from all five members of the band. What a powerful album.<br />If you're fan of progressive rock -- or what's become known as &quot;progressive metal&quot; -- you need to have a copy of Images and Words. It's the perfect balance between art and rock.
B000002MUW|4.0|You can always count on getting a great album with Madonna.<BR>She always delves into different styles, yet retaining the 'essence' of what makes her Madonna.  This is her R&amp;B / Soul moment (with a mix of electronica / pop)<br />The same applies here, though in my opinion (and i am a HUGE fan of hers), this album contains some of her stongest, but also weakest moments.<br />Lets get the weak tracks out of the way first: 'Survival', 'I'd rather be your lover',the single 'Human nature', and the pleasant song, 'Dont stop'.<br />The remaining tracks are outstanding.<BR>The beautiful 'Take a bow', the haunting 'Love tried to welcome me' and moving and beautiful 'Inside of me'.<BR>As for the more upbeat moments, the fascinating 'Sanctuary', quoting the poems of Walt Whitman, and the Bjork penned title track.<br />Despite its weaker moments, this is still a great album.<BR>Perhaps get Ray of Light / Music and Erotica first if you havent already, but dont by-pass this.
B000002JKA|3.0|The musicianship on Awake is extraordinary. No doubt about it. <br />John Petrucci is one of today's most accomplished and technically brilliant guitarists. And drummer Mike Portnoy is a monster, rivaled only by the likes of Neal Peart. Bassist John Myung is nothing short of astounding. And Kevin Moore is his usual melodic and surprising self (unfortunately, this was his last album with the band).<br />So why only three stars? Two hard-to-ignore reasons:<br />1. James LaBrie's vocals are among the most irritating I've ever heard. His I-know-there's-a-note-out-there-somewhere screams grate on my nerves in an unbelievable way. On this album -- DT's third studio release -- he alternates between a menacing growl, an over-the-top bellow and his trademark breathy-ness. And does so with the finesse of a wrecking ball.<br />2. The production is so in-your-face that it's almost too heavy for my taste. To me, above a certain decibel level, guitars lose their ability to uplift, stir, amaze and captivate and, instead, simply settle for crushing bones and scaring small children. The balance between light and dark, between heavy and delicate, so artfully struck on Images and Words, has been obliterated on Awake. This album is heavy, heavy, heavy.<br />And LaBrie is screaming, screaming, screaming.<br />All writers need a good editor. And all bands need a good producer, one who won't lead them over the top -- and off a cliff. On Awake, I think the line was crossed.<br />The albums begins with a bang -- Mike Portnoy's drum roll -- on &quot;6:00.&quot; The heavy tone and brisk pace are established with this track...and both don't let up until the very last track (&quot;Space Dye Vest&quot;).<br />&quot;Caught in a Web,&quot; the second track, is playing on my office CD player now. And LaBrie is screaming again. Shouting at the top of his lungs, in fact. It's God-awful.<br />The following track -- &quot;Innocence Faded&quot; -- is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's melodic and uplifting, showing signs of much-needed creative restraint. Great chorus. Nice background vocals. All in all, a pleasant respite from the bombasity of the rest of the album. (LaBrie displays both top-of-his-lungs shouting and that hideous breathy singing on this track. Try to ignore him.)<br />&quot;Erotomania&quot; picks up where &quot;Ytse Jam&quot; (from When Dream and Day Unite) left off. It's a clever and stirring instrumental track that buries the keyboards and cranks up the guitars. It's fantastic playing, and LaBrie is nowhere to be found. So this track gets two thumbs up from Yours Truly.<br />&quot;Voices&quot; begins with some moody, almost spooky bass, keyboard and guitar sounds, puncuated by Portnoy's heavy-footed drumming. Cool track.<br />&quot;The Silent Man&quot; is a slow, acoustic guitar track with lots of LaBrie to be heard. I'll bet you can guess what I think of it.<br />&quot;The Mirror&quot; (track seven) is another heavy, heavy, heavy track with lots of double bass work from Portnoy to further add to the feeling that my head is being crushed when I listen to it. Especially with headphones on.<br />The rest of the album pretty much follows suit, with a guitar sound that's distorted to the point of atonal. Where's the melody?<br />Despite the album's weaknesses (and there are many), it still stands as one of the best examples of music skillfully played you'll find anywhere.<br />If you're new to Dream Theater, don't start with Awake. Start with Images and Words, When Dream and Day Unite or Scenes From a Memory. Awake is liable to scare the crap out of you.
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna put this compilation together, to remind people that she is a talented artist, and that she is not all about 'controversy'.<br />This is not a greatest hits (get'The Immaculate Collection' and 'GHV2') but complements them beautifully. <BR>It is a collection of her greatest ballads, the majority of which were singles (9), but it includes greats such as the title track, lifted off the 'I'm Breathless' album, 'Forbidden Love' taken from 'Bedtime Stories', and 3 brand new tracks, 'You'll See', 'One More Chance' and 'I Want You' with Massive Attack (in 2 different versions).<BR>9 of these tracks you cant get on any other Madonna compilation.<br />A worthwhile additon to your music collection.
B000002HPT|4.0|Falling Into Infinity is a different sound for DT. Especially for vocalist James LaBrie.<br />It's hard to say what's not the same about this album. But it's noticeably different from its predecessors. Maybe it's the groove this album seems to have, a more bottom-heavy undercurrent (like on &quot;New Millennium,&quot; &quot;You Not Me&quot; or &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot;) that drives it along. Maybe producer Kevin Shirley wanted more of a total band effort than a guitar onslaught. So he buried the drums and toned back the guitars, and kept the overall pace a little on the sluggish side.<br />I don't know what it is. But it's a great change of pace. And one, according to some other reviews, that wasn't terribly well received among DT fans.<br />It runs the gamut, though. There's even a Flamenco-tinged track called &quot;Hollow Years&quot; that sounds like something you'd hear on an easy-listening station. Or on a dance floor at a wedding somewhere. It's almost a pop song, which is very strange for DT. But, to me, it works.<br />&quot;Burning My Soul,&quot; the fifth track, begins with a grinding bass line and a slowly building keyboard, guitar and drum montage (love that double bass action from Portnoy!). But then LaBrie joins in, screaming as usual, and the track goes into the dumpster.<br />&quot;Hell's Kitchen,&quot; track #6, opens with an atmospheric, moody bass, keyboard and guitar pastiche that slowly builds, but never reaches its full potential -- even though it has 12 minutes in which to do it.<br />I like the next track -- &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; -- largely because of keyboardist Derek Sherinian's intro. Sherinian sets the stage for a more aggressive, syncopated assault that's one of the highlights of the album for me.<br />&quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; (track # 8) seems like a Genesis song, circa their pop years with Phil Collins at the helm. I think it's the way the guitar sounds.<br />&quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; (track 9) is another mid-paced tune that's reminiscent of recent Rush, in my opinion. Maybe it's the bass line.<br />&quot;Anna Lee&quot; is a slow, love-songish LaBrie showcase that begins with a piano that sounds like '70s era Elton John to me. Nice background vocals throughought. Pleasant, by not terribly inspiring.<br />The last track (&quot;Trial of Tears&quot;) is -- at 13:07 -- the longest on the album. Divided into three parts, it has a bit of Rush in it (circa &quot;Xanadu&quot;). And a raspy bass line that reminds me of something Tony Levin would create. In fact, this sounds a little like Liquid Tension Experiment, Portnoy's side project, the first album of which appeared a year after this DT album.<br />Overall, this is certainly not one of DT's best albums. Yet, I gave it four stars just of the first few tracks that I like a lot -- and, more importantly, because of the balls it must have taken to create something a bit riskier than another Awake or A Change of Seasons. It shows these guys are willing to try new things.<br />And isn't that what progressive rock is all about?
B000002MFN|5.0|This is without a doubt, Madonna's most overlooked album, over-shadowed at release time by the SEX book and the film Body Of Evidence.<br />Until 'Music', this is without a doubt, Madonna's most inventive and incredible piece of work.<BR>Filled with great pop tunes, 'Deeper and Deeper', 'Thief of Hearts', 'Words' and 'Bye Bye baby', beautiful ballads - 'Rain', 'Bad Girl' and the haunting 'In This Life' (&quot;shouldn't matter who you choose to love...&quot;such beautiful lyrics), and amazing electronica / acid jazz / trip hop - whatever style you want to call it; the title track, the demanding 'Waiting', and the astounding beauty of 'Secret garden', this is one of Madonna's finest moments.<br />As for the controversy?  A couple of the tracks deal with sexual material, but its more suggestive than explicit. (the ode to oral sex 'Where life begins'). A very cleverly written album, which deserves more recognition.

B0000025ZF|3.0|That song on this album should be considered prophetic and ominous in todays world since September 11th...
B000000W6F|5.0|This is a beautiful and unique hard rock album. It's not perfect from start to finish (very few albums are), but its strengths are SO strong, its good songs (which fill about 80% of the disc) so worth hearing, that it easily earns five stars from me. Billy Corgan's guitar sounds are just gorgeous, shimmering and crying. Jimmy Chamberlin shapes each song by using the full dynamic and tonal range of the drumset, something most rock drummers haven't even attempted to do since the sixties. This approach is obvious on &quot;Window Pane,&quot; but check out &quot;Suffer&quot; and &quot;Snail&quot; especially to hear how Jimmy can lead the band around a corner with a sudden rise or dip in intensity. (The lack of this sort of drumming on _Mellon Collie_ is one of that album's real drawbacks. Most of the drum tracks sound like loops, and it makes the songs feel monotonous.) But the greatest thing about this record to me is how so many of the songs undergo a transformation, and end up a different song than they began. This is very rare indeed in any era of rock music. Orchestral symphonies usually do this, on a huge scale. The jazz compositions of Kenny Wheeler, Gerry Hemingway, and Dave Douglas often do this, and improvised jazz solos do it sometimes. But rock tends to be based on recurrence and somewhat circular forms -- even the progressive bands of the 70s usually finished a song by restating the original theme in the original way. The Pumpkins, by consistently getting from point A to point B (in under 5 minutes), have created what will probably remain a masterpiece, not just of the 1990s, but of all rock &amp; roll.
B00005NTJM|4.0|you probably have to really be a fan of Jethro Tull to fully appreciate this album. First, it reveals the formative qualities of the band, before they became more established in their ways of working and playing together. Second, it does not feature Martin Barre, because the guitarist on this first album is Mick Abrams. But, if you can tolerate the unusual, you are in for a treat! One is the flute lead in Serenade for a Cuckoo, in which Ian Anderson establishes his credentials as a jazz/rock flutist. In addition is the tune Cat's Squirrel, which I alway enjoyed comparing to the tune of the same name by Eric Clapton and Cream, not so much as to determine which one is better, but to enjoy the interpretation developed in each. The rest of the songs might be perceived to be uneven, but well worth the exploration. I've enjoyed digging out this album over the past 30 years, and it has that kind of staying power over time.
B00005OM4N|5.0|The highly antcipated 3rd album &quot;Britney&quot; from the infamous Britney Spears, is definitley this talented singers best as of yet! The album is a more mature, harder pop, with twists of R&amp;B, Rock, and Funk/Dance. The first single and track, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, produced by the funkalicious Neptunes, mixes R&amp;B beats with smoothe vocals to make it an awesome first single, which shows off Britneys new musical direction! Next theres &quot;Overprotected&quot;, which is definitley one of the best on the album. Its a hard pop beat produced by Max Martin (did most of 'Baby...' and 'Oops...' albums), as well as &quot;Cinderella&quot;, both written by Britney herself! Next theres the sole ballad on the album, &quot;I'm Not A Girl...&quot;, penned by Dido, which is by far her best yet. Then theres R&amp;B influenced songs such as &quot;Boys&quot;, produced by the Neptunes as well, a rocker song &quot;Lonely&quot;, produced by Rodney Jerkins as well as &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, which are both written by Britney too, and of course sound great as well. Theres &quot;Thats Where You Take Me&quot;, a classic techno-ballad written by Britney,  and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; which are Pop/Dance influenced as well, with great lyrics and beats! Brit did an awesome cover of the Joan Jett classic &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot;, another produced by Rodney Jerkins, which is also more R&amp;B, which actually lives up to the original. A pop-disco song &quot;Anticipating&quot;, written by Britney as well, is a great song to sing to and dance as well. Finally theres &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;, which was produced by Britney's boyfriend Justin Timberlake from *N'SYNC, and Wade Robson, their choreographer. The song is like a rock opera, with Justins vocals in the background. This CD also has an extra enahnced feature, where when you put the disk in your computer, you can watch an exclusive performance of &quot;Overprotected&quot;, as well as outakes from Britney's first starring motion picture debut, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, due out February 2002. All in all, this is an all around GREAT album, and a defenite MUST-BUY! Britney shows off her new styles and sounds in this provocaticve new album, which is the best she has ever done!
B000002N2Z|5.0|dude, this cd is just so friggin tight.  just trust me on this.  you will not be dissapointed.  it may sound more amateur than white pony, but you can just rock to this cd for hours.  i don't look at it as a piece of art as much as a cd that you just get reeeeally into.  i've found that i say \\"(...), that's awesome\\" every time i listen to it.  don't miss out on this one.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|Now this is what a greatest hits cd sould be. THE BEST OF THE CORRS is an excellent compilation of their best hits. Actually it includes most of the singles that they've released through out the years. THE BEST OF THE CORRS also includes remixes and live versions  of some of their hit songs -- plus 2 new tracks! That makes this collection even better. Andrea Corr (lead vocals) comands each song very well and the rest of the siblings play instruments and sing back-up. The album flows very well. THE BEST OF THE CORRS is an awesome pop/rock must-have.
B0000028M7|4.0|Ah,yes, Alice in Chains,Dirt. This album was practically issued at local alternative music stores at a introduction to the angst filled early-mid 1990's. Much like Frampton's &quot;Peter Frampton Comes Alive&quot;, this is a must have for the Generation X community. I remember buying this tape after years of listening to top 40 and old,classic rock and having a revelation,that led me to spend hundreds of dollars at a local music store. Fresh out of High School, days of getting bullied and ostracized almost over,yet still filled with emptiness,new to the working world,this album will always bring back that fantastic loneliness of 1992.
B000002MY3|5.0|OK, my taste in music is normally pretty much conservative and I don't like CD's that have a lot of bad language but surprisingly I liked this CD and the profanity was tame compared to the CD's with explcit lyrics that I have heard my nephews listening to, and I usually dislke songs that are like girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl hates boy and writes a bitter angry song and vive versa, but I actually liked You Oughta Know, and I just think this CD is very good! I think Alanis has a very nice down to earth and folky voice, her voice just has a nice edge to it that is refreshing from all the soft voiced singers like Charlotte Church, Mariah Carey, etc! My favorite songs on this are Hand In My Pocket, You Oughta Know, Head Over Feet, and Ironic (even though it has nothing to do with irony).
B00005QCYC|5.0|This movie is a great buy, all 3 of them are good to buy but then there is that 4th disk that has all of the great stuff on it. I went to see them all in theaters because there all worth it and it is good to buy it and watch them over and over again.
076781214X|5.0|This movie besides its stars Kathleen Turner, Nicholas Cage,<BR>Jim Carrey and Helen Hunt among others, has the realistic view<BR>of the 50's from the great cars and music to the houses and furniture inside them. The movie shines in all these aspects. To escape into the 50's like this is a real treat to the watcher. You don't have to look at your watch while this movie is showing, because you don't want it to end.
0156421178|5.0|This is one of the most important books of the 20th Century.  Orwell went to Spain as somewhat of a vaguely committed leftist; when he returned, he had truly found not only himself but the course of the remainder of the century.  Orwell discovers that things rarely exist in black and white but in a million shades of gray; there rarely is a &quot;good side&quot; in any contest. Tyranny is tyranny whether it wears the swastika or the hammer and sickle.  Another aspect of this book, for people who only know Orwell through Animal Farm and 1984, is his bravery.  He was right in the thick of everything and lived to write one of the truest, most searing documents of the last 100 years.  As a chronicle of war before WWII, I think it ranks with Graves's Goodbye to All That.  In both books, the writer plummets to the depths of human experience and fear and surfaces with enlightenment.
B000003S0R|5.0|Lyrically Eno plays little narrative games,&quot;...and the opium farmers sell dreams to obscure fraternities...down in the orchard monkeys and uncles p-laying their games like it seems they always have done....China my China I wandered around for years and you're still here&quot;(China my China).<br />Musically the sounds are a mix of the familiar Manzanera guitar and Mackay sax(his two old Roxy Music chums)but also unfamiliar Eno synthesizers which make some very appealing noise and various other unfamiliar aural delights from all manner of unidentifiable sources.<br />There are so many lyric devices and different sounds that this album feels like a catalogue or manual. Perhaps the Eno equivalent of the Little Red Book.<br />The beautiful synthesizer phrasings on the closing number Taking Tiger Mountain could easily fit on Another Green World.<br />Other songs are pure pop heaven though, when Eno sings &quot;Looking for a certain ratio-o-o-o&quot; you can hear that he has learned something from Bryan Ferry. A vocal style Talking Heads' David Byrne will also use.<br />Fat Lady of Limbourg is perhaps the star of the show but not by much as every song is a winning combination of odd verse and even odder backing noises. Though its experimental its also fun and listenable as any pop record if not more so. There is plenty here to challenge the playful mind that always is looking for something new, Enos sound terrains are always intriguing, and also there is humor, especially in the words, and a great sense of wandering into the unknown because logical thinking and music making patterns have been left behind. Although familiar things keep popping up, like references to Japan or China, and cold war spy apparatus like microcameras and spectrographs, they are merely there to add drama and a touch of reality c.1974, but only a touch. Tiger Mountain is not to be located on a map.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Poor Elle... her boyfriend has just dumped her, forcing her to relinguish her glamorous Los Angeles lifestyle to pursue a career in law at Harvard Law School. No one likes her; she feels despondent and alone... what's a girl to do? Why, get a manicure, of course! <br />In &quot;Legally Blonde,&quot; one might expect voracious amounts of high-pitched voices, pouting, and out-of-nowhere remarks and comments that have become the constituent image for blondes everywhere. The movie includes all of these things, no doubt, but somehow manages to cast them in a witty and extremely humorous light, while also possessing a heart and soul that are easy to relate to. It's a priceless comedic gem, and gave me every reason to fall into its spell. <br />In a performance that is easily likeable and irresistibly charming, Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, who hopes to be accepted to Harvard Law School to prove to her ex-boyfriend that she's not too stupid to be a lawyer's wife. With a 4.0 grade average, a fashion major from CULA, and a video essay featuring herself and others in bikinis (a tactic made funnier by the fact that she doesn't realize the effect she will have on the all-male board at Harvard), she is accepted, and arrives intent on winning back her man. <br />Of course, things are not all parties and homecomings, and she soon discovers that no one really cares to be around her. Former prospective fiancé Warner is now engaged to the snotty Vivian Kensington, leaving Elle's plans in the cold. With no one to turn to except for Paulette, a manicurist with low self esteem, Elle decides to take life into her own hands, and quickly learns the tricks of the trade at Harvard. <br />This is where the movie takes on a personality much like its main character. By setting out to prove her worth as a law student, Elle shows a determination full of energy and real drive. By doing so, she becomes more than just the stereotypical blonde bombshell everyone sees her as, and in allowing her character to expand, the movie generates into something more than just an average teen comedy. <br />The laughs are almost non-stop, filled with a sense of humor that has great taste and tact. Much of this has to do with the movie's mockery of all things blonde, while at the same time embracing them so that the humor isn't hurtful or insulting. From pinks skirts and high heels, to a fuzzy phone and a Chihuahua that she dresses in matching outfits, Elle's persona is a riotous display of the typical air-headedness given an atypical treatment through the display of her kindness. <br />Her gentle nature and her unwillingness to give it up also gives the feel-good factor a shot in the arm of confidence. The movie covers just about every lesson you can think of, from friendship and broken hearts, to first appearances and loyalty, and takes on a moral that is good, clean fun without being overly sentimental. Take the scene in which Elle helps Paulette stand up to her ex-husband. Elle uses her technical language to completely confuse him and retrieve Paulette's dog, and the scene becomes funny and touching at the same time. <br />The sheer joy and glee one gets from watching a movie like this can be the result of nothing less than satisfaction. It brought a smile to my face and laughter to my heart, and gave me a warm feeling inside that most comedies cannot. &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; never oversteps the bounds of good humor, nor is it ever too saccharine for its own good. If nothing else, it proves the age-old saying that blondes do have more fun.
B000002KOO|5.0|This was my first Peter Green related disc. I immediately responded to his stinging guitar sound and have since purchased two earlier Fleetwood mac Cd's Pious Bird of Good Omen&amp;the live Shine 69. Both get played more than Then Play On because I prefer the stinging guitar sound on his blues songs more than on the rock oriented Then Play On.<br />However, if you like a disc that explores rock terrain with blues roots, Then Play On is your disc.  You already know the hit &quot;Oh, Well&quot;(don't ask me what I think of you/I might not give the answer that you want me to), and you will love Rattlesnake Shake  and Coming Your Way. Be aware that there are some slow numbers on the disc as well. I like them but they defintiely have an early seventies feel to them. Then Play On,less a blues record than a classic rock record, though one with some stinging blues venom  in its rocking veins.<br />{Peter Green by the way is once again playing straight blues and has recorded two CD's of Robert Johnson numbers recently that have a very good sound and reputation among lovers of the blues.}
B00003CY0V|2.0|The killer opener, filmed in downtown Ventura, CA just blocks from my house, absolutely takes your breath away.  A stunning spin around the explosion of a hostage and the accompanying damage that goes through walls &amp; around the entire scene leaves you heaving in your seat &amp; gasping for air.  However, by the end of the film it ends up feeling like a broken promise.  You expect this truly stunning, rollicking action ride, but for all the pyrotechnics and Travolta/Jackman/Cheadle/Berry star power, it's a yawner.  Throw in some really stupid pseudo-geeky computer stuff that any real hacker would scoff at, a little kid in danger (always a cheap, stupid, easy way out for a screenwriter), and a gratuitous shot at Berry's really-not-that-impressive rack and all you have is a 2-hour waste of time that leaves you wondering what else you could have rented.<br />For God's sake, don't waste your money.
B000005IRG|4.0|This album is great because it harnesses a lot of different elements in the mid-to-late 70s rock, for all of the good reasons.  The opening track, \\"See No Evil\\", is a fun three-chord romp that's short and sweet and to the point.<br />Some of the other tracks, such as \\"Friction\\" and \\"Marquee Moon\\", carry with it a minimalist bass hook and guitar noodling that may faintly remind you of the Talking Heads at the time.  However, these numbers are more of a layer-by-layer structured piece.  (\\"Marquee Moon\\" runs almost 10 minutes, but it is so well-constructed and builds up to such a climax that you don't find a note of it unnecessary.  How many 1970s epic rock pieces can you say that about?)<br />The rest of the album holds up nearly as well, with some additional piano sprinkled in with the mix.  Maybe the best adjective to give the music of this album is \\"post-psychedlic\\", rather than try to fit it in with the punk revolution that would happen soon after the album came out.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|I know I'm probably speaking to alot of Disneyphiles by posting here and some of what I'll say might be heresy, but I figure an honest review beats mindless fawning.<br />First, the DVD.  It's about as laden with extra stuff as DVDs can get, and if you're a cartoon lover or Disneyphile there are alot of treasures here.  Film clips, a song that got cut, storyboarding... you name it, it's there.  I personally completely hate the Streisand performance of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;.  She out-sugars Adriana Caselotti, and that takes some doing.  But in the end, if extras are what you look for in DVDs it's got that in spades.<br />Now for the film.  Though I'm completely cognisant of Snow White's landmark status in animated film history I have to say the movie drags more than a little through the middle.  In retrospect it seems obvious that Disney was doing what alot of directors do today -- skating by on good visuals at the expense of story.  Of course it worked at that time, and Snow White remains an important and interesting film, but looking back at it from today's standards and comparing it to current work done by Disney, it dates badly.  The animation, revolutionary at the time, just doesn't do it for me and the story I doubt would be interesting to anyone other than very small children (5 &amp; under) of today.<br />If you buy your DVDs for the movie &amp; not the extras, you might want to rent Snow White &amp; see if your memories match the actual film.  You might, like me, find yourself both surprised &amp; a bit bored.
0062513346|5.0|This was my first book by Coelho and it was terrific! I've since read the Alchemist (his first) and The Pilgrimage. The Valkyries remain my favorite in what I found were interesting twists to the 'story'. I found it to be a metaphysical detective-like mystery novel. A little bit of cleverly outrageous in myth coming to reality in more than one situation.  Note: If I read a news filler item correctly Shirley MacLean embarked on the same journey as 'journaled' in Coelho's The Pilgrimage.  tvb... massachuetts
B00005JKHP|1.0|Besides the intro attack with the Klingons and the outstanding march Goldsmith had to offer, this movie stank. How many minutes of weird nothingness going by do we have to see? The audio dubbing was horrible as well. And was that purple eye shadow on Mr. Spock? Yikes.<BR>It was a movie made for desperate Trekkies sick of the reruns. Of course it was a hit, what else was there for these guys?<BR>And I say this as a Trekkie as well. Forget this waste. Wrath of Khan and First Contact are much better. Get this movie only if you suffer from insomnia.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oh god has she done it again. with her second album boasting a hit single, ms spears has matured somehwat from her first release. with tracks like &quot;stronger&quot; &quot;don't knock...&quot; &quot;...make u love love&quot; the title track and &quot;what u see...&quot; show spears' new attitude and breaks away from the love crazed little teenage girl crying for her guy to take her back and how much she loves him songs on baby one more time. although with tracks like &quot;don't let me...&quot; &quot;when ur eyes say it&quot; &quot;dear diary&quot; &quot;one kiss&quot; are mostly slow ballads that express spears' love for an unnamed guy. the monster ballad, &quot;where are you now&quot; can be compared to &quot;bottom of my broken heart&quot;. this track displays miss spears heavenly vocals with a great string guitar line put together. a remake of the rolling stones' classic &quot;satisfaction&quot; produced by 18 yr old rodney jerkins adds a great rock essence to an already unremarkeable album. althiough a little out of place, &quot;lucky&quot; attempts to make the world feel sorry for a girl who has everything but always crys at night because she has nothing. like so many songs before, lucky is a wonderful ballad that serves its purpose in making you a little teary eyed and &quot;thank god i have everything i want&quot; feeling for lucky. britney is assisted this time around by legendary country diva, shania twain and her hubby, mutt lange on &quot;don't let me be the last to know&quot; and rodney jerkins on &quot;satisfaction&quot;. this album is purely swedish driven music from the likes of max martin rami and the entire cheiron studios crew that were responsible for spears' previous hits, &quot;baby 1 more time&quot; &quot;crazy&quot; &quot;born to make you happy&quot; and &quot;sometimes&quot;. martin turns out infectious, mind blowing, hits on this album. although not compatible with the likes of madonna and janetor celine and mariah as far as music goes, britney spears is fastly becomming the teen queen of pop. surely, this album can not be compared to the previously named divas because spears has yet to write her own material, witrh the exception of the closing track &quot; dear diary&quot;. with less filler than baby one more time, oops...i did it again has more debth and more potential hits than her first release could muster. be sure and pick this one up, even if you aren't a britney fan. with rock flares, hip hop and country inspired tracks and lots of pop, this release is a must have for your collection.
0061091480|5.0|Really, I have not read this book clearly, but I have gained lots of experience out of this book.<br />This book teached me to live the moment as I want. Also as I want to live it and not as others want me to live it and not to think what people will comment about my attitude, love, do what ever I want, then after reading this book I learned :- live the moment do not think of the past and dream about the future.<br />Also our visit to earth is very limited time so we have to enjoy life the way we want to enjoy.<br />Messrs, I am divorced and I am only 25 years old and living in an eastern society where lots of things are prohibited and you are not allowed to do but this book really has changed my view towards my situation and my way of living. Really I have been depressed for a long time, but after reading this book lots of things has changed.
B00003CXAR|5.0|jaws was a groundbreaking film. arguably steven spielbergs masterpiece this film deserves to go on the list of the one hundred greatest movies of all time. the film's actors roy schieder, richard dreyfuss, robert shaw perfectly drive the movie along. the sound and music is incredible and unforgettable. easily surpasses the book it is absolutely magnificent. the first film to make over 100 million dollars it never runs out of drama. the chase at the end is gut wrenching. they needed a bigger boat alright but the movie wouldn't have been as exciting then. the line &quot;we're gonna need a bigger boat is one of the best phrases ever uttered in history.this is one movie nobody can live without.Pure action!
B000059Z8M|5.0|When I first reviewed this I was thinking that I didn't like the second movie as much as the first.  Perhaps I was wrong.  My two daughters, ages 14 years and 18 months, both love this movie more than any other we own.  I have watched it or heard it in the distance dozens of times.<br />A year ago my then 6 month old daughter didn't watch movies, now at a year and a half she is a huge fan of Buzz.  She loves Buzz and askes to watch him almost everyday.  She has a buzz toy, which is her favorite.  Buzz, Buzz, Buzz.<br />I still like the first Toy Story movie a little bit more, but I think both movies deserve a 5 and that any family with young ones should have this set in their collection.  They are both good clean fun and enjoyable to watch, even for the umpteenth time.
B00003CXA6|5.0|this film will go down as one of the greatest war movies of all time. The dialogue is crisp, the setting is right, the acting is perfect, the mood is correct. featuring an all star cast of actors like Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Sam Elliot, Jef Daniels and Stephen Lang this film never runs out of drama. The fight scenes are incredible especially the heroic pickett's charge will have you holding your breath until it's all over. As strong acting drives it along the music perfectly fits the action. this is one movie you cannot pass up especially for those into civil war movies. historically balanced with nice interpretation i give the movie two thumbs up
B00001QEBQ|4.0|I enjoyed this film and really enjoyed Eddie Murphy as a voice over.  In fact, after this and  then watching him play a donkey in Shrek, I think he has found his niche and should avoid doing any more bad movies.<br />Mulan has a moral story to tell to, and all in all I think it does a good job without letting the points get in the way of the story and dialogue which is way to easy to do.  The animation is wonderful as to be expected and the story flows well.<br />The only part lacking may be the romance part, it was predictable of course this being a kids movie, but came across a bit forced.  Perhaps leaving it out would have been a better choice, Mulan could have been just a hero, she didn't need to be a hero that gets her man in the end.  Never the less, it is a solid offering and a good recommendation.
B00004U8JU|4.0|a stellar cast and crew help make this film one of the best of all time. the dinosaurs were teriffic and splendidly made. this film is all about action and thats just what it delivers. who wouldn't fear a giant t-rex or velociraptor just bearing down on them like the way they did in this film. what a wild ride, as spielberg shows just how good a moviemaker he actually is. spielberg also made other superb films most notably jaws, close encounters of the third kind, and the new a.i. artificial intelligence.this one has thriller written all over it.
B00004R99M|5.0|This movie is &quot;practically perfect in every way&quot; with great acting, signing and some well done animation/live action footage (way before Roger Rabbit hit the scene).  One of my all time favorite movies, I still love to hum &quot;Chim Chimmney&quot; a song from a wonderful song and dance scene on the rooftops.  This is a really great movie and can be enjoyed over and over, belongs in any family movie collection, a very strong recommendation.
B00000K19E|4.0|the matrix is one of the best movies of all time. the special effects in this movie are top notch. loose plot keeps it from falling short of masterpiece. but who cares. the performance by Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne is drives the film right along. the only thing that i can compare to the special effects of the matrix is the one starring jet li. this film is a nonstop action packed powerhouse of a film. you definitely got to get this dvd.
6301390725|4.0|One of my favorite movies as a kid, I will enjoy this again when my baby girl gets a bit older.  This movie is a lot of fun and has one of my favorite all time animated scenes, the soccer match.  While today's computer aided animation could certainly make a this scene more polished and up to date, I don't think the charm of it could be improved upon.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable movie and family classic, a good solid recommendation.
B00003CXN4|5.0|this film deserves al 4 acadamey awards for best director, best supporting actor, best adapted screenplay, and best film editing. one of the best dvd's i have. it is long yet intriuging enough to kep you in it. an epic achievement this was partly based on the 1980's miniseries &quot;Traffik&quot; which traced the drug war from the Middle east to Europe. the cast is all star the plot gripping. definitely one of the greatest movies of all time.two big thumbs up for the powerhouse epic.
B000059XUT|5.0|An amazingly well written script for an animation film, the voice overs are fantastic and the technical aspects very wonderful to watch.  This movie is a definite must have for any family collection.  It is a real trick to make a movie that appeals to both young and old and this one does just that.  A strong recommendation.
B00003CXE7|5.0|one of the greatest summer blockbusters of all time Gladiator is action packed and kinetic. the opening scene is one of the best openings of a war movie ever. choreography is stellar. the fights in the colloseum are splendidly made. Russell Crowe excelently plays the general maximus a simple minded yet important man to the emperor of Rome.Forced to fight in the arena after the emperors son commodus kills maximus' wife and kid Gladiator doesn't run out of action. Joaquin Phoenix superbly plays his role. An evil self mannered man who just wants power in Rome. action packed with some of the best fight scenes around Gladiator packs a huge punch.
B00005AR3G|3.0|A coming of age animation that almost makes it.  It is entertaining, but far from being a classic.  There are some funny lines, and a few plot twists, but mostly it is one the predictable side and a bit contrived.  A mild recommendation.
6305176299|5.0|superb acting by Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, Joe Morton, Sandra Bullock, make this an absolutely intense thriller. everything justt seems to click on time and on target in Speed. One of Keanu's best of all time especially before his most famous role in the matrix. My favorite part in this stellar movie is when they jump over the 50 foot gap i also like when Jack(Keanu Reeves) goes underneaththe bus and tries to dismantle the bomb on an extremely low lying platform. Dennis Hopper makes for a good villian in this one.
B000001FE0|5.0|There is a vast catalogue of &quot;important&quot; releases that present many pop groups and artists of The Sixties in what is arguably considered their finest hour: The Beatles' Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Strange Days by The Doors, Dear Eloise/King Midas In Reverse by The Hollies, The Velvet Underground And Nico (debut album; same title), Distant Shores by Chad and Jeremy, Crown Of Creation by Jefferson Airplane, and too many more to mention. Sadly overlooked too often by the critics is this wonderful collection of music the Bee Gees released in 1969. The songs are often quiet and reflective, the music is accompanied by the lush, majesterial sounds of a full orchestra, creating a mood of luxury and elegance. The cost factor in creating this set of music must have been quite prohibitive at the time (This was originally a 2 record set), but the Brothers Gibb were looking for a Sound, a Final Note of rare beauty and grace. You couldn't compare Odessa to any other releases of 1969, it was unique. The album bears the distinctive absence of the latest trends and gimmicks so often employed at the time (false endings, backwards tape loops, vocoder vocals, late blooming psychedelia effects), so it doesn't sound dated when you hear it today. If anything, it was a bold move for The Bee Gees to present this opus, so very unlike what everybody else was doing. There is much thought given to these songs, and the studio time was well spent. I can't really say there are any &quot;throwaway&quot; titles in the set; they all work together as the woven threads to a grand tapestry. It's an extravagant move to include 3 (!!) orchestral instrumental pieces capping the sets, but they are so right for the album, and wondrous to hear even today. I still think Odessa stands as The Finest Hour for The Bee Gees. Like a fine wine, a classic film, or the distant memory of an old love affair, it only improves with time.
B00005QDW5|4.0|What else would you expect of a compilation of such a great group?. This CD has very great sound, the feeling of any Pink Floyd LP (since the songs are connected to give a sense of unity) and even includes &quot;When the tigers broke free&quot; which I guess have been a favorite for any Floyd fan because of its rarity. And it even has a comprehensive, although edited, version of Echoes. Three flaws though: 1) Too many &quot;Division Bell&quot; songs (And no &quot;Take it Back&quot;!...Are you kidding me?). That will lead the occasional listerner to believe that this is one of the best Pink Floyd works, but the true fans know different. 2) Not so many &quot;Roger Waters&quot; songs. (That's what you get for leaving the group!). 3) Not all the albums are represented. But I was kinda surprise that there are 4 Syd Barret songs, and that's only fair to one of the masterminds that has worked in this band. Anyway, I have to believe that this is an acceptable compilation, in the face of the hardest task of all: make something representative of the extensive work by one of the greatest bands ever. Enjoy!
B00005OM4N|2.0|I was very decepted by this album. Though the cover is beautiful, the songs all look the same and the whole album screams disaster. The only song that has a unique sound is &quot;I'm a slave for you&quot; but everyone knows Britney ever did better than that. But I appreciate a lot the song &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot;, the lyrics are great and the melody is relaxing, but if you compare to Oops I did it again CD, you might really appreciate better &quot;Where are you now&quot; as a slow song. The song &quot;I love Rock'N'Roll&quot; is awesome too, but it's nothing but a look-a-like of Oop's I did it again's &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. Frankly if you like pop music, you might prefer way more the two first albums.
0064409422|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia remain favorites for me, well into my 4th decade.  But I have to ask: When did the publisher resequence them? I can see that they are now in chronological order, but I find the original sequence more logical and compelling as a story.  <br />The original was 1. Lion, 2. Caspian, 3. Dawn Treader, 4. Silver Chair, 5. Horse/Boy, 6. Magician's Nephew, and 7. Last Battle.  <br />This puts the creation of Narnia within the context of the storyline. I can remember the epiphany of The Magician's Nephew the first time I read it in grade school. I felt like I was uncovering hidden secrets.  I don't think it would stand alone as well.<br />So, if you're planning to introduce these to your kids (and I hope you do!) consider the original sequence - I think you and your children will enjoy it more.
6303148352|5.0|This is a really cool movie. The special effects and sound are awesome. The movie just sweeps you into it. Sam Neill, Joseph Mazello, and Ariana Richards do a great job together as they are lost in the park. As the movie goes along, they give you all sorts of hints as what's going to happen, then later, those hints all come together. It's full of suprises and twists and turns, as the story will leave you on the edge of your seat. It's not a nightmare giver, but it is a little creepy. This is the coolest movie ever, and it's a definate must-see!
B00004XONN|1.0|If you put a couple of randomly-chosen fourteen year old boys in a modern studio with professional engineers and told them that they had to write and record an album in one day, odds are you'd get something much more entertaining than this (...).  It's hard to imagine something so repetitive could be so completely devoid of melodies, yet here it is.  I wondered why something so critically acclaimed would not receive more radio play until I listened to it -- believe me, this is not something you are going to enjoy.
B000002WYT|5.0|If you buy one cd, buy under the table and dreaming, if you buy two buy crash and under the table and dreaming. Crash is one of the best cds I own. The music ranges from the mello &quot;Crash into me&quot; to the up beat, &quot;trippin billies&quot;.  Every song on the cd is at least one step higher than any other music you can buy. Amazing lyrics, amazing music, you will listen to it over and over again.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Angeline Jolie, whose explosive personality made her more of an indulgence than Gia in the movie Gia and won her an Oscar in Girl, Interrupted, was just Lara Croft. Despite the deviations from Lara's video game wardrobe (needed for reality since Jolie isn't, Ummm, as busty as our video game Phenom), Tomb Raider is by far the best adaptation of a Video Game Character while being real at the same time. Critics didn't like Lara not being in much danger in the film, but, as a game player, if you play it right, she never is in any real danger except with you at the controls. Jolie certainly makes the film and her adversary makes quite the villan. Her Father, Jon Voight, was a nice touch adding some feeling to the film bringing poignancy to the ending(as was Alex West's romantic involvement). <br />Jolie, as always, is not the lady but the Vixen ready to explode. Scene after scene was intensely crafter to make her look like the Lara Croft and she did most of the stunts. I actually saw the film six times at the theater. Never bored once. Jolie had to tan constantly to look like her, makeup had to keep her Lara hair perfect for each shot, and the high-wire bungee act was simply Lara Croft. Enjoy the ride and look for Lara Croft 2 in 2003. Female Indy Jones time? Get Steven Spielberg to direct next time and Harrison Ford can forget about coming back (the big rumor).<br />Felecia Constance Rowe<BR>Chairwoman and CEO<BR>Teardropfilms, Ltd.
0671688782|5.0|I read the book because I was looking for a way to connect with my spouse and this book helped a lot!  Of course for an adult some modifications are in order!  Her explanations of the role of parents was very enlightening too.  Wish I had had the book when my kids were young and at home!  It would have made a big difference!  But it was nice to know that one could start at any age and help to connect in unimaginable ways with spouses, kids and even friends!  It has also helped a lot with my feelings of being unlovable and insecure.  I recommend it to any and all.
0385505833|3.0|This book was enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed in the end though. It all came to a close so fast that I felt kind of cheated. It is good for a lighthearted read however. It was a bit farfetched that any neighborhood would come together like that one did though. I cant imagine anyone's neighbors in these days and times being so wrapped up in each others lives.

B00004XONN|1.0|If you put a couple of randomly-chosen fourteen year old boys in a modern studio with professional engineers and told them that they had to write and record an album in one day, odds are you'd get something much more entertaining than this (...).  It's hard to imagine something so repetitive could be so completely devoid of melodies, yet here it is.  I wondered why something so critically acclaimed would not receive more radio play until I listened to it -- believe me, this is not something you are going to enjoy.
0451169514|5.0|Like many of Stephen King's books, &quot;It&quot; takes place in a small town in Maine called Derry. The story begins in 1957 when William &quot;Stuttering Bill&quot; Denbrough's younger brother, George, is killed by a clown in a rain gutter. His death is the first of many that will plague Derry for generations, but it's the one that will haunt Bill forever.<br />More than twenty-five years later, the pattern is being repeated--children are disappearing and occasionally found dead, brutally murdered--and one concerned citizen (Mike Hanlon) vows to put an end to it. He's responsible for contacting his six childhood friends (Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris, Richard Tozier, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Beverly Marsh-Rogan) and reminding them of the promise they had made together as children--to destroy IT if it were to reawaken. And it has.<br />Although the story is set in 1985, all seven friends continuously flashback on their childhood before/while/after confronting IT. The memory segments take up a great deal of the book, but I'm glad they weren't removed. Anyhow, Stephen King and brevity have never gone hand-in-hand.<br />If you're willing to read 1,000+ pages, then I highly recommend this book. It's well worth your time. But if not, I'd recommend the TV movie instead; that is, if you don't mind watching a three-hour movie. Either way, you'll be spending a considerable amount of time being scared.<br />My choice was the book. I read &quot;It&quot; back in middle school ('90 or '91), but I wouldn't necessarily encourage younger (or more sensitive) readers to try this one unless you're already familiar with Stephen King or horror novels. There is plenty of gore, profanity, and sex--everything typical of King--that might offend some people. So, consider yourself warned.
B00005OM4N|1.0|The first album was an achiever: ...Baby, One More Time was excellent and cemented the vestal virgin' Sexy and Seventeen routine for all the guys in the audience. I did like I'm a Slave 4 U since it had a Paisly Park (Prince) appeal but the rest of the album was so fassssssst, it just didn't gell. Well, guys, sex appeal only goes so far when production is razor thin. Kids will actually find this \\"music\\" great, but the grown-up audience that loved the first album and liked some of the 2nd will be disappointed in the Pop Princess. (...)
B000002KXV|4.0|If you're a Steely Dan fan, like me, you'll like this album as well. There's good stuff here with no bad songs, although &quot;Maxine&quot; may be the weakest of the bunch. Aside from that there's the radio staple &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; along with &quot;Green Flower Street&quot; and &quot;The New Frontier&quot;. All are great but my personal favorite is the title song (&quot;I'm Lester the nightfly, hello Baton Rouge!). The timeless nature of this album is one reason it will sound fresh for years to come.
0871137380|5.0|An exciting and fast-paced read.  I could bearly put it down.  But I had to get sleep at some point.  I read the book in three days.  And I have two clinics to run!  But this real-life story was too engrossing to put down.<br />A patient of mine told me about this book in mid-Oct 2001.  I was intrigued since my only recollection of Somalia was that the USA went to help deliver food and the &quot;ungrateful&quot; Somalians dragged a dead American soldier through their streets.<br />This book brought the whole affair into better detail.  I thought the author did an excellent job of telling the story of the incident from so many different points of view.  It is rear to read what the &quot;enemy&quot; was thinking and doing.  But Mr. Bowden travelled to Africa to get the story from those Somalians who were involved in the fight.<br />I've have been telling everyone I can to read this book.  So that some day we can thank those soldiers who fought for this country in Somalia.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|&quot;Mulan&quot; is one of the strongest entries by Disney in the late 90's. Aside from fantastic animation, what really makes this movie so great is it's intense epic-like unfolding (which should attract adults), with the Disney comedic angle (Mushu, the Dragon) to attract the kids.<br />Disney's 36th Animated release, also offers a strong message that I really don't think any of their films have had since Pinocchio. A child, whether being a wooden-boy or in this case a teenaged girl, can have courage and be unselfish when it comes to helping or protecting their family.<br />The DVD edition has a great picture presentation, and the Surround Sound is very effective. Especially during the stampede, which seemed to come out of &quot;The Lion King&quot;.
B0000073BG|5.0|I was a huge fan of the prog bands of the 70s, with the Gabriel lead Genesis at the top of the list. Admittedly, a lot of prog music does not hold up today, and I have moved on. However, I completely missed Renaissance, or if I did hear them it didn't stick.  Thanks to mp3 downloads I was able to sample this album.  I was in shock . . . achingly beautiful and moving, this music reaffirmed that the best moments of prog were special indeed, and still have the ability to profoundly affect me today.  As a rebuttal to the arguement mp3 downloads steal from artists, I have since bought almost the entire Renaissance catalogue.  In my opinion this album is the pinnicle, but I also heartily recommend TURN OF THE CARDS, NOVELLA and SONG FOR ALL SEASONS.  You will be amazed.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I was a little unsure about buying this album, but I bought it and do not regret it. I love almost every song. This album is a great mixture of pop and romance.
B00003W8NM|5.0|(...)In my opinion this is the best movie of all time,  to me it is even more than just a movie.  Edward Norton and Brad  Pitt played to of their best roles of all time. I also would like to thank the director David Fincher for putting together such a great spectacle.  And everyone else who worked on it , thank you all for this great gift to america and human spirits alike.
B000005QH3|4.0|I haven't seen so much action with a Dodge since The Duke's of Hazzard. Wait a minute, I mean a Chevy Camaro. (Pause is a great function.) Buy it and see what I'm talking about. There is plenty of breathtaking and unexpected car action. There are brief points of nudity in the movie. Ok, a whole scene involves a completly naked woman. Watch it first, before you invite viewing by your kids.
078322804X|5.0|This movie never gets old!  It is still as funny as ever, and the extra footage even seems to add a little continuity. I come from a suburb of Chicago, and a great amount of the fun I have is in seeing old, familiar places being turned upside-down by the hilarious exploits of Jake and Elwood.  A little-known fact of this cinema milestone is that it documents, with great care, much of Chicago's past look.  The Maxwell Street sequence, alone,is a clearly-intended slice of the city's history.  The beauty, and the cultural depth of Chicago, are fondly portrayed.  And don't forget the music!  I gotta tell you that this movie has soul, as well as humor.  All-time great musicians are all over this work.<br />Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway, and don't forget John Lee Hooker!  What a line-up, and what a sound!<br />Seriously good laughs, music, acting, and story.  A real movie classic.
6305784116|5.0|&quot;The Aristocats&quot; is a great, simple film that continued on Disney's animation department after Walt's death. Disney himself gave the go ahead for this film, but unfortunately he never got to work on it. There was a point in time, where there was a possibility that Disney Animation studios was going to close down since Walt was no longer there. Luckily for us, Roy Disney Sr. never pulled the plug, the film was made, and Walt Disney Studios continued on.<br />As stated in passed reviews, the animation is sort of iffy at times becuase of the new techniques that were being used in the beginning of the 70's, but the Disney basics are still there. Many people claim that this film began the decline of Disney films until &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; appeared 19 years later. This all depends on how you look at it. Yes, the 70's and 80's (up to '88), didn't see anything that seemed to resemble Walt Disney's touch, but all of the films that were made during this time also appealed many and are underappreciated simply becuase they were post-Jungle Book but Pre-Little Mermaid.<br />My personal opinion, is that the Disney magic continued in the 70's and 80's, but in a different way. Unfortunatly, since everyone was just accustomed to Walt Disney's personal style, people were just not ready for the change. <br />After taking all of this into consideration, I watched the film for the first time on DVD, and the bottom line is, that it's a terrific Disney film.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Have you ever closed your eyes while listening to your music ? Have your ever been touched by the warmness, the intensity and the sound of a record ? Have you ever felt like dying for your music ? <br />It´s been said enough about this band, about this record, about the great new white hype and there´s nothing more to say, except: 1. This IS the greatest debut album of the last 20 years ! 2. This record contains 11 (eleven) songs, each one a classic (and &quot;New York City Cops&quot; an all-time fave !). 3. Buy this record by any means and remember the Velvets !
0060926317|1.0|This book was chosen as the November selection for my book club. I hope the woman who picked it isn't there because I'm going to have some not very nice things to say about her choice.<br />1. The book is poorly written. It sounds &quot;hack-y&quot;. It is in bad need of editing, both for style and content. There are some really really bald metaphors in there, as well as misuse of some words. I knew I was reading a self-published book, and not for good reasons. <br />2. I don't know if all editions have this, but the one I'm reading has the translations from Ooota in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. Most annoying to read. Painful on the eyes. But this is a minor criticism.<br />3. The edition I have is presented as if it is semi-autobiographical. Please. There are these totally unbelievable statements made, with no back-up, no real explanation, just &quot;we are to accept this&quot; - for example, a compound leg fracture is instantaneously healed so the patient can walk on it. People communicate telepathically, not only with other people, but with dolphins. A supposedly-intelligent woman gets into a Jeep with a strange man without even verifying that he is the person sent to pick her up...<br />If you're gonna write fantasy, make it clear it's fantasy. Don't try to convince us that you have written an autobiography and then put in all this totally unbelievable stuff.<br />4. The whole idea that Westerners are &quot;mutants&quot; and that the native peoples have the only right idea of how to live. OK, now, I appreciate taking care of the environment and all, but I remain unconvinced that we should all strip down and go live in the woods, away from antibiotics, air conditioning, and water-purification plants. <br />I didn't feel uplifted by the book at all. <br />5. The sheer EGOTISM of the writer - the implication that she was something so special for starting a Junior Acheivement program for the mixed-race folks (I should've been suspicious there, don't the true Aboriginals have nothing to do with the people who are part European?) that this tribe would take her on one of their religious rituals, make stuff for her, massage her feet, etc? Sounds like a really harsh &quot;spa&quot; experience to me. In fact, if I wanted people to alternatively push me to my physical limit and then build me up as being so great, I'd go to a spa instead...<br />For gosh sakes, if you want some better environmentalism, read John Muir. Read Aldo Leopold. Read Thoreau, even.

0684852756|5.0|... two stars for story. Dull and irritating. I felt as if I spent an evening with a self-absorbed, whiny, even a bit cruel, middle-aged adolescent. But Kureishi is a wonderful wordsmith and certainly makes this character real.
B000002HMH|5.0|I just wanted to explain something to all the people who think this album is bad just because of what they think is &quot;Sell out&quot;.<BR>These two words &quot;Sell out&quot;...what do they mean. What I think they mean is that the person/band who is selling out, is actually making music to sell. That means making their fans happy by making the kind of music the fans want them to make. So if Metallica had made a Master of puppets or Ride the lightning all over again, THAT would be to &quot;Sell out&quot;!!! But what they did with Load, was to make music they like themselves at the time and didn't care what people think about that. If their fans don't like it, well who cares? They have enough money anyway, so now they can do whatever they want with their music. So &quot;Selling out&quot; does not mean that they've made music for the rest of the world. It's all about the fans.<br />My the way, this album is exellent. There's so much feeling to this album. Just listen to the last chorus of Bleeding me. That is brobably the best minute of music of all time. There are of course bad songs too on this album, but it's like that on all the other albums too. Just because a band change, it doesn't mean it's selling out. And it's not just heavy metal which is good music. Heavy rock is fine too!!! :)

B00000BKI4|5.0|Its just beautiful.  Don't listen to it expecting to see God or anything, but just lie back and turn the lights out and relax to it and you'll understand.  It grows on you too.  I hadn't listened to the rev much since the Harmony Rockets CD came out and I was very surprised with the direction they took.  Has a weird wintery feel to it.  Its the kind of thing you listen to while sitting by the fire with snow falling outside the windows.  Take it in a few times and it will keep revealing itself to you.  Then listen to almost anything else and see how grating it feels.    This thing is just really really good.

B00005R87Q|5.0|This film i thought was the (...), i love powerful cars and this film is full of powerful cars, so this film is my cup of tea! I watch it one rainy sunday afternoon with some but i really wanted to watch Tomb raider but it was fully booked, now I am glad it was fully booked, it was well worth watching The Fast and The Furious. By the way i have seen it 5 times now.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a great movie. But I'd never let little kids watch it. There's simply too much crude humor. The DVD is great. The first disc has the games and fun special features - as well as a cropped version of the movie with the sides cut off (I still don't understand the point in this - I don't get why some people like watching movies with the sides of the picture chopped off). The second disc has the more technically detailed special features, as well as the full widescreen movie (the one you should watch, since it has the whole thing - it also has a superior soundtrack since there's a DTS soundtrack). The quality of this transfer is excellent, in part because Shrek is a digitally sourced movie. I suggest everyone buy this movie. And when you watch it - do yourself a favor and watch the second disc. It takes a miniute to get used it it being shrunk down to fit the whole thing on your TV, but it really is nice seeing the sides of the picture:)
B000055QHO|5.0|I reviewed A Day Without Rain about a week ago however I managed to download Isobella onto my computer and wow! WShat a song. While I liked Enyas latest album Isobella surpasses every other songs on A Day Without Rain.<br />Isobella is a beautiful song that has a hounting chorus and beautiful Gaelic lyrics. I have no idea why Japan gets all the good songs. All countries deserve to hear this song.<br />While I somewhat disagree with Kabir Ahamed about it beating out Na Leatha Geal M'Oige and Smaointe, Isobella is a song that stands out on its own. It's a somewhat dark song that could have propelled ADWR to a five star. Enya hasn't put out such a great song in a long time.<br />I highly reccommend that you get this version of ADWR. Incredible work Enya! I hope your next album is a return to your darker more Boadicea-esque sound.

1577311523|5.0|I've read alot of self help and spirituality books and this one is the best so far. Tolle makes the cosmic concepts understandable. I think he must be Meister Eckhart (of the 13th century) reincarnated because I am reading Meister Eckhart's sermons and they sound just like Eckhart Tolle's theology. I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks a way to connect spirituality with religious teachings. The clarity with which the truths are presented convince the reader that Tolle has been fully realized as a master.
B000002IWQ|4.0|This CD is more of a straight forward rock album than Records like &quot;Power WIndows&quot; and the terrable &quot;Hold your fire&quot;.YOu wont hear alot of Keyboards on this one.It takes what they did on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; one step further.The bass Lines are realy funky on this record...the Guitar riffs to.Dont get me wrong...Its not a George Clinton Record, but it does groove more than alot of RUSH Records.Every song on the CD is good .The standouts in My oppinion are &quot;Animate&quot; &quot;Stick it out&quot; &quot;Cut to the Chace&quot; &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; and &quot;Every day Glory.&quot; But it is realy hard to say one song is better than another on this CD.RUSH seems to have found themselvs again after writeing sub- par record after sub- par record throughout most of the 80's.ALot of ppl will disagree But I think this CD is alot better than any record they put in the 80's with the acception of &quot;Moveing Pictures&quot; &quot;Signals&quot; and &quot;Permenant Waves.&quot; I also believe it is every bit as good as 2112(another classic.)IF you are thinking about buying a RUSH cd for the first time this is a good place to start.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This CD is definitely not worth purchasing. The first track contains cursing and phrases with inappropriate meanings, as well as other tracks in the album, which is a poor example to her underage fans. I am disappointed at how someone who probably once was a well-behaved child could turn into such a yucky person. Another reason, which is the main reason why I am writing this, is because it caused my CD player to malfunction, to be more specific, practically explode. It had worked perfectly until I inserted this CD in it. So in conclusion, I advise you all not to buy &quot;Britney&quot;. Spend your money on something more worthwhile, such as Charlotte Church's &quot;Enchantment&quot;.

0783229526|4.0|I was surprised by this film. I bought it because it was directed by Terry Gilliam and I have loved all his other films. This is very different in both the subject matter and style. Although it is arguably no less of a film than (say) Munchausen or Time Bandits, it is for me less enjoyable, just because those films use the innocence of childhood to make you feel good, but this uses the cynicism of experience to make you feel you have just been very, very sick. If this is what being an adult is like, send me back to Jack Lint!<br />I had no idea who Hunter Thompson was before watching this, and still have trouble believing he's real. (No, he's not the chap who wrote about the Beatles). Even if he is real, did he write himself as he truly is in the book, or some abstract version? Did Gilliam take the book version of Hunter Thompson and twist him into a Gilliamesque character? We may never know. What we do know is the care with which Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro play Thompson and his chum Doctor Gonzo.<br />There is an intensity to Depp's performance counterbalanced by the languid Toro which demonstrates uppers and downers in all their ghastly glory. Christina Ricci makes a noteworthy appearance, proving that she isn't just a washed up child star.<br />On the whole, a very interesting and strangely compelling film, but not necessarily a pleasant experience.<br />The DVD has a ton of extras, so it's well worth the money, especially the out-takes which show us something of what the film could have been like if it was longer (it was long enough!).
630289915X|5.0|This is the kind of story that transcends all generations and ages and speaks to each individual.  It is associated with the Christmas holidays and rightly so.  Yet the movie's story about a good man who is frustrated with his life to the point of suicide speaks as loudly today as it did in 1947.<br />Some critics of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; call it &quot;Capracorn&quot; (making reference to the movie's director, Frank Capra), and say that it is unrealistic sentiment, but I disagree.  The story basically shows how a man's life unfolds through a period of years in the town in which he was born.  What he thinks are disappointments and cruel tricks of fate actually lead him to the place he always wanted to be.  He is shown what the lives of his loved ones and friends would have been like had he never been born.  He realizes that those small acts of kindness and love that he has given to people were not insignificant, but made major differences in each and every life.<br />Particularly moving is the scene where the protagonist, George Bailey, superbly played by Jimmy Stewart, prays a silent, but desparate prayer in the town bar.  The answer to that prayer gives George Bailey some unexpected twists and turns, but shows the fabric of his life is so carefully interwoven with those he loves and cares for.<br />This is American filmaking at its very finest.  I highly reccomend this for the whole family.
0517122707|5.0|Throughout the first one-hundred pages of this novel I kept wondering why such a great consensus of readers thought it so stuffed with hilarity. If verisimilitude is still a quality to be looked for in fiction, why in the world would I want to have any association with slob extraordinaire Ignatius J. Reilly! Soon enough, the choice wasn't up to me. But it wasn't because of Reilly himself; rather, it was because of all the other characters, each stringently drawn within parameters one would expect of minor characters, but all interacting with Reilly. My empathy with the main character, therefore, resulted not from Ignatius J. Reilly himself, but from the others in the book who gave me reason to appreciate this man. For most of the rest of the story I laughed the same as everyone before me.
6301797906|5.0|This isn't one of those films which need a lot of explaining to tell why they deserve to be called great.  To those who know something about John Steinbeck's novel, it is enough to say that the picture is way ahead of anything even the most hopeful had reason to expect.  It is all beautifully direct and literal, like clear-cut themes in a symphony.  There is Tom Joad, on parole from prison, going back to his family on their farm.  The shell of a farmhouse, deserted, the family blown out by dust-storms and tractor-farming.  The family, found again, setting out westward in their junky old truck, for work and a place to settle on the soil once more.   The long trek west, over the endless inter-state highways, joing the miserable stream of other families driven away from their own birthright and seeking a promised land of home and work again.  Nunnally Johnson, who wrote the screenplay, had to do something more with Steinbeck's book than cut pages out of it and paste them together.   He had to dramatise it, which meant concentrating its essence while he built it to mounting emotion and action.  If Johnson's script narrows the gist of the story to only what happens to the Joad family, director John Ford had spread it wide again, in the way that only a movie can do.  The chief thing about the acting is that it almost never seems to be acting at all.  Perhaps John Carradine and Grant Mitchell give an occasional impression of doing their stuff, but the rest, from the most casual extra to the stars, might have been caught in some episode of actual life.  Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are the most important because they embody the main spirit of the drama: they both fill their parts with such life, that they are peerless in their playing.  There is, too Ford's fondness for mist and shadows and music-but all in their place here, integral and rarely mannered.  THE GRAPES OF WRATH proved that Hollywood could lead the world in serious as well as merely entertaining pictures; thisis a poem of a film.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is my first Moby CD and let me tell you it is awesome. I haven't really heard much of his old stuff but that doesn't matter because I like this one so much. He really has his own flavor; some songs are good rock tunes and some are pretty, etc..<BR>What I'm trying to say is that he has variety and style. So i would recommend it to anyone.
0380788624|5.0|Just chiming in with everybody else.   It was great a great read - fun and informative.  Crypto's new to me and it was neat to get the gist of it wrapped up in such a great story.<br />Wish I had a broader base of friends to recommend this to!
B000002IJL|5.0|these songs are great, I'm only fifteen, but I love these oldies, they make me wanna go back to the fifties, really. I first saw the movie and now it's  my favourite movie of all times. The actors are just amazing!!!! Everybody should hear this soundtrack, really, the songs are great, Stand by me is sooo beautiful, Everyday touches me every day! And Come go with me is probably my favourite!!<BR>Marie from, Bruges, Belgium xxx
B00000IAU3|5.0|Well, my title pretty much sums everything up. The bottome line is that Dido has such a great voice and it goes so well with her music. I sometimes think that she is underrated, or unrecognized, but she deserves recognition. She is very talented and her whole album proves it.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters and it rocked!!!!!!!! i couldnt wait for it to come out on DVD! its a must buy title

0446677450|4.0|The amount of good, applicable information in this book makes it worth the read.  The way in which Kiyosaki presents the information also allows one to interperate it in a way that makes it aplicable to their life.  The book also provides a way of thinking about money and about life that will prove very usefull for my life.  I have already implimented several of Kiyosaki's lessons and have been very pleased with the results.  I do recomend this book but only for those of you who can stand a slow read. The usefull information is covered and diluted by lots of pointless, useless droneing.
B000000W5L|5.0|Ok, first off, if you are a fan of these popstar wannabes that dance around, but dont play a single note, then this is not the album for you. If you are a fan a great rock music, a member of a band, then step right up and listen to EXILE ON MAIN STREET. This album shows THE ROLLING STONES at a creative high that very few bands are ever capable of reaching. This album is the last in a string of 5 great albums stretching from 1967 to 1972. EXILE takes country, rock, blues, and gospel and weaves together a toxic sound that on first listen will have you scratching your head and wondering what you are listening. This album will take a few listens to grow on you, but it is worth it. This album is one that I find myself going back and listening to whenever I need a jolt of some great music. This album was recorded in Keith Richard's basement in France and while the production may not be top notch, the songs are. You want some great songs to listen to, then here you go: ROCKS OFF, RIP THIS JOINT, SHAKE YOUR HIPS, TUMBLING DICE, SWEET VIRGINIA, SWEET BLACK ANGEL, LOVING CUP, ALL DOWN THE LINE, SHINE A LIGHT,STOP BREAKING DOWN, and the Keith classic HAPPY. So instead of wasting your time and money on these flash in the pan boy bands, go out and listen to some real music that was made by the masters of rock.
B000005RYQ|5.0|I really dug this Band back in the 80's.you had solid Pop Structured tracks that took them very far.as much as I dug them as a Group Sting going Solo even went further for a while.The Police were One of the Most Important Acts over the past 20 plus Years.
0441003257|5.0|I've been a fan of Neil Gaiman and his comics for many many years.  I first picked this book up in high school 8 years ago.  Since then, I have made friends, family, teachers, and even strangers read this book.  I've lost a few copies loaning it out and the one I have left is in terrible shape, but it's always worth it to hear &quot;Thank you so much for introducing me to this author!&quot;  The story is engaging, the characters are very three dimensional, the pace is fast, and the dialog is witty.  Fans of Neil Gaiman will be surprised by the lighter, funnier tone than they would expect from him, but his characteristic references to mythology and religious themes and his iconoclasm are in top form.  I was unfamiliar with the work of Terry Pratchet, but I assume that he was the source of much of the humor.  <br />If you are a Gaiman fan or just a fan of good fantasy/gothic writing, you will love this book!
B00000HZH7|5.0|This album is a pure classic speed metal metal album that puts Possessed in the same category as all the other great speed metal groups of the mid-eighties like Slayer, Destruction, Celtic Frost, Kreator, Sodom and Bathory. Possessed have carefully crafted their own unique evil, gothic sound that has been enormously influnential on scores of later bands. This album is simply brilliant, and it is a must for all death metal fans. How they managed to create such an excellent album while still in high school is beyond me!
B00002Z88D|5.0|What more can I say?.  This double cd is truly amazing.  Rock with orchestra?. Wow!!!. This is the only Metallicas stuff that I ever had. But nothing else matters!!!. Just Buy it, play it and enjoy it. You cant miss it!!
B000001ES9|5.0|Only a real true Rush fan could appreciate this album. One who can truly appreciate the incredible talent that Rush can show in this debut album. I recommend it to anyone who loves Rush, dont listen to it if you have never listened to Rush before but whatever you do, don't listen to people who tell you it (...) - it is a great album and always will be.
B00005R23S|5.0|If you're a fan of Springsteen, I fail to see how you would not be completely impressed and in awe of this.  The sound and video quality is impeccable .. the editing is imaginative yet restrained, allowing the performance to shine through.  As for the track listing, see for yourself !!<br /><br />(I had to edit this review. I left out a 'not' in the original review, completely changing my intent. I love this disc!)
1894003268|5.0|The first in Scenario Productions' &quot;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes&quot; series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect &quot;theater of the mind&quot; listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears's new album is one that promises to show great creativity.  Writing about five of the songs herself they all show how creative she is, however, they also all practically talk about her.  Other than that, it is a great cd.  The cover of &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot; is great and humourous all at the same time.  She does a great job.  As I sit here listening to her CD i dare to wonder, is there more Britney around the corner?  And as I further sit here I can answer my own question.  Britney is not going anywhere.

B00003CXAY|5.0|i first came in contact with this movie when i was about five years old..the only thing that i can remember clearly is the music... when i saw this movie for the first time i didnt understan anything..i thought it was horrible...but when i saw it again i realized what a great movie it was...it gave me a new perspective on the nature and life..., how much the human race is destroying our beatiful world.. , anyone who see this movie must realize that we must stop destoying our world... but unfortunatly it seems that not so many have seen it...becasue its getting worse for every day... i hope one day people will open their eyes and see the reality...<BR>//santadog (sorry for my bad english)
B000001GPX|1.0|Please. If I wanted a product aimed at the lowest common denominator, I'd buy a Big Mac. Listening to this is like having to suffer through a tour at the Louvre- painful and itchy.<BR>If you really want something that moves you, check out the Thai Elephant Orchestra. That's God incarnate.
6305971145|4.0|This is a great colorful Santa Claus movie for the first 45 minutes!!!  <br />&quot;The Santa Claus Movie&quot; is really 2 stories in one;<br />The first story is about SANTA CLAUS - 45 fabulous minutes of meeting Mr &amp; Mrs Claus, learning all about his history, characteristics, and legacy of immortality.  This story is complete and enjoyable.  Visiting the North Pole, meeting the elves, Mrs Claus and seeing the immortal process unfold is the main ingredient.  A true colorful and enjoyable musical score by Henry Mancini.<br />The second story is mindless villanous non-sense.  Misunderstood Elf leaves North Pole seeks peer approval by partnering with toymaker villian. Santa becomes only a supporting character in his Movie!!!!<br />Stick with the first half and you'll love this colorful tale of that jolly old Elf, Santa Claus.<br />The making of extra is delightful.  Santa's Movie is a fun addition to the Christmas library.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i think that this CD is very good, and that Jonh Mayer will be making more money in a few years than Ricky Wright will ever see.  Yo Ricky, why not listen to the Cd first, or at least get some taste.<BR>Brent
B00005QG9J|4.0|A broader range and mellow sound accompany this band's follow-up to their smash Make Yourself.  While Make Yourself is a better album, this one is far superior to some other recent rock releases.  This album is more personal, and a lot more diverse than the last one, but it lacks the edge that made Make Yourself great.<br />I got Morning View the day it was released, and I was completely satisfied.  However, it was replaced a few days later by Nickelback.
0380817683|4.0|I found that this book took a while to get going. Neither is it laugh out loud funny as the reviews claim. But it is one of the most moving books you will read this year (or any other year). At first I thought it was going to be one of those completely unrealistic books about 'how my life completely changed after rehab' but it's pretty realistic and you feel Rachel's pain as she wakes up and smells the coffee.  This really touched me and I'm not usually affected by books. The emotions conveyed in this are definately real.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback breaks through, from the first song that seriously grabs you (Never Again, harshly about an abusive father and taking action against him), to the next one (How You Remind Me), and the CD keeps going.<br />Money Bought and Hollywood are away from those songs enough that the CD doesn't get repetitive and every track is worth paying attention to.  Bought it because Amazon.com said I would like it, and man, do I love it.  <br />I'm going to see them in concert, just because this CD was so great.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has done it again. Yes everyone didn't want her to, but lets face it she is the it girl Christina Aguilera will never be. The songs on the cd are more grown and it sounds better than saying &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; and &quot;I'm So Lucky.&quot;Well to give you a better view on buying this here is a track by track review which may help a little more. 1=lowest and 5=highest<br />1)I'm A Slave 4 U - You must have heard it already. 5 stars<BR>2)Overprotected - Upbeat song saying that she is now grown and doesn't need to be protected. 5 stars<BR>3)Lonely - Okay upbeat song. 4.3 stars<BR>4)I'm Not A Girl,Not Yet A Woman - Nice ballad (basically only one) co-written by Dido. 5 stars<BR>5)Boys - Very good track. It doesn't really sound like a Britney track though. 5 stars<BR>6)Anticipating - Too upbeat. Sounds like a cheesy disco song. 3.9 stars<BR>7)I Love Rock and Roll - Other reviews make this sound dissapointing but it's O.K. 4.9 stars<BR>8)Cinderella - Well if it ain't broke do fix it. Almost like a better version of Stronger. Very good. 5 stars<BR>9)Let Me Be - She should of let this song be. Not to great. 4.1 stars<BR>10)Bombastic Love - This should of been on the Oops I did It Again Album. Very poppy. 5 stars<BR>11)That's Where You Take Me - Almost a ballad but it's still a nice sounding song. 4.2 stars<BR>12)What It's Like To Be Me - Co-written by Justin her boyfriend. Good ending song. Nice Pop tune. 5 stars<br />This album will not be a dissapointment to anyone. It's much better than her other two. It already is breaking records so try it out. Much better than a Christina Aguilera album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The special features alone make this worth owning, but when you get crystal clear images from the great digital movie, there's no topping this hilarious family adventure.  No matter how old you are, (I went with a group of teenagers) you'll love this movie.<br />Here's the bottom line: 2 discs of games, information, fun new interviews of the characters and a longer ending/party, it's an uplifting, wholesome film.<br />A+ on any grading scale.
B000003RCY|5.0|Herzeleid ranks up there with some of the greatest metal albums such Master of Puppets and And Justice for All by Metallica.  I think all of Rammstein's albums are great, but Herzeleid is the first and still the best.  There're a lot of great songs such as Wollt ihr das bett in flammen sehen, Asche zu Asche, and Der Meister.  It's hard and sometimes fast.  Rammstein is one of the most talented metal bands out there (unlike that System of a Down and Linkin Park [...]).  I play Rammstein pretty often in my weekly radio show here at Penn State.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie, be it the old version from 1982, or the newer, DVD version now, is by far, the BEST fantasy movie, and musical score I have EVER seen or heard! I loved this movie since I was 5 years old. And I have ALWAYS ALWAYS wanted the soundtrack to it, but could NEVER find it. And now, there's a DVD of it WITH the soundtrack included!! Who could ask for more?? I HIGHLY HIGHLY recomend this movie, be it for your children, or for yourself. If you don't have it, BUY IT. You'll see what I mean, trust me. ;)
B00000I3JO|5.0|I just had to add my two cents. I first bought this in cassette form at the end of the 80s, and literally wore it out, forcing me to buy another one. Finally, I bought the CD and don't face that problem.<br />Every song is spectacular, and time hasn't dated the CD. Paul Buchanan's voice is hypnotizing, and the music will take you to another place. I listen to all kinds of music, and own nearly a thousand CDs...and &quot;HATS&quot; is my Number One favorite of all of them.<br />The Blue Nile rarely tours, but if they come your way, do yourself a favor and go. I was told when they played in L.A. at the end of the 80s the crowd gave them a standing ovation after EVERY song. Finally, they returned for the release of &quot;Peace at Last,&quot; and I went. And again, they received a standing ovation after every song. I had never (and still haven't) seen anything like it.<br />I can't say enough about this band, so I will stop now. Just find it, and buy it. It will be worth whatever you pay.
B00005R23S|5.0|This DVD makes up for all the misgivings I've had about the HBO special and the CD.  The HBO<BR>show wasn't long enough to feel like a real Springsteen show; The CD was hastily assembled <BR>and the songs questionably sequenced.  The DVD is twice as long as the HBO special, and now feels<BR>like a real show and the songs on the second disc were put together with as much care as<BR>the first disc. The sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a DVD  - unlike the actual<BR>shows, the piano is now at the right sound level. I was very impressed by the way they avoided 2 <BR>pitfalls that often sink live recordings -  the audience noise is not overly loud and there is <BR>no dialogue between  songs.  Camera work and editing is first rate. I saw Springsteen 4 times on <BR>the 1999/2000 tour, and this captures the experience better than I thought any video could.  <BR>It is just great songs and performances all the way through with a band that is at the top of their<BR>game. It's hard to know where to start with the music but that sax solo in Jungleland always blows <BR>me away. I agree with the person who said  they would play this more than any other video - I know <BR>I  will.
B00003CY0V|1.0|In a year with a seemingly endless array of creatively devoid commercial films, Dominic Sena's (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), Kalifornia) monotonously incoherent, visually grandiloquent, and manically unoriginal Swordfish fits right in to 2001's aesthetically sparkling yet dramatically inadequate parlor of creative misfires, strategic miscalculations, and just plain mediocre stink bombs. Adorned by cardboard cut-out acting, a fiendishly under-whelming techno-spiked background of hackneyed terrorist stereotypes and undeveloped law-enforcement formulistic stooges, a narrative hogwash cluttered with typically pedestrian and inventively bankrupt sub-plots that do nothing more than accentuate the film's lack of breadth, an exceptionally halfhearted auto-piloted performance by John Travolta (alas continuing on his second horrible movie phase) that may initially impress but eventually grovels into artistically sterile complacency, and blatantly unimaginative action conventions that are stylistically astounding albeit momentously stale ,after the film's initial overwhelming sensation wears off, culminate in stranding Swordfish into only fulfilling it's entertainment aspirations through excess and overkill alone leaving out content, drama, pathos, and storytelling integrity replacing it with a superbly displayed and provocatively decorated entertaining nothingness of noncommittal  that infuriates with its dysfunctional diet of by-the-numbers entertainment.<br />For those easily deluded by eye candy, Swordfish easily has as much stylistic bravado as the Wachowski Brothers' The Matrix in appearance only. Underneath it's keenly realized pictorial anarchy of ball-bearing explosions, shock nudity, M-60 gunfights, impressive set decadence, and flying buses, we are left with a liquidated creative barrenness supplementing for an extremely unacceptable farce of movie by devising a semblance of content to deceive the audience with. By means of concocting this visage of real movie to cover the shambles of imaginative ineptness all around it, Swordfish is only an intensely ornamented empty shell casing of film that engrosses through it's dynamic distraction of it's problems rather than through just telling a powerful story. Frankly, Swordfish is the dubious epitome of how not to make an action film. Stay away at ALL COSTS. This is the proverbial pits.<br />As for Swordfish's DVD options, it consists of a very impressive anamorphic widescreen presentation, two Making-Of documentaries, a Dominic Sena commentary track, the theatrical trailer, and several other options. Ironically, the special features are highly more preferable than the infernal film itself.<br />It is recommended for all living organisms to STAY AS FAR AWAY from this quality toxic waste dump as feasibly possible. Only seasoned crack film reviewers should come within a hundred miles of this film abomination.<br />I rather watch a Mr. Rogers marathon instead of this.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Even showing up on DVD couldn't save this movie. It's too much for kids. Jar Jar's antics annoyed the heck out of me and got downright ridiculous. Why couldn't anything be done on purpose. I think little five year olds still would have liked Anakin and Jar Jar if they killed a droid on purpose. Anakin destroyed a whole Droid Control Ship and saved the day on accident and Jar Jar couldn't even pick up a weapon and fight droids invading. He did it all with his clumsyness which made the movie sooo unbelievable. The droids didn't even seem like a threat when no Gungans died and thousands of droids did. Crazy isn't it. It's not like I wanna see good guys die, but where's the threat if none do. Look at Return of the Jedi or A New Hope, many got killed trying to take out the Death Star and you were left wondering, &quot;are they gonna do it?&quot;. The fighting scenes with Darth Maul were awesome, best parts. Episode 1 basically represents Star Wars since it is supposed to be watched first. Not a good beginning to the saga. Too much of a little kids movie and it brought down Star Wars. You go from the threat of the Rancor and the Wampa monster over to Jar Jar. Oh well, Episode II: Attack of the Clones looks AWESOME! But so did the trailer of The Phantom Menace.
B00005N9CV|1.0|This is not the Diana Krall I know and love.  The orchestra on every track is simply not her style and the singing is very uninspired.  One or two phrasings in &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; caught my attention; otherwise, there is nothing of the playfulness, moodiness or sultry singing she exhibits on virtually every other track she's ever cut.  And then, of course, there's no piano to even compare with her other CD's.  I was so disappointed I tried to give this CD to a friend but he gave it back to me after listening to it.
0553213105|5.0|As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book.  In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest.  It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.<br />The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot;  And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits.  In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius.  Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.<br />Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel.  To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax.  Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people.  It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.<br />In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny.  Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up.  There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience.
B00005OWIU|5.0|The first note makes chills run through my body-(everytime I hear it) And every note after that keeps me wondering what is going to happen next. I can actually visualize what is going on, sceen by sceen and the movie is not even out yet. BRAVO!!!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|I originally bought this movie on VHS and tried to watch it on my 53 inch HDTV and had to stop it because the quality was terrible. Low grade tape made it look worse than is I recorded it off TV.  So then I get the DVD and more of the same.  The transfer was terrible the picture was digitized.  The text for alien languages were jagged. Just terrible.  So I'm sure Lucas will now release a superbit version so we have to buy it again and he gets more money.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is about the growing up of Francie Nolan, the main character.  It tells of the hardships of living in a poor Brooklyn neighborhood.  This book digs right into the heart of human nature, and shows a people sometimes brutal, yet oddly loving and kind toward each other.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful book, and I highly recomend it.
0060194995|5.0|I remember reading this book back in high school.   I wasn't really into reading books, but somehow this one really got my attention from very beginning to the end.   I don't really need to write about this masterpiece since this masterpiece is backed with many acclaimed reviews.   What this book really wants to point out is the presence of racism.  Not only Harper Lee describes this small town with his own imagination beautifully, but also writes what he wants to say to the world of racism.    There's this one speech by Atticus toward the end, and let me tell you, it will touch your heart with inspiration, the sense of justice, and determination.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I visited the real life battlefield and having seen the movie before and after I visited made me realize how good a movie it is. My favorite scenes are Pickett's Charge and the 20th Maine going on a bayonet charge in the woods. What makes the film great is that it was filmed on location and that its on DVD finally. The VHS version is good too but get the DVD if you can.
B00005QDW5|2.0|As an offspring of one of the biggest Pink Floyd fans out there (Mother), I have grown to love this mysterious rock band that had changed in their 30 years of existence. I think that it's about time that a collection of Floyd's best works be brought together in one album. I have pros and cons in my opinion of this album....first let's praise.<br />The album certainly covers Floyd in all it's forms; from the earliest days with Syd Barrett to the final days in Mr. Waters' absence, it's all there. The arrangement of non-chronologial order of the tracks (given year they were recorded, respectively)<BR>is an effctive method of &quot;juke-box Floyd&quot; for any fan. I also like the addition of &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free,&quot; a song previously only found in the movie &quot;The Wall&quot;...very nice touch.<br />However, I also have complaints and questons.<br />First off, and not too big a deal, is the missing seven minutes from the song &quot;Echos.&quot; The editor cleverly shortened the song so well that it's hardly noticable unless you are very keen.<BR>Okay, now here's my big objections:<br />Curiously, my favorite floyd album, along with a few others, have been left out of this collection entirely.<BR>Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma, Obscured by Clouds (soundtrack from the film &quot;The Valley&quot;), and More (sountrack from the film &quot;More&quot;) all have no spots whatsoever on this collection.<br />Now I guess to the average Floyd listener, this is no biggie, because they may not have even known of or listened to these albums before, paying more attention to the better known albums (The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here), it's more of a personal grudge that I have with the collection. <br />If I were a part of making this collection, I would have opted for a third CD, so as not to have been so restrictive in the amount of space for songs. A third CD would have, indeed, allowed selections from the missing albums to be present on the collection (and believe me, there are songs on all of them that are worthy of being a part of this collection), plus, room for a few songs that were left out on the other albums (Brain Damage from Dark Side, Have a Cigar from Wish You Were Here, Mother from The Wall...etc.).<br />So, in conclusion, this collection is very well done...but it could have been done better.<br />~Miggy~
6302794331|5.0|Brain Henson son of the late Jim Henson directed this movie. And which I'm sure you all know it is the first muppet movie since the death of Jim Henson in 1990. In the movie, Kermit The Frog, and other muppets play characters from a Christmas Carol. Note that there are humans like Micahel Caine in this movie, but more muppets. As the movie opens, Scrooge hates chritmas and gets invited to spend Christmas with his nephew Fred and his wife Clara.<br />Scrooge: Why did you even get married?<br />Fred: Why? Because I fell in love.<br />Isn't that why a lot of people get married? But to you think since 1990 the muppets has gotten long with out Jim Henson as thier director? But why did it take 2 years to make a new Muppet movie?
0553712837|5.0|As for my first AUDIO book..it was very much worth the four hours i spent listening too....John Grisham...your the best !!
0790736039|5.0|This movie rules! I'm a huge fan of the book, and I can say that the movie really does it justice. The whole story involves a group of kids, all &quot;losers&quot;, drawn together by a supernatural force to confront an ancient evil that takes the form of a malignant clown.<br />Tim Curry was, I think, born to play Pennywise the Clown. Sadistic, waddling freak with his doughy, grinning white face, red wet lips stetched as wide as his ears. In his clown form, he is able to charm the younger kinds, but he becomes the fears of the older ones, taking them down into his sewer dungeon to feed on them. The kids that finally beat the monster, Big Bill and Haystack and Bev and the rest of the Loser's Club, manage to force It back into It's lair, not dead, but nearly mortally wounded....<br />Driven by a feeding cycle, It rises again decades later, and the Loser's Club, now forgotten in adulthood, is drawn back together to face the monster one final time. This was originally made-for-television, so the movie is only capable of so much, but I think that fact alone gives the movie special merit. The casting was pretty much dead-on (especially in the case of Pennywise) and the special effects were surprisingly good. Probably the fact that the film makers were incapable of going the hack-and-slash rated-R route helped to improve the suspense and the atmosphere. The book was great, and the movie was great. I would recommend them both. I think that the humble perfection of a classic good versus evil story can sometimes be overlooked. The purity of a tale in which you can easily lose yourself. And that's just what It is. Two big thumbs up from me.

0743216458|3.0|Ambrose's account, the basis for the HBO miniseries, certainly makes interesting and often moving reading. I have been reading it bit by bit after watching each TV episode which aids my understanding of elements glossed over in the miniseries. If you've been watching Band of Brothers, reading the book will enhance the experience.<br />Sadly the quality of the writing is poor in places. All to often Ambrose slips in military acronyms for brevity that will leave regular readers without a clue as to what he is talking about. MLR, OP, CP, S2? And for what is supposed to be an historical account, the book is peppered with erroneous detail (see Dr. Forczyk's review).<br />It's a pretty much one sided tale (Think:- How E Company won the war in Europe almost single handed) which has actually lent itself very well to the TV production. It would perhaps have been better if Ambrose had written it as a dramatised &quot;based on a true story&quot; style book, rather than trying to pass it off as a definitive history. As history I'd give it 2 stars, as a fiction I'd give it 4 stars, but since it's both I'll split the difference and give it 3.
B000002N3N|3.0|To my mind, TMOT represents Enya's low water mark (excuse the pun). This was the CD that wrested me away from full devotion to her work. Not that the CD is bad. By other artists' standards this is definitely above average. But for Enya, it is simply a retread. Repackaging of previous musical ideas. Little in the way of innovation.<br />I find in reading reviews of her music that reviews fall into several categories. The lemming reviews, are those by devotees who blindly accept any of her offerings with equal fervor. The musical snobs, who castigate her work as being unsophisticated and trite. The newbies, who are hearing Enya's work for the first time and think the latest (their first exposure to Enya) is the be-all, end-all. And then there's me, the nostalgic, offering what I feel is an objective take on how a CD ranks in an artist's overall repertoire. That said, Watermark is pure genius, the best album of the last twenty-five years. Shepherd Moons is also brilliant, though inevitably a notch below its peerless predecessor. TMOT continues the slide, dipping into mediocrity, territory that Enya had never before chartered. On account of the disappointment I had with TMOT, I still haven't shelled out for her latest CD, ADWR, but I'm sure my curiosity will win out.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I've heard quite a few of diana krall's older songs but this is my first cd of her. I'm not a jazz expert but I think that her voice is definitely better in this album. <BR>  I've read some other reviews and I do not really agree with some that say that her songs lack passion. I think that her songs in this album are in fact passionate... unfortunately, you may tend to compare and expect her to sing like classic jazz singers. Thus you may fail to listen to what feelings SHE wants to convey in her songs. I think that if you were to enjoy this album fully, you should not expect anything but listen with an open mind. <BR>  The conclusion is that if you are looking for a classic jazz cd, this is not for you. If you're looking for good music, good vocals and something new, this is a definite choice.
B000002GEV|5.0|Good Lord on toast!!! If I hear one more person state that Supertramp is a pop band, I'm gonna go scooters!!! <br />What does a group have to do and be, in order for them to get their recognition as a great and fantastic group of musicians???<br />Crime of the Century...a pop song??? doh!!! ... <br />&quot;Rudy&quot;...a pop song??? doh!!!<br />&quot;Asylum&quot;... a pop song??? doh!!!<br />Pink Floyd could only wish they had put out an album like this!<br />Not taking anything away from Pink Floyd, however, when this album came out, I think it scared the living bejesus out of most PF fans cause they didnt think anyone else could come up with a concept album such as this. Then to go on to create some of the great commercial successes that they did in the 80's as Supertramp did, must have made Pink Floyd cringe...as well as all of their devoted fans. <br />Yeah, well, after &quot;The Wall&quot; that was pretty well it wasn't it?<BR>Even then, &quot;The Wall&quot; leaves a lot to be desired doesn't it?<br /> I can't understand why most people are so quick to lambaste and be so critical of Supertramp? Give them their due for they deserve it. The &quot;Crime of The Century&quot; album is one to be reckoned with in all aspects. Do not for a minute disregard songs such as &quot;Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;... these were big numbers in an even bigger album. To dismiss them as pop songs is the same as saying Pink Floyds &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; is commercial hogwash. Strange how it is that you can hear Dreamer and Money being played simultaneousley on many FM channels???, however no one be-littles Pink Floyd??? <br />Put both songs into perspective though, and you'll see them both deserving of their merits. Also, listen to the entire album(COTC) from start to finish, you can see where &quot;Dreamer&quot; fits in,... it's a subtle release for the person that is slowly going insane here. Perhaps having a happy moment... surely this is allowed???<br /> I guess I see this album for what it is, and that is something that takes us on a journey and allows us to relate to a part of ourselves that we all know and yet, are afraid to let in. Crime of the Century is an album that speaks volumes.<br />&quot;School&quot;, is probably one of rocks most underated numbers to date!!!<br />Pink Floyd had Alan Parsons engineer the DSOTM album and if you need proof of this, listen to the first few albums that The Alan Parson's Project did. Supertramp had only themselves to produce COTC and subsequent albums.<br />I have to say that COTC is one great and fantastic album and to give it any less merit would be a sin, but judge it for your self, get this album, listen to it, and for heaven's sake, please... please!!!... do not let anyone tell you this is a pop band.<br />Supertramp did go on to release &quot;Even in The Quietest Moments&quot; and &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, but this is the direction that they chose to go. A lot had to do with the stylings of Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies and this brought them into the 80's in the fashion that they are now being rated upon, and with that being said, could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your personal preferences. <br />Good for them that they were able to take the people that recognized their talents and carry those as well as others that loved their musical genious and keep us enthralled with what these guys were all about. <br />To me, &quot;It's Raining Again&quot;, and &quot;The Logical Song&quot; just exemplifies how such a talent was able to come on board mainstream and attract the large numbers of fans that these kind of songs did. Do not dismiss however for one brief moment that their earlier works were &quot;pop&quot; like. The vision that they had, came forth very strongly and hearing their results are proof of that.<br />Listen to &quot;Fools Overture&quot;(off of the Even in The Quietest Moments album)... and this will give you an idea of their heartfelt compassion, their respect and love for the music and the point that they make. Even with a topic such as this, they still find a way of giving us hope through their music. (Another underated song in my opinion)... I wonder if this is considered a pop song? <br />Supertramp is not a &quot;pop&quot; band and should not be considered as such. Listen to their earlier recordings,... follow their music, and you'll see for yourselves, that these guys are more than talented. When you get to &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; enjoy it for what it is... another great album, laid down in simpler ways, but nonetheless an album full of quality songs... done by a group of extremely talented musicians.<br />Crime of the Century...<BR>...best way to hear this album?... put it on while your alone, with headphones... turn it up a bit... ENJOY!!!<br />Thanks... Kim
B000050XEI|5.0|I'm currently a graduate student and purchased this CD in hopes of finding a mellow CD to listen to while studying.  I found it!  Enya's mellow vocals and soothing instrumentals really help me unwind and concentrate on the task at hand.  I enjoy listening to this CD at other times, too.  It's very relaxing.

0385484518|4.0|I don't know why I didn't pick this little gem-of-a-book sooner.  I remember there being a lot of talk about it - there was even a TV movie made of it.  But for whatever reason, I never picked it up.  Then a friend of mine read it and said I must do the same.<br />I said, &quot;Great, can I borrow your copy?&quot;  <br />&quot;Absolutely not.&quot; was her reply.  <br />She said it was good enought to warrant my purchasing and important enough to have in my own modest book collection.  So, I picked it up.  In two short days, I read this wonderful little book and feel that I too had the luxury of my own personal sessions with Morrie.  How lucky Mitch Albom was to have known him and to become reintroduced to him at such an important time in both of their lives.<br />Morrie's messages are simple and they focus on living in the moment, sharing ourselves and loving one another.  He is wise, funny, poingant and right on the money with his thoughts and observations.  <br />Many people already have this book. But if you know a few like me who haven't picked it up, this would make a great and inexpensive gift that they will truly thank you for.

B000001OAA|5.0|If youre looking for great alternative music, look no further than the debut from Garbage. With Butch Vig's wizardry and Shirley Manson's smart mouth, Garbage delivers a trash bag full of tricks and treats that never get old or dated. The aftermath of the classic Nevermind album from Nirvana, Garbage revived the hip and witty side of alt-rock, fusing it with electronica and sweet ear candy that practically drips from the speakers like honey. Opening with  why-was-this-not-a-single &quot;Supervixen&quot;, Garbage just glides by, spinning yarns of depression, religion, revenge, and stupid girls. Ive heard people say its not raw enough, too calculated and over produced, and i could not disagree more. Its the most played rock album in my collection, and I think its still hip, intelligent, and powerful since it came out in '95. &quot;Vow&quot; is my favorite song on the album. I highly recommend this one. You will not be dissapointed.
B00002R0MC|2.0|Despite the millions upon millions of fans worldwide that swear by Robert Nesta Marley's Island Records product, none of these sides (with the exception of the recently released Jamaican mix of &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; as well as the expanded version of &quot;Exodus&quot;) really captures Marley at his best.  All of Marley's Island offerings were doctored in the studio upon receipt by Island Records owner Chris Blackwell in the U.K. (by the likes of Rolling Stones' touring keyboardist Rabbit), softening any raw roots edges to meet a more &quot;populist&quot; (read: caucasion) audience.  Although songs such as &quot;One Love&quot; have been played to death (in a manner not unlike Van Morrison's &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;), Marley's 2 albums with Lee Scratch Perry have been ignored in lieu of this mediocre material.  &quot;African Herbsman&quot; and &quot;Rasta Revolution&quot; are far more indicative of a truer reggae context than the reggae-lite/pop oriented sounds contained within &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot; - do yourself a favor and investigate these 2 titles (and the embryonic Wailers on C.S. Dodd's Studio One label if so inclined); you'll be left wondering what all the fuss re: the Island era (other than the recent aforementioned reissues) is all about after a listen.  &quot;One Love&quot; indeed.
0671042858|4.0|The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon is not Stephen King's best work. Its not complicated and involved as The Stand, or as bone chilling as The Shining. But It works. The woods are a scary place, and I used to be terrified of them as a kid. The idea of a little heroine with a possibly haunted walkman is a simple formula, not too big on horror, but big on courage and faith; which is another formula used in most of King's books. Trisha joins Dolores Claiborne or Jesse from Gerald's Game in Stephen's heroine against evil club. The baseball stuff was boring, since im not a sports fan, but it did have its purpose, and the ending could have been a little more scarier, because we were expecting a big climax. But it didnt, and it is an enjoyable book nevertheless. Not laying it on too thick, horror tactics this time around were replaced with old fashioned suspense and anxeity, and thats not so bad. A good quick read, worth giving a try.

0385505833|1.0|After reading the first chapter of Skipping Christmas on the internet I was motivated enough to part with some of my hard-earned money to buy a copy.<br />  Unfortunately I wasted my money. The rest of the book did not live up to the first chapter.<br />  Having read some of Grisham's exciting writing,I am having trouble with the notion that this is one of his books. His other books have main characters who are strong individuals. The Krank's, on the other hand are wishy-washy, afraid of their neighbors, terrified of disapproval by others. The theme of the book-that Christmas has become an expensive chore instead of a delight-certainly has merit. Luther Krank's decision to &quot;skip&quot; Christmas (meaning skip all the usual preparations) and go on a cruise instead seems innovative and I cheered him. But the rest of the book is spend with Luther and Nora abolutely COWERING in fear over what their neighbors say and do.<br />  Very frustrating silly  book. Anyone want to buy mine?<br />Lynn Badler
6302054982|5.0|The rise and fall of turn-coat witness protected \\"wiseguy\\" Henry Hill, is portrayed perfectly by Ray Liotta in this biopic of sorts. Frankly, I am surprised Liotta's career didn't explode after this. Then again, ho-hum \\"Dances With Wolves\\" beat this film as 1990s best, so you can't explain taste in Hollywood.<br /><br />All the performances are powerhouse here. Robert DeNiro plays Jimmy Conway, a close associate, who can't ever be a \\"made\\" man because he's only half Italian.  He plays his part with a perfectly cold calculating ruthlessness.  He's loyal until the Luthtansa heist he masterminds is exploited by all the associates involved.  Conway is adamant about telling each person not to show off.  Several don't listen, so he offs each offender one by one. There is a shocking scene where an associate who buys a flamboyant Pink Cadu is soon parked under a bridge murdered behind the wheel, wife at his side. We're treated to the shocking visual as the piano tacet ending of the song \\"Layla\\" booms in on the soundtrack.  This is only one of many examples where Goodfellas, has the right song for every scene.  DeNiro's best scene is where he finds out one of his friends is killed, (I won't say who in case you've not seen this somehow),  and he is so overcome with emotion he cries hysterically while smashing a phone on the glass of an old fashioned outdoor \\"Superman\\" phonebooth and then knocking it over completely with an angry shove.  Can that really be done though?  Aren't they attached to the ground?<br /><br />Joe Pesci is sociopathic extraordinaire Tommy DeVito. He's so unhinged, the slightest insult turns him deadly, and there's nothing too grisly for him to deal with.  He has no compuntion about exhuming decayed bodies while talking about eating sausage and peppers.<br /><br />Henry Hill played by Liotta is more of a lover than a killer in this movie, often shocked at the violence of his associates, and preferring to keep a stable of girls on the side, much to the constant anger of his nice jewish  wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Piles of cash keep her quiet for a bit.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie is when Billy Batts, a made guy, insults Tommy in a bar while having drinks. Billy, played by mob movie regular Frank Vincent, tells Tommy to \\"Go Get your f-ing shinebox!\\" He insults his position, reminding him of when he was a shoeshine boy.  Jimmy and Henry drag Tommy out of the bar seething, but return before Billy leaves. They wait until the place is empty, have a few drinks like  friends, and then Tommy and Jimmy  literally stomp Billy to death while Henry watches in shock, to the tune of Donovans 60s classic \\"Atlantis.\\"  This song is so perfect for this scene for no reason I can think of, but it just  works.<br /><br />From Henry's early days as a wanna-be errand boy for well played mentor and fatherly boss Paul Sorvino, to his rise as a close non-made associate, and ultimately his fall as a busted paranoid coke head, there's not a badfella moment in the two and a half hours running time of this film.<br /><br />One flaw is at the point where Henry is first seen all grown up, and starting his Goodfella life. Henry and Tommy are leaning against a '65 Chevy Impala and the subtitle says \\"Idlewild airport 1963.\\" Even for people who don't know cars, we've all seen enough rap videos to know what a '63 Impala looks like!!

0446677450|2.0|This book might have been useful a few years ago when we were still in the midst of a real estate and stock market bubble, but sort of dated today after the bubble has clearly burst.  The author boasts of investing in small speculative stocks, the types of investments that have cost American investors trillions of dollars in capital losses from the recent stock market secular bear market we find ourselves in.<br />Following this type of investment advice in the current economic environment might take you out of the middle class and on to the welfare line.  Maybe pick it up again in 10 years when it will be safe again to invest in securities and probably deflated real estate environment.<br />The most interesting tidbit from the book is the authors point of view that buying an expensive home that's beyond ones means is a liability rather than an asset.
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down  By Mark Bowden<br />Read this book!<br />The book is about the disaster that befell American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993.  A repeat of everything that is wrong with the UN, police actions, nation-building and using American soldiers as fodder.  It was to this reader a 'synecdoche' for the entire Viet Nam War - another example of fighting without objective and having the high tech, heavyweight warriors being chased out by pajama wearing, 90 pound, under nourished, low tech Somalians as the stand-in for the Viet Cong.   When the bodies piled up, the brass would have swept it under the rug until CNN showed a US pilot getting dragged through the streets.   Then the orgy of finger pointing began and culminated with someone's head  on a stick - Les Aspin's, the Secretary of Defense.   Those that fail to learn from the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them.<br />Even though sad in perspective, I give it four and a half stars for an utterly fascinating read, one of the best combat diaries, equipped with the letters from the girlfriend and the guy who made everybody laugh, dying first.  This is a war story to end all war stories: an urban battle, a jihad, a street fight, a massive helicopter assault, a rescue operation,  and even 2 Congressional Medal of Honor winners, awarded sadly enough, posthumously.  Bowden pulls from his arsenal every human emotional weapon to shoot at the reader;  hate, love, revenge, joy, dread,  horror and sadness.  The story depicts the futility of war - the senselessness of it, and the complete absence of God.  Readers as voyeurs, from the safety of their homes, watch men in combat revert to their primordial selves and fight to survive with pure bestial fury.  War is frightening. <br />Bowden makes one feel the loss of comrades and countrymen and their innocent beliefs.   He reports the awe and horror that Americans felt as they watched civilian Somalian men, women and children run into to the streets into a hail of bullets to shoot at our soldiers!  We were supposedly there to help them, to feed their starving. Then we learn that the Somalians were told the Americans would force them to become Christians - creating jihad!  What tragedy the world has wrought!  The waste of it all, the foolishness of  it all!<br />Bowden wove the facts like a novel and did our Delta Force and Rangers a great service by telling their heroic story.  None braver, and an eye opener for every fat and soft American, lying on their couch in front of their big screen TV, comfortable with the knowledge but also afraid, of the kind of man it takes  to defend the borders or climb into the caves of Afghanistan, willing to die while defending us.   The book could very well be a nightmare precursor for US troops awaiting a similar fate in Afghanistan.<br />The whole book is  a 15 hour battle detailing America's attempt to storm a building in the &quot;Mog&quot; to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid, a Somali warlord and/or  his henchmen.  The one hour operation turned from a lightning raid to a long drawn out perilous thunderstorm as every Somalian, and we mean every Somalian, that could shoot a gun, ran into the streets and did so.   Some of the &quot;skinnies&quot; as the Somalians were called, had RPG's, rocket propelled grenades that brought down two Black Hawk helicopters.  The Americans captured Aidid's henchmen but saw the battle plan fall to pieces as their treasured Black Hawks fell from the sky.  It then became an endurance tale as 100 American soldiers,  bleeding, dying, without water and ammunition and a fading hope of reinforcements, held out against a force of thousands of  armed and courageous Somalians in the midst of their crumbling city.   The Americans  waited for humvees and armored personnel carriers to muster and try to reach them as the Somalians started huge tire fires in the streets and shot at everything that moved.  <br />Bowden painstakingly put every minute of the 15 hour mayhem into chronological order and then described in molecular detail  every sucking chest wound, RPG blast, TOW missile strike,  blood soaked pant leg,  mini-gun barrage,   genital mutilation and cry of dread uttered by US soldiers.  The reader, heart racing, becomes as helpless as the trapped Rangers waiting for a rescue team that has lost its way.  Bowden brings our the bright red of war wounds as the reader cringes with sorrow and guilt.   He even traveled to the Mog in 1997 and interviewed the Somalians who fought in the battle - which brought fresh insight to the book and more senselessness to the entire UN operation.<br />Mike Durant, helicopter pilot, is pulled from the crash and saved from an angry mob by a Somalian who sees a good price.  He is brought to safety as a bargaining chip by Aidid's people.  Clinton cuts a deal, and we run.  Our dead heroes - fought for absolutely nothing - Vietnam all over again
B00005QDW5|4.0|Echoes (also the name of a track which originally was going to be used for the final sequence in the movie classic &quot;2001: A Space Oddisey&quot;) is a very good compilationof Pink Floyd material from all their musical periods: with Syd Barrett (their founder), pre-Wall and even post-Wall/post-Roger Waters (there's &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Marooned&quot; to account for their last two studio albums). Plus the album comes bundled with lyrics packaged in a very artful cover designed by Storm Thorgeson (does the name Hipgnosis sound more familiar maybe?)<br />As with all great musical acts, it's extremely hard to come up with a compilation of Pink Floyd's best material without leaving out things that will be considered essential by someone. And though this album attempts to be all things to most people, the fact that some of their long songs have been edited down so that more material can be fit in the discs, and that not even one new song has been included in it, explains why a compilation of works from such a great band falls short and currently only averages four stars in the reviews of their fans here.<br />However, having said this, if you have absolutely NO Pink Floyd material in your music collection, this double-album will expose you to all their musical periods (with a little more emphasis, perhaps, on their initial stages) so that you can then go out and start your Pink Floyd collection.
0761536434|1.0|This is a useful book if you want gossip on the US industry and its people and background. <br />It is not history, since the author makes no attempt to distinguish text obtained from interviewees from other source detail of events.

B00000JGHM|4.0|In order to rate this DVD, you have to look at two distinct entities. 1) The Movie 2) The DVD<br /> The Movie - Michael Mann is one of the premier directors for those of us who enjoy Home theatre. His rock scores move easily from foreground to background. The Cast is excellent of course; Pacino, DeNiro, Voight and Kilmer are all excellent as you would expect, and it is one of the best good guy bad guy scripts ever written.  Some of the more modern film makers would do well to take note of how the sub-plots and character development build and maintain in this film. You actually care what happens to supporting actors in this story. The Movie itself I rate as 5 Stars. Excellent.<br />The DVD - Again, with any Michael Mann film, the sound was incredible.  You could hear shell casings bouncing off the ground, and at one point during a shoot out with an incredible amount of breaking glass, I felt the need to brush some glass off my shoulder.  Doesn't get better than this! Dolby Surround 5.1 worked amazingly well on this film.  This is the kind of movie that makes you truly pleased you bought a Surround Sound system.  On the other hand....Where is the EXTRAS??<br />No Actor or Director Interviews, No commentary, No deleted scenes, not even the typical cast and crew filmographies!  Why buy it in DVD?  Another down side?  Cheap Case. It isn't a hard plastic case, but one of those cheap cardboard containers that don't close properly. As a matter of fact, the DVD came loose from the holder during shipping and was slightly scratched.<br />  So here you have it. Excellent Movie, (inferior) case, and non-existant extras that we buy DVD's for. Consider renting this film as opposed to purchasing.  DVD - 2 Stars.

The part when the young girl convinced her in-laws that she could not stay married because of a dream was so fascinating.  It was so dramatic, like suddenly an idea just popped into her head.  Well, I am sitting there wondering where did the idea come from, and how come she didn't think of it before. Did she receive help from a dream, or did the dream just predict what she was going to do?
B00005Q4ED|1.0|I have always enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre.  George C. Scott is superb as Rochester, and while Susannah York is a bit old to be playing Jane she does a fine job.  Great visuals, atmosphere and casting of other characters makes this one of the better versions.<br />This DVD, however is atrocious.  The cover claims the film has been digitally remastered, yet we are presented with a washed-out picture filled with scratches.  Far worse, ALMOST AN ENTIRE SCENE IS MISSING--the film jumps from the end of one scene to almost the end of another (cadeaux scene).  And last, the cover uses a picture of Scott from an entirely different film (Murders in the Rue Morgue, I think).
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the best films I have ever watched, in fact I bought the DVD before I even had anyting to play it on.<br />The art work is excellent, the story excellent, even the dub is very well done, it's hard to describe just how good this film is.<br />This is one film that non-anime fans can watch and enjoy.
0060282983|5.0|Charlotte is a spider and Wilber is a pig, who has just found out that his fate is to grace the farmer's table as bacon and ham.  The warm hearted spider befriends the pig and sets about to save his life by spinning webs that promote Wilbur.  &quot;Terrific&quot;, &quot;Radiant&quot;, and &quot;Some Pig&quot; are among the slogans she uses to transform opinions about Wilbur.  Helping in her in her task are the barnyard residents chiefly the local rat Templeton.<br />This is an unlikely pair of friends (as so many are), with Wilbur never quite able to overcome his distaste for the way in which Charlotte gains her sustenance.  But it is a genuine friendship and all the more touching for the differences that the pair have to overcome.  In the end both Charlotte and Wilbur make heavy sacrifices in the name of that friendship.<br />This book is funny and touching and captivating from the first page to the last.  No childhood should be without it.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I saw this movie in the theaters this summer and it was such a bummer. I could not belive that someone would approve such a lousy script and make it into an equally lousy movie.  My suggestion is to rent this before you buy. If you haven't seen it, watch it first. Don't buy it until you have sat through it once because you will just winding up hating yourself for wasting the money on it!  I hope that if they make a follow up it is much better and not full of plot holes and bad fx's!
0060012331|5.0|This is a wonderful, dark and hilarious story.  It's for children, the same way the original Brothers Grimm stories were for children.  It's funny and frightening, and in the best Pratchett tradition, makes you re-think the &quot;fairy tales&quot; you grew up with.
0780631684|4.0|great movie to laugh and jump at. its a great slumber party movie, not too heavy, but still good. the alternate ending isnt very good tho. :-(
B00005KARK|4.0|This sweet animated film (only 64 minutes long) is truly a Disney treasure. The simple story is about a little elephant that just doesn't fit in because of his freakishly large ears. Timothy, a little circus mouse, befriends Dumbo and sees only beauty in his new friend. Dumbo entertains us, as well as teaches us a timeless lesson about love and tolerance in a world that is often times unkind and cruel. The animation is rather simple as compared to the detail found in Snow White or Pinocchio, but it somehow works because of the film's other strengths. In Dumbo your emotions run the full spectrum from laughter to tears. The musical numbers are memorable, especially &quot;Baby Mine&quot;. Baby Mine is a tearjerker if ever there was one. The crows add great comic relief toward the end of the film. The Special Bonus Features on the DVD are a real nice touch and generous. Among the extras are a &quot;Celebrating Dumbo&quot; featurette, two animated shorts, and a Music Video of &quot;Baby Mine&quot; sung by Michael Crawford that will have you sobbing all over again, guaranteed! The only complaint I have was mentioned by other reviewers, that being the grainy quality of the film. This flaw simply does not make any sense. I would have expected that Disney, promoting Dumbo as the &quot;60th Anniversary Edition&quot;, would have bothered to restore the picture and audio elements. The DVD back cover makes claims to Dumbo being digitally restored and remastered with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, but it certainly is not evident to me. I guess we should be thankful for the merits of the DVD which are many. Recommended.
0061040967|4.0|This is Pratchett's best work since 'Interesting Times'. This one includes an all star cast of: Rincewind, Cohen the Barbarian, Captain Carrot and a host of supporting characters including,of course, Death. The art by Paul Kidby is truly wonderful. I can't imagine reading this without the great artwork. The art complements the story perfectly. It's Beautiful!<br />The reason I gave 'The Last Hero' four and not five stars is because it is woefully short. You can read this in a day. I suggest that you savor the art while reading this so that it lasts longer. Other than the length, the book is near perfect.<br />A collector's item for all Discworld fans!
B00003CY0V|5.0|Yes, there are many ways to start off by slaming this movie, but it's an action flick and IT DELIVERS what it's supposed to, many people overlook that. The story is pretty dum , stupid , and confusing, but it's nothing that the action and Halle's boobs can't pay off. It a great action movie, buy it, sit back, relax, and ENJOY THE MOVIE.

1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has assembled a thorough, accessible work on a very pure form of realization: the realization of one's presence. As a fully realized being, Tolle explores the topic of this being-ness. He demonstrates how to transcend life's challenges not so much by efforting, but by simply and firmly remaining in the point of power: the now. In a gentle, intelligent and humorous way, he answers student questions about real-life, practical concerns such as relationships and family. These answers are clear and direct, and can satisfy the beginner as well as the long-time seeker of realization. He honors each reader and listener when he writes, &quot;You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are!&quot;<br />I found the chapter on the Inner Body most useful. This is the &quot;meat&quot; of how to practice one's presence. Tolle recommends we feel the inner body at all times. &quot;This will rapdily deepen and transform your life. . . . negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances.&quot; <br />This book merits reading and re-reading. It is a treasure.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I've never been more disappointed in a Paul McCartney album before. I have all of his post Beatle albums (including all the Wings albums) and this one is a real let down.   FITD, OTG and FP were all much better than this.
B00005R2M3|4.0|While this album may not have the raw emotion or sincerity that her past albums had, Shakira definitely did the &quot;right thing&quot; as she crafted this album.  Having been a fan for almost 4 years now, I am glad that she has the opportunity to try to break into the American market.  I personally was surprised by the many different influences in her latest work.  Her songs range from the raw emotion of Nirvana to to Ricky Martinesque super-slick production.  While her efforts to reach out the the English speaking world may not be on par with her Spanish work, this album is a definitely a bridge worthy of crossing.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This is a great CD. Maybe not as great as everyone made it out to be, but definitely a solid record by a band with a much-needed sound for this otherwise mostly pathetic musical period.<BR>It sounds a little like the Velvet Underground, but that's not the first comparison I would have made.. (wishful thinking?). <BR>My only problem with this album is that after a few listens, it is a LITTLE monotonous. It's not that it all sounds the same, but it does all sound like different versions of about 3 different songs. You know what......... nevermind all that. There's no need to criticize a band who is at least trying to forge ahead and have a unique sound, which is something they accomplish brilliantly. I just can't wait to hear where they go from here... they already have MY attention, so give them yours.
020161622X|5.0|This must be one of very few books I never felt like putting down.  Quite a daunting task for any programming book. The reason for not wanting to put it down is probably related to the fact that it should strike a cord with every person that writes code. It effectively force you to ask: Am I writing programs or am I a programmer?  If you don't understand this question becuase you think there is no difference then you should definitely read this book.<br />The techniques and habits the authors describe are very useful.  Even if you may not have a use for every single one in every single project, I am quite convinced that you may over a career find all of them useful.  The author's don't propogate that this set of ideas are a complete set - what they do propogate, however, is that programmers should work smarter not harder, and that one obviously achieves by thinking about what you are doing (and learning form other - like this book).<br />The writing style is very entertaining and thus makes a good read.  I would say that this book is indespensable in your personal growth as a programmer.  It may just prompt you to adapt your way of doing from being a &quot;child&quot; programmer to becoming a &quot;real&quot; (&quot;adult&quot;) programmer. If you think you are already a &quot;real&quot; programmer, like I thought, then this book should make you realize that one is never to old to learn, that one should never stop thinking about what (and how) you are doing.<br />Enjoy a great read.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Having missed Radiohead this summer due to a badly-timed rainstorm in the Baltimore/DC area, I was apprehensive about buying this in the first place. I didn't want to hear what I had missed ealier this year. Well, I heard it. It's great, of course. <BR>No storm could have proven a match for Radiohead's violent, sharp-edged renditions of these eight songs. For those of you who think that there's no way the same moods could be captured live that were captured on Kid A and Amnesiac... well... you're right. What you have here is something different. It's a visceral, raw-sounding band who doesn't hit every note perfectly and actually doesn't care to. <BR>Everything is sped up to maximum velocity. The National Anthem, aggressive enough on Kid A, comes off live like a derailed train. I Might Be Wrong, which was so controlled and tight on Amnesiac, gets a faster, harder treatment here. Even Everything In Its Right Place, so consciously subdued on Kid A, jams along with a drumline that wasn't there before, and the last 2 minutes of the song are just loops and loops of Thom's  voice echoing backward and forward and up and down. The biggest change on the record is Like Spinning Plates. It's done without the spiraling synthesizer effects of the Amnesiac version, and to great effect. In its place is a layered, gentle piano number that works beautifully. And finally, the inclusion of True Love Waits is something fans who know what they're talking about have been waiting for since about 1999. I just wish Lift had also been included (will we EVER get to own this song??).<BR>Overall, it's a great EP for diehards, since no one else will care enough to listen, and we like that just fine.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is the best classic Disney has ever produced. My three-year old is so captivated by the adorable Snow White and her company of Seven Dwarfs that sometimes she wants to watch this movie few times a day. The music is exquisite, the songs mesmerizing, the movements brilliant, and the whole (although well-known) story thrilling. This film is really splashy and will go the long way in shaping children's minds.
1563896656|4.0|In this book, that collects the complete 6-part miniseries, Alan Moore has attempted to blend comic-books with what is considered literature. It worked well and makes for an interesting read.<br />Staged in 1898, a certain `Cameron Bond' (in order of one code-named \\"M\\") is forming himself a team consisting of, to us, well-known literary characters. He first approaches Wilhelmina Murray to be in his team and asks her to go collect the next possible team-member, so together THEY can look for the next ... and so on. Naturally each time they go look for a new member the team has grown one person stronger. The gathering is not without problems though which makes each mini-quest (which mostly stays true to the literature in which the characters originally appeared) an interesting sub-story. Once the team is formed, consisting of Captain Nemo and Allan Quatermain among others, they're given an important task ... for `the good of the entire world'. <br />An interesting and entertaining story, well worth the while. What makes this book extra fun though, is that all through the story there are little hints to existing books in the artwork. That's also why it's even more enjoyable if you're well-read in \\"normal\\" literature (a pro, not a must). You'll get little (non-vital) things that are not explained anywhere in the book. For example, you'll know why Mina insists on wearing her scarf.. Next to it being nowhere predictable that little extra gives it an edge over most `respectable' Graphic Novels around. <BR>The art-style lies somewhere in between Eddy Campbell's (From Hell), Jason Lutes' (Berlin) and Tim Sale's (The Long Halloween). It's detailed, atmospheric and very well-chosen considering the events are taking place more than a century ago. All in all a high-quality book.
B00005QXXO|5.0|The only thing better than a Radiohead album is a Radiohead live show.  Buy this now, or forever hold you peace.
B00005QXXO|5.0|This is an incredible band.  That's it.  We can go home now.  Eight songs, all true to the studio versions.  &quot;National Anthem&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot;, and 4 others.  The singing is passionate.  I have no idea how that get that sound on a stage.  The songs are more raw, because they are live and that gives the songs another dimension.  The crowd noise is not there interfering and the sonics are perfect.  The energy of the live performance is projected also.  My only sadness; it's 40 minutes.  I could listen to this band for hours.  If you are not familiar with this band, the music is very spacey.  The music projects an emotion.  It is rough rock in places.  It is abstract in places.  It is bombastic in places.  It is Art-Rock in places.  It is distorted rock in places.  It is electronic rock in places.  It is the ultimate Progressive Rock.  The singing is raw emotion.  It's distored in places.  You have to experience the song &quot;Morning Bell&quot; as it picks up steam and crescendoes at the top and then the bottom just drops out.  It is an experience.  I would expect nothing less, because all of Radiohead music is an experience.
0312932081|5.0|This is one of those books that should be read in high school english class- a true classic.  (...)  I was fascinated from the very beginning to the very end of the book; I couldn't put it down!  Ender is a fabulously well-thought out character, and the 'virtual world' Orson Scott Card has created in my mind is astonishing- I've been having DREAMS about it for goodness sakes!  Bravo, O.S. Card, for this literary masterpiece!!
0140277447|4.0|Lots of people have said lots of stuff about this book, so I'll try not to bore you:<br />The most interesting thing about this book was the part about the Nazis as heros. Before I go on, let me enlighten those who don't know what the book contains: there is a sifnificant vignette in the book about the role several Westerners played in protecting the Chinese population during the Japanese occupation.  Notably, a couple of Germans, who were relatively highly placed socially and thus co-incidentally members of the Nazi party, play a significant role in \\"saving\\" people. The back of the book calls one of them the 'Oscar Schindler of China', or something like that.... Yes, it's kind of a wierd perspective. And I'm about to say something even wierder: I would (and do) reccomend this book to all the Germans I know. <br />Reading this book during the horrors of the Yugoslavian war and reading as someone who lived for a long time in Germany (one of the few countries on the planet that openly and repeatedly beats itself over the head with its WW II guilt), I found it to be a fascinating illustration of a principal which we too often forget: no one nationality or group has cornered the market on cruelty. (...) (Aside from all that, the book is quite well written: it would be a good read even if it were fiction.)
B000002H8F|5.0|&quot;Bossanova&quot; is an extrodinary record, as all the other Pixies  albums. After owning this gem for about 9 years, I still listen to it with amazement. They, like a few other bands, were TOO GREAT for mainstream mall rats to grasp. Songwriting, musicianship, and the wittiest lyrics ever contribute to the Pixies longlasting mystique and influence. We all know Kurt was a Pixies freak.<br />Me too.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Ladies and gentlemen, meet James Paul McCartney. Following his nine-year recording stint with the Band Of The Century, he pursued a solo career that yielded two classic albums (Band On The Run and Tug Of War) and three pretty damn good ones (McCartney, Ram, and Venus &amp; Mars). And the rest? For the most part, each new arrival featured two or three tasty avocados on a bed of soggy bean sprouts. Perhaps McCartney was simply trying too hard to fill his own shoes.<br />The good news on Driving Rain is Paul has finally given up. No endless months of fine-tuning and overdubs. No fancy cover either - just a fuzzy Polaroid with a dashed off, handwritten title. If he feels like celebrating, he lets himself soar - as in the last-minute addition of a supercharged \\"Freedom\\" from the Concert For New York. If he wants to jam, he digs in at length. If he's feeling romantic, he lets us know (yeah, now there's a surprise). The entire album has an offhand, thrown together feel to it - like something Macca and a neighborhood band knocked off in their garage last week. Paul hasn't sounded this loose since 1965. It suits him well.<br />Remember Sgt. Pepper's floating, melodic bass lines? They're back for an encore on Driving Rain, and the title song announces their return in the album's opening seconds. Beatlesque flourishes are here, there, and everywhere - from the White Album-ish \\"Heather\\" with its oh-so-British piano and vocal phrasings, to \\"About You\\" and \\"Back In The Sunshine Again,\\" either of which could pass for Abbey Road outtakes. Paul's new backing band is young, talented, and unpretentious. They make even the jams and instrumentals work. <br />Simply put, Driving Rain is Paul McCartney's best and most consistent effort since 1982's Tug Of War. Whatever demons Macca has been battling since Winging it on his own, remember you read it here first: they've lost, Paul's won. He is more than live. He's finally free. And to celebrate he's unleashed his first monster album in nearly two decades.
B00005BJPO|5.0|What can you say about Akira, the manga or the movie, that hasn't already been said? It's brilliant, to<BR>say the least. The animated version, like the graphic novel series, has withstood the test of time most<BR>honorably. That said, it's great fun to watch, and there's so much detail that it will require several<BR>viewings to fully drink it all in. (To this day, I still haven't picked up on all the details in the scenes with<BR>Kaneda's gang and their assigned groupies. Talk about complex!)<BR> As a big anime fan, I of course recommend you see it in the original Japanese. Sure, there's no fancy<BR>mix like you get with the English tracks, but no English dub can really do this film any justice. Besides,<BR>this is a film set in Japan with Japanese characters, and really should be watched in its original language. (On that note, I must warn those of you that don't have it yet: The video uses the opening<BR>and end credits from Streamline's previous subtitled version of the VHS, which gives credit to the<BR>original Japanese cast. Pioneer adds their own voice credits after the originals run. Thought you'd get<BR>the original Japanese print?)

0425107469|5.0|Ok, first off I noticed some people actually rated this book poorly.  Now this is completely nuts because anyone who read the book and has any bit of an imagination was grabbed on the first few pages and not released until the very end.  I hated reading with a purple passion, first time I read this book I was skipping a class in school sitting in the library about to take a nap.  I heard a girl I knew talking about how she liked this author so I went and looked up Watchers since I was bored out of my mind.  Since that day I think I can say I own just about every book Dean Koontz has written except for some he did under pet names.  Watchers changed my views and made me realize just how entertaining a good book could be.  Awesome book, great characters!<br />here's a final note.............<br />- (...)

B00003CXN3|1.0|I absoultley hated this movie! Its was boring, very very boring. I am still puzzeled as to why this movie won so many Oscars. One of my friends picked this movie, and we still haven't let him down for picking such a terrible movie. I envy those who haven't seen this.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Just like my title says, this cd gives you the true feeling as if you were in concert seeing them.  All the songs are not just the studio versions,they all have new energy, new arrangements, some new vocal parts as well as instrumentation.  For example, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is now a piano piece with synth strings in the background, unlike the studio version where the music is played backwards.  &quot;Idioteque&quot; now has Phil backing up that techno beat with his drumset, making it a sort of breakbeat track.  And best of all &quot;National Anthem&quot; is bigger, better, and more powerful, that raw bassline is now bigger and fuzzier, making for the ultimate groove.<BR>  All of these tracks were recorded in Oxford, Berlin, Oslo and Vaison La Romaine.  It would be a perfect score if the quality of the recordings remained uniform thhroughout the cd.  They do except for &quot;I might be wrong&quot;.  It sounds as if it was recorded by an audience member with an antiquated analog tape recorder.  So the sound is very distant and the guitar sounds weak.  But besides this all the other songs sound very nice and clear.  All in all, a good live cd.  Much better than their studio versions!<br />ps<BR>you get the lovely &quot;true love waits&quot;, a song with just thom and his acoustic guitar.  it's been in their live shows for years but yet to be officially released until now.
B00005MAM2|1.0|I am an old time fan of Akira. I bought this DVD with high exceptions. I just want to put out to the fans that are thinking of buying the DVD to please reconsider. The original sound effects and the old voices are gone. Some company takes pride with ruining the movie's original sound English translation. Shame on them for retranslating the movies and stripping all the cool sounds. Like when number 26 (I think that is the little guy's name) is moaning and the windows break out of the building. In this new version most of the coolest sound effects are gone. I couldn't even finish watching it because the movie is ruined. The picture and the plot are still the same.... But the sound stinks. The VHS version is better for the old time fans.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Sure, we've heard all these before but it's Madonna, does it matter? Nope. She's the Queen of Pop! I love all these songs! Plus, the cover and inserts of the CD have 100's of minature Madonna photos! It's all good!
B00005QXXO|4.0|Like having that strange uncle that never married visit you and tell all the great stories he knows. Spellbinding and wonderful, it will not disapoint.
B00000G3PA|1.0|You can count on Jerry Bruckheimer whenever you want a big, loud production that assaults your eyes and ears.  If you want something realistic, full of meaning, or anything that requires you to use your brain beyond a kindergarten level, then you need to look elsewhere.  And what better (or shall I say worse?) to drive this point home than the insipid 1998 blockbuster ARMAGEDDON?<br />If you ask me this is nothing more than one of those really bad 1970s disaster films with an all-star cast and a bigger budget.  There is not one original character or subplot.  The jokes are so over-recycled that you can almost hear them begging to be buried in a landfill.  The only thing really worth watching - don't think of me as bloodthirsty - are the scenes of carnage and destruction.  But not even those scenes can save it from the plot holes that are so big that a the Texas-sized asteroid could easily fit inside.  And here are just a few:<br />1.  How could a group of oil riggers (no disrespect toward real oil riggers) as idiotic as those in the movie make a group of well trained astronauts look like bumbling nincompoops?<br />2.  How is it that the smaller asteroids only hit huge cities like New York City, Paris, or Shanghai?<br />3.  How could the asteroid be cut into two neat pieces without smaller debris (like a piece the size of Rhode Island) falling to earth?<br />4.  How come it is called ARMAGEDDON when the world gets saved?<br />If I were bored enough to watch this miserable dreck twice I would probably notice more discrepancies, but once was entirely too much for me.  As it was, I found the movie to be as entertaining as one of Bill Clinton's old speeches.
0790729628|3.0|This is much like the first big screen adaptation of Dune; to someone who has never read the book, so much has been left out the viewer ends up wondering &quot;what the heck is going on?&quot; Those who have read the book look at it and say &quot;I can follow the film, but they really chopped this up.&quot; This is often the feeling of what the directors cut does to those of us who have seen the original film in the theater. Having seen a number of Humphrey Bogart's detective films, the noir style of the original release and the trench coated Harrison Ford as Deckard give it a nice retro 40's feel. His Bogart-esque &quot;Sam Spade&quot; voice-over makes this work perfectly. To people who have never seen the film before and watched the directors cut, their comments have consistently been that they didn't understand the film. That it seems like something is missing. When they watch the directors cut after the original release they have no questions about it and find it good and more artistic interpretation, though less understandable version of the film. The voice over explains much of the characters thoughts and feelings to the viewer, without which the viewer ends up with far too many questions about what is going on and the actions of the character. Perhaps some like leaving this open to their own interpretation, which is their choice. But they are watching the film having seen the first release, giving them an overall understanding based upon the original. To the uninitiated watcher, this almost always elicits confusion. To someone who has seen both and prefers the directors cut, by all means this is a reasonable version. To anyone who has never seen the film before, go see the original before you watch the directors cut, otherwise it won't make much sense to you. The sound track, as any by Vangelis, is magnificent.

0465011012|5.0|&quot;Aquariums in Pyongyang&quot; is an incredible story of survival and triumph over evil and hardship. Kang chol-Hawn was an upper middle class child of idealistic Koreans living in Japan when his parents returned to the North Korean &quot;Workers Paradise&quot; that was in the making of North Korea of the early 1960's. The reality of course, they soon discovered, was far from the communist propaganda that his mother was so taking in by. By the age of nine Kang was sent to a gulag and in it he endured all that one would expext from a communist gulag, beatings, starvation, hard labor, communist propaganda and brain washing. Not many people survived ten years in a North Korean gulag fewer still managed to later escape to the west or in Kang's case South Korea. None before have written a book about such experiences and that makes &quot;Aquariums in Pyongyang&quot; a unique book. One of the amazing things about this book aside from the story it's self is that Kang manages to not only detail the horror but also display quite a bit of humor albeit largely sacastic humor such as a chapter titled &quot;ten years in the camp: thank you, Kim Il Sung&quot; Another chapter entitled Biweekly Criticism and self-criticism is filled with sacastic humor that can make you laugh out loud even if you feel a little guilty doing so knowing the suffering of the gulags prisonors. Aquariums is a excellent book that will challage your views of North Korea no matter what your political views are. an excellent read definitly reccomended
6305127638|4.0|This was really the first all-Next Generation film.  As ever, Star Trek looks so much more impressive on the big-screen, and with the production values afforded by a film budget.<br />The plot moves fast (somewhat too fast I thought when seeing it for the first time) but is packed with action.  This film I think should appeal to fans of good action films who may not particularly watch Star Trek.  As such, it doesn't quite have the certain charm of the series that life long fans will be used to, but more than makes up for it with an enjoyable plot, some fairly good character moments (though mostly Picard, Data, and the Guests) and some excellent special effects.<br />This film was made purely for enjoyment, and to appeal to a wide audience, and it acheives that admirably.  It's worth buying, and stands up to several viewings over the years. Perhaps because it didn't attempt to acheive as much as its somewhat flawed predecessor (Generations) this film has been so much more enjoyable.<br />Overall, value for money, and very entertaining, Star Trek fan or not!

B00005R2M3|5.0|A remarkable english language debut from one of the hottest singers in music. Shakira has crafted a sensational album that mixes pop, rock, funk, middle eatern, and latin.There is sure to be something for everyone. Her unique voice is powerful and passionate. Songs like Whenever Wherever, Eyes Like Yours, and Objection show her vocals off and it's what makes each of these songs some of the most fierce songs in recent music history. A spellbinding album that should not be ignored. Shakira has set new standards for popular music and hopefully some of todays artists will take notice. One of the best and most original albums this year.
B000002KO1|5.0|Just wanted to add my two cents worth about this flat-out, bone-chrushing, ball-busting, worth-every-penny-of-its-cost CD of the Pretenders' debut.<BR>     I bought this album at the time of it's original vinyl release in 1980.  I proceeded to wear out two copies of it in a few months by playing it repeatedly.  To say that Chrissy Hynde stood alone in a male-dominated rock arena, and gave back as good as she got is undisputable.  &quot;Precious&quot; may well be the title-holder of all time for feminist anthems, hearing Ms. Hynde spit out the &quot;F&quot; word pretty much sums up how she was prepared to deal with anyone who stood in her way.  While others have covered the gamut of praise about this album, I would like to say that &quot;Mystery Achievement&quot; still has the power to thrill me like no other song in the pantheon of rock.  I saw the band do this number as their closing song on their first American tour and glimpsed Heaven.  Chrissy, the visionary.  She makes me glad I'm from Ohio.
B00005QXXO|4.0|If you're a serious Radiohead fan, it is imperative you pick this up quick. For two reasons. 'Like Spinning Plates'...an absolutely stunningly beautiful rendition. And of course, 'True Love Waits'..excellent to finally have an 'official' version. I miss the backing electronics on the popular bootleg version but it's still a total joy. The rest of the tracks suffice quite nicely.
B00005NW02|5.0|I won't have much to say about this CD...but I will say that this, this CD...this is worth the money to buy...and worth the time to listen to. <br />System Of A Down has created a sound like no other band out there. They hit hard, and fast...and with a little introspection and melody thrown in for good measure. While their peers like Slipknot and Mudvayne sing with just primal ferocity, SOAD has thrown in some political manifesto lyrics like Rage did...with that said, Serj sings about the broadest of topics...psycho groupies, pogo sticks, the state of the drug war, etc., etc....now what other band can have a song about the corrupted prison system and drug war, and then turn around and do a song about a pogo stick the next...only System Of A Down can. This my friends is an exciting album...a maniac lyrical delievery...a twinge of melody...and a hard hitting edge...what more can you ask from a Hard Rock band...nothing...
0062515675|4.0|A great book - full of insightful suggestions to change your life for the better. If you can get by the corny story line and cheesy dialouge, you'll find many ways to lead a more fulfilling and less stressful life. I've read it twice!
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD has hit quite a rotation in my CD player...I have come to a realization that rap metal has been grossly overdone and has become somewhat of a parody of itself...some bands seem to have gotten the trend, and ran with it...albeit not so great(Reveille comes to mind)...some just move farther and farther away from the whole label(Korn, Deftones and Incubus to name a few, which were never really rap metal bands to begin with)...and some finally get the trend right...Linkin Park is a shining star in this doldrum of Rap metal...Limp Bizkit seems a bit glossy and overcooked now...<br />Linkin Park does something that Limp Bizkit never did right...it made more intelligent lyrics and added some freaking melody...Fred Durst sounds like absolute hell when he tries to rap...and he is just one pissed off guy singing about...well, being pissed off(case in point, listen to Break Stuff and Full Nelson, a testament to my point)...Chester Bennington gets the full on whisper to a scream thing down quite well(Chino Moreno still is great at doing it)...and DJ Joseph Hahn and MC Mike Shinoda can really, really rip it up...in fact, if you want to listen to two songs that showcase both of these men, listen to A Cure For The Itch and High Voltage(High Voltage is only on the special edition and in single format with One Step Closer)...<br />So if you want to hear a more 'evolved' rap metal album, get  Hybrid Theory...if on the other hand you want to hear the glossy sell out side of rap metal go out and buy Limp Bizkit and leave me alone...
B000001DTM|5.0|I bought this CD back in 1997 when I became a new U2 fan since I heard the song 'One' and was completely floored by the fact that a powerful rock band had produced a song like this, so touching and ironic. 6 years after I bought it, this album has grown on me as I heard it almost every other day. The amazing lyrics and masterfully crafted lyrics of 'One', 'Cruel','Acrobat, 'Love is blindness' and the soulful 'Light my way' , 'Who's gonna ' and the powerful heavy guitar-solo driven 'Acrobat' which shows The one and only Edge at the height of his creative guitar playing with powerful drumming by Larry and Bono frantically trying to sing at par with the musical perfection. 'Even better than the real thing' is a strong guitar driven song with the unique combination of techno drums by Larry and synthesizers is amazing.Definitely stands with the other two U2 master pieces 'Joshua Tree' and 'All that you can't leave behind'
0452282152|1.0|I read this novel for a contemporary literature class, and wondered the whole way through how it could generate so much exuberant press.  <br />As a historical novel, it succeeds in waving epochal details and Vermeer trivia under our noses; but the fiction Chevalier blends with her fact is lusterless.  The plot is predictable, the tone is flaccid, and the novel suffers from strained, often weak metaphors which occasionally seem reliant on vagueness to stand for artistry of phrase or image.  Theodore Roethke called these kinds of phrases &quot;loosely evocative utterances.&quot;<br />In addition, I found the narrator's voice affected at times, particularly in the presentations of her &quot;ignorance&quot; and her utterly soul-less journey to artistic understanding.  Her &quot;sexual awakening&quot; also seemed weakly conceived and emotionless.<br />As a student in a contemporary literature class, I'm going to pretend I read this book as a cultural study on how the marketing and hype that surround a book (literally, there is more text on the front and back covers from reviews than from the book itself) has little to do with its literary merit.<br />For a novel that was inspired by history, but blends fiction and an amazing use of language, try Margaret Atwood's &quot;Alias Grace.&quot;

B00005OM4N|4.0|If you thought you were going to buy this CD as a gift for you daughter or grandchild, I'd advise you against it. Almost completely gone are Britney's childish songs like &quot;Sometimes&quot; or &quot;Heart&quot;. She's taken her trademark sound and twisted it, molded it, and shaped it into something more mature, sexy, and very grown-up. She's growing up along with her audience, and her music is now no longer suited for 12-year-old girls. But that doesn't make this CD a bad thing; in fact, it's very, very good. But if you were expecting another &quot;Oops!...I did it again,&quot; you're going to end up with a very big surprise.<br />I'm A Slave 4 U - 4/5 Her first single. It's a very different sound for her, which is no surprise since it was written and produced by the Neptunes, who are known for their funky hip-hop and R&amp;B hits. It has a very hypnotic beat and an extremely steamy music video. A very, very sexy song about &quot;being a slave for the music,&quot; as Britney put it. The lyrics would suggest she was a slave for something else entirely -- she moans &quot;I'm a slave for you, I cannot hold it, and I cannot control it...&quot; Hmm. Think about it! Anyway, I didn't like it at first, but it has definitely grown on me.<br />Overprotected - 4/5 Britney cries out against her sheltered life. &quot;My life has been so overprotected,&quot; she sings against a mix of stuttering beats and a funky bassline. Written by the Pop Princess herself, Britney shows her need to feel independent and on her own on this song. One of the best songs on the album. Destined to be a huge single.<br />Lonely - 5/5 One of my personal favorites. A funky and riff-heavy uptempo number about letting go of a guy that's treating her badly. As she belts out lines like, &quot;What, you think I'm just another chick? Messed with Brit, boy you must've tripped,&quot; her attitude and style really shines.<br />Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - 3/5 The second single off her album and the theme toher new movie. A ballad about being stuck between her teenage and womanhood years. I did not like this song much for two reasons: 1) It's a bit too corny for my taste, and 2) Britney's vocals are quite lacking on this song. Her ballads tend to flaunt her limited vocal range. If you're looking for a good ballad, check out &quot;Before the Goodbye&quot; (only available on imports) or &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot;. The lyrics are well-written, but the music (and her voice!) could use improvement.<br />Boys - 4/5 This song was also done by the Neptunes. Britney lets her voice be a bit more husky on this track, and it really works. It's got a great beat and some nice ad-lib done by Britney. It's reminiscent of Janet Jackson's &quot;Nasty&quot; when she starts chanting &quot;Get nasty&quot; in the background. <br />Anticipating - 5/5 A great, fun disco-pop song. Great to listen to while driving around with friends. Britney sings about clubbing with girlfriends over strings, keyboards and a stuttering beat. A very fun, lighthearted pop song.<br />I Love Rock 'n' Roll - 5/5 One of my favorite songs on the album! Britney cranked up the bassline and added a heavy beat for this song. Her best cover to date. Britney's voice is twangy and full of attitude on this song. Sounds great turned up really loudly!<br />Cinderella - 3/5 I didn't really like this song mainly because it sounds like just throwaway pop fluff. The lyrics could've been a lot better and the melody and beat sound overused. Overall, it's alright, but it's one of the weakest songs on the album.<br />Let Me Be - 5/5 I think this is Britney's first solidly good song. The lyrics are excellent and I love the melody. It has an excellent chorus, but even better are the verses. It has Britney's trademark sound, but she's turned it up a notch. It's got a great beat and overall song. This would be an excellent single.<br />Bombastic Love - 3/5 Much like &quot;Cinderella,&quot; this song just sounds like more fluff.The lyrics are so-so and the overall sound of the song sounds like it's been done a million times before. Britney's vocal stylings and the opera singers in the background make it slightly reminiscent of Pink's &quot;Most Girls,&quot; but only in a musical sense.<br />That's Where You Take Me - 5/5 Britney's best ballad, in my opinion. The lyrics are very sweet and uplifting, and for once Britney's vocals really shine in a slow-tempo song. It has an infectious beat and a beautiful melody. Another solidly good song. <br />What It's Like To Be Me - 6/5! My favorite song on the album. Penned by Justin Timberlake, he's also featured on the track with background vocals and beatboxing. &quot;Walk a mile in my shoes, do me right or I'm through,&quot; Britney sings over Justin's smooth vocals and heavy beatboxing. Excellent lyrics and an even better beat. Britney's best song to date.
0345451325|4.0|I dont even play computer games but the novel intrigued me in its presentation and book cover.  Now, I have heard of this game and its new system coming out and I have tried a few game/novels out and have not been impressed - UNTIL NOW!  Eric Nylund's writing is great and I already have two other books from him since I read this novel.  Mr. Nylund's story telling and bigger than life characters in this book make it clearly above and beyond just a game book.  The story starts out with a woman named Dr. Halsey who is creating a super soldier for the future war that is coming in the guise of an alien race that seems unstoppable and unknown to earthlings in any way shape or form.  Dr. Halsey and her accomplice Jacob Keyes take a dozen children from orphanages and make them into super beings thru endless surgeries, drugs, and a battle school that is far superior and secret than normal military.  The leader, and main character comes from a boy/man they call number 117, or John.  John is not the strongest or the fastest, but he has the mind of a leader.  The reader then goes on a journey thru these poor kid's boot camp and watch them fail as well as conquer their own fears and others prejudice.  This insight and character development, mixed with great action sequences is what saves this novel from being just another fast written game book for the boys.  The author's writing style is made for this type of novel and it shows in every space battle as well as groundside wars as well.  This novel goes thru about 25 years or so, so you get to follow the kid's growth, as well as some of the other normal humans rise and falls thru the years.  The aliens are introduced slowly and revealed for who and what they are in a way that keeps the reader wanting to read more to find out - very smart!  If you love military space opera with lots of great action with lots of great characters written in - then you will find that this is not just another game novel - I can't wait for the new book!

B00005R2M3|5.0|Well, I love Shakira's voice, her music and her lyrics. I think this new CD is gonna be a success, I like too much her first single &quot;Wherever, whenever&quot; maybe she's gonna fill the hole that Alanis Morrisette left behind....I hope you enjoy it as me, and if you listen careful, you'll find a big influence (or copy?) of Bangels &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; in her song &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot;. Thanx.
1559408898|5.0|Indeed, this film is violent.  But so is Dawn of the Dead, the Godfather, etc.  Occasionally it is the director's intention to desensitize the viewer to violence in order to draw a particular reaction.  Verhoeven's brutal sequences can at once be tragic, highly comic, and energizing.  We are not sure how to react and so we begin to question the nature of violence itself.  <br />Criterion does a wonderful job in the transfer, even ADDING ADDITIONAL VIOLENT FOOTAGE NOT SHOWN IN THEATERS.  Verhoeven's vision is complete on this DVD, and I always believe it is important that a director's work is uncensored.  Besides being a visual feast, this movie goes to work on you, making you consider the irony of American society.  It's not just some action garbage to watch at two in the morning on a Sunday night because Marilyn Chamber's &quot;New York Nights&quot; dissolved into static.  Watch, enjoy, and think.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is wonderful!!!!.  She's trandsending Latin music to a whole new level.  She's one of the greatest Latin pop/rock stars out there.  I am so happy of her crossing over.  We get to see this beautiful Latin artist do her thing.  She's reminds me of Selena when she was getting ready to record her English album.  I hope Shakira suceeds in EVERYTHING she does!!!!!!.
0671024256|5.0|If you want help or advice on writing, King is your man.  This was a very terrific book that explains writing in depth and how one can improve a little on his or her writing.  The best thing about Stephen King is that he is brutally honest.<br />This isn't an instructional book on writing, it's more of a memoir on his experiences on writing.  He offers tips and suggestions along the way, but as he said in the book, &quot;You can't make a bad writer a good writer.&quot;  This book isn't going to transform you into a best-selling author; that's something you have to figure out on your own.  This book is sort of like a guide.  It lets you get into the mind of a fiction writer and what it takes to write.<br />I especially like his memoirs on writing.  It was very interesting how writing has helped, and possibly saved his life.  He talks about his early years of writing when he was a kid and finishes it off with when he was hit by a car and how writing helped him get back to living again.  Even if you're not a writer or thinking about becoming one, this book is still a terrific read.  You'll discover what kind of commitment and determination it takes in the world of fiction.  Maybe it'll help you appreciate the work that is involved in writing stories and novels.<br />King said it best when he said, &quot;If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or tools to write.&quot;  That's the best advice you can give and it's nothing but the truth.  As a beginning writer, I know that all too well.  This is a terrific read which lets you get into the mind of the creative master of horror and fiction.  Like I said, it's best for people to read it if they are writers or beginning writers, but it's also a book that anyone can enjoy.  Put this book on your list and read it as soon as you can.  I loved every word of it.
B00004RFCM|4.0|A nice collection of the first season, including some fun extras.

0140430350|5.0|Who among us could not appreciate the social satire in this novel that translates perfectly to modern day? Heh. Thackeray's constant rhetorical questioning does get a little annoying at times, but that's my only complaint. If you are tired of dry, boring, altruistic, overly melodramatic, and/or maudlin novels from this era, this is the book for you. Even though times have changed considerably, Thackeray's observations on society still ring true as if they were written yesterday. You will see people you know in his characters, and perhaps, although you might not want to admit it, yourself. Becky Sharp and her &quot;artful&quot; ways will draw you in and you will lose sleep, but it's worth it.

B000002KKC|5.0|&quot;Tusk&quot; is not by any chance &quot;Rumours II&quot;, as most people could have thought after the impressive success of the previous album. The band that have conquered the musical market with the charming and charisma of the two female vocalists Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, the powerful guitar chords of the underrated guitar player Lindsey Buckingham and the breakups and makeups of their love stories inside the band itself, was still coming out of the big storm that the tension of the recording sessions and the touring had brought to their lives.<br />So this is the sound of the &quot;pieces&quot; of the multiple explosions felt during the making of &quot;Rumours&quot;. Buckingham takes control of the production of an album that, if it has a defect, is that it appears as a compilation of three solo recordings more than a group work. Anyhow, he started experimenting new sounds in the musical fields, and letting again his emotions be in charge of the lyrics. The amazing &quot;That's Enough For Me&quot; is, to me, his most interesting track, a fast-rocking-kind-of-country song which, in about six verses resumes about all his feelings for bandmate Stevie Nicks. The title track &quot;Tusk&quot; is also worth noting because of the presence of a marching band and an african drumming that makes you go out of your mind. Overall, his 9 songs on this album (which by the way was originally a double LP and is now comprissed onto just one CD) are a showcase of lots of different styles, and his lyrics are always an opportunity for him to show the anxiety that he was living through... While &quot;The Ledge&quot; (a pseudo punk rock strange rocking track) and &quot;What Makes You Think You're The One&quot; (a great opportunity for Mick Fleetwood to show his drumming in a hard rocking song) talk about the breakup with Nicks, the beautifully harmonized &quot;Save Me A Place&quot; finds him in the search of the real love, the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Walk A Thin Line&quot; and &quot;That's All For Everyone&quot; make him wonder if he's done the right things during the past events, and &quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong&quot;, together with &quot;Not That Funny&quot;, two tracks filled with strangely distorted guitars, talk about the newly discovered affair of Stevie with Mick. All of those tracks are full of passion, sometimes anger, sometimes anxiety. Never was Lindsey more involved with the musical production and with the vocal arrangements than here, and you can note that he is a genious.<br />That huge quantity of work surely inspired his bandmates to work. Thus Christine McVie delivers some of her finest songs here, such as the lovely opener &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, with great harmonies, the wishful &quot;Honey Hi&quot;, the sad and innocent &quot;Never Make Me Cry&quot;, the rocking &quot;Think About Me&quot;, one of the highlights of the album. Her voice never sounded so sweeter than here, and she somehow seems to have lost some of her self-esteem, reaching for a love that almost never comes... Her highlight though is the atmospheric, brilliant and glorious &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;, which features Peter Green on guitar, and really inspires and hipnotizes you. A relaxing track with somehow sad vocals that fit perfectly into this keyboard-driven song. Wonderful.<br />And if anyone had doubts about Stevie Nicks being a highly talented songwriter, this is the album of her definitive consagration. &quot;Sara&quot; is a very enigmatic and poetic song that still enchants one trying to find what on Earth is she talking about, also because of the dreamy guitar/piano arrangements. &quot;Angel&quot;, another rocker, is surrounded by a strong electric piano by McVie, and features the confirmation that everything that Stevie writes is about herself (&quot;that girl was me&quot;). &quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot;, a masterpiece and sort of a sequel to &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, talks about the confusing lights of fame; and &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; is undoubtedly a tribute to lover Mick Fleetwood, a gorgeous ballad with somehow sad lyrics. Finally, her meaningful and haunting pray &quot;Storms&quot; leaves one with tears in your eyes. Very emotional and powerful.<br />These three totally different and complex atmospheres combine to form the eclectic &quot;Tusk&quot;, one of the most recommendable album of the 70's, a storm of creativity, and a must-have in any music lover's collection.; is undoubtedly a tribute to lover Mick Fleetwood, a gorgeous ballad with somehow sad lyrics.

0451526295|5.0|\\"Mansfield Park\\" is a great book, and no one reviewing here has claimed otherwise. (Well, there are a few exceptions, but they're better left unmentioned.) But there has been a great clamor over the quality of its protagonist, Fanny Price. One camp has her a valiant heroine full of moral rectitude and therefore admirable. The other paints Fanny as prig, passive and odious.<br />I fall into the latter camp.<br />There are several common defensive positions taken no behalf of Fanny Price (who, I dare say, is used to having people do all the fighting for her). I've taken these positions and constructed rebuttals to them:<br />1) \\"Fanny had to be passive. She was penniless, without strong family connections, and living in a precarious position at the mercy of her guardian, Sir Thomas.\\"<br />The novelist is god of her creation. Austen created Sir Thomas and Mansfield Park, took Fanny's father and turned him into a drunk, her mother into a slattern, leaving her at the mercy of the world. Fanny's passivity and helpless situation was manufactured by the author. It did not have to be so, as evidenced by Austen's other books.<br />2) \\"Fanny's morals are virtuous and to be admired, not to be discredited. She was a strong character, as evidenced by her staying true to her principles.\\"<br />What are Fanny's principles? She talks bad about no one, unless someone she likes talks bad about them first. She does not laugh, speak on her own behalf, or like to be the center of attention. She is content with small things. She dislikes flirting. Basically, she disdains action, which she considers pushy and rude. And, indeed, she exhibited a constant stream of passivity throughout the book.<br />First, there's a literary reason why passivity fails to hold the reader. Action reveals character. A character's thoughts and speech are unreliable. It's only in the crucible of conflict we see what a character is made of - we see her make a decision and act on it. Fanny doesn't act. Or rather, her action is not to act. In literature, passivity creates a gap between a reader and a character. We don't care as much.<br />Then there's a socio-political reason, too. In a society where women could not hold office, vote, or own property, women were at the mercy of men. The Taliban would feel right at home in 1810s England, surrounded by women swaddled under petticoats and dresses, who had no rights of citizenship. Women were expected to be demure, passive, and pretty, like baubles. It is no wonder that modern-day sensibilities object to Fanny, who embodies that time's feminine ideal. Nowadays women can survive on their own. Who would want to go back? Fanny is in this light an ugly reminder of how things could be and, in some places, still are.<br />Most importantly, Fanny's passivity bogs down the narrative itself. The ending of \\"Mansfield Park\\" relies on a series of serendipitous events, none of which Fanny drives herself. First, Sir Thomas is a decent, moral character, and eventually recognizes Fanny's value, but only after a family crisis. Edmund, Fanny's love, almost marries her rival, Mary Crawford, but decides not to only after Mary botches a five-minute conversation. And none of these things happen if Sir Thomas' eldest daughter never abandons her husband on an adulterous fling. Think of the string of events that take place to create the ending! If only one of these events or characters are different, Fanny's in deep trouble! If Sir Thomas had the character of Mrs. Norris, Fanny would be on the street in no time. And while Austen constructed her book to ensure Fanny's happiness, she jumps the plot through so many flaming hoops that the end feels lame and forced.<br />3) \\"We must judge Fanny's morals in proper perspective; that is, from 1819, when Jane Austen wrote 'Mansfield Park.'\\"<br />A difficult statement that makes us question that very way we read. Should we bring our modern sensibilities to a reading of a book written almost 300 years ago? Should interpretation be based on our personal experience of the text? Yech and double yech.<br />But fortunately, Austen wrote other books, and we can judge her characters' morality not with our modern-day morals, but against her own.<br />And Fanny Price comes through like a prig.<br />One neat thing (among many) about Austen's books is the struggle in her women between security versus spirit. (Security to Austen means money.) Which only makes sense if we imagine how uncomfortable 1810s England was for a woman of Austen's intellect and profession, a woman who no doubt wrote novels desite its impropriety.<br />In \\"Persuasion,\\" for example, this conflict is embodied in Anne Elliot, who loves a man her social circle disapproves of. She turned down his first marriage proposal on the advice of a family friend, but spends her life regretting the decision. And that's what the novel is about. Regret for not marrying Wentworth, for not loving, and for choosing convention over emotion. Now this is a conflict we understand. Who among us has no regrets?<br />In \\"Mansfield Park,\\" convention and emotion agree. Which is pretty easy, actually, because Fanny exhibits so little of the latter. Fanny is spiritless. She passively watches the outcome of her life unfold before her. She does nothing to aid events along. She never laughs, jokes, or exhibits joy. I can only think that Fanny Price would be the object of disdain and pity by the other Austen heroines. And has anyone realized that Fanny resembles her aunt, Mrs. Norris? Can anyone doubt that after 30 years married to a parson, Fanny, too, will be sanctimonious and self-righteous?<br />Love Fanny or hate her, \\"Mansfield Park\\" still earns 5 stars.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Since I've bought this CD, I've played it non-stop, I'm absolutely hooked!  Escape is a fun CD, full of energy and it makes you want to dance, and then there are the ballads that only Enrique can deliver with such passion.  Besides the wonderful execution by Enrique, keep in mind that he was involved in the production and writing of ALL the songs on the album.  That is a great accomplishment on its own.  Enrique is a great talent, and the evidence lies in the fact that he sings, writes and produces his work.  For fans, it's a must have!  For others, buy it you might pleasantly suprised!
B000002UB3|5.0|It is my opinion (and probably countless others) that this CD easily ranks within the top third of every Beatles' studio recorded albums - no tempting Apples about it. Similar in particular to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Abbey Road contains several outstanding tracks which unfortunately were[are] not included on the majority of Beatle compilations (The Beatles 1967- 1970 and Past Masters II being prime examples). Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Oh! Darling, I Want You (She's So Heavy) and Carry That Weight ultimately I believe deserved a far better and more publicly renowned status. All such tracks included tremendous character and freedom attributes the like very few if any other bands have been able to surpass on regular album content. Assembled along with legend hits Come Together, Something, Octopus's Garden and Here Comes The Sun, Abbey Road gave[and still gives] accurate representation to the talent these unparalleled Liverpool Lads have shared and contributed over the decades. With their ingenious songwriting abilities, the FabFour proceeded through time to win the musical hearts and souls of FabMegamillions....
B00005Q66T|5.0|Yet another great compilation of different-flavoured tracks. She taught me a lot (amongst English) when I was growing up, in Hungary, about how to interpret and enjoy he world and, lately, I miss the message she used to have behind her music about diversity, feminism, war, etc. It also takes some listening to to enjoy her latest songs. Might have given in to fashion trends a little bit too much... The concert was a big disappointment (can we get something like Blond Ambition ?!), and, sorry, I just can't appreciate Music... She will always be the most influential celebrity in my life, though. My personal favorites are Human Nature and Beautiful Stranger. <BR>What's next, Maddy? Back to the eighties a little bit, I hope. Maybe some AFRICAN sounds? (Wish you teamed up with THIERRY MUGLER!!!)
157492589X|5.0|Movie is a CLASSIC and the acting by every actor in the movie was superb ~ but the music which plays throughout the whole movie is garbled to the point of distraction ~ I returned the VHS tape ~ but have recieved no replacement tape or refund so beware before buying!!

B000021XS0|5.0|This is one amazing album. And, perhaps, my new DT favorite.<br />Not only is the production back up to DT standards (thanks to Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci), but it's chock-full of fantastic musicianship, uplifting arrangements and melodies, nice background vocals and even tolerable lead vocals from James LaBrie. <br />Plus, and here's the really cool part, it's a full-blown CONCEPT album like my favorite progressive rock albums of old. (One of which is Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime.)<br />Petrucci's playing really shines on Scenes From a Memory. As does new keyboard player Jordan Rudess who seems to add a whole new layer to DT's already diverse musical landscape. His style is distinctly different from Derek Sherinian's (their previous keyboard player). Rudess (who played with Mike Portnoy and bassist Tony Levin in Portnoy's superb side project Liquid Tension Experiment) has a beautiful, creative, melodic style of playing that's immediately pleasing to my ear.<br />The only downside to this otherwise flawless album is the subject matter: reincarnation. That's hardly a new topic. In fact, it's quite passe. So it's a testament to Dream Theater's skill as musicians, songwriters and arrangers to pull off something that could have fallen flat on its face. Their music is fresh, even if the subject matter isn't.<br />It's hard to pick a favorite track, since they all seem to flow from one to another. But I like Track 6 (&quot;Beyond This Life&quot;) quite a bit. And Track 2 (&quot;Overture 1928&quot;). And the delicate Track 7 (&quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;). Overall, however, I think I prefer the depth, complexity and sheer drive of Act II over that of Act I. Starting with the Eastern-flavored, nearly 13-minute tour de force that's Track 6 (&quot;Home&quot;), Act II kicks off with a compelling bang and doesn't let up all the way to the end.<br />I won't go into what the &quot;concept&quot; is about because so many other reviewers have done so already. But it's interesting enough to hold one's attention. And the music is certainly stirring and bears repeated listenings.<br />If you're wondering what Dream Theater is all about, Scenes From a Memory would be a very good place to start.
B00005QATY|5.0|My favorite thing about this movie was that it was unpredictable.  The characters, the writing, and the folk music are all free of standard Hollywood cliches.  I really enjoyed looking for parallels to the Odyssey while watching the movie, and it made me want to reread the Odyssey and then watch O Brother again to pick up on all of the allusions.  Although this movie will make you think, it is also extremely funny, and has a creative and engaging storyline.  You don't need to know anything about The Odyssey to enjoy it either--it's good entertainment on its own.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Other reviewers prefer a softer Paul , this time he is rougher , he jams again ! and it seems that he is been listening to some good rock lately , because at moments this CD  takes different turns into a harder territory , (thanks a lot Mr. McCartney).<br />The Indian influenced song (Riding into Jaipur) is a great one(not for love song fans) and shows that he is still  searching for something new , the Jam(Rinse the raindrops) is a phenomenal 10 minutes piece that reminds me at moments the great CD &quot;The mirror ball&quot;  from Neil Young w/Pearl Jam.<BR>She's given up talking is a departure from Paul's classic sound and shows that there is hope to get a better album next time.<BR>The Hammond organ and the raw drums are alive and help the music feel more natural.<BR>Keep on listening good rock Paul , get some Radiohead and King Crimson and mix it with the White album and you will deliver a masterwork !!<br />4 Stars because he still let a couple of silly love songs appear on the CD.
0553213105|5.0|This is surely the most delicious of Jane Austen's novels. Austen writes with superb insight of the era she was living in!The characters are wonderful - the spirited and rebellious Lizzie Bennett, proud and handsome Darcy, the gloriously silly Mrs Bennett and the ogre that is Lady Catherine de Burgh. If you only ever read one classic novel, then this is the one to read. Follow it with the BBC video version (1995), a glass of wine, a large box of chocs. and curl up on the sofa. Enjoy !!
B0000009SE|5.0|You liked Hot Rats ? The grand wazoo ? What are you waiting for ?<BR>A phenomenal CD.
0440219078|4.0|I read this book with my daughter of 11 and found it to be frightening and kind of a downer. <br />The parts about the young boys budding sexuality was disturbing to me. I realized it was probably my own uncomfortableness about this rather than the fact that my daughter was reading this. She is probably having some of the same thoughts but I'm just not aware of it.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to kids 11 or older. Probably not the best for younger kids.
0140143505|5.0|I got an immense amount of pleasure reading this little book of correspondence between a woman in New York City and a used bookseller in London.  The letters span the years 1949 to 1969 and revolve primarily around Helene Hanff's search for English literature classics that she had difficulty acquiring in New York.  Could a book sound any blander???  Well, I'll tell you it's not!  It's a wonderful read.<br />I'd rather not go into any details lest I diminish the pleasure of this book to anyone unfamiliar with it and considering reading it.  It is not a love story, nor is it maudlin or overly sentimental, it's just wonderfully entertaining.<br />The only thing that might have made this book even better might have been some annotations or background information on some of the characters or the bookstore itself.  Though I hesitate in mentioning this because such additional material might actually take away from the charm of the book.<br />A couple of her subsequent books do answer some questions, but the books themselves are not quite the same as this unique volume.  Also, the book was made into a movie of the same name which was pretty good - but read the book first!
0871137380|5.0|It made me extremely uncomfortable to read about inabilities to fight in the modern age. <br />Mr. Bowden does a tremendous job of bringing each of the soliders to life in this book. As each solider is introduced and then cut down by enemy fire my heart fell into my gut. Mr. Bowden does a terrific job of presenting all sides of the story. I expected this book to be very technical but it was a very easy read.<br />This is a tragic story that I hope we, as a country, have learned from.
0446677450|4.0|I enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad even though it was a bit repetitive because it allowed me to draw my own conculsions about how to go about making money. This book was not a step by step analysis on how to get rich but rather gave insight on how to go about it. One of the points in the book is that you should learn as much as possible about business or the area you want to invest in, so reading this will give you a heads up. I would recommend this book for people between the ages of 20 to 40 because the processes Kiyosaki writes about take a few years to get your investment going. Kiyosaki gives good advice and gets different situations to make his points clear, which at times can get tedious. But overall I liked this book because I gained more knowledge of the business world.
1878424319|1.0|&quot;Unsubstantiated jibberish&quot; is the way I'd sum up this book. I found the author's lack of content irritating throughout. It reads quickly though as you won't be slowed down with any thought-provoking content.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This has to be the weirdest CD I have ever purchased. I have all the Shakia CD's in Spanish and I like tem a lot. This one however, gives me a bizar feeling. Hearing Shakira in English is weird enough, but the music it self is very funky in a popish way. As you can see I'm having truble explaining my self in english right now, but I guess this is the process she went through, expresing her ideas and feelings in English, which is hard. So not only did she learn another language, she also produced a record in English! so I give her credidt for that. Some songs are a bit repetitive. I like the insturment experimentation in Whenever Wherever, using Quenas and other folk Andenan instruments to give the song a very interesting texture, and she does the same in Tango. Buy this CD, It's funn and very original, you might need to listen to it a few times before you get into it, I am geting over that \\"bizarre\\" feeling. Shakira is a real artis, she makes her stuff and it has her stamp on it. The blond no-blond dilema is nothing once you get the point of Shakira. Experimentation and honest evolution as an artist and a woman. OK enough rambling, buy It and listen to it with an oppen mind. And take the time to listen to the other awsome Colombian artist like Aterciopelados if you like Alternative experimental and possitive stuff, Juanes for a Pop-Rock blended with Colombian Folk and Carlos Vives for pure Vallenato! Soraya is also cool, very clam and relaxing.<BR>(...)
B000004C0Y|1.0|This DVD's quality is poor at best.  As for this John Wayne film, this western ranks as one of my favorites.  Unfortunately you will see a better quality version of this if you wait for it to play on WTBS and then tape it with your own VCR (even if you use the oldest tape you own the quality will exceed the DVD).<br />This DVD was a MAJOR disappointment.
B00005Q66T|1.0|I love Madonna, her music career holds no boundaries.  But GHV2 is a bust.<br />There are no new songs on this CD, and furthermore she left out some of her singles, like &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, and &quot;Fever&quot; or even &quot;Rain&quot;.<br />However she puts in the mundane &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; from &quot;Ray of Light&quot; which wasn't even a single here in the US.<br />Also on here is the tired &quot;Take A Bow&quot; which is also on her &quot;Something To Remember&quot; compilation of ballads.<br />This is a poor greatest hits compilation.  She should of put songs from her &quot;Music&quot; CD like &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, her recent No.1 dance single &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, but they remain to be seen.<br />I feel Madonna is just cashing in now which makes me feel a little used after being a devoted fan for the past 18 years.<br />GHV2 is everything I already have.  Madonna should of put some dance remixes (like Deeper &amp; Deeper or Music)on this compilation as well as a couple of new hits....remember &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; which contained &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;?....<br />A total disappointment, and there is no reason to buy this like most Madonna fans they have ALL these songs.
B000003TB6|5.0|This album is incredible. If you like real hip-hop without all the violence and nastiness, this is what you've been looking for. The Roots have incredible skill and are quite innovative. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Blackstar, Jurassic 5, Del, Tribe Called Quest, you catch my drift.

B000002HH9|5.0|Finally got around to purchasing Wild Mood Swings. Another exceptional installment in The Cure saga.  Robert and Co once again steer clear of formulas that have brought prior success - a true indicator of real artistry - this is why I will ALWAYS come back to The Cure.  The title pretty much sums up this outing.  A wide range of sounds and moods; the horns and violin (Shankar??) are simply wonderful.  It was either Duke Ellington or Thelonius Monk who, referring to a question of genre, said &quot;There is only good music and bad music&quot; - This is most definitely good music.  No surprise.
0930289331|5.0|This book is a split story. One-half Bruce Wayne developing his fighting skills into the Batman, and One-half Lt. James Gordon trying to deal with corruption on the force, while trying to hunt down Batman for his vigilantism. A great, self-contained, story.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Summarized in three words, Driving Rain can be described as rocking, personal and versatile. With his profound lyrics Paul McCartney expresses his feelings from three years ago up to now in an open, personal way. Although they are profound and very often inviting to think twice, the lyrics are easy to remember and make you want to sing along.  They are completed by fresh, rocking and yet complex instumental arrangements. Paul shows his whole genius  in singing, composing and playing bass as well as acoustic guitar and sometimes piano.A great band completes the intense,versatile sound. The album starts with rather melancholic songs,nevertheless never losing hope showing at least in a reluctance to give up. Later, the songs express hapiness clearly inspired by a new love. Although the prevailing style is rocking,the album includes slowlier ballads as well and &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; reveals an eastern style that reminds of George Harrisons Indian-inspired work. &quot;Freedom&quot;, the reaction to the September 11th tragedy,is also included. Its a strong cry for freedom full of energy that refuses to hide away because of terrorism and encourages the listener to do the same. <BR>   Conclusion: A MUST for fans but also a great musical experience for people not yet knowing his previous work.
0930289455|5.0|I heard of this book for awhile. When I finally got it, I was shocked. It's a very disturbing story of the Joker's torment of Commissioner Gordon on one hellish night. <BR>This book is very graphic, and you don't end it with a sense that justice is done. But, you will be satisfied by the quality of the story and the art.
0790734850|5.0|Curtis Hansen's Brillent film noir is one of the best films ever made. A great cast of charecters great script and brillent direction what more could you want in a film.

B00004XQ83|5.0|Like that's a bad thing. A previous review mentioned that this is, in effect, not like today's music at all. Well, no kidding, and, thank Heavens. There's a reason that all through the movie, they call this an &quot;old-timey&quot; sound. This album is a cornucopia of southern music -- blues, gospel, bluegrass, and the traditional music that gave birth to modern country music -- and it can't be compared to popular genres of today, because it doesn't fit. If you can't listen to the instrumentation and vocal talent on this disc and enjoy it, at least some of it, you're not really much of a &quot;music lover&quot;. This album has more heart on it than a lot of studio-enhanced dreck released today from ANY musical genre.
0783227019|5.0|One Of Brain Da Palma's best films Al Pacino performance is remarkable way better than his performance in Scarface even theo the performance in scarface is good this blows it away.

Watch it you will love it.
0792844882|5.0|It may be thought that Showgirls is for the lonely salesman in the hotel room, as he punishes the minibar and wonders why his promises to both wife and pastor are as, as Shakespeare wrote, such straws in the wind.<br />In actuality, a subtext of this film happens to be profoundly proletarian in a way seldom seen in Hollywood productions...which despite their populism, celebrate Erin Brockovich's ESCAPE from proletarianization.<br />For Nomi wants to work.  Unlike many members of the working class, who accept mininum wage and dehumanizing work, however, Nomi swims, or dances, against the deskilling pressures of work by insisting that she wants to work as a dancer, using her unique (I'll say) body and talents.<br />The problem is that the corporation Nomi works for recognizes her star power but needs instinctively to have Nomi act in hypercompetitive fashion, by pushing other dancers down the stairs.  <br />(...)Nomi, like so many working people, is willing to work hard but unwilling to play this game.  Instead, she does a bit of revolutionary ultra-violence on a rock star who's raped her friend and walks away from Vegas.<br />There's a mysterious good old boy at the beginning and at the end who swipes, with a grin, Nomi's luggage but picks her up as she walks away.  Perhaps Dionysius, perhaps Elvis.<br />In a society which wars on dance, Showgirls manages to celebrate it almost in spite of its overt messages(...)

B000001FS3|5.0|This is the defining album in U2's catalogue, and was lustfully lauded.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I thought Incubus would never do anything as good as SCIENCE again. I was wrong. Almost every song on Morning View is melodic and heavy at the same time, and very original. The best one is &quot;Just a Phase,&quot; which slowly builds up for about 4 minutes is a fasion resembling Tool and later Sunny Day Real Estate, then breaks into a very intense chorus, which is almost orgasmal in nature. Incubus has proven themselves as a solid band with this release, making me forget a little mistake they made called Make Yourself. Awesome CD!
B00004VVNB|4.0|Between 2001 and Star Wars, you did have some fascinating sci-fi, such as &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; or &quot;Soylent Green.&quot;  &quot;Logan's Run&quot; was one of these.<br />Imagine a utopia where everyone has glitz and glimmer to the lees--until they turn 30.  Wasn't that the hippie's motto?  In any case, you are pulled into this world with Logan whose mission is to track down the runners.<br />The fascinating thing about this film is that it is so accurate.  Look at our superficial MTV age we live in, where old people are either run out, or chewed up into soylent green.  This movie was years ahead of its time.<br />By the way, it was parodied on Simpsons episode BABF16 - Kill the Alligator and Run, where the vee-jay is retires and replaced by a younger vee-jay.

B00003CXXI|5.0|Let me tell ya,  this movie was so good I thought that it was a Disney movie.  However, there is one way that you can tell Disney movies from everything else.  Disney movies do not have profanity.  Shrek does.  I would recommend this movie for kids who are at least ten years old and any adult.  Eddie Murphy out did himself as donkey.  Cameron Diaz was terrific as Princess Fiona. (I didn't know she was so good).  Mike Myers was perfect as Shrek.  John Lithgow was good as Lord Farquaad.  The muffin man scene was hilarious.  I love this movie.  I hope that it wins some awards too.  My only fear is that the dorky Harry Potter movie might have a higher box office and be an all time better movie.  I ain't gonna see it!
B00005JKES|5.0|&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; enthusiasts should know that a decent international/all-region DVD of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; pilot is easily obtainable from several venues, principally E-Bay and many specialty DVD retail sites. For a very reasonable price, I purchased a new, sealed copy from a vendor on E-bay. Though it may possibly be trimmed a few minutes from the edition that originally ran on network TV (as the running time is ninety minutes exactly, instead of the 100 minutes or so that most TV movies run without commercials), this international edition flows nicely, has great image quality, and DOES NOT have the cheap tacked-on ending &quot;resolving&quot; the mystery that other foreign editions reportedly do. It has the same creepy cliff-hanger fans remember (Mrs. Palmer screaming and the mysterious gloved hand digging up the hidden necklace). Just make sure you get the edition I'm talking about; the cover of the DVD I purchased shows photos of five or six of the main characters suspended above a black-and-white tiled floor.  So, those who are hesitating to get the season one box set from Amazon or another source because the pilot is missing shouldn't worry.  Just grab the pilot from one of the places I mentioned and you'll be all set for season one!
B00003CXDU|5.0|Viewed simply as a parody of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; phenomenon, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; could be considered the most fiercely exact satire since &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. Everything from the term &quot;questers&quot; to William Shatner's weirdly pompous body language (from wearing a girdle?) makes it into this very well written and acted comedy.<br />But what makes &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; such a perennially entertaining movie is the sweetness at its core. The naivete of the &quot;geeks&quot;, both terrestrial and alien, is portrayed with affection rather than ridicule - thus embracing the idealistic child inside each of us.
B000002KYK|3.0|The orchestrations are OK, I suppose, but they're not the actual music from the flick. Some of it sounds a little too disco. However, on the good side, Richard Tee's piano adaption of &quot;Memories of Green&quot; is very good. It effectively captures for me Deckard stuck in that rainy, cruddy city.
B00005JKGV|5.0|This is an excellent movie. For many months I had posted a review here that got it totally wrong. I thought that the first character (played by Pullman) was a fantasy, and the second was real. (And I wrote it before Mulholland Drive came out.) Well, I saw Lost Highway again recently, and now I'm of a different opinion. Here's a few hints, but I'll try not to spoil anything.<br />The movie is chronologically linear, with one exception (the very first scene). It doesn't jump around in time like Mulholland Drive does.<br />It is a subjective movie, telling a story from one character's perspective; and when that character becomes delusional, the movie consists of his delusions. In the very last scene, however, you can see what is happening to the character in the real world: he acts it out while he's driving.<br />Pay attention to these lines: \\"Sleep now,\\" and \\"We sentence him to death by electric chair.\\" And of course the one about Fred wanting to remember things his own way. The underlying story will be pretty clear to you.<br />This movie is eerie, the characters are mostly hostile toward one another, and you're left with an unsettled feeling when it's over. Some people don't like that, but if you enjoy The Twilight Zone you'll understand how a movie like this can be great.
B00005QDW5|4.0|What?????? A Pink Floyd &quot;best of&quot; (?) that finds room for 'When the Tigers Broke Free' (isn't that a Waters solo???) and omits anything at all from Atom Heart Mother, More, Ummagumma and the much-neglected Obscured by Clouds??????<br />Yes, it is pleasing to see several Syd Barrett tracks, although surely one among the plethora of bootlegged live versions of 'Interstellar Overdrive' could have been included, or an edit of the studio version at the very least, given the influence this piece carried at the time of its release.<br />Floyd neophites may find it an interesting intro to the band's oeuvre, but I suspect long-time acolytes would find it hard to forgive Gilmour and co for not being more selective in this compilation. Apparently, David Gilmour fought in vain for the inclusion of 'Fat Old Sun', but the idea of a 'Best of Pink Floyd' without &quot;Cymbaline&quot;, Ummagumma's breathtaking live version of &quot;Careful With that Axe Eugene&quot;, the wonderful &quot;Childhoods End&quot; and Rick Wright's magical &quot;Paint Box&quot; etc just doesn't cut the mustard, at least not for this reviewer.<br />In these days of interactive technology, perhaps the Floyd should have invited suggestions from their public as to a track list. <br />On a more positive note, the inclusion of 'High Hopes' from 1994's very fine &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, 'Sheep' (from 'Animals') and the usual DSOTM standards partly redeems the omissions stated above.<br />Of course, the music is all wonderful if you like this sort of thing (remembering John Lydon's classic &quot;I hate Pink Floyd&quot; t-shirt!) and objectively identifying a quintessential &quot;best of&quot; is nigh on impossible.<br />Memo Messrs Gilmour, Wright and Mason: about time for something new methinks, and not a time to rest on one's laurels...<br />For everyone else, Pink Floyd did NOT begin with Dark Side of the Moon. Try back-catalouging to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, More,Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds. You won't be disappointed.....<br />Also try Syd Barrett's solo collection for a real awakening.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears is back and she wants you to know a few things. She's a &quot;slave 4 u&quot;, &quot;lonely&quot;, and &quot;overprotected.&quot; Basically, Britney's screaming I'M AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN! So watch out! Ok so now we know but is BRITNEY any good? Well, it is. It's not as sugary as her last 2 albums but it still packs in the grooves. Songs like &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot; and &quot;anticipating&quot; are very well done. On &quot;boys&quot; she struts a sexy voice with lines like &quot;sometimes you just need one&quot; and &quot;you're a sexy guy/i'm a nice girl/let's turn this dance floor/into our own little nasty world&quot;. On the ballads side, &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; is a dud. She sounds so sappy that it just ruins the entire song. The lyrics are kinda lame too. The other, is an awesome mid-tempo ballad called &quot;that's where you take me.&quot; Britney wrote or co-wrote 5 tracks on here and those are the best ones on BRITNEY. The dream team --Max Martin et al-- seem to have run out of fresh ideas for this project. Songs like &quot;lonely&quot; and &quot;boombastic love&quot; sound strained and stale like they could've been BSB or Nsync outakes. The track &quot;what it's like to be me&quot; --that Justin contributed-- leaves a lot to be desired. It's the weakest song on the album. BRITNEY is Britney's most personal album. It's also her least polished album to date. It's not her best but it shows growth. Oh, and you can groove along to it too.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|i was so excited when they made the movie. I am the biggest fan of this game, let alone an angelina jolie follower. This movie is action packed, and most of what is in this movie is actually in the game. I couldnt help but watch this movie and twitch my fingers like as if i was in control.<BR>i highly recommend this movie...especially fans of the game....
B00005OM4N|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter the day it was released.  She owns all 3 of Britney's CD's.  I must admit, even I have been caught listening to her CD.  My daughter loves her CD and would listen to it 24/7 if I would let her.  Anyone who loves Britney's music will love this CD.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Being a close follower of his life and work for more than 25 years, this is the album I never dared to hope he could still be able to come up with. When I put the album on last night, it took me six, seven songs to jump up and whisper to myself: this is impossible, this is the best he's done, since.... Abbey Road. This one reminds me why I started to love him when I was a kid listening to the first Beatles' albums. It's a fantastic album!<br />Let's be frank here. Although his later albums still had some wonderful music on it, sometimes you would have asked yourself whether Macca had completely lost touch of reality (Give my regards to Broad Street), sometimes he was too kitschy to bear (So bad, or that bit on Off the Ground with the lady and animals on their &quot;mossy nest&quot; uurrgh), often I thought, he was producing rather forced or pale efforts to recapture the magic inspirations of the sixties (C'mon people, Young boy). Only in the ballads of the grown family man and his adventurous FIREMAN trips, one found consolation. (Well, A LEAF was fab too.) But DRIVING RAIN sounds as if he was thirty years younger, full of energy, full of joy, hope and FULL OF INSPIRATION. The spark is there, the fire is there, the ballads sound heartfelt, the band is rocking and fresh. Paul McCartney has entered a new phase in his life and you can hear it. I can only congratulate him and us as well. He has proven it yet again -- that he still is one of if maybe not THE best living songwriter and performer. What a joy to have him still writing and playing for us. Thanks Paul, as a Radio Dj once said: when you get a Paul McCartney record, it's as if your birthday and Xmas would fall on one day. -- An effortless triumph.

B00004U45G|5.0|This 2 disk set from Page and the very talented Black Crowes is a must for all Zeppelin fans and people who appreciate great music in general. You have heard all of these songs before, but never quite like this. The vocals are Plantesque, but different enough from the original to make the album entertaining again and again. The group also covers other artists (Peter Green, Elmore James and others) and all of the tracks are worthy. It seems everything Jimmy Page does is top-notch stuff. My greatest musical regret is that I didn't see this group when they toured.
6300216209|5.0|Love Story was an amazing movie. It made me experience an incredible range of emotions from happiness to sorrow. I couldn't help but laughing at the loving abuse that Jenny showed Oliver with her &quot;preppy&quot; remarks or cry at the sorrowful ending that you know is coming, but just don't want to accept. This is a movie that I think all generations of women will love, but men don't exclude this movie. My mother loved it, I loved it, and I'm sure I'll share it with my children and grandchildren someday.  Seeing this movie is an experience you should have atleast once in your life.

B00005QDW5|4.0|Being born listening to many different styles of music, I got to confess that Pink Floyd was among one of the more interesting bands I had heard (in retrospect, I didn't suspect that some songs I heard on the radio growing up were part of the band's library, like &quot;Have A Cigar&quot;, sadly not on this compilation).  This compilation has a good scattering of material from their history (and from what I read in the previous reviews, that's a good or bad thing), but there are still some songs that I hoped would be in this set, like &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot; (a classic album in it's own right).  Still, some of the good &quot;best of&quot; compilations are always meant to whet the appetite of new fans, not the long-time ones.  This one fits the bill perfectly.
006016848X|1.0|If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, why does my birth certificate say &quot;Detroit?&quot;<br />I am a woman in my mid-50's and I am a person, not a stereotype. Some things I do may seem &quot;stereotypically&quot; feminine. I love babies, I think about relationships, and even though I am an adult, I like cute, cuddly, stuffed toys . . . especially dogs and teddy bears. And I have a two year old Chihuahuah mix puppydog whom I have lavishly spoiled.<br />But I don't always talk about what bothers me, and while I appreciate a person's caring, I value my privacy -- in other words, I have a cave as deep as any man's, and I don't talk about my problems until I am good and ready to. Did I also mention that I have a dragon at the mouth of my cave, too?<br />I care about my friends, but I don't always take an active interest in what they are doing because I am busy frying my own fish. Weddings bore the living daylights out of me -- unless, of course, as an organist, I can make some extra money playing for them. And as for being &quot;romantic. . . &quot; well, I am kind hearted and affectionate, but I've had several relationships with men go right down the drain because the one who has been unromantic was ME! At the moment I am contemplating getting married, but my idea of a perfect wedding is the Justice Of The Peace office with the secretary and maintenance man as witnesses!<br />Men and women are different; of course! It wouldn't be fun if they weren't. But I don't think the line is as sharply drawn as Dr. Gray says it is. I'll admit that when a smart cookie like Dr. Gray makes his statements, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that something is wrong with me. But when it comes to a choice between self-acceptance and Dr. Gray acceptance, I'll take my own, thank you.<br />I am wondering what kind of effect his book has had on men. Stereotypes are as unfair to men as to women.<br />If a man has a dragon by his cave, that's OK. However, he had better keep his dragon tamed, just as I have to keep mine tamed. The second that I get bitten by someone's dragon, I confront the owner. We adults need to keep our pets under control, don't we?ep his dragon tamed, just as I have to keep mine tamed.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I am a die-hard Disney fan and yet I absolutely loved how this movie poked fun at some of the best Disney classics.  <br />Rolling in the aisles doesn't even begin to describe our reaction to this movie.<br />Enjoy!
0694013889|5.0|&quot;Once Upon a Potty,&quot; by Alona Frankel, is a fun book for small children and their caregivers. The book tells the story of Prudence, a little girl who has gotten a new potty, and is learning how to use it.<br />The book is full of bright, friendly illustrations. There are explicit depictions of body parts, urine, and excrement: this enhances the educational value of the book, in my opinion. There are a number of nice touches, like the pretty flower pattern of the mom's dress.<br />Although I have only seen the &quot;girl&quot; version of the book, I understand there is also a &quot;boy&quot; version. &quot;Once Upon a Potty&quot; is a good book for families going through toilet training, but would also make a nice light-hearted gift for anybody.
B000003S0Z|5.0|Why hip hop has not discovered and sampled the hell out of Brian Eno's music is a mystery to me.  If Puffy or Dr. Dre ever get a hold of &quot;No One Receiving&quot;, you'll see DJ's all over digging in their record crates for Eno albums.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Who would've thought that Madonna would have a second &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album? Certainly not me. She was suppose to fade in the eighties and forget who she was in the nineties. She refused to disappear. Originally, I was going to write a negative review of this album because there is no new mixes or new songs on GHV2 but I have to review it as what it is, a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album.<br />GHV2 is a collection of songs that showcase Madonna's evolution as an entertainer. No other artist can tranform her music like she can. Whether it's because she is a true artist or a manipulator, it doesn't matter. As you listen to each song, you realize Madonna has an ear for good music. The songs aren't as catchy as in the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; but GHV2 has better songs. She moved on from &quot;popcorn&quot; music to adult songs that touch the heart, soul and feet.<br />Would I recommend this album? If you already have all of her albums, don't bother. There is nothing new here unless you have to buy it just to have it because you're a fan. If you only have a few of her albums, this album is a must.
0898705525|4.0|&quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is described by Chesterton as &quot;a slovenly autobiography&quot;, a description that's really not too far off the mark. Instead of depending upon rigorous logic, the contents of this work are rather &quot;mental pictures&quot; of a sort, which is what the author states at the outset. This sort of approach is easy to attack by any contrarian skeptic, but I can't criticize Chesterton, as he and I are really cut from the same cloth. Loath to state the obvious, we both prefer to *illustrate* the truth via induction. This is a perfectly valid method of presenting ideas, it's just that it's easy to misunderstand and misrepresent. It's for this reason that this book probably wouldn't change someone's mind-kind of a litmus test for the open-minded, which, it turns out, self-proclaimed `skeptics' or `freethinkers' are anything but.<br />Chesterton makes two really good points throughout the book: 1) sanity lies in maintaining seemingly opposed extremes in a kind of dramatic tension. It's not balance, it's both at once. It's not a contradiction, it's a paradox. Christianity fits this like nothing else: singularity/plurality, freedom/servanthood, individuality/assimilation, etc., all are fused together in seeming contradiction of common sense. But don't we always find truth to be stranger than fiction? In contrast, monomania is a kind of insanity, like total belief in oneself, or the belief that one unfalsifiable human construct, like evolution, completely illuminates everything. 2) The importance of maintaining a kind of humble childlike wonder about the world, the universe, about existence itself. What if you saw a four-inch-long fully-functional helicopter hovering about? Wouldn't that be delightfully incredible? Not too long ago, after reading this book, it dawned on me, upon observing a dragonfly, that that was precisely what I was looking at. I'm not even talking about creationism, irreducible complexity, any of that. It is in fact, neither here nor there. Just the fact that such a marvelous thing should exist, by any means, is truly stupendous. It should inspire deeper thought about fundamental issues. The modern-day `scientific' priesthood is perpetually at pains to systematically dismantle the ability to see things this way even as they proclaim it superficially.<br />The funny thing about Chesterton's writing is that he gets so wrapped up in his ideas that rather strange-sounding, apparent non-sequiturs come up every so often. A sample Chestertonism: &quot;As a fact, anthropophagy [cannibalism] is certainly a decadent thing, not a primitive one. It is much more likely that modern men will eat human flesh out of affectation, than that primitive man ate it out of ignorance.&quot; Well, duh!? As in his Father Brown mysteries, Chesterton loves to toss off sweeping statements, and is a bit too shy of explicating his ideas with the utmost clarity sometimes; chalk it up to slovenliness, I guess.But for the most part his ideas are sound and his writing thought-provoking.or there.

B000002U82|5.0|There are plenty of reasons why Pink Floyd's 1973 masterpiece DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is one of the most enduring and popular albums ever released.  It's the beauty and majesty of the music, how it continues to flow so well even when it's discussing the grim subjects of insanity and death.  It's how you are able to lose yourself and be entranced by the mesmerizing sound effects and subtle rhythms that are layered upon one another.  The biggest impact of DARK SIDE is Roger Waters' extremely powerful and poetic lyrics.  This is by far the best lyrical album I've ever heard (and I own a lot of CDs!).  It's amazing how the music and words fit into the dark concept even so after 28 years.<br />Although there are nine tracks on DARK SIDE, each one comes immediately after the other, making essentially a long 43-minute suite.  All of the sounds that will come on the album are meshed together at the beginning of &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe,&quot; which is a soothing and relaxing opener before leading into the sound effects bash of the frantic &quot;On the Run.&quot;  &quot;Time&quot; is definitely one of my favorite songs of all time.  The imagery that Waters uses on this track is spellbinding.  David Gilmour is one of the best guitar players on the face of the earth; he knows when NOT to overplay, and his solo is just--in a word--amazing, as well as Nick Mason's cool drum intro.<br />The emotional high point of the record is &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky,&quot; a very moving instrumental which features female backup singer Clare Torry wailing her heart out during the sad passage(which sounds like a funeral dirge).  I'm sure everybody knows &quot;Money,&quot; the commentary on greed with its infectious bass line and &quot;Us and Them&quot; with its jazzy saxophone and moving organ playing, followed by another trippy instrumental (&quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;) and the concluding medley (&quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot;).<br />One of the defining works by one of the best bands.<BR>-&quot;There is no dark side of the moon.  As a matter of fact, it's all dark.&quot;
B00005QK3W|5.0|I'm Blown Away !!

The Only Problem With This Disc (Besides Being Too Short) Is Paul's Choice for the first singles. instead of from a lover/loving flame he should have released about you/your way. or she's given up talking/heather. this disc should assault the airwaves........Thank You Paul  More More More.
B00005Q66T|5.0|MADONNA's GHV2 (Greatest Hits Volume 2) takes off where THE IMMACUALTE COLLECTION with her previous hits from 1982-1990 left off. GHV2 has her hits from 1992-2001 Although this album does not have the hits in the order they came out it still works. This album includes 15 of MADONNA's biggest hits in this order ~ DEEPER AND DEEPER, EROTICA, HUMAN NATURE, SECRET, DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA, BEDTIME STORY, THE POWER OF GOODBYE, BEAUTIFUL STRANGER, FROZEN, TAKE A BOW, RAY O LIGHT, DON'T TELL ME, WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL, DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE, MUSIC. This album is a great collection and despite a few songs like Human Nature, and Don't Cry For Me Argentina this collection works really good. Sadly this album does not have any new songs on it and these songs are all the originals just edited versions of most of them. I have to say MADONNA did not become the most successful female recording artist in history by doing the same kind of music. MADONNA takes risks and here you will see how she has truly evolved and how her music is always changing and one step ahead of the rest. From the 1992 Erotica naughty girl Dita Parlo, to the 2001 angry Girl in What It Feels Like For A Girl, MADONNA continues her control as the QUEEN OF POP and the most amazing women in POP music today. Let MADONNA's GHV2 Open Your Heart and let you be touched again for the very first time. Remember your Frozen until you get this album and then you will see a Ray O Light in this Drowned World. Now that I have shared my review and my Secret with all you Beautiful Strangers please dig Deeper and Deeper in to your pockets BUY this MADONNA GHV2 CD, Take A Bow and last but not least enjoy MADONNA's Music.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Bring no expectations to this film. Some reviewers have been (over)using the word &quot;linear&quot; in writing about this film, trying to describe the fact the story is not told beginning with A, and progressing neatly to B, and all the way to Z. However, the film does more than simply skip randomly from one letter to another. The film has a precise structure.<br />Leonard is a man with Hippocampal brain damage. He has short term memory as long as he sticks to one subject. As soon as the subject changes, he has forgotten what he was previously discussing. Someone says something to him, he turns his head, and has forgotten what was said. He also cannot make new memories. He remembers everything that happened in his life before the head injury he sustained when his wife was raped and killed. (or was he hit just before she was attacked?)<br />Leonard is a fighter, however. He tattoos information on his body. He takes Polaroids and writes information on them in indelible black ink. He has a flow chart on the wall of his hotel room with pictures and notes. Step by step, Leonard is learning to cope with his brain deficit. His struggle and success is symbolized (in case we miss it) in his tattoos. The early ones are amateurish scrawls, while the later ones are precise lettering, and the very recent artistic script.<br />The narrative structure for this story is Leonard's ability to frame his experiences. At first it is poor, and the viewer is confused. We see scenes, and are introduced to characters, but we can't make any connections among them. Later in the movie, each scene makes sense; it connects to something else; we see the whole picture, and not scattered and disjointed bits.<br />It is very clever. I thought of Roshomon, watching it, but it is much more intricate than Roshomon. Even more mind-boggling is Guy Pearce as Leonard. He proves himself a consummate actor in this film, at least to me. His range is astounding: the last film I saw him in was Priscilla, Queenof the Desert.<br />Also, if you see this film, you get to hear one of the funniest lines of the year: &quot;What's going on here? OK...I'm chasing him. No. He's chasing me.&quot;
B00003CWTI|4.0|In the opening scenes of 'Magnolia' PT Anderson goes a great length in setting up the premise that the implausible is certainly not impossible.  However, an hour into the movie, the unusual opening scenes can be conveniently forgotten.  The movie settles into a comfortable zone, relating stories of a group of individuals who are going through a certain crisis in their lives.<br />There is the male-power guru who has the chance to watch his estranged father dying.  There is the grown-up child genius that is searching for the meaning of his mundane life after the spotlight of television gameshow fades away.  Meanwhile, another child genius is struggling with the same spotlight that he hardly desires.   All these stories and more are told masterfully.  Anderson will show you that he has what it takes to convey such vivid emotions across the screen.  Throw in a fabulous soundtrack by Aimee Mann (although words have it that Anderson was inspired by Mann's songs and not the other way round), and there is the drama waiting to pluck the Oscars.<br />Or so you thought.  Anderson shifts into the high gear and the denounement will blow you away.  Then you remember why he painstakingly set up the opening scenes.  As an audience you don't really know what to make of it, to like it or to turn away in disgust.  <br />The truth is, 'Magnolia' is as much a drama as it is a showpiece.  It exudes arrogance and for once you remember as an average moviegoer you are at the mercy of the director.  He is the storyteller and like it or not, he has the power over you.  PT Anderson has certainly mastered the art of film-making and he is not content with delivering your average drama.  However, is he good enough to do what he does with this movie?  That is for you to decide.  Personally, I think he is.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul has made a comeback after his disappointing 'Flaming Pie'. Not that I had any doubt he would. The sound is lean, and he adds <BR>some muscle to this record which he has not done for some time. Jazz fans might take some notice of this recording as well, since Abe Laboriel Jr.'s chops are given soem prominence; no Ringo Starr here. Also, the Hammond B3 organ is given a significant role. Very hip.  The track 'She's Given Up Talking' has a feel an an extended playout which has retro-seventies funk written all over it. 'Spinning on an Axis' also explores seventies retro, but it will not remind you of Paul's own seventies output. Some nice use of elecrixc piano on this one. 'Your Loving Flame' is a minor gem, an anthem, nicely handled. <br />'Driving Rain' has all of Paul's pop and rock sensibilities in full form, and his vocals are excellent. Recommended.
B000021XS0|1.0|I'm gonna get slammed for writing this review, but I don't care.  These Amazon reviews are idiotic.  Everybody just reviews their favorite stuff, so you end up with every single CD, (from Creed to the Insane Clown Posse) with a 4.5 or 5 star rating.  I consider myself a pretty open minded guy when it comes to music.  I'm a huge music fan and I listen to anything I get my hands on: electronica, jazz, indie rock, hip hop, etc.  And once upon a time, I even dug prog rock and heavy metal.  I still spin my old Genesis albums every once in a while.  Anyway, when I first heard about DT a few years ago, I tried my best to enjoy them, but I found it to be a difficult task.  <br />No matter how hard I try, I can't get into them.  My main complaint is that they sound incredibly cold and mechanical.  If you program a bunch of robots to play instruments flawlessly I imagine this is what you'll get.  Sure, they have amazing technical skill, but unless you're a 15 year old teenage boy, that won't be enough to hold your attention.  Queensryche and Rush might not have had as much technique, but atleast they could write some good songs.  And anybody that says this James guy can sing like Geoff Tate is kidding themselves.  His operatic wailing is grotesque.  Also, I'm not all that impressed by John Petrucci.  To me, he sounds like he just plays a bunch of fast scale runs.  I'd rather hear a lyrical guitarist like Marc Ribot than a guy who sounds like he's practicing his scales.  (I've seen John Petrucci's guitar video and it was VERY revealing)  I think a great guitarist is one like Wes Montgomery... a guitarist that might practice all day, but can leave his practicing where it belongs... at home, and not on stage.  <br />To be honest, I'm being a bit harsh.  I would probably give it a 2.5, but I'm giving it a 1 instead to offset all of the raving 5 star reviews.  The band is certainly ambitious, which is commendable.  Also, there are certain times when DT can trancend their flaws andactually make moving music (like in the pretty good &quot;Images and Words&quot; and the okay &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;).  But those moments are few and far in between on this album.  On a side note, you prog rock guys should listen to Ween's &quot;The Mollusk&quot;.  Absolutely hillarious prog rock parody.  (a lot of it sounds exactly like vintage ELP)  In conclusion:  Bring on the unhelpful votes!
B000056HRZ|5.0|Above the plot and the intrigue, and the great actors and incredible dialogue amd music. Beyond the filmwork and characters, and the tension of war... OK... that alone makes this a great movie.<br />Beyond all of that is a love story, and a story about what matters in life.<br />Rick is faced with a decision about a lover now married to someone else. With this, he must also consider not just her husband, but the impact stealing her back would have on her and her husband's efforts to stop the war.<br />Adding to the reviews here is difficult. Buy it, and if you don't buy, rent it. You'll be back to buy it later. It really is that good.<br />I fully recommend this movie on every level I can.<br />Anthony trendl
014028009X|5.0|I read this book in about a day..it was that good! I could not put it down!! I later saw the movie , which was excellent also, but the book was even better! I have recently read the sequel, and again, was not disappointed! Bridget Jones is someone that any woman can relate to on some level! I definitely reccommend this book and its sequel!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Bring no expectations to this film. Some reviewers have been (over)using the word &quot;linear&quot; in writing about this film, trying to describe the fact the story is not told beginning with A, and progressing neatly to B, and all the way to Z. However, the film does more than simply skip randomly from one letter to another. The film has a precise structure.<br />Leonard is a man with Hippocampal brain damage. He has short term memory as long as he sticks to one subject. As soon as the subject changes, he has forgotten what he was previously discussing. Someone says something to him, he turns his head, and has forgotten what was said. He also cannot make new memories. He remembers everything that happened in his life before the head injury he sustained when his wife was raped and killed. (or was he hit just before she was attacked?)<br />Leonard is a fighter, however. He tattoos information on his body. He takes Polaroids and writes information on them in indelible black ink. He has a flow chart on the wall of his hotel room with pictures and notes. Step by step, Leonard is learning to cope with his brain deficit. His struggle and success is symbolized (in case we miss it) in his tattoos. The early ones are amateurish scrawls, while the later ones are precise lettering, and the very recent artistic script.<br />The narrative structure for this story is Leonard's ability to frame his experiences. At first it is poor, and the viewer is confused. We see scenes, and are introduced to characters, but we can't make any connections among them. Later in the movie, each scene makes sense; it connects to something else; we see the whole picture, and not scattered and disjointed bits.<br />It is very clever. I thought of Roshomon, watching it, but it is much more intricate than Roshomon. Even more mind-boggling is Guy Pearce as Leonard. He proves himself a consummate actor in this film, at least to me. His range is astounding: the last film I saw him in was Priscilla, Queenof the Desert.<br />Also, if you see this film, you get to hear one of the funniest lines of the year: &quot;What's going on here? OK...I'm chasing him. No. He's chasing me.&quot;
B00005QXXO|5.0|If you felt Kid A and Amnesiac were too cold, inhuman or mechanical, you'll truly appreciate this album.  It brings a human warmth to Radiohead's latest albums... and leaves you aching to see them live.<br />HIGHLY recommended.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Classic, Classic, Classic. Those three words seem destined forever to describe this movie, and it's tempting to over-rely on them when reviewing it. However if we look beyond the fun and games of the promotions department at Disney, we see an intelligent and caringly crafted piece of art, which is probably as relevant to-day as the updated version made for its 50th<br />anniversary.<br />The music used is mainly well-known, and is as timeless in its own way as the various animations used as an accompaniment. This is a wonderful way to present orchestral music to the children of the Nintendo generation, and a perfect film to sit round and watch with all the family. I recommend buying the restored original version which is available on DVD for any British<br />viewers who have only seen the Wizard's Apprentice clip time after time on Screen Test!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I will not let my children watch this movie again. Enough said, poor judgment on Disney's behalf.
B00005Q66T|5.0|GHV2 takes a retrospective look at the career of Madonna, from where THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION left off. Starting with &quot;Erotica&quot; all the way to &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, this is a fair representation of Madonna's hits. Sadly no new tracks, but that's how it is sometimes. Madonna wanted this album out in Spring 2002, and said she'd do three new songs, and a new photo shoot. The record label wanted it for Christmas, so she said no new songs or new pictures. But you know its still worth having. It may not include all of her singles from the 90's but its a fair representation of Madonna's career in the 90's. The songs appear in edit forms, many radio edits, some in original form, some edited solely for this album. The booklet features a candid biography on Madonna in the 90's, and has an extensive supply of pictures over the years. Overall, this is a must buy, like THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. Essential for your collection.
0345451325|5.0|I read this as soon as I could get my hands upon it and let me tell you that it was not in the least a letdown. I loved the book from start to finish and now know a lot deeper into the story of Halo. The book starts out with Dr. who started the whole Spartan project looking for candidates into the program for the soldier that is seen in Halo. The story progresses focusing on the boy who would grow up into the Master Chief [I don't want to give anything away] But, as the covenant begins to close in the story escalates to a large battle between the human and covenant that ends where Halo begins. So this is a great book if you wish to delve deeper into the story behind Halo and why it is one of the most innovative storylines in the gaming industry as well as the best game for Xbox. Enjoy!
0792156684|5.0|I've watched this movie about 20 times and each time I watch it I get transfixed by this perfect love story.  I'm sure that anyone who watches this will fall in love with it.  It's a tragic love story that stays in the heart forever.  I love it!  Buy it!
B00005OB0A|4.0|After the exultant disco of her last album 'Light Years', 'Fever' sees Kylie moving forward to the 80s.  To be frank, this era suits her far better - 'Light Years' was a masterpiece of disco excess, but too often the broad gestures of the music left Kylie's limited voice seeming a little thin.  here, the settings are much sparer, the arrangements leaner, the production so clinical you could hear a stilletto crack ringing across it.  the influences here are minimalists such as Gary Numan, early Pet Shop Boys, early house (in its poppier variant), the Madonna of 'Borderline'; her nearest contemparies might be Spiller.<br />the exemplary song is the single, 'I Can't get you out of my head', with its very simple elements - the insistent bass; flickers of synth like a wind-brushed harp; gleaming faux-strings lines.  there is no chorus to speak of, just an undulating loop of severe melody.  these limitations, as on the rest of the album, free Kylie's voice, and the song, so simple yet so addictive, is far and away the standout single of 2001.<br />this is not to say disco is forgotten.  the second half is a particularly fantastic treat, with the late-Pet Shop Boys stomp of 'Dancefloor', the guitar-sparked intensity of 'Love Affair', or the epic 'Burning up', in which acoustic calm is consumed by leaping flames of disco inferno.  Even so, this is disco as practised by Chic, restrained and formally disciplined, rather than the extravagance of 'Light Years'.<br />Lyrically, 'Fever' is an album that speaks very frankly about sex.  In this case, however, the doubles entendres move away from this subject, rather than towards it, and point to another three-minute miracle (!) - the pop song.  When Kylie says 'I'm only here for a little while', she seems to be talking about pleasure and availability, but she is also celebrating the brevity and transience of her chosen medium, its power to transform and take over.  Kylie doesn't make pop records.  She IS pop.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Okay don't expect the meaning of life in Miss spears new album but it is light hearted and she is the queen of bubble gun.  Actually don't expect the meaning of anything in this overproduced eye candy.  Britney is a sweet girl, and her wanna be nastie is not working out.  She should start going back saying &quot;yal&quot; and &quot;yes mama&quot;--we love her for it.<br />For example her track &quot;boys&quot; starts off with her singing in her typical robotic recorder voice &quot;so curious&quot; over and over it is really annoying.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paule McCartney's greatest gift has been songwriting. In this album he shows us his talents to the max. His new album is a breath of fresh air to those who are tired of the current stuff out there. The best tracks on this album are the ballads. Some like &quot;from a lover to a friend&quot; have the records most raw and best moments. &quot;i do&quot; with its delicate melody and softly arranged strings is a standout track. &quot;this is all I want/This is all i need/This is all I long for/i do. The ballads are great but rock is certainly not missing. &quot;driving rain&quot; has an uptempo melody and rocking beat. Its a great car song. His voice sounds the same as when he was with the Beatles. One of the songs, &quot;Freedom&quot; is a benefit for the victims of September 11. Its an amazing track like the whole album itself. If you like any of this guys work, then pick this Cd up!
B00005R2BG|2.0|I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the high ratings this movie got here and at IMDb! Don't be sucked in by this. I believe that all the people who loved this movie wrote a review, and most of those who disliked it didn't bother.<br />The hysterical hype surrounding this movie would have it that people laughed, cried, clapped and generally had epiphanies when they saw the movie. All I can say is, the packed audience that I say it with was as underwhelmed as I was!<br />Down to the nitty gritty:<br />Plot: young poet (McGregor) goes to Paris and falls in love with performer (Kidman) at the Moulin Rouge, much to the displeasure of the influential Duke who's fixated with her. There's not much else to the plot!<br />Acting: Ewan McGregor's character is one dimensional, but he is very endearing and earnest in his performance. The loving way he looks at Satine is very moving. Kidman fares less well. She makes a stunning entry, but her annoyingly twitchly performance has surprising litlle impact for all that she tries too hard. She's easily the most forgettable thing in the film, and it's hard to feel anything for her character, such as it is.<br />Singing &amp; Dancing: Ewan's voice is quite attractive for the most part, although it's deficiencies sometimes shows. Kidman's weak voice is painfully obvious when she has to cope with more demanding songs than &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;. There is hardly any real dancing in the movie apart from some bumping and grinding.<br />Production Values: very good. Sets and costumes are sumptuous, as expected.<br />Visual Style: MTV watch out! The director likes to move the camera... a lot! <br />Music: There's been a lot of talk about how innovative the music is. It isn't. Basically, old hits are recycled in new ways, which makes the film less orignal that the Astaire/Rogers movies<br />Overall, this was a moderately entertaining movie that doesn't deserve the praise or condemnation that is has received. It can dragin some places, and isn't original, innovative or<BR>controversial in any way. Take the gushing reviews you read here with a large pinch of salt, and you might enjoy Moulin Rouge.
6305003882|5.0|A great movie about the world of drugs and drug-users.  Leonardo is a superb actor in this movie-- the best I've seen him.  This film is very sad but does give the brutal truth about heroin.  Not necessarily a happy movie but it does get my vote!  Buy it!
0198534469|5.0|Needham's book is a masterpiece which will be appreciated by anyone who already has gained (or is simultaneously gaining) a firm knowledge of the traditional, i.e. more algebraic, approach to complex analysis. In addition to reading it for pleasure, I have used the book extensively in teaching 18.04 Complex Variables with Applications at MIT, not as a required textbook, but rather as inspiration for lectures and homework problems. The book helps me give the students (mostly undergraduates in applied mathematics, science, and engineering) the geometrical insights needed for a deeper understanding of the subject, beyond what is found in various standard texts, such as Churchill and Brown or Saff and Snider (the required textbook for 18.04). As a prelude or companion to Needham's book, however, I would recommend reading one of these other books and working through more  straightforward examples of algebra and calculus with complex functions.  With that said, Needham's book is a perfect supplement to a first course in complex analysis. <br />Needham's book is unique in its clear explanation of how the rich properties of analytic functions all follow from the &quot;ampli-twist&quot; concept of complex differentiation. In my class, I use this crucial, geometrical idea from the first mention of the derivative, where it goes hand in hand with the concept of conformal mapping (which is often at the back of introductory texts, but which I think should appear near the beginning). Perhaps the most delighful section of Needham's book is the one where he uses the same ampli-twist concept to give a very intuitive, unified proof of Cauchy's theorem, Morera's theorem, and the fact that a loop integral of the conjugate gives 2i times the area enclosed. The book also contains many clever and challenging problems, which are appropriate to give students to help them &quot;think outside the box&quot;, as it were. <br />The most amazing thing about Needham's book is that it is sure to delight and edify both beginners and experts alike with its simple, geometrical explanations. This is all the more impressive because geometry in mathematics education is more traditionally a vehicle to teach rigorous proofs rather than intuitive understanding.
0451204530|1.0|How could a Harvard grad, WWII veteran, spy, and engineer not know where Newport News was? The use of xeroxing has been mentioned as a reflexion of poor editing; I agree, that troubled me to the point where I wondered what other historical information was also untrue.  At one point our hero is driving a jeep on the Florida sands, the next moment he leaves his &quot;car&quot; to venture on foot. No one in 1958 called a jeep a car. Shouldn't do it now either, but back then a jeep was a four-wheel, very rugged, but very small off-road vehicle that would never have been referred to as a car. Sloppy work. No more Follet.  I actually felt sorry for his editors, I imagine they caught errors but due to publishing deadlines, the changes were not incorporated into the final book.  On the ideolgical side, too little depth to explain the motivation of those who leaned to the left. It also seemed too far fetched that a small group of young pre-war coeds in Cambridge would all play such significant roles in the major events of the world.

B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul is still influenced by music of the day.  In the 60s, it was Brian Wilson, and The Who (And a number of other bands).  In 2001, it is Radiohead.  Driving Rain feels like a response to today's music (By today's music I do not mean Creed or Britney).  It is clear he spent a lot of time fooling around in the studio, but the melodies and words at the core are pure old school P-Mac.  The songs are happy love songs, sad love songs, and jolly car driving ditties.  &quot;Your way&quot; seems to be the stand out track on the album.  WARNING: Paul rocks on this album.  Don't let the notion of a fifty something man rocking out scare you.  Paul is cooler than all of us.  Never forget that.
B000002UUX|5.0|\\"Rust In Peace\\" has to be the best metal album ever made. Let me tell you why: Every song is very unique riffs and killer guitar solos. Each song doesn't follow the boring verse-chorus verse-chorus format. The solos are the best there is, period. Hanger 18 and Tornado Of Souls are metal classics that are my favorites. Mustaines voice kinda (...) in this album, but the music more than make up for it. Also, this is the best lineup's first album and the peak of the band's creativity. From this point on, Megadeth tried to be more pop-rockish, and even though they were way better than Metallica in the 90's, if they released more albums like Rust In Peace, they would have been more respected in the metal community.<BR>DEFINTELY A MUST BUY FOR ANY METAL/HARD ROCK FAN!
B00005OWIU|5.0|I have not purchased this, but listened to it all online thanks to RealPlayer. Wow is just about all I can say. It was wonderful! <BR>For all those Harry Potter fans out there, this CD is a must have go getter!
B00004Z459|1.0|Well, i had this CD for a week, then i gave it to someone, so, its obvious i didnt really enjoy it. I'm not big into metal though, so maybe that explains it. In my opinion, the music is just a &quot;hybrid&quot; of all the other flash in the pan bands that preceded linkin park. I didnt like it, I don't like Linkin Park. I don't like metal. Enjoy.

B00005Q66T|5.0|Ciao! fellow amazon reviewers and shoppers.<br />Madonna has done it again with this thrilling and different collection of hits. I am very happy to learn that Beautiful stranger made it to the track list!<br />Out of all the songs, I personally think that Madonna's MUSIC, THE POWER OF GOODBYE, BEAUTIFUL STRANGER AND BEDTIME STORY ARE my favorites.<br />If you don't know the track list, it is as goes:<br />1) Deeper and deeper 7&quot; edit  2) Erotica radio edit  3) Human nature clean radio version  4) Secret  5) Don't cry for me Argentina original non dance version  6) Bedtime Story  7 The power of goodbye  8) Beautiful stranger  9) Frozen  10) Take a bow  11) Ray of light  12) Don't tell me  13) What it feels like for a girl non dance mix version  14) Drowned world/Substitute for  15) Music<br />The photos inside the booklet are amazing and they show her in all imaginable poses and styles. Actually, the whole concept of the artwork is Madonna's different looks from the start up to the present. Even the graphics on the cd itself are cool and offer a bold and new look to the incredible Queen of Pop's journey of success.<br />There is a song for everyone. If you like serene and serious stuff, &quot;Don't cry...&quot; is for you. If you like moving, unearthing trancelike music, Bedtime story is for you. I liked the idea of Madonna continuing right from where she left off with the &quot;Immaculate Collection.<br />Unfortunately there are no remixes on this compilation. It would have been fun to find the remixes from her new singles here. Oh weeeeellllll. It's okay because whatever the Queen of Pop does suits me fine.<br />Upon reading the writeup inside the booklet, I first thought it cool that Madonna wrote something for her fans, but instead, it was written by Dan Cadan. The writeup was interesting because I learned a little more about Madonna than I knew already.<br />I think you will appreciate her a whole lot more after reading it.<br />The cd cover is an unusual for Madonna. Usually we see her whole face or her whole body. Here, she is close up and dramatically made up, and I find her expression both seductive and shy.<br />This woman knows what music is and knows how to make it. 5 big  huge gold stars for this collection.<br />Sing on Madonna, and hope you will come up with another collection some time in the future.<br />Enjoy the cd and hope my review helped you.for Madonna.

B00000JR29|4.0|From the band's silly name, to their dependence on synthesizers, Tears for Fears is a fine example of the 80's pop sound. The band, led by Roland Orzabel's powerful voice, made some memorable recordings and this CD has most of their best material. This CD captures their sound well, and it is their most commercially and critically successful. Unless you are an incredible fan, you can get this one for your CD collection and skip the greatest hits packages.(This review refers to the original recording w/o the filler.)
B00003CXN4|4.0|O.k., now I guess you´ve already know what &quot;Traffic&quot; is all about, right ? But if you still haven´t see the movie yet, let me give you some helpful reasons why you should do so: first of all &quot;Traffic&quot; happens to be THE most convincing and enthralling narcotics thriller since the glorious days when Popeye Doyle broke the french connection. <br />&quot;Traffic&quot; is wonderfully acted, stunningly edited and photographed (Soderbergh operated the camera himself, using the pseudonym &quot;Peter Andrews&quot; !) and very uncommon for traditional hollywood film standarts. Benicio del Toro gives an outstanding performance as narcotics detective Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, speaking only spanish throughout the entire film (alright, there is one brief scene where he speaks english with a heavy accent !), but Soderbergh also gets great performances from Michael Douglas, Luis Guzman (meanwhile a Soderbergh regular) and Catherine Zeta-Jones. <br />The soundtrack, composed by Soderbergh´s longtime companion and former &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; drummer Cliff Martinez, is very unnasuming and underlines perfectly the several situations of the film.<br />The transfer of this disc is very well done. Due to the fact that &quot;Traffic&quot; was shot in very grain images and colours (each of the three stories has another &quot;look&quot;), very similar to the &quot;Dogma&quot; films, it is a little difficult to tell, if there were any flaws of picture quality, but to me it looks pretty good. <br />The extras on this DVD include an electronic press kit (or &quot;B-Roll&quot; if want to call it that), that seems very much of a letdown (because it looks to me like one of those Made-for-cable documentaries minus narration), but if you like to watch only the director directing (and the actors acting, haw, haw), you might get your kicks out of it. Me, I would have prefered at least one informative audio commentary track, like the one Soderbergh did for his previous DVD releases &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot;, &quot;Out of Sight&quot; and &quot;The Limey&quot;, which really offered not only intereseting insights, but was also highly entertaining. But, hey, you can´t have it all, can you ? Extras also include several deleted scenes and filmographies of cast and crew.<br />O.k., so if you like to watch a good crime thriller for a change, then &quot;Traffic&quot; may serve you well, but be warned: if you are out to catch an action/adventure film, your popcorn might get stuck in your throath. I can assure you that &quot;Traffic&quot; contains almost no &quot;action&quot; whatsoever (there is only one brief chase at the beginning). &quot;Traffic&quot; tells three stories, has no main character the audience can rely on, and is more or less entirely based on characters and their motivations. A return to the great &quot;ensemble&quot; pictures of the seventies, if you like.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie a novel about an old man, a young man, and life's greatest <br />lesson.  You see yourself in the story thinking that you are immortal so it doesn't matter<br />how you live your life.  In the story, &quot;Morrie walks the final bridge between life and <br />death and narrates the trip.&quot;  He tells what should be important in life and what isn't.<br /> Morrie Schwartz, a sociology professor at Brandeis University who becomes <br />terminally ill, teaches Mitch Albom the values of life.  Mitch had Morrie for a teacher<br />on Tuesdays for classes all through college.  When he learns of Morrie's illness he <br />visits Morrie every Tuesday at his home in his study which was now the classroom to  <br />teach Mitch life's greatest lessons.  Each Tuesday they discussed a different <br />topic of life such as aging, family, money, emotion, and death.  Morrie teaches Mitch about<br />love, family, and &quot;being prepared to die any time, you can be more involved in your life <br />while your living.&quot;   <br /> This book really opens your eyes on your own life and how you live.  We cannot<br />take our lives for granted.  A person can become ill and die at anytime.  Morrie teaches<br />you to be happy in life and what things in life are more important.  He teaches us that we<br />are all always in a hurry and do not concentrate on the things in life that are more import-<br />ant we all worry about getting somewhere and having more than worrying about our<br />family, and friends.  We must not feel sorry for ourselves, someone is always worse off<br />than we are.  I really enjoyed this book it made me think more about which direction <br />my life is heading.<br /> The only side of the book that bothered me was the thought of death throughout the<br />book.   I don't of course like to think about my own death even though we all have to die <br />someday.  This novel constantly reminds us that we will die someday.<br /> I can't be too criticalof the book because Morrie does throughout the novel, teach<br />his student Mitch not only about life and learning how to live, but also how to die.  He makes <br /> readers analyze their lives so that they can live a happy and fulfilling life.
6304913176|4.0|I hated this movie the first couple of times I watched it, but the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. It's got evrything that makes a good sci fi action flick. Giant bugs, big starships, big guns, legions of troops, etc. The plot seems really weak at first, but after a few viewings, the plot seems more sound. All in all this is a pretty goofy film, but it is a lot of fun to watch. One warning though, this is an excessively violent film with lots of blood and gore
0684833395|4.0|<BR>If you were to take the sit-com M*A*S*H, set it in a WWII squadron of bombers, and make the comedy dark instead of light-hearted you would have Catch-22.<br />In this story, a bombadier, convinced that he will die if he continues to fly bombing missions, tries in vain to get sent home after fulfilling his quota. The story utilizes absurdist circumstances and disfunctional characters to portray war, and the American military machine as a \\"damned if you do, and damned if you don't\\" hell where a sane person just doesn't fit in.<br />Some of the passages were laugh-out-loud funny, but overall it was a bit dark and absurd for my tastes.<BR>
B00005N9CV|2.0|This was my second Diana Krall disk.  I received the first one as a gift and I loved it.  As soon as &quot;The Look of Love&quot; came out I purchased it.  I like her voice and singing but I was dissapointed in this disk.  There are too many very slow numbers on it.  There needs to be more of a mix.  As much as I like her singing, I found this boring.  I'd have a hard time recommending it based on that.
B00005R2M3|2.0|This release is a disappointment compared to the spanish language albums.  The production tried too hard to sound like a lot of the fabricated teen artists of today.  And even though Shakira wrote a lot of the material it is easy to hear that someone held her hand on LAUNDRY SERVICE.  It just sounds bland and could be mixed in with a lot of homogenized pop artists.<br />But this is her first English album.  Maybe if the sales are high for this one she'll be able to put in her own signiture for the next one.  But when you're on TRL you have to mesh in with that sound some  how.  Let's hope that Shakira doesn't get lost in the soon-to-be teen pop rejects or too late in being a part of the latin craze.
B00000ILE7|5.0|All the bad reviews are most likely from people that are ticked off that Newt and Hicks were killed in this film, so ignore them. This is propably the best written of the Alien movies. It doesn't try to follow the 1st two exactly, but it's extrememly well written, very dark and dramatic, very intense, has a fantastic cast, and the score is really powerful. The best thing about this film is Weaver's acting, this is the only Alien film where her acting really impressed me. The alien in this one is also the coolest. Spawned from a dog, it's much more aggresive and agile than the others. This film is a must have
B00004S35Z|5.0|While the phrase, &quot;greatest album&quot; is a useless distinction for the great Stevie Wonder, the material contained herein finds him at a pinnacle of his more introspective songwriting mode. Released between the chart-topping splendor of INNERVISIONS and the monumental SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE, FULFULLINGNESS' FIRST FINALE has spare instrumentation and a particularly personal tone.From gospel-inflected affirmations to the funky classic, &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman,&quot; this music is spirited.<br />Stevie sings out on a seamless array of love declarations (&quot;Creepin&quot;) and social protestations (&quot;You Haven't Done Nothin&quot;). The melodies are simple and evocative, spiced with jazzy harmonies. Between his gentle clavinet work and his inspired synth romps, the man's got a great keyboard palette, and he surely knows how to use it. Throughout, Stevie provides excellent interplay between foreground andbackground, rounding out his vocal and keyboard flights with haunting overdubs. Perhaps most outstanding is the moving reverie, &quot;Heaven Is,&quot; a hand-clapping groove on the divine. Let's face it -- few soulsters can be quite as mesmerizing as Stevie with a line like, &quot;Love is so a-ma-zing.&quot;
B00004Y7SF|1.0|What on earth is this collection!?!  Aguilera's &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; fails horribly with a voice and arrangements that are neither pleasant to listen to nor successful in their attempts to instill the spirit of the season.  It's a complete rip-off.  You'd be better off listening to a cat in heat.
0385505833|1.0|This book is mean-spirited and hostile right up to the very predictible ending where all the characters who have constantly treated one another meanly throughout come together in an unconvincing show of Christmas spirit. It's unconvincing because &quot;Christmas Spirit&quot; is what is sorely lacking from this story. And humor? I found very little to even smile about.<br />The lead characters, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Krank, decide to NOT do all the Christmas hoopla one year and take the money they will save and splurge it on themselves instead. Does this seem like a radical idea in this day and age to you? It didn't to me either, especially considering how commercial the holiday has become and knowing this is the first year they will be without their daughter. It made perfect sense to me. And yet not one of their acquaintainces or their circle of so-called &quot;friends&quot; offers one ounce of support for their decision. A few offer envy, that's about as close as the author comes to endorsing the Krank's view that Christmas has gotten out of control and they'd rather just<br />take a break one year from all the chaos surrounding it.<br />Are the Krank's bad people because they decide one year to spend the thousands of dollars they would normally spend on Christmas on themselves? Their neighbors and friends seem to think so and spend almost the entire book not letting them forget it.<br />This book also completely lacks any relationship between the characters and the true meaning of Christmas. It's all about parties and gifts and conspicuous and expensive wastes of money in the name of the holiday. There's no kindness or empathy or understanding among the folk who inhabit this world. And nothing of Christ at all. I also found the notion that everyone the Krank's knew or met would be so appalled by their idea. In this day and age, with the commercialization of the holiday, I think many people would sympathize with one's desire to not ride the Christmas roller-coaster once in a while.<br />But worst of all, I don't know what the author was trying to say about people or the holiday. The people act meanly toward one another throughout the book. Is that in the spirit of Christmas?And the holiday seems to be all about decorations and parties and not pleasing yourself at all, but trying endlessly to please everyone else. That doesn't seem like a recipe for holiday cheer to me. Sure, it all comes out in the end, but I found it hard to forget the hostility up to that point. By the end, I didn't care whether any of them had a nice Christmas or not.<br />If you feel you must read this book, I suggest the library. That's where I got my copy and I am very glad I did.

6305399212|5.0|Aliens is my favorite of the Alien movies. This movie has everything that Alien fan love: Hundreds of Xenomorphs (the aliens), The Colonial Marines (the coolest military group ever), and the Queen alien. This was an awsome film when it first came out, but the Special Edition makes it 200 times better. The added scenes add so much to the plot. It explains who brought the aliens to the colony (i'm not saying who though). The fight scene between Ripley and the Queen is the coolest fight scene ever. If you haven't seen the Special Edition yet, you should order this now. It'll make you want to throw your old copy in the trash
B000002UYZ|5.0|And it's beyond comprehension how anybody can give this less then 5 stars.It gets 10 easy, and 38 million copies sold since release just about says it all!
630438551X|5.0|I am blown away by this movie. It is gorgeous and tragic and ultimatly beautiful. Claire and Leo are great as the movie two leads. This movie is so good, i went back and read the text, and i had and all new understanding of it, and i loved it even more. Dont listen to all the old people who think its too colorful, or fast.<br />SEE THIS MOVIE PLEASE.

B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira nos tiene acostrumbrados a letras sugerentes, pegajosas y con veradera inspiración. En este nuevo trabajo Shakira se luce desde una perspectiva general del album.<br />Las canciones de este disco se amoldan a la fórmula de Shakira del disco anterior, que vendio millones de copias. Esto me hace pensar que hubo cierta búsqueda de comercialidad en el proceso del disco. Esto le quita un poco de su personalidad artística, aunque no la esencia del proceso de composición de la obra como expresión de algo.<br />En el disco destacan tracks como: &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; por su letra sugestiva, aunque me recuerda a &quot;Octavo día&quot; por su tipo de composición, sus pulsaciones de ritmo al final del track; sobresale &quot;Tango (Objection)&quot; por su excelente mezcla de sonidos rock con instrumentos aparentemente contrastantes como la guitarra y el acordeón, aunque me recuerda a &quot;Ciega Sordomuda&quot;, ambas usan un estilo -tango y mariachi- como formula; &quot;Rules&quot; es una excelente canción que expresa el compromiso de una relación con verdadero amor, tiene un exquisito sabor a rock de los 80`s; &quot;The One&quot; por su tinte setentoso y gran sentido de personalidad individual del amor es distinguida; y &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot; tiene un original sabor innovador en su melodia inroductoria pero, me parece típica en ella la armónica que tambien suena en &quot;¿Dónde estan los ladrones?&quot;. A lo mejor esto es parte de la personalidad de Shakira, pero pareciera entonces que no evoluciona completamente por esas formulas que se mantienen. Esa repetición de elementos plàsticos en su composición causa cierta desilución.<br />Esta producción de la &quot;Mujer llena de gracia&quot; le garantiza un lugar dentro del mercado anglosajón que no la conoce. Tiene una gran expresidad artística pero, esto se ve opacado en la tipicidad de la fórmula en algunas canciones. El disco es muy bueno pero esto le hace perder parte de la esencia creadora de una obra artística. En general admiro a Shakira por que sobre los patrones del mercado, su obra si tiene personalidad, a pesar de todo.
B00005OWIU|4.0|There were familiar sounds from several of the past Williams soundtracks. Nothing I could put my fingure on, but short passages of Indiana Jones, E.T. and Star Wars. Are the similarities there because the composer is the same or is it because there is hardly anything new left to be written?
B000001E7T|5.0|This album is almost the total opposite of &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;.  It is a very haunting and sometimes disturbing album.  This album seems to be the pinnacle of her career.  Although stories from the city is fabulous, this one will go down as her classic.  It is definately her darkest to date.  Just listen to the first track.  The song builds to an awesome climax.  My favorite track, one a little less haunting, is the song &quot;C'mon Billy&quot;.  Its got a great hook and melody, and was the only song besides stuff from her new album that she played at a recent concert i saw her in.  The single off of the album, &quot;Down by the Water&quot;, just about summarizes the whole album.  It is a masterpiece, and explores the dark and disturbing world of PJ Harvey.  If you like her old stuff, definatley buy this.  If you are a new fan and are deciding which album to buy, buy her recent one first.  Then go in backwards chronological order, to the breathtaking &quot;Is This Desire&quot;, to this album, and then to either &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;rid of me&quot;.  Either way your gonna have to get this album. Dont pass it up.

0441172717|2.0|I am an avid SF Fan who has long been about to read &quot;Dune&quot;, and this summer I finally started. I really had high expectations, especially after reading all the raving reviews in this forum.<br />Sadly, I found this book hard to get into, slow-paced and a little too confused to really catch my interest. I made it through just because I felt I had to, and was actually relieved when it finally ended and I could start reading the next book that I had in line waiting for me. Not recommended!
0671027344|5.0|This book is excellent and a must read.  A VERY moving and engaging story about a mentally boarderline teenage boy named Charlie who writes letters to the reader during the course of a year or so about his life.  I don't want to say too much about the story line itself so as not to spoil it, but what I can reveal is that Charlie discovers that he has a unique talent.  He also makes a much more disturbing discovery.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This musics speaks to the heart of three current generations. My generation which listened to our grandparents talking of the hard times of the thirties. My parents' generation who were children during those same years, whose personalities were worn sharp by the grindstone of the depression. Lastly ,it cuts deeply into the memories of the few remaining grandparents who knew some good times before the fall, but who suffered those memories during the hard times. Some of these songs will make you cry.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Awsome album, the greatest musician in the world!! Very Very enjoyable from track 1 to track 16, thats right 16, buy it and find out! Love it, doesn't get much better than this!
B000002L42|1.0|...well, aside from those who AREN'T fans, anyway.  However, I'm surprised by the number of reviews that praise this album.  This release is just as dull as the Two Against Nature DVD.  Donald doesn't try very hard to sing here, with a lot of his phrasing lacking any punch whatsoever.  Sometimes he rushes the words, and other times he drags them out.  In either case, it's simply annoying here.  The backup singers are also incredibly Muzak-like, adding nothing to the proceedings.  Instead of energizing the tracks, they instead sap what little life is there, making things like &quot;Reelin' In The Years&quot; and &quot;Bodhisattva&quot; absolute torture to sit through.  I never thought &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; or &quot;Sign In Stranger&quot; - of all things -  could ever lose their cool, but in this setting, Becker and Fagen absolutely kill them.  Even the favorite &quot;Peg&quot; has lost its timeless sparkle.  Sure, there are first rate musicians playing on the tracks here (just like on any other SD album), but for once, the smoothness takes over, leaving the Dan little room to shine.  Alive In America is as lifeless as the mummy pictured on its front cover.
B00005NVT1|4.0|Forty-five minutes of live Daft Punk action recorded in Birmingham, England, in November, 1997.  This isn't exactly a &quot;live&quot; CD - there isn't any &quot;Hello Cleveland&quot; or extended drum solos (alas, no spinning drum kit) - more a &quot;live mix&quot; CD.<br />Having seen them live on the same tour (Cambridge, UK), i was blown away by what i heard/saw, but part of me was also wondering, &quot;Is it real/Memorex/sequencer?&quot;<br />Then IT hit me - who cares!?!  THIS IS GREAT!<br />Okay sound quality (little to no crowd noise) and the disc i got (from the UK) came with free stickers!  Such a deal, and it cost less than the ticket to get into the gig...<br />Why only 4 *'s?  It could have been longer, it could have been a DVD (the extra bit of the &quot;D.A.F.T.&quot; DVD wasn't enough!), and c'mon folks, it's not like it's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; or &quot;Revolver&quot; (or even the wonderful &quot;Homework&quot;)
B000002H70|5.0|As was iterated by Kyle in South Park, this is the best album ever, of the cure or anyone else.  Yeah, I used to do my hair like Robert Smith.  Yeah many of their other albums are great and can be argued as to how good they are.  However, none come close to the brilliance that is disintigration.  It is a depressing CD, but somehow the world seems to be a better place afetr I listen to it.  Other classics of the Cure just leave me in a disturbed mood (Faith for instance) the rest of the day.  Again the other albums are great, but are just the warm up to best act of the Cure.
0060976624|5.0|It's hard enough to write something that a lot of people would find funny, but think about this:  How often have you read something that just made you laugh out loud in a tears-are-falling-down-my-face kind of way, time and again?  Buckley does that here.  When I read the book five years ago, I was staying with a bunch of relatives at a summer house on vacation, and I was up reading and laughing until about 3 a.m.  At breakfast the next morning, everyone was mad at me for waking them up.  It was only after I told them about the book and gave them a copy to read did they understand, and forgive.  Outside of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces,&quot; &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot; really is the funniest, most laugh-out-loud book I've ever read.
B000002AZ8|2.0|It has been said that Vitalogy was the first recorded salvo in Pearl Jam's (purely mythical) mission of alienation, which many argue reaches it's conclusion with No Code. But consider if you will how far out and alienating it is to provide a young audience recently robbed of Cobain with... an album of dark, angry, riff based, mostly loud ninties rock songs. One can't help but feel that Pearl Jam could have done little more to buy into the zeitgeist, and the rough edges will surely have been nothing but a delight to those who mistrusted the smoother sound of the first two Pearl Jam records. And clearly this would not matter at all if the albums contents were worth while. But in fact this is by far Pearl Jam's laziest effort, and this lack of application manifests itself not in honest, direct communication but in half written, boringly delivered songs. Not For You could be a good song, were it not for its one riff being bludgeoned to death by repetition and its being expected to carry the song way further than a three chord motif can bare. There are some good things to be heard here: Corduroy is a Pearl Jam classic and a good song as well, suggesting that were more time and creative energies lavished upon this record, it could have been good. In actual fact it turns out that (apart from Corduroy) the best bits of Vitalogy  are the 'throw away' Bugs and Pry To, simply because they represent glimpses of interest amid what is otherwise a dull excercise in the banal, made all the worse by the fact that Pearl Jam had showed so much of merit on the first two records and now seemed determined to flush it down the toilet of grunge with the most half hearted of... [at this point the reviewer left the PC for so long that his flatmates posted the review for him anyway]
B00005QK3W|5.0|Finally!  A great new album by McCartney.  I say &quot;finally&quot; not because it's been awhile, but because this is a gem.  A friend of mine said last week he would hesitate buying this album because he felt he had been burned before by Paul's legendary light fare.  I'm here to tell you that this is one fine album.  He's added a nice rough touch to most songs and in the eleventh hour added a bonus cut ... &quot;Freedom&quot; from the NYC Concert for the victims of September 11.  The cover art is fun, as taken by McCartney with his Casio wrist camera as seen on Larry King's interview.  (Yep, that's Larry on the back.)  As I listened to the album, I waited for the light weight, trite love song clunker, knowing it would eventually show up.  Happily, it was nowhere to be found!  Fans and non-fans should enjoy this one.  He certainly hasn't lost it!
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is a really good album I think.Right now i am really experimenting with different sounds of music,and I think Radiohead is a really good alternative band.I like what they do with their music,and i think it is good that they use more than just guitars.I would give this a 5 star rating,but i am still listening to get and getting in to the sound of it.I'm sure in another week or so,i will totally be in love with this album.Anyone who wants to go into a mellow,secure sound,I suggest that u get this album.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Ok. I was thrilled that &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; was included, I was shocked that &quot;What Shall We Do Now&quot; was not. Hey, I LOVE Pink Floyd. What I mean is that this should have been a boxed set with a third or fourth disc. There is nothing from Atom Heart Mother, Or Obscured By Clouds. That is too bad, really. So, Dave says that he doesn't like Atom, but I happen to think that it is wonderful, and Obscured as well. AND, I like Rick, but,..&quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot;? Why is this on here? Unless they were going to include ALOT of others? &quot;Summer 68&quot; is a cool Rick tune that would have been a better fit. Then ...well, I love them, But after Roger,......
B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is the best Madonna album I've ever herd. My favorite tracks on the album are: &quot;Drowned World / Substitute For Love,&quot; &quot;Nothing Really Matters,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;Candy Perfume Girl,&quot; &quot;The Power Of Goodbye,&quot; and &quot;Sky Fits Heaven,&quot; although I do like the whole album. Every single song has a diffrent message and diffrent tune, unlike Britney Spears not one song sounds the same or is the same type of music. There's not one type of music on this album. It's a mixture Alternative, Rock, New Age, with a little of Heavy Metal. This is by far the best Madonna album, and it proves itself by selling over 15 million copies worldwide.
B000003BF1|5.0|if your starting your stones collection or in fact starting to collect any rock and roll this must be the first and the first track &quot;gimmie shelter&quot; is the first place to start. i've listened to the stones for more than thirty years and must have bought this ablum at least a dozen times in my life and i keep coming back. wow
B00005Q66T|4.0|This album is good, but I thought it could have used some new tracks. I mean, I want some new material, this collection doesn't do Madonna justice. I'm not saying this album is bad, it's actually pretty good, but why would you buy an album that has all of the songs you already have, I think Madonna should have put atleast one new track on the album. I don't care much for remixes, but she had some left over tracks from &quot;Music&quot; why couldn't she just put one of those on the album? But definetly buy this album!

B00005R2M3|5.0|I have been waiting for her English Album for about 2 years (I have her Spanish album as well), ever since I found out she was going to release on.  The wait was well worth it because this album is fantastic. I had here &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; before the album was released and loved it. I also love &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, it's a beautiful song! She has also re-released &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; from her last album in English &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; and is great either way. This was totally worth every cent!!!
B00003CY0V|5.0|An action movie about Terrorim, hacking, John Travolta &amp; Halle Berry. ONE AWSOME movie with really good directing. Just dont watch the Trailer first when you get the DVD. This is one action movie that has some really cool scenes and ideas, and you dont want to ruin any of them by watching the trailer first :)
0385505833|2.0|I hate to be critical of such a well-meaning book, but it really is below mediocre.  I've never read any Grisham, so I have no idea how it stacks up against his usual, but it stacks up pretty poorly indeed against every other piece of fiction I've read in the last 2 years.<br />First, the premise is barely plausible.  Seizing on a financial motivation for &quot;skipping&quot; Christmas, the protagonist proceeds to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Is his motivation thrift or mean-spiritedness?  Grisham makes no effort to indicate that the protagonist is mean-spirited, but without that, the plot development rings false, and the (I don't think I've giving anything away here) late conversion doesn't seem all that interesting.<br />Second, the characters are all one- or two-dimensional.  These are-- at best-- paper cutouts of people.<br />Third, and I'd have to say the crucial failing for me, was the utter flatness of the dialogue.  This is the Tom Clancy school of dialogue.  There wasn't a single laugh for me in the book, although Grisham was clearly trying to make it whimsical.  The dialogue was almost exclusively exposition, yielding little insight into the characters.<br />Two stars, one for being about Christmas and one for being readable (and probably writeable) in a single sitting.  It's clearly not trying to be much, and it succeeds at that.
0375703764|3.0|Danielewski wrote a long book, but I think I can provide some help with a short review.  The most striking thing about the book, perhaps besides fun visual arrangement in some chapters, is the copious amount of footnotes.  So here is my suggestion:<BR>1.  Skim the introduction, and skip it if it bores you.<BR>2.  Skip all the normal footnotes with dates and names.<BR>3.  Skim read all the personal footnotes of Johny Truant- marked by the shift in typeset.  Many times you can skip whole paragraphs and still get the jest of what is being said.<BR>4.  Read the body of the Navidson record, carefully at times- but if you feel like you're getting bogged down, skimming large sections here won't hurt either.<br />I think this is fair because the footnotes, in my opinion, are meant to impress by their sheer volume, not their content.  I spent twenty bucks on this book and at first I thought I had wasted my money, not making any progress for two months.  But when I read it following the criteria above, I was able to finish the book in a week and I really began to enjoy it.  By the way, the book should really be rated 3.5 stars, plus I'm not into horror or sci-fi, so for a fan of this genre, the rating might go even higher.<BR>P.S. No one gets as much anonymous sex as J.T. and his friend Lude, but it was still fun to read.
6303965415|5.0|&quot;Persuasion&quot; is fantastic -- you won't find a finer Austen adaptation, or a truer film, or a more romantic love story.  The characterization is uniformly superb -- Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are absolutely perfect as the leads, and the supporting cast is equally excellent, with Sophie Thompson turning in a great performance as Mary Elliot.  Of especial note, though, is the actress who played her mother-in-law, Mrs. Musgrove -- she was an absolute *delight*, and I wish I knew her name.  She captured the role beautifully.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful.
B00005QK3W|5.0|After listening to the album four times, my initial impression is that it sounds like a distant cousin to the RAM album. There                             is that kind of casual, let's-do-it-and-not-think-too-much-about-it quality about it, which in general recalls Paul's early 70's                                albums. True to this spirit, some of the songs are slight (Your Way, Driving Rain) but still very catchy. Songwriting has always come easy to Paul, you see, and occasionally he just doesn't feel the need to come up with a middle eight or a &quot;bridge&quot; to properly finish off a song. <BR>     The production is, in my opinion, a vast improvement over the last album. The vibe is warm and organic, the natural                          sounding drums are much more suitable to Paul's music than Jeff Lynne's monster snare hits on Flaming Pie. If you own                             any other McCartney albums then you know what to expect lyrics-wise. The guy never did compete with Shakespeare, you                              know, and with an exception of couple of poignant moments, the words are merely pleasant and passable. <BR>      But it doesn't matter, because that familiar Paul McCartney vibe, that melodic spark which we all love so much, is still there. And curiously, there are several deeply melancholic moments here that carry genuine emotion: From A Lover To A Friend,                                She's Give Up Talking in particular both have a strange, haunting quality to them. Lonely Road starts out calmly and builds effectively into a desperate growler. Heather is a beautiful, euphoric piece which captures the rush of falling in love with someone. My version of the album comes with a bonus track -- a live recording of &quot;Freedom&quot; from the New York City benefit. It's quite rousing, and Paul's vocal sounds much stronger than I remember it from watching the show on TV. <BR>     In the end, if you don't like McCartney, this album won't convert you. But for the diehards, this is an embarrassement of                                riches. Is this on par with his classic stuff? Have no idea. If it was released in 1972, I have a feeling the album would probably top the charts, and it would spawn two top ten singles. Today, radio won't touch it and most people will not even know it's out. But, hey, it's just great to hear from the man every once in a while. Favorite songs: Lonely Road, Heather, From A Lover To A Friend, She's Giving Up Talking, Driving Rain, Your Way, I Do.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Yea ok so I just bought this and immediately popped it into my car player-and guess what? I started dancin like crazy! This cd is definitely a must-have for any true fan, especially if you've seen them live(like me!)-it'll bring back some great memories (and probably a little drool.) Radiohead puts a whole new spin on things live-real drum beats, tamborines, changing their songs into entirely different pieces. Plus may I just say that Spinning Plates and Idioteque are beautiful on this album. Ok, wait no the whole thing is beautiful. If you haven't checked out the best band in the world, this cd is great to get you started!
B00005A46T|1.0|It really depresses me when a band makes an excellent debut record and follows it up with (...). Slipknot is a perfect example. They come out swinging with a perfect, creative, and very original debut that is balls-out heavy, yet it some excellent work and pretty experiementive at the same time (\\"Scissors\\"). But I am very dissapointed.<br />First of all, these are some very (...) lyrics. I can't believe this is the same Corey. If you think songs like \\" \\"Heretic Anthem\\" took a lot of the thought process, then you must think that Drowning Pool writes good songs.<br />Even the music is all of the same. I expected a band as original as Slipknot just to switch it up a TINY bit. But nooo, they couldn't change at all. They had to please their \\"hardcore maggots\\" by making as heavy as a record as possible, yet nothing else.<br />Overall, a very dissapointing follow up. Skip this.
0385505833|4.0|A very funny and pleasurable book to enjoy before the holidays.<br />So completely unlike Mr. Grisham's previous works. I am an avid fan of Mr. Grisham.
0060001941|5.0|I think I finally understand my younger sister who is in her forties today.  She read this book when she was the age of eight or nine and living in New York City.  I recall her talking about how wonderful the book was and how much she enjoyed Francie and aunt Sizzy.  Like Francie (including myself), she grew up in similar circumstances except there were six siblings and mother.  Dad was too irresponsible to fit any of the characters, except perhaps the disgruntled Willie Flittman, who runs off with his new found vocation; a single man orchestra (substitute women).  Anyhow, she grew into Sizzy more than Francie although there was a lot of Francie in her as a young girl.  I certainly went off in search of the American dream.  My sister did not, although Francie still lives in her particularly in her search for beauty, love, and insatiable love for books.  She too wanted to read all of the books in the local library.  <br />The book speaks mounds of truth about poverty and the struggle faced by urban poor.  Ms. B. Smith treats the subject and the characters with great tenderness and honesty.  Although the pathos and ethos of the urban poor may not have been of great interest or even palatable to readers at the time of the book's publication, the great human paradigm and its redeeming values is timeless and relevant.  Reading A Grows in Brooklyn and having lived in Brooklyn Heights as well as experienced a similar childhhod is especially welcoming.  To reflect on those difficult childhood times is important as it helps keep me grounded.  I would not deny or exchange that experience for anything in the world.  <br />The book is a must read for all lovers of literature regarless of age, gender, or socioeconomic circumstances.

0140143505|5.0|This little collection of numerous letters back and forth across an ocean at a time when 'globalization' was just beginning to find its definition shows at the very best how words alone, when chosen carefully, can give birth to a relationship that will soon be treasured. If e-mail messages have begun to grate, here is a book that will remind you how sweet letterwriting can be and how wonderful a thing it can accomplish...if one only takes the time. 84, Charing Cross, I've concluded, is also the perfect gift for friends with sensitive souls who already seem to have everything. It is also a fine thing to read before turning off the light next to your bed.
044651652X|3.0|Frankly, I can't blame anyone for either.<br />I picked it up off the 80% off shelf at my local [bookstore].  I had heard of it -- and it had an astoundingly long run on the NY Times bestseller list -- and figured that for [the money], I may as well read it.<br />Well, I read it, and I liked it.  I can see why people *don't* like it -- its commercial properties are extremely blatant, its calls for suspensions of disbelief are incredible, and it has too much prologue and not enough actual action.  (Okay, we know every detail of what happens until they sleep together -- some seventy pages' worth of detail -- and then the rest is wrapped up, another thirty years' worth, in less than forty pages?  Hello?)<br />I did like it because it's a very sweet book that has an interesting moral quandary in it -- what is our duty to others?  Ourselves?  Who takes priority?  Are decisions about our lives supposed to be practical or full of passion?  Which decision would we regret more?<br />Yet it doesn't hang up on those things -- it just tells a story.  I like stories, therefore I liked the book.  Anyone looking for anything that takes more than an hour to read and has you thinking about it for more than two hours would be disappointed, though.
0064471837|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers of this book, I too feel as though I've read nearly everything worth reading in modern fantasy, and I insist that this is one of the very best. Several years ago, I borrowed it from a friend and devoured it. Since then I haven't run into it in any bookstores, which has surprised me. The characters are very well drawn, the world is atmospheric, and the logic of the universe is extremely tight and interesting. Furthermore, the prose is good! I recommend this book extremely highly to anyone. It is so good that it does not deserve to be regarded only as genre fiction.
6305013578|3.0|Fritz Lang's Metropolis is quite a dynamic film with an important statement about worker's condition compared to the lifestyles of the rich and famous. These conditions are still experienced today, all over the world, and Lang's message should always be kept in mind.<br />The story itself is very creative, with some terrific special effects, especially considering the fact that cinematography was still in its infancy. There is some light magic that is most impressive for this early sci-fi flick.<br />However the quality, or lack thereof, of this DVD should be a terrible embarassment to the producers. Yes, it is a film we all want to see, but the company has really cranked out a load of garbage on this one.  Fortunately it was very cheap to buy.

B000001FTD|5.0|Before this album, Anthrax were just a bunch of speed metal jokesters from NYC who had a thing for comic books.  But with the slow rise of Metallica (who were more influenced by NWOBHM than punk), Anthrax's dominance in heavy metal would soon come.  AMONG THE LIVING is the band's third album which showed how tight they had become with the inclusion of Joey Belladonna (who replaced the first singer from the FISTFUL OF METAL album).  The power riffs of Scott Ian are sick, and who could forget the power of Charlie Benante's drumming?  This man should've had eight legs.<br />While they still got into comic books (&quot;I Am The Law&quot; is about Judge Dredd), they also dealt with the original occupants of the United States (&quot;Indians&quot;), double-faced people (&quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;), and their love of Stephen King novels (&quot;A Skeleton In The Closet&quot;).  Most bands around this time were about speed and shock value, the only thing shocking about Anthrax was the whiteness of Scott Ian's legs!  But they could play, oh could they play, and didn't sacrifice skills for speed.  Their future efforts would be mixed affairs, but this albums easily stands as one of the best of all time.
B000001FN3|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION is one of the best horror-themed rock albums ever produced.  Every track is based on a work by that master of the morbid, Edgar Allan Poe, and the band--actually only two musician-songwriters, Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, backed up by some outstanding session musicians--does a fantastic job of weaving Poe's eerie narrative and lurid atmosphere into a macabre musical tapestry.<br />Some of Poe's best works are interpreted here, not the least of which are &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher.&quot;  The more widely-known piece on the album is probably &quot;The Raven,&quot; having been granted a lot of radio play when it debuted in the 1970s,  and &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; stylistically stands as the album's most traditional rock-and-roll song.  But from an aesthetic standpoint, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is undoubtedly the best track.  The entire song lasts for more than 16 minutes, contains no lyrics (other than a newly added voiceover at the beginning), and is divided into different movements in much the same way as a classical symphony.  Like the Poe story that inspired it, it runs the gamut of human emotion, starting off with a serene yet melancholy classical passage, then seamlessly moving through jazzy new-age and rock segues towards an intense symphonic crescendo.  When listening to the song from start to finish, it is impossible to NOT feel that sense of inexorable deterioration and downfall that is inherent to the Poe work, and it is altogether quite artistically satisfying.<br />TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION was originally released in 1976 and was, to the dismay of some fans, re-released a few years later with different jacket illustrations.  Though the remixed and remastered CD version reviewed here uses the original jacket art for the cover and liner illustrations, there are other aspects of the disc that will nonetheless upset fans who are &quot;purists.&quot;  For example, musical passages such as guitar riffs or background synths have been blatantly superimposed onto some of the tracks, and many of the tracks are now tied together with narrative voice-overs recorded by the late Orson Welles (yes, THAT Orson Welles).  However, one must bear in mind that these alterations have been executed by none other than Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson themselves, and they claim to have done everything possible to ensure that the music contains the same spirit that endeared it to fans when it was originally released in 1976.<br />Still, musically speaking, the album has undergone a noticeable facelift.  Of course, if this CD represents your first exposure to the music, the changes probably won't matter to you in the least.  But if you're someone who has loved the album since its original debut, you'll just have to give this version a listen and decide for yourself if the changes either deface or enhance.  To most fans, though, the album will most certainly remain a classic.<br />This CD is highly recommended to fans of horror, those who love the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and anybody who fondly remembers the concept rock of the 1970s.ll nonetheless upset fans who are &quot;purists.&quot;  For example, musical passages such as guitar riffs or background synths have been blatantly superimposed onto some of the tracks, and many of the tracks are now tied together with narrative voice-overs recorded by the late Orson Welles (yes, THAT Orson Welles).

B00005O5CM|4.0|Where do I start?  The film starts off when Elle Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon, prepares for her date with the love of her life, Warner, believing that it will finally be the night he pops the big question.  When he unexpectedly decides to break up, simply because he's going to Harvard, and he doesn't think Elle is very smart, Elle decides to go to law school too to win Warner back.  But the tables turn when Elle finds out he already has a fiancee.<br />Shortly: This film begins with a clueless type attitude and doesn't totally meet the hype the film has, but the humor eventually grows to be hilarious, and Reese Witherspoon turns out to be a total delight.  While the film has a &quot;goofy&quot; everyday teen plot, this film is possibly one of the most charming comedies around.  This film is definetely worth a gander.

B00005QXXO|5.0|\\"Live is where we live!\\" where the words of U2's Larry Mullen Jnr. after they had won an Mtv award for best live act in 1997.<BR>I think this quote fits very well with Radiohead, and especially with their songs!<BR>As most of us know by now, Radiohead have been exploring new musical territories on their last two albums \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\".<BR>One very good thing about these explorations was the somehow naive and honest way in which they where performed.<BR>Radiohead is not about making commercial sell out records. Radiohead is not about being \\"intentionally difficult\\" or \\"avantgarde\\" or whatever. Radiohead is about music. And that's all! The important thing is music itself and not all these labels which we put on music. <BR>They never pretended to be experts in the field of electronic music. They never pretended to be experts in jazz. Yet they <BR>went on a journey into these musical genres and used elements from them as a catapult, an inspiration, for something new and unique.<br />\\"Kid A\\" was probably the darker, moodier record with disturbing soundscapes and icy techno/electronica. Examples: \\"Everything in it's right place\\", \\"Kid A\\", \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"Idioteque\\".<BR>\\"Amnesiac\\" was the brighter twin, though it had some dark moments as well. This record included several jazz explorations. That does not mean boring (...)standard jazz, but as I mentioned before elements of the genre used as a catapult for something entirely unique. Some songs that showcase this: \\"Pyramid Song\\", \\"You and whose army?\\", \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\".<br />And now...the live album. \\"I might be wrong - live recordings\\" contains eight tracks, and this is where the songs \\"come to life\\". <BR>\\"The National Anthem\\" is a noisy explosion of fuzz bazz and psychotic sounds allowing the song to rock on into another dimension without the \\"honks\\" of the horns found on the studio version. The rock continues on \\"I might be wrong\\" which is dirty distorted guitar rock in its live form.<BR>\\"Morning Bell\\" proves my suspicion one again. Phil Selway is an AWESOME drummer! This is concentrated groove at its best! A great track, slightly remminiscent of the album version, yet here the guitars have more space and therefore they sound more \\"freaky\\"....kind of.<BR>\\"Idioteque\\" is intense and rocking with real drums alongside Jonny Greenwoods syncopated synth beats.<BR>\\"Dollars and Cents\\" and \\"Everything in its right place\\" are also great and quite different from the album versions. \\"Dollars and Cents\\" is stripped of the fat strings and the heavy echo/reverb of the studio version and this leaves more space for the guitar, which simply sounds great!<BR>\\"Everything...\\" is very interesting in that Greenwood samples Thom Yorke's voice live, using a Korg sampler. This creates an amazing effect of several layers of vocals being cut up and put together. This shows how you can use technology to create an awesome dynamic live effect.<BR>I have seen Radiohead perform this song live, and towards the end they stop playing and leave everything to the sampler and the effect boxes. Humans give in, technology takes over. Yet this is using technology in a positive, inventive way.<BR>Two surprises are on the disc as well. The first is \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" which is a beautiful piano/keyboard driven tune here, unike the studio version with its backward vocals and weird sounds. <BR>The 2nd surprise is \\"True Love Waits\\", an incredible song which finally has found its way to an actual release. This is just Thom on vocals and acoustic guitar. Just one more proof that they can still write and perform beautiful songs and maybe and indication of what the future has to offer?<BR>Anyways, I'll be looking forward to it!<br />We're getting to the end now, just one more final note before I leave you:<BR>the day when I bought \\"Live recordings\\". This was monday 12th 2001 and I went into a Virgin Megastore in London to see if they had gotten the album. While I was there I noticed a big screen which showed a stage in basement section. The basement was full of young screaming girls. I got the cd and went to see what all the fuzz was about. Suddenly the screaming got a whole lot louder and Westlife (!) appeared on stage. They started singing and I stood there for a while thinking \\"so this is Westlife?\\" (I had to ask someone who they were when they appeared on stage).<BR>Anyway, they (weren't good) and you couldn't really hear anything because of the screaming girls so I left...<BR>On my way home I noticed a newspaper headline at a newstand, which read \\"Jet crashes in New York\\". My first thought was \\"what? not again!?\\".<BR>This is a strange world we live in. Plastic and commercialism. War and terrorism.<BR>Apparently everything isn't in its right place. But we are allowed to dream!<BR>thank you.
B00005OWIU|5.0|As an adult &quot;HP&quot; fan, I was scared twice; once when I heard that Chris Columbus was directing the movie and two, when I found out that John Williams was writing and conducting the soundtrack.<br />What impressed me the most is that this soundtrack holds its own as a purely classical piece.<br />Yes, &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; is the common thread that you will hear throughout the entire soundtrack, but even the lighter pieces (such as &quot;Diagon Ally&quot;, &quot;Mr. Longbottom Flies&quot; and &quot;Christmas At Hogwarts&quot;) quickly turn musically dark, I guess, with the tone of the movie.<br />I *adore* the use of the celestine against the deep, bass sounds of an orchestra for contrast. <br />Oh, and &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot; is perfect. <br />I've read many reviews about the movie, and some of the reviews are stating that the soundtrack is &quot;heavy handed&quot;, &quot;typical John Williams&quot;, and all of that.<br />Nonsense. Disney's &quot;Fantasia&quot;'s soundtrack used classical music to perfection, and they believed that was a colossal failure, as well.<br />As a stand-alone CD, I adore this. As an adult HP fan who's taking her 12 year old niece to the movie (and who's going to don her Halloween costume!)premiere, I'm curious to see how it fits in. I think it's going to do just fine.
B00005Q45W|4.0|I'm loath to give this album less than five stars, but I want to express dissatisfaction with the music.<br />Lyrically, Cohen has not skipped a beat.  The theme of the tension between the sacred (my secret life) and the profane(Babylon, Boogie Street) that runs through all of Cohen's work is here present in spades.  In this respect, Ten New Songs might be his most &quot;intimate&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; album yet.  And the words are wonderful, laden with Cohen's familiar alchemy of levitical gravitas (&quot;In streams of light I clearly saw the dust you seldom see, out of which the Nameless makes a Name for one like me&quot;) and puckish mischief (&quot;I fought against the bottle, but I had to do it drunk&quot;).  Five stars for the words.<br />But the music...Leonard, what were you thinking?<br />I've read in various interviews that the synth music on this album was originally intended to be replaced with &quot;real&quot; instrumental music, and that Cohen fell in love with the synth and insisted on keeping it.  That was a bad decision.  The album sounds like a really good demo for ten really great songs.<br />Why, oh why, mister Cohen, did you not let Bob Metzger go to work on these great new songs?  It's not too late -- get back in the studio with some musicians and put real accompaniment behind these delicious words.  I, for one, will buy the album again.

B0000042H4|5.0|I was one of those listeners who objected to this Ring Cycle for many years. I regarded Solti's conducting as loud and unsubtle, and the engineering as gimicky to the point of detracting from the music. I also objected to the use of some singers clearly at the end of their prime, Hotter and Windgassen. Now, after hearing the remastered set, I have done a complete about-face. It may be that the remastered sound is cleaner and leaner than that on the original LP's and tape editions, but I no longer find this sound overblown or unsubtle. True, Solti is explosive at times, but appropriately so; his Walkuere actually reminds me of Furtwaengler's at many points. And like Furtaengler and Knappertsbusch, Solti gives us a very dark and subdued Act 1 of Walkuere that only brightens at the very end, as it should. He captures all the mystery of the work, as well as its excitement, much more clearly on this new remastering. I no longer find Hotter to be a disappointment; on the contrary, despite some moments of strain and unsteadiness, I find this the most moving portrayal of the role of Wotan I have ever heard, even more so than Hotter's other recordings of the role. And Windgassen now sounds more vital and vibrant than before, almost as much as he did in the 1956 Knappertsbusch Ring from Bayreuth. As for the other singers, they are all admirable, some ideal. I still wish that Hotter had done Wotan throughout this cycle, but I admit that George London comes mighty close to this standard in Rheingold. Of course, the actual recorded sound is NOT a reproduction of the Bayreuth sound, with the recessed orchestra supporting the singer, but rather with the singers very much blended in the orchestral texture. It seems now more clear that Decca was not trying to create the feeling of a live performance in the theater, but rather bring the drama into the listener's living space. Perhaps this very immediacy is what alienated me from this recording for so long. I would never want to be without a Bayreuth Ring, but this one is also indespensible in its own unique way.<br />Having heard the boxed set from Germany, I think it is even superior to the remastered USA sets of the individual operas. The blary and brassy sound originally on the LP issues has vanished altogether in favor of an airy transparency. I now can hear great subtlety as well as muscle in Solti's conducting; as I said, he sounds more like Furtwaengler or Knappertsbusch than the brash conductor I thought I had earlier heard. His Immolation Scene at the end of Goetterdaemmerung brought me to tears; Solti moves the heart as well as the senses. Windgassen is surely the most sensitive and vulnerable Siegfried along with Max Lorenz (I am NOT a Melchior lover), Nilsson is at her most intense and noble, easily the equal of Astrid Varnay, Hotter, despite being past his prime, is the most heartbreaking Wotan I have ever heard, Ludwig the most outraged and imperious Fricka (Flagstad in Rheingold is not quite her equal, being a bit too placid), Frick is the most powerfully evil Hagen and Hunding, King and Crespin the loviest Waelsung twins, and Fischer-Dieskau finally rescues Gunther to his full tragic height. And Neidlinger remains the ne plus ultra Alberich.<br />Some critics and listeners have regarded Solti's &quot;Walkuere&quot; as the weakest part of his &quot;Ring.&quot; Frankly, I have never understood the reason for this; even when I was not fond of the overall Solti cycle, I always treasured this &quot;Walkuere.&quot; Like Furtwaengler and Knappertsbusch, Solti gives us a somber, subdued First Act, with broad tempi, that only opens up and comes to life at the end. This is perfectly consistent with the dramatic situation. But it is the Second Act in which Solti really hits the mark. Like Furtwaengler, he sees the Second Act, and particularly Wotan's long monologue, as the pivotal event of the Ring, where Wotan finally sees the futility of his plans and abandons himself to his ruinious fate, destroying Siegmund and Sieglinde along with him (and later on, Siegfried as well). Having heard Solti and Furtwaengler do this Act, I find it impossible to regard it as an impediment to the drama. Solti is grave and somber here, again with braod tempi that allow the music its time and space. And with Hotter at his interpretive greatest, this Act cannot fail to impress with its greatness. (Incidentally, I rememeber an early review of this set stating that &quot;No other Wotan in history has mastered the role as profoundly as Hotter.&quot; Certainly, no other Wotan in my experience, including Hotter in his other recorded performances, expresses the anguish and finally the explosive anger as in this performance.)In the Prelude to this Act, Solti begins it in the same vein as the First Act ended, with febrile passion, but as the music changes to the hammering Walkuere motiv, he not only broadens the tempo, but changes the orchestral coloring to something much more massive, monumental. We are leaving the realm of mortals to enter the cosmic world of the Gods, as the human drama is revealed as a part of the larger divine one; Solti understands this broadening of the dramatic scope at this point and underlines it perfectly.<br />It should be obvious by now that this is a &quot;Ring&quot; for the ages, and belongs in every serious collection of classical music.estroying Siegmund and Sieglinde along with him (and later on, Siegfried as well).

0875845851|5.0|This is a book is about successful, well-led companies -often market leaders- that carefully pay attention to what customers need and that invest heavily in new technologies, but still loose their market leadership suddenly. This can happen when disruptive technologies enter the stage. Most technologies improve the performance of existing products in relation to the criteria which existing customers have always used. These technologies are called sustaining technologies. Disruptive technologies do something different. They create an entirely new value proposition. They improve the performance of the product in relation to new performance criteria. Products which are based on disruptive technologies are often smaller, cheaper, simpler, and easier to use. However, the moment they are introduced, they can not at once compete against the traditional products and so they cannot directly reach a big market. Christensen researched how disruptive technologies have developed in the computer disk industry, an extremely rapid evolving industry. He identified six steps in the emergence of disruptive technologies:<br />1. Disruptive technologies often are invented in traditional large companies. Example: at Seagate Technology, the biggest producer of 5,25 disks, engineers in 1985 designed the first 3,5 disk.<br />2. The marketing department examines first reactions from important customers to the new technology. Then they notice that existing customers are not very interested and they conclude that not a lot of money can be made with the new product. Example: this is what happened at Seagate. The 3,5 disk's were put upon the shelf.<br />3. The company keeps on investing in the traditional technology. Performance improvement of the traditional technology is highly appreciated by existing customers and a lot of money is being made. Example: Seagate invested in the 5,25 disk technology. This led to considerable improvement of the technology and to a considerable improvement of sales.<br />4. New companies are started up (by ex-employees of the traditional companies) and markets for the new technology emerge by trial and error. Example: ex-Seagate people started up Corner Peripherals. This company focused on the small emerging market for 3,5 inch disks. In the beginning this was only for the laptop market.<br />5. The new players move up in the market. The performance of the new technologies gets better after some time, enabling them to compete better and better with the traditional companies and products. Example: the performance of the 3,5 disks improved drastically. The 3,5 inch disk moved up in the market, to the personal computer market. Corner pushed Seagate out of the PC market for 3,5 inch disk drives.<br />6. Traditional companies try to defend their market position and to get along in the new market. Often they notice that they have fallen behind so far, that they cannot keep up. Example: Seagate did not succeed in capturing a significant part of the new market for 3,5 inch disk drives for PC's.<br />The events described above can be understood by the four principles of disruptive technologies which Christensen formulates:<br />1. In well-led companies it is customers, not managers, who actually determine resources allocation. This is a proposition of the resources dependence theory (Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978) which is supported strongly by the research of Christensen. In essence: middle managers will not tend to invest in technologies that are not directly appreciated by important (large) clients, because they will not be able to get quick financial gains by doing this.<br />2. Small markets can not fulfil the growth need of large companies. For several reasons, growth is important for companies. Unfortunately, the bigger the company, the harder it is to continue growth. A small company (40 million sales) with a growth target of 20%, must achieve 8 million extra sales. A large company (4 billion sales), has to achieve 800 millionof extra sales! Emerging markets often simply are not large enough to fulfil such growth needs. They can, however, fulfil the growth needs of new small companies.<br />3. Markets that do not exist can not be analysed. The ultimate applications of disruptive technologies can not be foreseen on forehand. Failure is an intrinsic unavoidable step to success.<br />4. Technology supply does not always equal the market demand. The speed of technological progress is often bigger than the speed with which the customer demand develops. By improving the performance of the disruptive technologies (for instance the 3,5 inch disks, first only used in the laptop market), they became suitable for the larger PC-market.<br />These steps explain why traditional companies are often not capable of applying disruptive technologies. Christensen argues that you can not resist these four principles. What you can do however, is use them to your advantage. For instance: in a large company you can create an 'island' where the new technology is developed for the new market. Also it is possible get an ownership in emerging companies which develop the new technologies (several companies have done this successfully).<br />I think the innovator's Dilemma is an excellent book. The ideas are empirically foudend and together they form a coherent theoretical framework. The examples from the computer disk industry, the steel industry and others, are very well-documented and interesting. The book is logically structured and reads easily.0 million of extra sales!

B00003CXXJ|5.0|&quot;Shrek&quot; is a completely entertaining film. There are so many references to the Disney-ification of all things, not to mention the Great Mouse's hijacking of all Germanic fairy tales, that its a wonder Eisner &amp; Co. didn't sue. All the vocal talents are spot on. And the bonuses on the DVD are also worthwhile- I particularly liked the interviews with the cast members. I personally look forward to Fiona and Snow White remaking &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;.<br />This is NOT a kid's movie, despite it being animated. It is, in the Jay Ward tradition, a fractured fairy tale. And, along with &quot;Memento&quot;, the best thing I've seen so far in '01.
B00005QK3W|5.0|All I can say is &quot;WOW!&quot;  I really don't know how to start, other than to say that once again, Paul McCartney is showing the world that he can still rock out!  I've waited to hear this CD, and finally I have it in my grasps and I can't stop listening to it!  The first song, &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; is a great opener to an album, and the production is great!  &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; shares the sentiment, I think, that all of us go through when you've lost a relationship and then find someone you'd like to get to know a little better.  &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; has a nice sound to it - I love the voice effects!  Only a Beatle could do a song like &quot;Driving Rain&quot; and pull it off and make it sound wonderful.  Again, it just has that new sound to it.  &quot;Back In The Sunshine&quot; is one of my favorites, as is &quot;I Do,&quot; which I think might rank up there as Paul's next &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed.&quot;  In fact, I really can't say which songs are better than the others.  With Paul it seems that a tragic event (like the death of John Lennon or his wife Linda) always helps his songwriting, and this time is no exception.  And then with his new girlfriend Heather, Paul has even more of a muse to write about.  In fact, maybe &quot;Magic&quot; is my favorite song on the disc because it's about Paul and Linda.  <br />Paul has a very modern sound on the disc, for lack of a better term.  The band members are, I believe, in their early to mid-twenties, so maybe that is part of the reason the sound is so different to what we've heard from Paul before.  The production, I think, is slick.  I hope that many people my age will discover this album.  This isn't a Britney sounding music, it's Paul.  And as John Lennon once said, &quot;It's Paul McCartney music, and it's good music.&quot;<br />Also, I would like to add one little thought.  The song &quot;Freedom,&quot; which was written after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentegon is included though on these first pressings it isn't mentioned on the track list, just on a sticker on the front of the case.  While it's not a &quot;Yesterday&quot; or &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; the song does have a strong cause behind it that helps it out a lot.  It's a nice &quot;bonus&quot; track, though it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the album.  Overall, this is well worth picking up and buying!  You can't go wrong!
B00005QG9J|4.0|For anyone out there who writes an online review for this band and gives it 1 star just doesn't know what they're talking about. I have all of there albums the EP's, SCIENCE, Make Yourself and the new one. On science, the music that was out at the time, incubus sounded like the rest of them, just a little bit more funky. The rest of the metal that came out than incubus, limp bizkit, korn allll sounded alike they coulda been replaced by anyone else; lots of rocking... and the singers rappin every now and then... <br />if you think they sold out than you dont know what music is. they've just gotten better, smarter, and more unique. instead of just writing riff after riff, scream after scream, they decided to sing, write melodies and write songs. maybe the rest of the &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands will learn a thing or too, and start writing good songs, and not just riffs that they know will sell albums......  that to me is selling out. korn's last 3 albums are more sellling out than incubus will ever be.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Laundry Services is the album meant to break this wildly talented Columbian singer into English-language stardom.  I think that it does so admirably; however, potential buyers should be aware that it is most defintely the product of a savy, mainstream music industry marketing machine.  As such, it's songs are uniformly over-produced (a charge that is true of the vast majority of MTV-driven pop).  The rhythm tracks are inexorably uniform and tight, and every vocal nuance of Shakira's powerful instrument has been analyzed, homogenized, codified, harmonized and sanitized for your protection.<br />What separates Shakira from the pack , however, is that she is the real deal.  Yes, her vocal stylings have been influenced by Alanis Morisette.  Yes, her current hair and wardrobe make her appear to be yet another Britney, and Christina, and Mandy wannabe.  Yes, she has overt popstar ambitions, and has been accused of plagarism in the past.  <br />But she *can* write.  <br />And she *can* sing.<br />Lyrically, Shikira is finding a her voice in a new language on this album.  It's easy to dismiss her English as simplistic; however, I assure you it's not easy to speak simply in poetry or song.  Her subject matter on this album tends toward the usual pop fare of sex, love and jealousy.  Shakira's lyrics are servicable on this album, but it remains impressive that she even assayed the challenge to write this album largely in English (four tracks remain in Spanish, two of which are the same tunes as earlier tracks on the CD).  As a bonus, we get an earlier Spanish hit (Ojos Asi) by Shakira in English with lyrics by Gloria Estefan.<br />Musicallly, Shakira writes tunes which incorporate a wide spectrum of influences including pop, rock, latin and middle eastern music.  With the help of the musical industrial complex behind her, this album includes tango-accordians, surf-rock twangs and the ever-popular South American pan-pipe.  For me, the album kind of sags in the middle after thethird track &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; until the aforementioned &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; kicks in on track ten.  Nevertheless, there are at least three new, memorable and remarkable singles on this album.<br />Vocally, Shakira continues to shine.  She has amazing control, vocal flexibility (yes, there is more to that ability than the yodeling she's accused of) and can affect a wide range of timbre.  She has a great dynamic range, and an okay frequency range.<br />All in all, I have enjoyed this album alot after buying it today.  Shakira has tremendous talent, and one hopes that it will not be destroyed by the fame that she and the marketing machine behind her are pursuing.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Fairy tale movies for kids have been done so many times over, but none have ever been as unique and funny as shrek. A grumpy ogre unwilling to give up his swamp to intruding fairy tale creatures, Shrek must journey out to the castle of lord farquad, and do whatever it takes to regain his home. A great movie for everyone, very funny and a clever story! One that everyone should see!
0553573411|5.0|This is more good stuff from Robin Hobb.  We continue the story of Fitz, the royal bastard training in the art of assassination.  His position in this book goes from bad to worse, and then to even worse (no, he hasn't seen worst yet)!<br />In this volume we have a delightful new character, Queen Kettricken, as well as the always interesting Lady Patience.  Queen Kettricken brings with her from her mountain kingdom the idea of Queen as Servant, which she attempts to live out in her new home.  The people here don't understand her, which causes life to be difficult for her.  Her dearest friend in her trials is Fitz.<br />Fitz has other problems to worry about, too.  The Forged Ones are spreading across the land, and Prince Verity's war with the Outislanders is growing more desperate.  People are losing confidence in him, and begin to speak favorably about Prince Regal, who wants Fitz dead.<br />The Royal Assassin, whose place was meant to be a shadowy one, serving the king in secret, has been exposed, and new dangers threaten him.  Fitz will have to make difficult decisions about what is right and what is best, and he learns that those two things aren't always the same.<br />Fitz's character continues to grow and mature over the course of this book, yet he is still very capable of making impulsive decisions and acting rashly.  The harrowing ending of this book will keep you on the edge of your seat and reading late into the night!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is not the type of book that I would usually pick up and read. Then my teacher made me read it for English class and I fell in love with it. It kept my attention throught the whole thing. The ending was kind of weak but the rest makes up for it. I would definitely recommend this book.
0090006801|5.0|I read this book in high school over twenty years ago and it made quite an impression.  I've never forgotten it and reading some of the other reviews it's obvious many others share the same sentiment.  Burgett's writing style gives you the feeling that you're actually there, witnessing the accounts of Normandy with an unbelievable attention to detail.  Thankfully, we had people such as Burgett not only willing to fight the fight but to also give us a glimpse into what it was like to be there.  This book is a must read for everyone, provided you can find it.
079284131X|4.0|CHILD'S PLAY was one of the first 'killer doll' movies, and still remains the best. Serial killer Charles Lee Ray (also known as &quot;Chucky) is shot to death by a policeman in a toy store, but before he dies Charles manages to transfer his soul into a toy doll by reciting a voodoo incantation. A little boy named Andy Barclay receives the &quot;Chucky&quot; doll from his mother as a gift for his birthday, and soon the doll is running around murdering people and Andy is being blamed for the crimes. Andy is in much deeper trouble because &quot;Chucky&quot; wants to transfer his soul into Andy's body before &quot;Chucky&quot;'s soul becomes trapped inside the doll.

B000001F3C|3.0|I was so looking forward to hearing this cd but after \\" New Years Day\\", it really was a slight letdown. A few of the last songs are allright but this cd just doesn't move me the way I thought it would! I did get lucky and order through a CD club so I really don't have much invested in it. I only ordered it because of some of the reviews it got on Amazon. I guess it pays not to listen to others. I guess if someone were trying to collect all of U-2's cd's it would be allright but that would be the only way I would spend more than $(...) on this! Maybe I'll change my opinion after a few more listens but I doubt it!
B00005Q66T|3.0|I don't know what compelled me to want to buy GHV2 considering that I already have 13 out of the 14 tracks on the cd. I think it was more for the packaging than the music. The countless pix of Madonna in the cd booklet is excellent. It amazes me how much she has evolved as an artist. Musically, I found this compilation to be shoddy and thrown together at the last minute.<br />All of the songs here are radio edits which that in itself spoke volumes that Warner Brothers wants your money badly. Nothing worse than hearing songs like &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; edited. That's just wrong. Secondly, the original film version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; was used, not the dance remix which received more airplay than the original version. Finally I'm missing &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;. Sure they received minor airplay but they were great songs that should have been added on to the cd. If Madonna was involved in the project, this cd would have been just as great as &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; but she wasn't and this compilation is mediocre at best. Definitely not one of the better greatest hits compilations I have ever come across.
0446677450|3.0|Although Kiyosaki had some very key points on how to manage your money, he came off as repeatitive when trying to unnecessarily reiterate some of his focuses.  This book could have been written in 40 pages, but instead Kiyosaki decided to stretch it out for the sake of quantity rather than for a condensed interesting content. After reading the six lessons, the reader could put down the book and have gained almost as much information as someone who kept on reading. This would have been a much better read if Kiyosaki had stopped while he was ahead instead of adding more chapters.
0792156684|5.0|Titanic is a wonderful movie. In a time of cynicism it is heart-warming that it's life reaffirming message was so eagerly accepted by the world's movie audiences. Millions of people connected with this movie, making it, deservedly, the biggest movie in history.<br />The movie has its loud and obnoxious detractors, but they are mainly tasteless, insecure teenage  boys with a silly jealousy thing going on over Leonardo DiCaprio's popularity  with women. Ignore those idiots and enjoy this grand spectacle in the style of classic Hollywood epics.<br />This film is brilliant in EVERY way. Acting, music, technically, just in every way. It richly deserved its 11 oscars.<br />Historians have emphasized over and over the fact that the Titanic sinking has never been told as accurately as here. The fictional love story does not detract from the tragedy, but serves to bring in modern-day audiences with a story they can relate to and helps them appreciate the scope of the tragedy as never before.<br />Anyone who is not moved by this film (other than some silly teenage boys) could be a sociopath and I would be afraid to sleep in the same house with them.<br />Seriously, buy this DVD, forget the hype and just sit back and enjoy brilliant film making at its best. Forget your cynicism and get caught up in a very touching story set against the backdrop of one of the most enduring tragedies of all time. The sinking is especially well filmed, with awesome special effects and presented so realistically that you will feel like you are on the ship.<br />Long after the films obnoxious little detractors have grown old and silent this film will stand as a testament to great and enduring film making.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Driving Rain is Paul McCartney's first album of new material since 1997's Flaming Pie.  In between he released an album of covers Run Devil Run that was recorded shortly after the loss of his wife and soul mate, Linda.  That album was the most emotional of his career.  While Driving Rain isn't quite as emotional, it still has a certain weight to it.  There are some of his classic, light and breezy tunes &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; and the laconic &quot;Spinning On An Axis&quot;.  Much like &quot;Lovely Linda&quot; from his first solo album, &quot;Heather&quot; is an ode to the new love of his life Heather Mills.  The album's best tracks are laced with an emotional weight.  &quot;Lonely Road&quot; has a frenzied edge, &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; has is filled with anxiety and &quot;There Must Have Been Magic&quot; is filled with longing rememberances of the past.  &quot;Your Way&quot; has a country flavor and &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; is a ten plus minute workout that shows off some nice cohesion from the spry four piece band Mr. McCartney assembled for the album.  Throughout the record, Mr. McCartney plays some of the best bass lines he's played in years and he reminds us that he is, in fact, a true legend.
B000002I25|5.0|It sure is a pleasure to reminisce, back to a day when we really thought that &quot;all you need is love&quot; and everything would be all right. Yes, the time between my 14th and 15th birthdays, when Sergeant Pepper was redefining what was musically possible and everyone else was reacting to it. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; indeed!<br />For Jim Morrison and the Doors, it was an unbelievably creative time, as evidenced by the songs on this, their first album. To say there is not a bad track here only begins to communicate the importance of the record. Some at the time called them America's Dionysian counterparts to the Rolling Stones, and that's a good place to start. Let's just say the Doors showed what could happen when &quot;California Dreams&quot; turned into nightmares, as &quot;The End&quot; so aptly describes.<br />The gem here remains &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, every bit as incandescent as when I first heard it all those 34 years ago during the &quot;Summer of Love.&quot; Of course, we're talking about what we then called the &quot;FM Version&quot; with its soaring keyboard and guitar break in the middle. The album snaps, crackles and pops with the bluesy &quot;Break on Through&quot;, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, &quot;Take It as It Comes&quot;, and such fine rock standards as &quot;Alabama Song&quot;, &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; and &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;. Another favorite of mine is the softer &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;, and of course, &quot;The End&quot;, which later gained new fame from its appearance in the film &quot;Apocolypse Now&quot; (a particularly poignant use of the song I might add).<br />Another reviewer called this one of the four or five best rock albums of the 1960's. (I'm inclined to agree with that, but completing that list is a difficult chore indeed!) Simply put, Morrison's later death in 1971 would rob the music world of perhaps many other great works to come. For the Doors, only L.A. Woman rivaled this one creatively.
B00005QXXO|4.0|On Radiohead's previous two albums, Kid A &amp; Amnesiac, the band created sonic landscapes that featured multi-layered sounds.  They threw everything snap, crackle and pop they find into creating the sound collage.  The eight songs on I Might Be Wrong don't try to recreate their album's counterparts' sound. The band just plays the music with the instruments they've got and it shows they are just as powerful live as in the studio.  Lead singer Thom Yorke's beatbox vocal opening to &quot;The National Anthem&quot; is powerful and adds a tension to the song before he even utters a verse.  In some instances, the band leaves Mr. Yorke out on a ledge with little support.  He carries &quot;Idioteque&quot; with just sparse drum work and the album's closer, &quot;True Love Waits&quot; provides only an acoustic guitar.  Mr. Yorke's vocals are the foundation of the band's sound and the live album shows off his wonderful gifts.
0688170528|4.0|As a mother, this book of fiction has touched a nerve.  To deal with the death of a child would be excruciating; but to deal with the death of your child by suicide would be dreadful, unbearable.  As parents, we often don't see the pain our children our in, we excuse their behavior as being rebellious or moody, or &quot;It's just a phase....&quot;.  I guess that explains Melanie's unwillingness to accept that her daughter could be suicidal.  But we do love to hate her in this book anyway....<br />I love how Ms. Picoult has mixed love with mystery and drama.  Even the engaging courtroom scenes are remarkable.  This is the first of her novels that I have read, but it won't be the last.
B00005Q66T|5.0|GHV2 is the second greatest hits collection from the material mom.  Unlike her first greatest hits album, The Immaculate Collection, GHV2 doesn't contain any new material, but the material presented is stronger than the first collection.  Showing her growth as an artist, the music takes center stage.  Where her first hits like &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, Material Girl&quot; and others were about cultivating an image, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; are well crafted and musically inventive songs.  &quot;Deeper &amp; Deeper&quot; is an almost forgotten song, but it is a great, pulsating dance track and &quot;Human Nature&quot; captures her sexual dominatrix aura.  GVH2 is a great sampling of Madonna's music from the 1990's.
B000000WJZ|5.0|and there's plenty good to say about &quot;siamese dream:&quot;<BR>the band was on the verge of some kind of implosion when this was worked on, thus there's plenty tension in the way they play together.  factually, billy did a lot of work on this baby, so in essence it's his album alone.  oh boy, but those pumpkins... my god, they rock on this album.  quietness and rockinness abound.
B00005OWIU|3.0|This score written by John Williams was very nicely done, especially &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot;. The only disappointment is that I expected a composer of Williams caliber (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) to write something a bit stronger and more moving. The &quot;Quidditch&quot; theme for example, was not very exciting. But overall he is excellent in making the listener feel Harry's wonder and mystery of being at Hogwarts.

B000002I2I|5.0|This is an amzing 1970 Lp. Its too bad that there are any musicians like the Doors these days. Morrison Hotel is a stripped down rock that includes plenty of Bo Diddley rhythms it omits their jazz chords or cosmic lyrics its just The Doors at their best. This is a must for any Doors Fan.
0060012331|5.0|Its a Discworld tale aimed at younger readers (ages 9-12) but I dont care. Its a DISCWORLD novel, people! Besides, if kids can enjoy the &quot;regular&quot; Discworld books, why cant an adult enjoy this one? <br />Terry Pratchett (TP) does not patronise his target audience in this novel. The storyline tackles heavy issues but done in such a way that it wont turn off the younger mindset. Such is TP's creativity that he's able to tell a tale for his younger fans without appearing to be a doddering old man preaching to the kiddies. In fact, his fans of all ages will laugh themselves silly at the ever present humour, though the young 'uns will enjoy it more as the references are more recognisable to them.<br />The regular Discworld characters do not make an appearance (Death has a cameo, though) but again that does not affect the story for veteran Disc fans...although events that happened in other Disc books are hinted at, which is nice. Besides, this is an &quot;Amazing Maurice&quot; novel, so let the cat and his rats shine.<br />TP has parodied Shakespeare's plays, Hollywood, politics, murder mysteries and err...Australia in his previous works and this time its the turn of the Brothers Grimm 'Pied Piper' fairy tale. Maurice the cat runs a very profitable scam involving the rodents and a naive kid who can play a pipe but this being a Discworld book, things soon go pear-shaped real quick. There is evil about and it does not like cats. <br />All in all, TP has once again created lovable characters to populate the Discworld and join the ranks of fan favourites like DEATH, the Patrician, Granny Weatherwax, Commander Vimes and the Librarian (oook!). I hope there will be other books featuring Maurice and/or the rats in either the regular Discworld books or this &quot;Young Readers&quot; set. <br />My only criticism is the cover. Why oh why do the Discworld novels published in the US cant have great cover art like its UK counterpart??? This novel suffers the same fate as theregular Disc novels published in the US -- boring covers. Go to amazon.co.uk to see what I mean.
B00003CXN3|3.0|I dunno. But anyway about the film...<br />Ok, I had to watch it twice before I figured out what was going on and even then I figured, what was the point? It's a really long movie anyway. The most irritating thing about it was the way it suddenly ended - I won't tell you how, I'll keep you in suspense. Basically, the movie's about a three way competition between two drug cartels (Juarez and Tijuana) and the US DEA, FBI, ETC ETC blah blah...I got irritated with the general too. I forget his name though. Javier was cool, though.<br />Ok, so what did you learn about the movie from this review? Absolutely nothing. And that's what you'll learn from the movie too...

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is definately the best band today.  The title 'Hybrid Theory' fits well with this band because they blend many types of music, from Joseph Hahn's stunning scratching and mixing, to Brad Delson's ripping chords, to Mike Shinoda's lightinig rapping, to Phoenix's throbbing bass, to Rob Bourdon's slamming beats, to the sheer volume of Chester Bennington's voice.  This band can't be catagorized as one thing or another; they have some of one genre and a bit of another, but one label that this band has earned: A SUCCESS
B00005Q45W|3.0|Somehow, the ambience of this recording is missing part of the magic. That part of the magic is the backdrop or background if you will that gives colorful contrast to Cohen's voice. In this recording that background is shallow and lacking color(s).Cohen's voice would have been better complemented with a live acoustic band and it would have made his latest effort a golden peg in musical history. I cannot imagine the Beatles or Shirley Horne singing along with a synthetic band.<br />Now I have to wait another 8 to 10 years to see if Mr. Cohen will learn from this. I only hope his voice will still be strong then.

B00000B9BD|5.0|This is one of Strawbs' finest moments, with great songwriting, great arrangements and superb perfomances all round. From the spiritual uplift of &quot;Benedictus&quot; to the acoustic simplicity of &quot;Hey Little Man...Thursday's Child&quot; and on to the riches deeper into the album (particularly the powerful &quot;New World&quot;), this music is pure joy. Dave Cousin's haunting vocals drift in and out beautifully. John Ford gives an impressive &quot;Beatle-like&quot; performance on &quot;Heavy Disguise&quot; and there's lots more to enjoy and cherish here. This is a GREAT album!
B0000033OT|5.0|Donny Hathaway is the most under-rated R&amp;B male singer of our time. He is not mention with Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye, which is sad. Stevie and Marvin only became political after Donny did. I am for one mad that radio or other artists are not real about this man's influence on music. I had to search high and low about this man and his life. This album showcase a man of immeasureable talent and at the same time displays his torture soul. If you want REAL soul music with both meaning that teaches you about life, GOD, the human spirit, and the world. This album is for you. A MUST HAVE!!!!
0393312836|5.0|This is a book about a boy named Alex whose interests are rape, ultra-violence, and classical music. He and his droogs are in a gang that goes around and indulges in these things. They enjoy drinking milk laced with drugs to sharpen them up for a bit of ultra-violence. This novel is very brutal but the nadsat seems to be a buffer for the brutality. After Alex breaks into a house and beats and old woman his gang members abandon him and leave him beaten, with a chain, for the millicents (police). He is entered into a criminal rehabilitation program. Now when he thinks of the things he used to love he gets sick. This book is one of the greatest pieces of English liturature ever and was even made into a film by Stanley Kubrick. If you want to know what happens to Alex, read the book. This edition includes the 21st chapter which was originally excluded in the original American release. A highly recommended novella.<br />P.S. The nadsat is really cool. After picking up the book with my rookers and viddying it with my very own glazzies I was impressed with Burgess' masterful use of nadsat. EXCELLENT!

6305181772|4.0|We've seen James Bond, the Man from Uncle but Mission Impossible is the only spy film that shows how to create a real world of espionage and action.<br /> Based on the successful 1960's series, it starts off with the impossible missions force(a group of specially qualified agents) doing a simple job of catching a traitor,who is stealing  secret files of every undercover agents real identity. The team is wiped out except for Tom Cruise who becomes the number one suspect for their deaths. Using all his skills he has to prove his innocence, find the real culprit and keep one step ahead of the authorities.<br />  The set pieces are truely dazzling, the finale on the Channel Train tunnel is absoloutly stunning and the possibly one of THE best action sequences in cinematic history.<br /> The story never slows down for a second and although at first viewing a little confusing its still gripping stuff.<br /> The supporting cast is fantastic from Jon Voight to Vanessa Redgrave it's very hard to criticise a film so well-thought out.<br /> The best action-orientated espionage film since You Only Live Twice. Shame De Palma would'nt stay for the sequel.<br /> The DVD extras are few but who cares when you've got a film this good!!!!!!
078322947X|5.0|Yes the film has obviously been reformatted to fit the television format, as has been stated. It is badly cropped, and makes the film look ugly and ill concieved. I saw Sorcerer at the BFI cinema in London in October 1997, and to see the film in its full aspect ratio is the only way to see it and fully appreciate it. Come on Mr. Friedkin, how about a special edition reissue in its correct aspect ratio, anamorphic of course, and with tons of extras to boot?<BR>At the moment it's a 5 star film, but only a 2 star DVD
B00003CX5P|4.0|I love the STAR WARS series.  I had huge expectations for PHANTOM MENACE and was definitely let down.  Now that it's a few years later and the DVD has finally been released I still don't like the film.  It's not horrible.  The most watchable parts of the film are the final battle and the Senate scenes. For me, PHANTOM is successful in its effects, costume and set design, and political intrigue.  Lucas awed me with the Gungan battles and hooked me with his political intrigue. PHANTOM left me wanting more in the acting, story, and construction of the plot.<br />The bonus/cut scenes are interesting, but not revelatory.  I'd heard about the Greedo scene and thought that it read quite well in script form.  After seeing it on this DVD, though, I still believe that Lucas did a poor job directing his human actors and staging their scenes.<br />The effects in PHANTOM are incredible and the pod race is amazing.  However, if you don't care about the characters then you don't care how fast they are going and if they may crash!  (i.e. the &quot;Luke-and-Leia-on-speeder-bikes&quot; scene in RETURN OF THE JEDI may not have been as technically advanced as the Pod Race -- however, I actually WORRIED that they might get hit by a tree.  I can't say the same for Anakin in his pod.)<br />On a positive note:  The documentary on the 2nd disk is a lot of fun and illustrates how hard it is to bring these films to life.  The DUEL OF THE FATES music video is nice as well.  And the animatics are very interesting to watch.<br />I am a fan of George Lucas and believe that he was trying to push some bounderies on PHANTOM MENACE.  Every artist needs to grow and try new things (in his case: new technology). I also believe that he was still finding his &quot;voice&quot; after being away from directing for so long.  I have some hopes for ATTACK OF THE CLONES -- although not as high as my PHANTOM expectations.<br />I am grateful to Lucasfilm and Mr. Lucas for the DVD.  I think they've done a great joband as a long time fan of STAR WARS am appreciative.
B00005A46T|1.0|Alright, this is completely and utterly garbage.The lyrics are unbelieveably disturbing and these (...)freaks are obviously<BR>no talent (...)artists.No offense to you Slipknot fans because we all have our own opinions and like are own music and thats what makes everyone unique and individual, but all the same i do not recommend this cd. Indstead try System Of A Down or Gorrilaz or something. thanks for reading this. PEACE
B00003CXTG|4.0|I don't care what the critics say, they were way too harsh on Pearl Harbor.  This movie was good!  I think a lot of people had TOO high of expectations, and of course you set yourself up for let down when you do that.  True, this movie wasn't JUST about War, it also tried to appeal to the females also. It incorporated a love story to keep some of the women interested.  That is a hard thing to do. I like war/romances.  <br />I learned a whole lot MORE about Pearl Harbor and the bombing than I even cared to remember in my high school history class years ago.  I think this movie did what it was supposed to do.  It entertained people, and it made people REMEMBER what happend in Hawaii 60 years ago.  Plus, a LOT of the veterans LOVED this movie, and were even crying in the audience.  I think this movie was excellent, and a very entertaining piece of work. With the Sept. 11th events, I have an even greater appreciation of this movie. <br />I can't wait untill it comes on DVD!!  It also includes some REAL historical footage/accounts for those of you history buffs out there.   :-)
B00003CXXJ|3.0|The best part of this film is Princess Fiona, which is not only one of the best animated characters in years, but also flawlessly captures Cameron Diaz' incredible repertoire of cute facial expressions.  Wow.  Worth the price of admission on her own.<br />The worst part is easy: the toilet humor.  The film could easily have been bumped up a star or two without it.  <br />I find it odd that some parents can wring their hands over the word &quot;damn&quot;, but have no compunctions at all about their kids being exposed to the continual (and disgusting) bodily-function/fluid &quot;humor&quot;.  And conversely, I also find it ironic that some folks would use the word &quot;wholesome&quot; in any sentence related to this film; it's nothing remotely of the sort.<br />It's an ok and entertaining film overall, but it would be better if Dreamworks realized there are other laughs you can earn besides cheap ones, and there are other ways to do it besides wallowing in scatology.
0767827902|5.0|This movie is realy good. I happened to stumble upon it on television and i was not disappointed, but this DVD is definitely a must-have.<BR>Notes: The framing of the shots, the composition of the film, and the sound editing/music (mostly Hank Williams) are all elements that I consider outstanding in regards to this film. Ben Johnson is also excellent in his role.<BR>I hate the phrase coming-of-age, because it is a clich, but this film fits into that genre I suppose. The landscape of Anarene, TX possesses a desolate sort of beauty usually found in westerns. The plot trudges along, subordinate to the scenic beauty and composition of the film as well as the brilliant depth of characters, not unlike the film Walkabout by Nicholas Roeg or either of Terrance Malick's first two films (Badlands and Days of Heaven, though to a lesser extent). At the center of the picture is Timothy Bottoms, who plays the character Sonny. The film deals with different aspects of isolation and stagnation in its characters as those elements are inherited from the setting. This is true for all the characters - they all deal with this dilemma in different ways, however. One of the highlights of the film is the relationship between Sonny and Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) as it is very well drawn and kindly executed. Cloris Leachman's performance as the coach's lonely wife is also noteworthy.<BR>This is one movie that succeeds because we believe in it. We believe in it because of the way the barren sparseness of the town Anarene is conveyed to us. It encourages us to feel in the most unmanipulative way. This movie's simplicity is its vitality, and vice versa. It is a film not bogged down by melodrama.<BR>On the weak side: Cybil Sheppard. I think cybil shepard is overrated, but in her defense she is presented with a fairly difficult character here.  get over your fly baby self.  luckily, in this case, age happens
B000002IQ9|5.0|I have several Genesis and Phil Colins CDs. This is one that I continually listen to.  It is perfect in every respect, with background vocals and perfect redentions of his best solo songs.  I wish I was at this concert.  Don't hesistate to get it if you enjoy Phil Colins!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Colombia has so many beautiful things to offer, and the music of singer/songwriter/producer Shakira is certainly no exception! Already an international music sensation, Shakira is poised to make her mark in the U.S. music scene with the debut of this phenomenal collection of English songs. For those of us who also admire her Spanish songs, a few of those are also included. LAUNDRY SERVICE offers a mix of high-energy music representative of various genres, including rock, tango, and Middle Eastern. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; (&quot;Suerte&quot;) and &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; will make anyone get on their feet and attempt to engage in the fine art of belly dancing. Another infectious song is &quot;Objection&quot;, with its romantic tango intro that turns upbeat into a ska-inspired tune. Coupled with amazing music arrangements are solid, unpretentious lyrics that speak to the heart, as well as the mind.<br />Thank you to Shakira for putting her heart and soul into this album. You will not be disappointed. Viva Colombia, viva Shakira!
B000002IST|4.0|Phil Colins fans will enjoy.  I personally prefer &quot;Genesis&quot; over &quot;We Can't Dance.&quot;  This album sounds very much like a Phil Colins studio release.  The music is excellent, but should not be labeled as Genesis.  I still recomend it to anyone who likes Genesis and Phil Colins.
0694003611|5.0|I gave this story a 5 stars rating because as a kid i loved it and i felt like everything,even though it is not real should be said goodnight to. I believe it gives kids a good imagination and I would highly recomend it to any young reader.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the best album ever made. Why? Look first at the circumstances of its recording. The Beatles had all but agreed to end it after the &quot;Get Back-Let it Be&quot; fiasco. Inner turmoil and natural growth had led them to this point in their career. The story goes they phoned George Martin and said 'let's do one more like we used to'. And so they did. <BR> The instrumentation is seamless and breathtaking at points. The songs are timeless. The End suite of songs is not only powerful, but unique in recorded music. They did this in one take - unbelievable. The music on this album will be just as fresh in 2069 as it was in 1969. <BR> I've heard the working title for Abbey Road was Everest, after a favorite brand of cigarettes. Very appropriate, I think. No higher mount has been scaled in popular music to this day. This is where the progress of popular music's growth ended. What a journey, from Johnny and the Moondogs to the top of the world.
0140177396|5.0|Steinbeck \\"Of  Mice and Men\\" demonstrates the power of a true friendship, the value of sticking with what we believe, and taking responsibility into our own hands no matter how much that could hurt.<br />A very interesting style of writing and the choice of the written dialect make it even more fun to read and not let go. A story that contains so many emotions in each chapter, the transition from one situation to another is delivered so smoothly that you will have a hard time putting the book down before reaching the last page.<br />There is a lot to learn from Steinbeck style, story and his idea of a true friendship.
B0000509C3|4.0|Children of the Corn, I shall freely admit, will not win any oscars.<br />But like all Grade-B films, it is not meant to.  It is designed for people who like to sit back, munch on chicken wings, and enjoy themselves.<br />With that in mind, I openly admit liking the movie.  Yes, its missing footage should be added back in, and yes, its &quot;climatic&quot; confrontation scene involves one of the most corniest (get it, corniest?  Corny?  Children of the Corn?  I gotta million of 'em!) speeches imaginable, but who cares.<br />It's fun!!!

B00005QXXO|5.0|Radiohead remains in my mind the best band of our times. They prove with this 40 minute live recording that they can deliver in front of a crowd. Buy this because it's Radiohead. But really buy it because track 4, a newly designed &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs ever. They substitute the slightly annoying, backwards music, with a masterful piano piece. Tracks 1,6,and 8 are also stand outs, 1 and 6 being possibly better than the album versions and 8 being a light but moving &quot;love&quot; song that hasn't appeared on a record. <BR>No. 8, &quot;True Love Waits&quot;, is surprisingly mainstream for Radiohead. It may be foreshadowing another change in their style?<BR>Maybe Radiohead named this recording &quot;I might be wrong&quot; as if they're attempting to set down their more dismal side clearly before they release another album that might be happier.
0451191153|5.0|I've read so many reviews for this book it makes me sick.  Some say its the worst book ever written while others acclaim its genius.  I would agree that Dominique's character could be seen as a little bit demeaning, and Roark is a selfish (selfish is probably not the right word because Roark never wanted money or power, he just wanted to work - his way) jerk.  But I think what Ayn Rand is trying to say is that we need people like Roark to help the human race evolve.  And it's people like Toohey who hold us back not for humanitarian reasons but for power.  <br />This book blew me away and made me take a step back and accept what Ms. Rand's point was, not necessarily agreeing with everything she says but at least accepting it and respecting it.  Also, she talks about Altruism and how (she)Roark thinks that it is holding society back, but that it's okay to give and be equal because we've been bread to do so, but there are going to be people out there who would rather give in another way, by inventions and ideas.  Roark was very clear from the beginning that he works for himself only, and his work is a gift to society.<br />I loved Toohey's rants too.  Hearing the evil badguy preach what we've all been taught since the beginning like: &quot;make man feel small and insignificant&quot;, &quot;make man associate pleasure with guilt&quot; and we all know and believe that.  The only thing I didn't like about him was that everything always went how he planned--he was too smart and manipulative to be human.<br />Love it or hate it - You should read it.  You might learn something about yourself and other people.  Her (Rand)ideas will never be outdated and in that way she'll live forever.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This CD takes several listens but my first thought was &quot;it sounds like this is something from......?&quot; Paul's styles of music are quite varied throughout this CD but after a few listens and in some cases, right away, you begin to associate many of these songs with some of his other mateial from other recordings throughout his career. The good news it's not from Red Rose Speedway or Press to Play!  On much of the CD you could tell me this was an out take from The White Album, Abbey Road or even Band on the Run, and I'd be hard pressed (not to play) to argue. She Doesn't Talk Anymore has that accoustic guitar that is so prevelent in much of the White Album while parts of Rinse The Raindrops seems like a cross between the jam of Helter Skelter and Abbey Road's I want You (she's so heavy) before segueing into a Door's rythem of L.A. Woman accented by the electric piano. As mentioned, the CD seems to borrow from a variety of differnt styles and the song Heather could easily be imagined as a melody that Pete Townshend could of used in Tommy. Basically a 4 minute instrumental with a chorus of backround &quot;ooh's and ahh's&quot; and building cresendos with Keith Moon-like drum fills throughout. Not your traditiaonal ode to love in a ballad like the title would indicate. The song Magic could easily be imagined as something from the Band on the Run sessions.  About You has echos of Oh Darling or a leftover from Run Devil Run. Overall it sounds like Paul has decided to borrow from his past.  Not a bad decission!
B0000041Q3|5.0|Pavorotti, Sutherland and Caballe, how can you go wrong? I admit that Corelli is perhaps more thrilling as Calaf, Price more poignant than Caballe, and Sutherland's low notes barely audible. Lucky that Turandot does not require chest tones. But those are only slight complains. As a whole, this performance is the best in the world, not even the one with Nilsson is as good, and certainly vastly superior to Callas's version. A big plus is the state of the art sound that burst out of my speakers like nothing else.
B00005QXXO|5.0|The brand new cd I Might Be Wrong is the most outstanding musical masterpiece . From the being with National Anthem ,also the fans in Everything  In Its Right Place were they beggin a flood of clapping to fire up Thom . Throughout the record fans screaming Thom ,as finally people are giving respect to the greastest music group in the world. Nevertheless, True Love Waits is very moving ,and Idoiteque is my favorite live song. This cd is a must buy for all RADIOHEAD fans and anyone who is looking to listen to a masterpiece.
B00005Q66T|5.0|GHV2 is the follow up to Madonna's Immaculate Collecton, which gave us a chance to play catch up with her most vital hits, like &quot;Into The Groove&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;. A different Madonna is documented on the second greatest hits collection, which in itself is an accomplishment. Theres definitely growth in her songwriting (&quot;Drowned World (Substitute For Love&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;) and more diverse styles of production. From the infectious blues/r&amp;b of &quot;Secret&quot;, to the otherworldly Bjork/Nelee Hooper produced &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, GHV2 doesnt leave many stones unturned, with the exception of such songs as &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; and the cover of Don Mclean's &quot;American Pie&quot;. There is enough to satisfy though, spanning throughout her career and conjuring many an image: the dark dominatrix dungeon rhythyms of &quot;Erotica&quot;, the beautiful and more tame &quot;Dont Cry For Me Argentina&quot;, the spiritual techno of &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and most recently the down home on the range folk of &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot;. GHV2 is a great best of to have. Having it all in one package is easier and reminds you of how far this ever entertaining woman has come.
0743216458|5.0|I'm normally more of a techno war obessed 13 year old than a sensistive loving guy.  This book achieves a balance of mushy and detials about war.  An incredible account and a gr8 show on HBO!
B0000025GW|5.0|The people that bash this album are totally wrong. They say that Bobs singing in uninspired.  I have never heard a singer so inspired about something. Especially since he really has something worth singing about. Bob will go to heaven for the things he belives while doing slow train and go to the rock and roll hall of fame for HighWay 61 revisited.  Which matters the most?, you tell me.  Bob is pouring his heart out in this music and really means it. The songs on here are beautiful and heartfelt. The only song on here that is filler is &quot;do unto others,&quot; which gets old after about 3 minutes. Sounds like he wrote abunch of things on paper about what not to do un to other people. If you are a christain or believe in Jesus and like Dylan than there is no reason not to have this.  <BR>Bob Dylan I can't wait to see you in heaven someday.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira has been around for some time but known mostly to Latino audiences.  This album is going to make this Columbian artist a SUPERSTAR!  Amazing lyrics: How can she know English this well?  Thanks to her friend, Gloria Estefan!  Add diverse musical fusion (Andean influences) and a rich velvet textured voice, and you have a CD to be played again and again and again to discover the nuances of her global vision and international influences.  You can almost feel the presence of the Beatles, the BeeGees (Good Times), the Go-Gos, Alanis Morisette, and even Spanish flamenco music in many of her new songs.  Shakira, you are destined to achieve great things, your &quot;duende&quot; is genius!  Suerte!  Te queremos mucho, mujer!

I received the product with no hustle and I find no trace of what OUR government would not approve.<BR>Anyhow, I enjoyed the first season very much although personally, I like the second season better while the dialogue and acting are so well matched and much more sophisticated.<BR>Cannot wait to have the third season.

0316776963|5.0|About a year ago, my brother, while visting, accidently left his copy of Naked behind.  I read it, and i got hooked.  I waited forMe Talk Pretty One Dayto come out for so long, and i was not dissapointed.  It is...hilarious.  Other reviewers of this book have spoken their dissapointment because the book is not continuosly sidespliting.  It doesn't need to be.  Sedaris has the remarkable talent for bringing the humourous out of the ordinary.  He writes casualy, as if his readers already know him.  His caustic and biting writing style and pleasing and more often than not, just funny.  He pokes at everyone, his family and himself.  His stories are believable, but only just, which makes them all the more interesting.  He writes like a normal, everyday person, expressing normal everday occurences and thoughts.  His work can be sad and extremley funny at the same time.  He hit the nail right on the head in most of the stories, after reading the book, i realized that i agreed with him on most everything he wrote.  This man is amazingly persuasive and exceptionally funny.  I reccomend this book to anyone looking for a good read!
B00005R2M3|1.0|This album is so predictable, and extremely boring.  Shakira uses the same old formula for every single song.  I think the most interesting one is \\"The one,\\" and I believe she didn't even write it herself.  Because what many people don't know is that she ONLY co-writes.  But in every song she has someone who does it with her.  This album tries to sell Shakira as a musical genius by including the classic Led Zepplin guitar sounds in one of her songs.  And that is the whole album, she just borrows sounds from songs that have been successful before.  She flirts with the sounds of rock, but falls way behind from completing an authentic rock song.<BR>\\"underneath your clothes,\\" is not a bad song, but her vocals killed the song.  There are many parts where she sounds, regardless of whether or not she purposelly tries, just like Taylor, and her song, \\"Love will bring you back.\\"<BR>Shakira is not a musical phenomenon, at least not in my eyes.  Her music doesn't really sound any latin at all.  Yes, she included some sounds of the music from the Andes, but more than a direct influence, they are nothing but a \\"nice\\" touch.<BR>She basically makes plain American music, with very bad lyrics, ann very poor pronunciation.  Some people really insist in separating Shakira from Britney Spears, but they are the same thing.  Does not matter if she or someone else writes her songs, either way they are ....  Not so much the music, but the lyrics are the worst I've heard in a long time.<BR>I don't recommend it. I think we should wait for a real latin artist to come and show us what the latin music is all about.  Shakira offers nothing new, plain and old American music.<BR>Just another Britney.  Just watch how she dresses and all that dance, than more than dance loks like a pretty bad strip-tease.  If that all she has to offer, I'll rather watch Britney do that.  At least she doesn't have the wxtra 20 lbs of weight that Shakira carries in her stomach alone.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The truth about Tomb Raider is complicated.  Even though I gave the movie only one star, the DVD does have its merits. If you're still reading this review, you're probably the type of open-minded (or obsessive/compulsive) movie watcher that actually wants to read about the DVDs high points, so here they are: <br />*  the movie has great special effects, and perfect casting of the lead character (if anyone tells you that Angelina Jolie is not the spitting image of Lara Croft in this movie, slap them...hard).  <BR>*  In a DVD, the action scenes alone may be worth the purchase for some. And one should remember that the DVD medium provides extra features, and the opportunity to skip undesireable scenes.<br />Which brings me to the reason that I gave the product only one star. The movie, in and of itself, is terrible.  Let me restate that: the movie is worse than any live-action movie of a video game I've seen (including Street Fighter), with the possbile exception of the Mario fiasco. Why?<br />**  The plot is stupid (if not for Lara's terrible judgement, there wouldn't be any drama), a number of scenes are overdeveloped, and there are really only 2 high-octane action scenes.  <BR>**  Where are the thought provoking riddles?  Where are the innovative &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;-type tomb break-in scenes? This movie is based on a STRATEGY game...hello!!<BR>**  And for all of those people wanting to &quot;see more&quot; of Angelina Jolie, you're out of luck--the video game is more risque.<br />So, if you've got a couple of bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you've got 20-25 minutes to kill to watch the few interesting parts of this flick, go right ahead.  Otherwise, check out the Matrix for the 15th time, or experiment with Lost In Space, or the Prince of Egypt.

B00004XONN|1.0|No, sir, Radiohead are one of the worst bands I have ever heard in my life. Their music is softer than a pillow and they don't swear at all! The worst part, however, is that their lead vocalist, Steven Jenkins, doesn't scream AT ALL! So disappointing. If you want true screaming brilliance, go buy Idaho by Slipknot, who's lead singer, Fred Durst screams bloody murder. You'll thank me.
B00005R2M3|4.0|well...i think she did a fairly good job...but it is not the same shakira...it doesn't sound much like rock...it sounds like pop...i just hope she doesn't go for that jennifer lopez, britney spears, christina aguilera look...man she has way too much talent to just become one of those acts that try to be seductive...what happened to those leather cover all suits...she used to be original...now i confuse her with all the rest...i hope the old shakira comes back...
B00000JCOV|4.0|Slipknot are the best screamers out there. Fred Durst, who handles the vocals is awesome at swearing and sounding tough. All he does is scream. It's great. I love screaming. I don't think anyone could scream enough. He must have a lot of sore throats. I took one star off though because sometimes Mr. durst like to sing, and what is up with that? I hate singing. Not good. Try their new CD, &quot;Idaho,&quot; it has way more screaming and more cursing!
B00005R2M3|4.0|This lady has a set of pipes, and she uses the full range here. Unfortunately, she doesn't flex those muscles until the second half of the disc. If this were an albumn, side 1 would never be played again, side 2 would get worn out. The first 7 songs, all in English are mostly light weight pop, with one pure disco tune, Ready For The Good Times, the first 7 songs would earn a 3 star review only because of Shakira's voice. But songs 8-13, earn 5 stars, even if 2 of the songs are duplicates from side 1 sung in Spanish. She is much more comfortable singing in Spanish and it shows on side 2, as she wraps the full range of her voice around the music. Poem To A Horse is a classic kiss off tune. For me the stand out, and FM hit is Ojos Asi, sorry, Eyes Like Yours,which is also on MTV Unplugged and Donde Estan Los Ladrones?, featuring lots of mideastern influence. Buy the CD, put some money in her pocket, and maybe she will shed the pop music suggestions from the less talented Estefans that holds this albumn back.
6305878323|5.0|I can't believe that I hated this film when I was a kid, you would think that I would have liked it more back then. But about 3 months ago, I bought this DVD and saw the film for the first time in around a decade. I cannot believe it's the same movie, in fact, I started to wonder if I was even paying attention to it back then as it was playing.<br />The film is nothing less, and probably a lot more than a classic. Julie Andrews completely submerges herself into the character. She definitely deserved the Oscar that she got. The song's are strong, but a few stand out above the rest. Such as, &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; and &quot;``Chim-Chim-Cheree&quot;.<br />I hope a Special Edition DVD will be released in the future, becuase I am very interested in seeing more behind the scenes documentaries, detailing the Visual Effects that were created for the movie. The Gold Collection DVD, does offer a good documentary that gives a lot of insight, but there has to be a lot more, and I would like to see it. The &quot;Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere&quot; featurette, is a great extra.<br />I do agree that this was Walt Disney's greatest LIVE ACTION film, but I do not think it's his greatest acheivement. That goes to &quot;Snow White&quot;, which influenced motion picture history a lot more than &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; did (and I'm not trying to lessen this film, in anyway).
B00004WGC4|5.0|I have to admit that my thoughts about Fawlty Towers pre-viewer were, &quot;can anything be THAT funny?&quot; (I have rather a pessimistic nature) And the answer is yes, yes YES!<br />John Cleese is at his hysterical best (in both senses of the word)as Basil Fawlty. He is a comedian who makes a nervous breakdown the funniest thing in the world. Then there is the marvelous Prunella Scales as Cybil, his wife and (as he calls her) his little puff adder. Andrew Sachs is great as the sweet but always confused Manuel (he's from Barcelona). And of course, Cleese's real life wife at the time and writing partner, Connie Booth as Polly who runs back and forth between the bickering Fawltys and usually manages to benefit herfelf in the process.<br />The cast, as you can tell, is the reason it all works so well. For anyone who has never seen Fawlty Towers, it concerns the adventures of the staff and owners of the afore mentioned hotel. They have a talent for making a small problem into a full scale disaster until it blows up in Basil's face. And don't feel sorry for him either, he is a horrid person but a funny one.<br />My favorite episode is also &quot;The Germans&quot; with Basil suffering from a concussion ordering Polly and Manuel not to mention the war to some German guests all the while doing impressions of Hitler and other insulting things. As the German guest put it, however did they win?<br />The best tape in the set in the one with Communications Problems. It was the first one I saw and I nearly imploded from laughing so hard.<br />This is the Sistine Chapel of sitcoms (quothe Entertainment Weekly) and you definately owe it to yourself to try it out.
B00004R99U|4.0|Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World, is an above average sequel and superior to many of the other DTV Disney sqeuels. This is mainly becuase after the the first film there was still some story that needed telling.<br />While this film is gravely incorrect as far as history goes, Disney has given us a new story that shows us what happened to Pocahontas and John Smith's relationship. Pocahontas' journey to England was a terrific idea, and from that the creators were able to mine endless possibilites. All the songs are catchy, and come close to matching those of the original (surpassing some). The ending might be disappointing to some, becuase it does an injustice to the original film. But others might not mind it.<br />The Gold Collection DVD includes the Silly Symphony short &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot;, which is a wonderful little added bonus.
0761536434|5.0|Weighing in at a massive 608 pages, Steven L. Kent's THE ULTIMATE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES is nothing less than glorious, especially for admitted coin-op history junkies such as myself. Kent chooses to lay his foundation in Chapter 1 with the early rise of coin-op devices and the introduction of David Gottlieb's BAFFLE BALL bagatelle table in 1931. Devoting his opening pages to coin-op's roots was a wise move, he pays homage while giving the reader a greater sense of how we got here. From then on it's full tilt into the video realm. Kent utilized Leonard Herman's excellent book, PHOENIX: THE FALL &amp; RISE OF VIDEOGAMES as one of his research cornerstones, but don't let that fool you. The author logged over 500(!) interviews with the small, medium and large insiders of the video game landscape. It's an amazing feat which yields an abundance of quotes from luminaries such as Al Alcorn, Dave Theurer, Nolan Bushnell, Ray Kassar, Ed Rotberg, Maysaya Nakamura, Dave Thiel, Joel Hochberg, Dave Rosen and Ed Logg (just to name a few!). From the corporate movers and shakers to the programming geniuses, Kent leaves no voice unheard. He also weaves the intricate origination tales of giant game makers such as Sega. Few realize it was founded by Americans living in Japan and that &quot;Sega&quot; is not a Japanese word. It's an abbreviation of the original company, SErvice GAmes founded in 1952. Kent's THE ULTIMATE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES delves deep into the explosive home console successes and failures as well as the coin-operated arena. Even today, former CEOs marvel at the days when they could do no wrong. Just ask former Atari topper Ray Kassar who is still awestruck by the 1982 sales figures of Pac-Man cartridges. Twelve million went out the door that year, setting a retail sales record. In short, THE ULTIMATE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES is a book whose timing couldn't be better. With video game hobbyists and players residing throughout the world, they've come to know that the machines of their childhood are now treasured collectibles. Rest assured, there will be more and more books forthcoming about the video game phenomenon. For now, Stephen L. Kent has delivered us pixel-eyed vidiots a wondrous tome that peeks &quot;behind the screens.&quot;
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you love british comedy you'll love Fawlty Towers.  Perhaps one of the most overlooked due to its short run, but short can be sweet!  While I love the series, the DVD is not really the best.  The transfer is great with only a few bad spots, finally gets rid of the fuzz fom my videos.  The sound is average, no 5.1 but really is it needed.  Now onto the other stuff.  The commentary, as others has stated is about useless.  The extras, including outakes and montages, is lacking.  It's nice is there, but i want more outakes!!  The one shining extra are the menus.  THey are very cool.  This is still one of my favorites, and while be displayed with pride in my collection...until Are You Being Served? and Red Dwarf make it to DVD.

B00005LMBK|4.0|When I first saw this band I thought it was just a joke since the musicians (2D, Murdoc, Noodle, and Russel) are cartoons. NORMALLY, I don even like rap or hip-hop at all but when I heard the rapping vocals on tracks like &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;, I enjoyed it thoroughly. My favorite song on this CD has to be &quot;Rock The House.&quot;  Since I like ska music, I loved the horn line in this funk/hip-hop song. The lyrics are also funny.  A song that I'll give the Gorillaz credit for uniqueness is &quot;Re-Hash.&quot; The chorus is prety catchy.
0395754100|3.0|My two year-old has just met Curious George.  She has never seen anyone smoke a pipe, so she asked &quot;Why that silly sailor eating the phone?&quot;.  She's in no danger of taking up smoking, so I'm not fussed about that content.  It is the fact that George's curiosity gets him stuffed into a sack and abducted by the man in the yellow hat, who becomes a father figure to George, that most disturbs me.  Am I the only one who is made uneasy by this occurence?  Here is the man in the yellow hat, eventually presented as George's friend, but he proves himself first to be a tricky person.
0792844882|5.0|I don't care what others say about this movie, I love it! It's outrageous, daring, eye opening and totally badddddddd. To me this movie is the soft porn version of Cinderalla (haha).
B000056K04|1.0|Dave Matthews Band: Great musicians playing (awful) music and a short guy who sings through his nose. This cd is the worst of the worst. Then they have about a dozen live albums, \\"Listener Supported,\\" in which every song sounds the same. Will this band ever go away? Anyone who gains a large audience base and then puts out (a bad album) like \\"Everyday\\" deserves to be fired. Dave, I don't care what you put out from here on, you are F-I-R-E-D. Power to the musicians, writers and singers who are actually talented.
B00000JR29|5.0|I still remember when this album was big back in the 80s and I still love it today. I'll never forget when my breath was taken away when I first heard EWTRTW and Shout. The best song however is the Working Hour. I still get chills listening to this song.<BR> <BR>This album is a classic by all means and should be in anyones rock/pop collection.
6304708521|4.0|As both Paul McCartney and George Harrison have stated, it was the Beatles who invented rock videos. The Fab Four created promo films for Ticket to Ride, Paperback Writer, Rain, Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane prior to the release of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; in 1967. It is the video performances of Blue Jay Way, I Am the Walrus, Your Mother Should Know, etc. which are, without a doubt, the highlight of &quot;Mystery Tour&quot;. Admittedly, the movie is amateurish; lacking in plot and void of any sensibility. Taken as a film per se, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; would rate 1-star. However, taken as a compilation of videos, the film greatly succeeds. (I simply skip the nonsensical parts and head straight for the musical performances.) The music is, of course, absolutely impeccable and the videos are so much more engaging than current MTV fare. In fact, the clip for I Am the Walrus-- with its dancing &quot;eggmen&quot;-- may just be the coolest, most off-beat song promo ever filmed. The spot for Fool on the Hill --with Paul gazing high atop the Pyrennes-- is absolutely beautiful and quite befitting of that elegant song. Also, you just gotta love that silly wizard garb the guys break out for their performance of the title song. On the downside, the DVD itself is subpar. The picture, in dire need of remastering, is inexcusably grainy. Quite frankly, the film looks like a cheap VHS transfer. So why 4-stars for a plotless movie wrapped in a lousy DVD presentation? One word: MUSIC! More specifically, great Beatle music. That is the saving grace of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.
6304140754|3.0|In some ways, this is really bargain basement Scooby Doo. Don't get me wrong. This is an alright video, but I have certainly seen better Scooby tapes. The first episode involves  the gang along with Scrappy going to a Halloween gathering at a castle. Soon, they realize that these party guests are really monsters. But they are in fact being haunted a ghost who possibly is a danger. I'm not so uptight that I'll deny this is an alright episode. But the plot is not really up to Scooby's usual levels. This episode is just a little too campy, and it lacks the charm we find in the better scooby episodes. (Notably 'Hassle in the Castle,' 'Scooby Doo and A Mummy Too,' 'Foul Play in Funland,' 'Go Away Ghost Ship,' 'A Night of Fright Is No Delight' and a few other episodes.) The second episode involves a tar monster haunting some archeological sights in Turkey. Again, it's a decent story, but it does lack the charm that we find in many other Scooby episodes. I guess my bottom line is that if [dollar amount] is not a big deal to you, you may as well add this video to your Scooby collection. If on the other hand, your budget is on the tighter side, try to borrow this first and then decide if it's worth the [dollar amount].
B00005R2M3|4.0|I am a Shakira fan. So my opinion may not be very objective. I like the CD, overall has a lot of good songs, and I admire the fact that she wrote/arranged most of them, her English is quite good too. I will go thru the songs now: &quot;Objection&quot; is very original, good arrengements. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; is for sure the promo of this CD. &quot;Ready for the good times&quot; is a good disco fantasy. &quot;Eyes like yours&quot; is a disappointment. I agree with the prior review that this CD hardly match her Spanish work, however I am confident it will get her noticed. Overall is a B+.
0385505833|2.0|This is a quick cute read but lacks substance and storyline.  I was hoping that it would be as enjoyable as &quot;Painted House&quot; but was disappointed.  Very predictable ending.  I would have liked to see Grisham develop the characters more.
B00005Q66T|5.0|First of all, I have to admit that my opinions might seem anything but objective. Those close to me know that I have a bit of a bias in Madonna's favor, but that's because She has never given me reason NOT to...and GHV2, her first &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation since 1990's phenomenally successful (and simply phenomenal) The Immaculate Collection, is proof of her endless superiority. With that having been said, I feel truly blessed to be among the first people to share with the world my thoughts on the year's best record, &quot;GHV2&quot;. <br />The 1990s gave Madonna a slew of Top 10 singles and seven multi-platinum records, yet many viewed it as a less successful period for her than her 1980s heyday. That's merely because her work was less mainstream, and much more progressive; it's no wonder that the Erotica album took years before it was reappraised as one of her finest works. It was also the decade in which Madonna's non-musical ventures earned more media attention than her music: the banned videos, the successful films, the not-so-successful films, the Sex book, her pregnancy, etc. But while the media was busy misinterpreting every move Madonna made, and looking for any opportunity to pronounce her as \\"over\\" (a groundless accusation fired from many \\"reputable\\" publications), she was busy cranking out the best music of her career. Madonna is one of the few 20th century performers to avoid peaking early, and instead to continue outdoing herself; her voice improved with age, her style was constantly changing, and each subsequent album outdid the last one. <br />Flash forward to 2001. With Madonna at yet another one of her \\"peaks\\" following the hugely successful Drowned World Tour, mainstream audiences are now getting the chance to reevaluate Madonna's most stellar musical accomplishments in the form of GHV2. And for anyone who quips that infamous \\"she was better in the 80s\\" mantra, I urge you to listen to this album just once. One listen to GHV2 and memories of the timeless Immaculate Collection all but disappear. Like TIC, this is one of Madonna's most incessantly listenable albums; pop this into your stereo at your next party, and you will have no need to skip tracks or switch discs. Also like TIC, it traces Madonna's evolution, only this time the evolution is more personal than musical. The 90s offered fans Madonna's most introspective music (her wonderful 80s work was slightly more ambiguous) and the journey the listener takes visits every stop in Madonna's life and career over the past ten years: the anger, frustration, and sorrow of Erotica; the somber and contemplative outlook of Bedtime Stories; the personal and artistic triumph of Evita; the emotional and spiritual understanding of Ray of Light; and the innovative euphoria of Music. <br />Like all fans, I was initially hoping for some bonus tracks or new mixes of Madonna's classics, but Madonna truly knows best, because there's nothing about this collection that warrants alteration. I might have liked more tracks from Erotica to be included, but that is an album which works best as a whole rather than being divided into singles. And while the exclusion of ballads like \\"This Used to be My Playground\\" and \\"I'll Remember\\" is noticeable, it should encourage listeners to pick up her outstanding 1995 ballad-only collection, Something to Remember. <br />Madonna's success and influence continues to astonish all of us, from the most passionate fans to the most jaded critics. How many artists see fit to release a \\"greatest hits\\" collection every ten years? How many artists are lucky enough to have ANY hits every ten years? Madonna is truly unprecedented, and as many have said before, her show is far from over. Imitators and naysayers have come and gone, and many more will come and go in the years ahead. In the meantime, we can all sit back and appreciate all that she has done for the world of art and entertainment. Madonna herself has often noted that \\"the music is all but forgotten\\" in the cultural whirlwind that is her life, and now it's time for us to remember. GHV2 contains fifteen songs, any one of which could have made a lesser artist's entire career. Yet for Madonna, each served merely as a stepping stone into the future, and her path is as endlessly delectable as it is artistically rich.<br />Simply put, GHV2 is perfect. It's also priceless, and a wonderful reminder of how lucky we are to be sharing a lifetime with the greatest artist and greatest entertainer of them all.<br />Thank you Madonna....for everything.

B000001FS3|5.0|This album is one of the few albums ever to recieve my &quot;play&quot; level of approval. See most artists put a few good radio friendly tracks on an album, then fill the rest up with the left overs. Even U2 is guilty of this, See lemon or zoo tv albums.<br />Josuha Tree however is one of the few albums that I can place into my cd player and never worry about skipping a bad song.<br />There are no bad songs on this album they all rock.
B00005QK3W|4.0|It's true; it rocks. A few slow songs are included but with 16 songs that's nothing to get upset about. Lonely Road ends with Mccartney belting out some inspired vocals. Tiny Bubble reminded of something or other on the White Album and then it dawned on me: Piggies. Still, a nice song to listen to, but not nearly as developed as Harrison's. Heather is mostly instrumental but a very pleasant piece of work. Driving Rain is the most catchy of the songs, but I can understand if some folks don't like the 1,2,3,4,5 lets go for a ride, 6,7,8,9,10 let's go there and back again. Not exactly earth shattering; not exactly Bob Dylan; it's fun to listen to though. Your way sounds country a little bit and is fun; Your Loving Flame is a very well done piano piece. Freedom is great and it's hard to believe he just dashed it off after the WTC bombings but he's Paul Mccartney after all. Magic is fresh and almost as catchy as Driving Rain. FALTAF probably won't get much airplay but it's a very nice piano song but probably not as quite as good as Your Loving Flame. I haven't listened much to Riding to Jaipur and Rinse the Raindrops but they are probably fine tunes. Spinning on an Axis is my least favorite up tempo song and About You my least favorite slower songs. All in all a very good album.
B000001F5F|4.0|I only gave this 4 stars because it is a superior album in comparison to most live albums it still inferior to &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; which blows this out of the water.. <BR>However it is worth the price if you want to hear some good ole pre-zoo tv U2
B00005QGAT|5.0|Thriller was an excellent record too but received a boost of sorts from the then fledgling MTV. This record though made it Completely on its own merits and thus deserves a five star rating for the artistic, musician and showmanship triumph it obtained.

B00005N9CV|5.0|All the negative comments on here are bit much. They come off sounding like self-involved pretentious jazz snobs. I enjoyed all the songs and arrangements and vocals! I recommend it to anyone. I can sit back and really enjoy this CD many times over.<BR>And apparently so can about half a million other listeners as well, since this CD has already gone gold in less then 3 months.<BR>These other negative reviewers probably loved Miles Davis' post 1972 work!
B00003CX5P|1.0|This film defines boredom.  How anyone could love it is beyond me...much less watch extras about the hideous making of a cinematic atrocity.  George Lucas has directed the dullest film ever.  EVER.  I wanted to shut this thing off twenty minutes into it and forced myself to watch it.  It is even more boring than 2001: A Space Odyssey...and that is next to impossible.  But of course what can you expect from the man who brought the world such trash as Willow and Howard the Duck.  I HATE this film and am so glad that SHREK is outselling it on DVD.  I would rather watch Chesty Morgan movies ad naseum than to ever sit through this void on celluloid again.  Anyone who likes it is welcome to it but don't ever try to go on a date with me.  I'll send you packing.
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is the Sinatra we all envision with respect and awe. When you get RID of those campy, silly and outright embarrassing awful Billy May arrangements, (not to mention May himself) and bring in Basie, then go to 1960's Vegas, you'll get the best on the mark performance Sinatra ever recorded. This material is about as swinging and hot as Sinatra gets. Period. On time, off time, no time, it ALL works here like magic: this is the epitome of cool swing arranging with a Basie band that is very much as hot as Sinatra in every way. The crowd loved it and you will too. If you buy NO OTHER Sinatra CD, you must buy this one.
B000002AGE|5.0|Great classic fusion. A must for any collector of jazz or serious audiophile. IMPORTANT: SONY(Columbia) prevents you from making copies of the songs on your home CD recorder.
6305508550|5.0|I'll make this simple. You will either love or hate this movie.  If youve EVER worked in a cubicle in an office, with co-workers and over-managing bosses you will rank this as one of your all-time favorite comedies....  On the other hand, if youve never worked in this environment you might find this to be one of the most strange and non-sensical movies ever.  It comes down to being able to relate firsthand to almost all the things that make this movie so great. I was laughing from the very first scene (traffic) to the very end, (milton). Perhaps the best comedy of 1999.
B00005QCYC|5.0|This has got to be one of the best boxed sets ever! I can't wait to get it! I didn't buy the first boxed set, which contained Jurassic Park and The Lost World, because I knew Jurassic Park III was coming out! That was like a year ago or so and I knew they'd put out a trilogy boxed set when JP3 was released so I decided to wait! Well don't worry, because if you have already bought the first two films, you can still get the trilogy collector's box by simply buying the third film on DVD! Yep that's right, the reviewer who mentioned it before me said Universal was being nice, and it's true! All you have to do if you already own Jurassic Park and The Lost World, is Buy Jurassic Park III and inside the DVD case they're is a form or something that let's you order the trilogy box case that comes with the fourth disc I suppose! So You can still get the Trilogy Box Set wether you've bought the first two films or not!
B00005QXXO|4.0|As far as live albums go, this is an excellent one. In order for live albums to be worth their salt they must possess versions of songs that are different than on the studio albums. Radiohead do not disappoint here. 'Like Spinning Plates' is an amazing revelation. I had always been less struck by it than all the other songs on \\"Amnesiac\\" until I heard the piano version here. Yorke's vocals are truly extraordinary. 'Everything in Its' Right Place' also benefits from the live treatment, Johnny Greenwood distorts Yorke's vocals with great success and with absolute relevance to the song itself.<br />'The National Anthem' and 'Idioteque' are naturally great live tracks, and the versions presented here, although not radically different from the originals on \\"Kid A,\\" are nevertheless fantastic.<br />The gem of this album, and it is worth the (dollar amount) alone, is the previously unreleased 'True Love Waits.' It is an acoustic effort from Yorke, and it is a wonderful addition to an otherwise mostly expected set of songs.<br />This should appeal to both the Radiohead afficionado as well as to the relative newcomer.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|To me as a teen I have to say that from my personal experiences Shrek is definetly for all ages! This movie just lifts your spirits with its dry humor. William Steig did a delightful job at depicting a fairy-tale world that we have known for ages...but somehow this movie of the fairy tale world seemed different and definetly more fun. It wasn't just the same boring old thing!!<br />Now on to the movie. Our main-character a big green ferocoius looking ogre named Shrek(Voiced by Mike Meyers) lives in solitude from the rest of the world. Kinda like a hermit in our world. All he wishes is to be left alone in his swamp because unfortunately the world doesn't exactly appreciate ugly ogres. So to his immense disliking fairy-tale creatures captured by Lord Farquaa have flocked his whole swamp. Accompanied by a self-centered annoying talking donkey(Voiced by Eddie Murphy) he sets out to find Lord Farquaa and get back his rights to the swamp. However, he ends up getting the job of rescuing Princess Fiona (a fair maiden Farquaad wants as his bride) from a castle guarded by a ferocious dragon.<br />With a serious of fast-paced events Shrek and his pal donkey manage to save Princess Fiona, unfortunately not before the dragon fell in love with the talking donkey.(I found that totally hilirous!!<br />As Shrek leads Princess Fiona back toward Farquaad's castle, adventure begin, which does introduce a blossoming romance of sorts! This story was filled with great humor such as when the very short Lord Farquaa tears off the Gingerbread Man's legs which resulted in a bunch of laughter from the audience. THe fun packed adventure will truly delight whole families! A great-see!

You can clearly see Britney is fast approaching 21 when club bangers such as SLAVE with lyrics &quot;All you people look at me like I'm a little girl&quot; and and she's also tired of being so &quot;Damn&quot; OVERPROTECTED.<br />&quot;Britney&quot; is clearly a little R&amp;b with songs such songs of my favorites on the disc Janet Jackson-ish BOYS but she still keeps Pop fans happy with songs such as up beat tempoed THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME.<br />The only ballad on the disc NOT A GIRL.... clearly shows Britney does have some talent. ALthough not the best c.d. out today, &quot;Britney&quot; is a good record.
B00005QIPH|5.0|i don't know about second coming of the stones or whatever hype's been thrown around, but i'd have to say this is the most interesting record i've listened to so far this year.<br />it is extraordinarily weird, in a very subtle way, not as subtly as madness was weird, but in that ballpark.  everyone seems to be relating them to the stones and vu, which is also weird because what i heard didn't have much to do with that.  to begin with, there are some solid motown lines in the stuff, especially on last nite and someday, which sounded like allusions to the jam and other late 70s early 80s mod to me.  but it is jumbled up with a ton of other influences.  barely legal could have been written by new order, basically, and soma has what i believe is an allusion to the psychedelic furs.  take it or leave it lifts from pil's this is what you want this is what you get and the fall.  the other major influence is probably the stooges circa early/middle 70s much more so than the velvet underground which would never mix motown with their brand of rebellion.  in any case, there's so much there to sort out and get a kick out of that i can't see how someone could call it derivative; if it's derivative, then all of rock'n'roll is and thus a good thing to be.<br />it's way overproduced, but, hey, you can't have everything.
0385486804|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK... I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN FROM START TO FINISH... VERY FAST MOVING... AND INTERESTING....THIS GUY WAS VERY SMART.... IT IS TOO BAD THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT... I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO MEET HIM.
B00005K3NY|5.0|I personally didn't notice any audio sync problems on this disc.  But, the picture quality needs acknowledgement.  It's worth having just for the widescreen &amp; the awesome transfer of a 20 year old print.  It was like watching it for the 1st time.  I remember the trailer from when it first aired.  Look at the difference in picture quality between the trailer, the VHS edition, and the DVD.  Then you'll realize it's worth the low price, and then some.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a great CD...the best of the best from the last decade.<BR>The booklet...wow...it's amazing...more than 500 little pics of Madonna. However I think there are some songs missing...That would be totally perfect if there were &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;,&quot;You'll see&quot; and &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;...However all the songs are really great...Te best of the best...God Save the Queen(s).
6300270424|3.0|Filming of this concert at Madison Square Garden took place at the end of July 1973 and the end of the 1973 tour year for Led Zeppelin&#8212;and it shows in almost every performance.  As a rabid Zeppelin fan who owns many live Zeppelin concert recordings (including several from 1973), I can assure you that what you hear in this video is not the Zeppelin you would hear in March or May of that year, which were far better shows.  In those months, Zeppelin is fresh and energized and they often left your out of breath.  Here in this concert footage&#8212;with bits and pieces that were taken from each of the three shows&#8212;Page shows some signs of being spent from the long touring year and Robert's voice is just horrid in some spots.  Both freely admit that these concerts were not their best effort and both have often bemoaned both the quality of the footage and the quality of play.  Lot of the blame could be put on the awful editing job which is evident throughout the film to fit three days of the best music into one supposed concert night (notice how their clothes change from scene to scene?).  Additionally, there are several concert footage scenes that were \\"re-filmed\\" in a reconstructed studio set of the concert stage (for proof, look at Plant's teeth.  In one shot, they'll be crooked, in other shots perfectly straight.  Why?  Because he had his teeth fixed after 1973 and the \\"re-filming\\" captured that).  But of all the many cuts found strewn throughout the film, the most criminal cut occurs in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" right before the Theramin section&#8212;it's amazing someone could have gotten away with that one.  There are several in \\"Dazed and Confused\\", too, that rank up there in the list of poor edits.  Even after Page's solo in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (perhaps his finest in that touring year), the film cuts to the previous night because Plant liked the way he sounded that night instead.  If you listen closely, this cut completely unbalances the tempo of the song.  Lastly, watch Jones very closely after the end of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  He takes his bass guitar off twice.  It's that kind of mediocre production that plagues this entire film.<br />But even with all the complaints, I still love this film.  It actually was the reason why I became the Zeppelin fan I am today.  I watched it one weekend in 1986, and I have been addicted to Zeppelin ever since.  As so many other reviewers have said here, even a relatively weak Zeppelin performance is worth its wait in gold.  The boys still pull off a lot of exciting moments in these songs, most noticeably in TSRTS, DAC, NQ, and SIBLY.  So despite my reservations about the film itself, I still would recommend it to Zeppelin and non-Zeppelin fan alike.  Jimmy was a true guitar sorcerer in those days, and Jones & Bonham were simply gigantic from one night to the next&#8212;the best rhythm section ever in the history of rock bands.  No other live band then and now can match these guys in talent.
B000002BQK|5.0|Well I have been a fan of Mariah Carey ever since she dropped her debut album back in 1990.  Have all her albums so I think it is safe for me to say that this is her best album.  <br />She sounds more focused on this piece and lets out more emotions and it shows in her singing and songwriting.  Has one fast paced song in Honey which is great and the video was delicious too.  Puff Daddy produces the song and it is actually good.  This has some nice ballads such as Butterfly, My All, Fourth Of July, Beautiful Ones, Outside.  <br />On My All she displays some resemblances to old Whitney Houston which is good.  She even gets down with Bone Thugs N Harmony on Breakdown which is just straight off the chain classic track; may even be the best on the album.  Bones harmonizing throughout the song really add some depth and straight dopeness to the song; they act as sorta backup singers.  Babydoll is one of Mariah Carey's best slow jams and one of her best songs EVER.  The beat to this is so laid-back and PERFECTLY fits the track.  Mariah Carey is at her vocal best on this song. A masterpiece of a song. And to make it even better it was self-produced.<br />To conclude you should buy this album if you are into Mariah Carey.  However if you like her two most recent albums Rainbow &amp; Glitter, then you shouldnt get this as it is a completely different vibe.  But still R&amp;B fans should get this.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This album is one of his best works yet. The music rocks and the lyrics are really cool. The song Freedom is one of the best on the CD. my advice, buy this CD quick!!!
B00000J7SO|4.0|Yes Street Legal still has its annoying aspects, such as the robotic female backround vocals on Changing of the Guard, but then again just about every Dylan album has a &quot;what was he thinking&quot; moment. This kind of inscrutability is what makes Dyan Dylan. However, the remix has taken what was a muddled mess and allowed many classic Dylan songs to shine through.I was quite frankly astonded by the difference.
B00005OAJ1|2.0|See... they're not really good looking, but they sing about how cool and good looking they are and it's really ironic and funny. Get it? They don't look like rock stars, but they talk about how they're rock stars. Get it? <br />It's really hip. Right?<br />See... They're really cool, but they say they're not, so they really are. <br />Be a part of this very exclusive club. Maybe you're ironic and clever enough to get it.
B00000253N|5.0|Bob Dylan's 1975 classic, Blood On the Tracks, competes only with Fleetwood Mac's Rumours as the greatest break-up album of all-time and, as stunning as Rumours is, not even its heartfelt sentiments can compete with the deeply personal album rock's leading songwriter recorded after divorcing his wife, Sara, in 1974. For Blood on the Tracks, Dylan abandoned the jamrock of his recent work with the Band, donned a simple acoustic guitar and meditated on his recent tribulations. What he produced is astounding. Perhaps only when confronting subject matter as emotionally complex as divorce do fans see what an able songwriter Dylan truly is. The ten masterpieces of Blood on the Tracks, be them love songs; hate songs; break-up songs; apology songs or other, are some of the most mature, affecting and insightful tracks ever recorded about relationships. Dylan's thoughtfulness and ingenuity tower over typical rock music about love and loss. Thousands of fine love songs have been crafted but no hate song matches the cleverness, power and downright cruelty of \\"Idiot Wind.\\" \\"If You See Her Say Hello\\" is one of the most achingly heartfelt, naked expressions of regret I have ever encountered. \\"You`re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" and \\"Buckets of Rain\\" are winsome and heartening expressions about letting go. The remarkable, happy-go-lucky ballad, \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" makes life seem like an exciting venture like no other tune. Each song is pleasingly melodic, deeply reflective and lyrically brilliant. I can not recommend this album more highly. No album in the rock cannon is quite as clever, tuneful and moving as Blood On the Tracks.
B00005QXXO|4.0|What can I say?  This live cd is really great.  You get the true experience of listening to a Radiohead concert.  These tracks are not just the studio versions played live. No!  These are tracks with new energy, new arragements, and at times new instrumentation.  For example &quot;National Anthem&quot; has a new intro with Thom doing a crazed human-beatbox vocal which add a great new dynamic to the song, not to mention the bassline being really fuzzy, making for the ultimate groove.  On &quot;idioteque&quot;, Phil helps out on acoustic drums to complement that techno beat.  Finally on &quot;like spinning plates&quot;, instead of the weird/warped/backward studio version, here it is a piano piece with synth strings swooshing in and out with the rest of the band warping Thom's vocals.<BR>  So, these songs are bigger and def. better than their studio versions.  A def. must for those wanting the definitive radiohead live as well and cool versions of their studio favorites.  All the songs were recorded in Oxford, Oslo, Berlin, and Vaison La Romaine.<br />ps<BR>you also get &quot;true love waits&quot;, thom and acoustic guitar, a song they have played for years but never officially released!
B000002I2M|4.0|In the final days of their career, the Doors got back to their roots. Along with accenting the rollicking blues riffs and cryptic poetry that are the basics of their music, that process consisted of returning to their hometown of Los Angeles. The influence of that setting permeates through 1971's L.A. Woman. Los Angeles is, of coarse, &quot;the city of night&quot; and a brooding, sinister dusk looms over most of L.A. Woman. The title epic and the cover of John Lee Hooker's &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; (made distinctly phallic by its slow, slinky rhythm and leadsinger, Jim Morrison's husky tone) are as forebodingly sexual as the blues can get. &quot;Riders on the Storm,&quot; a dusty, whispering song about a serial killer, is even creepier than the band's notorious epic, &quot;The End.&quot; &quot;Been Down So Long&quot; is an excellent, gritty, prison-encased blues rocker. All songs on L.A. Woman are enhanced by Morrison's gruff, brawny vocals and the band's funky arrangements both sounding more forceful and confident than every before. The Doors were certainly in their element here. L.A. Woman is a magnificently decadent album.
B00002DD97|5.0|Hey,<BR>   I love this CD. No, I havent listened to the limited eddition one but i do plan on buying it in the next week or so.

B000003S0K|4.0|Influence from both protopunk band, the Velvet Underground and minimalist composer, LaMonte Young, is apparent on sonic experimentalist, Brian Eno's 1973 solo debut, Here Come the Warm Jets. The album is a schizophrenic soup of the avant-garde. Sometimes blistering hard rock centered around layers of distorted guitars bursts out (\\"Blank Frank,\\" \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\"), sometimes an achingly, beautiful composition erupts (\\"On Some Faraway Beach,\\" the title track) and sometimes a quirky, glamrock oddity is provided (\\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" \\"The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch,\\" a song about a sex toy featuring a hilarious, squeaking, mechanical keyboard solo). No matter where he wanders, Brian Eno does little wrong on this album. Few musicians can pool so many extremes and oddities into such an infectious, cohesive mix as well as Eno.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I own Shakira's Pies Descalzos, The Remixes, Donde estan los ladrones?, MTV Unplugged, and I just bought Laundry Service.  I can't say that this cd beats her Spanish one because it doesn't but it comes very and I mean VERY close.  Shakira is still Shakira but just in English.  She even includes 4 Spanish songs in here that are just amazing!  From the hit single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Suerte&quot; to her tango influenced &quot;Objection&quot; and &quot;Te aviso, te anuncio&quot; Shakira is super charged to take on the world! &quot;The One&quot; is a soft and sweet ballad and is sure to become a classic love song while &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Poem to a horse&quot; are going to show the rock lovers what Shakira is made of! &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; is a very good dance song and &quot;Que me quedas tu&quot; slows it down a bit.  I love the use of instruments in this entire album. Shakira is most definitely a &quot;Woman full of grace&quot; and she shows it. The entire album is produced by her.  This cd is a must-have!
B0000024SI|5.0|Mixing the electric blues sound of Muddy Waters and Sonny Boy Williamson and the surreal, beatnik lyricism of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs with his own rapid-fire rhymes and croaky, yet striking, vocals, Bob Dylan shaped a flawless, stark, dry version of the blues for 1965's Highway 61 Revisited. The characters in Dylan's songs are lonely, witty and severely nervous. The surreal word frenzies of tracks like \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" the title song and the shaky \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" are funhouse mirrors reflecting the trying era in which they were recorded. The murky sound and the bizarre wordplay are perfect for this awesome magnum opus of uncertainty, antipathy and fright.
B00004XOWM|5.0|CSATHDFW is a great album. It's not as hard and original as the first, but it has that certain something that makes you listen to it all over again without getting bored...<br />Yes, i admit, most songs are not quite intelligent, just like the lyrics. But the music is great, and you kinda grow on the songs and you like each one of them more and more each day...<br />Many people in here keep saying bad things about Fred Durst. Come on, people, what's wrong with you?? Just because the lyrics are pretty silly or because he's white... it doesn't mean he's not talented. The fact that he discovered so many great bands is a proof... cause without Fred we wouldn't have Staind, or Puddle of Mudd, or Cold... so thank you Fred for that...<br />and also do you think that a &quot;stupid person&quot; like you keep calling him would stand a chance being a director? Check out the many videos Fred directed and you'll see the great ammount of talent this guy has.......<BR>so leave Fred alone! If you don't like the way he raps, don't listen. <BR>But both Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit brought something new and exciting to today's music and they deserve credit for that.<br />And about the album... very interesting, with many different songs...<BR>check out Hold On, feat. Scott Weiland (from STP), probably the best song on the album.
B000002J03|4.0|After their rough, shrieking debut, Led Zeppelin tightened up their potent, bluesy sound with 1969's Led Zeppelin II. With the exception of the rambling \\"Lemon Song,\\" Zeppelin II features succinct riff rock. They do not loose much of their ardor (Listen to hypercharged \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" for proof). The rough edges are merely smoothed out. Instead of the moaning, spiraling epics of their self-entitled debut (\\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"I Can't Quit You Babe,\\") Led Zeppelin II presents the Chuck Berry-ish bop of \\"Heartbreaker,\\" \\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\\" and \\"Ramble On\\" and neatly trimmed tumblers like \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and \\"Moby Dick.\\" The earsplitting impact of their first album is lost, but Led Zeppelin II is still a winner. The melodic, succinct tunes are memorable, catchy and still pretty darned rocking. Their second album features the seminal British hard rock band cutting a fine, fiery batch of tighter tunes.
B00004RHZU|3.0|When Pink came out with her first single &quot;there you go&quot;, I expected a soild debut album. Well, I was wrong. CAN'T TAKE ME HOME is just average. Pink has a good singing voice and she has the attitude but the production is lame. A lot of songs on CAN'T TAKE ME HOME sound like Timbaland/Destiny's Child rip offs. The song &quot;most girls&quot; is actually the best song on here. Others that come close are &quot;private show&quot; and &quot;can't take me home.&quot; Pink gets all of anger out on here but at times it seems like she's holding back. The ballads are a mess. They're long and drawn out. Pink's at her best on the uptemos. CAN'T TAKE ME HOME is an average debut.
B000002UA2|4.0|1972's Obscured by Clouds is the most unjustly overlooked album in Pink Floyd's catalogue. Its instrumentals, the title track; \\"When You're In;\\" \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" and especially \\"Mudmen,\\" are some of the finest wavy, lavalamp psychedelica I have ever heard. \\"Childhood's End;\\" \\"Free Four\\" (the first song in which Roger Waters, deals with the death of his father in WW2) and \\"Stay,\\" (sung seamlessly in keyboardist, Richard Wright's dry hum) feature on a new, humanistic approach to the band's songwriting. The clear, trancelike sound and down-to-earth subject matter are fine precursors to the style employed on Floyd's legendary works, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. If you love those albums, Obscured by Clouds is certainly well worth considering.
B000031XCR|5.0|Wow, this CD is outstanding! Celine Dion is an amazing singer! There are many wonderful songs on the CD, but my favorite is My Heart Will Go On, whenever I hear that song I get a chill and goosebumps because it is such a beautiful, poignant, touching song and when I hear it it makes me think of the unfortunate people who lost their lives on the Titanic! Other great songs are Love Will Move Mountains, That's The Way It is, and many others. I highly recommend this poweful CD!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Another splendid effort from Paul.  Some rockers, some charming love songs, some experimental forays, some driving bass playing, and some great vocals from rock's best melodic voice.  Lonely Road is a strong opener reminiscent of World Tonight from Flaming Pie.  From A Lover To A Friend is instantly likeable and grows on you.  She's Given Up Talking - a weaker effort - weak melody and lyrics.  Sometimes Paul seems to try too hard to be clever or profound and it just ends up being weird!  The title track has a fascinating chord progression and catchy beat and tune which make up for the 12345...   678910 lyric!  I Do is a classic McCartney love song, easy to relate to and sing along to.  Tiny Bubble is infectious with a cool progression which sounds a bit like &quot;Piggies&quot; (a GH song). Magic - nice track...  Your Way - has that nice country guitar sound that McCartney occasionally uses with good humour - very likeable song.  Spinning on an Axis - oops!  &quot;It's the season of the culture bat&quot; as lyric doesn't help this song either!  &quot;Heather&quot; is a lovely tune.  Slightly odd but heartfelt lyrics. &quot;Loving Flame&quot; has a great element of passion.  &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; uses Indian instruments and tonality very effectively.  A nice contrast within the album.  The last track, Rinse the Raindrops is a bit long but has some great improvising.  Then comes the bonus track, Freedom, live from the NY concert.  Great tune, and what a great voice at the tender age of 59!  <BR>     The album would be helped by dropping a couple of tracks as suggested above (16 songs including the bonus track).  I think that some of McCartney's albums would have been better received by critics if he had only been to identify an embarrassing track of two and leave them off! A catchy single a la Hope of Deliverance from Off the Ground or Young Boy from Flaming Pie would have been welcome too.  <BR>    Anyway, as a professional musician who has all of McCartney's studio albums, I am certainly pleased with Driving Rain. While it's not one of the top level McCartney albums like Tug of War, Band on the Run, Flaming Pie or Flowers in the Dirt, it's not far behind either.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks was awesome, and has to be watched in chronological order.  The series left me emotionally drained after watching each episode it was so powerful.  After watching the last episode and feeling so horribly cheated by the television networks I would wander around in the following weeks with a profound sense of loss, and flashes of the feelings Twin Peaks left me.<br />The best television series ever made.
B00005QDW5|5.0|But this is actually really good. I have every Floyd album from Piper to Division Bell, plus Wrights, Waters and Gilmour's solo albums. Every song is mixed so perfecly together, even if the songs are a few years apart. What actually does (stink) is that \\"Echoes\\" is shortened by about 6 minutes, but you get the track \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\", which is awesome cause you could only get that from the movie. I reccomened this to people who want to complete their collection, not the album for first-time Floyd fans.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The last real album from Tupac Shakur is without doubt the finest example of real rap music in existence. Released less than two months after his &quot;death&quot; in Las Vegas drive-by shooting it finds him at the top of his form. Every track is so deep multiple listens will still not discover every hidden meaning and lyric that this album has to offer. The album begins with a mock report on the album's release and this leads into the opening track Bomb First featuring EDI &amp; Young Noble from the Outlawz, on this track 'Pac rips into his enemies and just destroys them. However, dissing is not the main focus and 'Pac only twice more goes for enemies, dismissing Dr. Dre on Toss It Up and mentioning everyone who crossed him on Against All Odds. The deep, mysterious tracks begin with Hail Mary, again featuring the Outlawz (this time Young Noble &amp; Kastro), an infamous hook and killer verses, just a classic cut. <BR>The only real party track follows, Toss It Up featuring K-Ci &amp; Jo-Jo, Danny Boy and Aaron Hall. &quot;To Live &amp; Die In LA&quot; is a laid back, relaxed track which just can't help giving you the feeling of lounging in LA watching the day go by. Next &quot;Blasphemy&quot; as deep and mysterious as you will get, Prince Ital Joe's hook, the slightly altered Lord's prayer and chilling lyrics which just compel you to listen. &quot;Life Of An Outlaw&quot; as you might guess features the Outlawz (EDI, Napoleon, Kastro &amp; Noble) and is one of the most uptempo, in-your-face tracks on the album. &quot;Just Like Daddy&quot; is the usual track on a 2Pac album dedicated to women, again with the Outlawz (EDI, Kastro, Noble &amp; Kadafi's lone appearance), a great feeling track and possibly the most accessible.<BR>The standout cut is &quot;Krazy&quot; featuring LBC rapper Bad Azz, the most thugged-out beat and lyrics ever, you just wanna roll up the windows and just ride around the city. &quot;White Man'z World&quot; is a brilliantly emotional song charting his mistakes and regrets living in a &quot;white man's world&quot; and also features clips of Malcolm X &amp; Martin Luther King Jr. In &quot;Me &amp; My Girlfriend&quot; 'Pac's gun is his girl and he uses his lyrics well to get this across. &quot;Hold Ya Head&quot; is to me an updated version of &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; this time open to men and women alike and even surpasses the original. The album finishes with &quot;Against All Odds&quot; aimed at all of 'Pac enemies (note the omission of BIG, did 'Pac know something we didn't??) and finishes, some would say aptly with a collection of gunshots.<BR>The first time I heard this album was five years ago (Nov. 96) and still now I listen to it a lot, nothing since then has or probably will eclipse &quot;The 7 Day Theory&quot;, the best and most intriguing piece of music ever to be compiled.

B00005QK3W|3.0|Thanks in part to the Concert for New York, this has to be one of the most anticipated albums in Paul's career. As usual, expectations are high, especially in light of the phenomenal, Grammy nominated work found on &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;.  My first words of advice to anyone out there interested in &quot;Driving Rain&quot;: &quot;Flaming Pie 2&quot; it ain't.<br />Paul bravely takes on a modern, semi-alternative sound on this album, and at times it doesn't fit. But alas, he is a guy who's been in the business for some 30 odd years, so it's only natural that he tries to go a different, hipper route (a la Eric Clapton on &quot;Pilgrim&quot;). The album starts off with &quot;Lonely Road&quot; and &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot;, two meloncholy songs with  optimistic messages and catchy choruses. &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; has a dark, alternative feel to it and comes off as a pleasant surprise. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is weak, plain and simple. Again, the music is different, but the lyrics are weak.....&quot;Bip Bop Bam&quot; weak.&quot;I Do&quot; and &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; are bright and pleasant songs, with the latter tune achieving a jumpy pop feel. &quot;Magic&quot; is the ode to  Linda; an ok song, a bit overdone. &quot;Your Way&quot; is another gentle Paul love song with shades of some of George Harrison's work on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot; and &quot;About You&quot; are the &quot;rockers&quot; of the album, which isn't saying a whole lot.<br />&quot;Heather&quot; is a mostly instrumental song, with a few utterly daft lyrics. &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a standout, tried and true Macca track, complete with Beatlesque backing vocals. &quot;Back in the Sunshine&quot; feels tired after the first few lyrics. Ah, the lyrics. I am saddened to say this, but I think Sir Paul has finally hit a brick wall in his writing.  Don't get me wrong, there are several tracks on here that stand up lyrically with most of his solo efforts; but as a whole, he generalizes most of the songs and seems to have lost that magic touch he had just a few years ago.<br />We all know this album is about two things: Linda, and Heather. Missing Linda, and cherishing the vitality, optimisim and freshness of his relationship with Heather. It's not that there's anything wrong with having a specific inspiration for an album because it's worked for him in the past. However, in the case of &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, the intial listen will leave you with the realization that at least 7 of the songs on the album are  about the same thing, said in the same way. <br />Paul is either going to get ripped for trying a modern sound, or enjoy the praise both Bob Dylan and Clapton achieved with their contemporary releases just a few years ago.  I for one don't criticize Paul for attempting to update himself ; half the time it actually works. But I have to point out what can only be described as disapointment in the lyrics found in these songs....c'mon Paul, &quot;12345, let's go for a drive&quot;? You CAN do better. One final note: stealing the stomp-and-clap thing off &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; for &quot;Freedom&quot;? Not very original...but then again, neither are the lyrics.

Rated pg-13 for violence/gore, adult content, brief nudity, and adult language. Not a bad movie! Kids at age of 9-anytime, will be allowed to watch it! I watched it at 6!
B00005JKHP|3.0|&quot;You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear&quot;. That old-fashioned bit of wisdom perfectly describes this DVD's attempt to rehabilitate the flawed original movie. The reason? Sluggish editing and unfinished effects were only a few of the problems with this film. The main one, which is unfixable, is a poor script. Then there's stiff acting from the beloved original crew, who don't appear to be having much fun. And, those unnecessary new characters who were thrown into the film simply because they had been part of the ill-fated ressurection of the television series. Sterile, gray sets. The DVD is redeemed only by the interesting features on the second disk.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I bought this album for the previously unreleased track \\"True Love Waits\\", and because I have never seen Radiohead live, and was curious to hear how they managed to play such complicated songs outside of the studio. I was surprised! I thought it would be good, but not this good. The piano version of \\"Spinning Plates\\" is so beautiful, and \\"True Love Waits\\" is so depressing in such a pretty, harmonious way. Each song is recreated with such ingenuity, that it gives new life to the songs. It's also great to hear Thom speak, and to hear the \\"new\\" track at the beginning of one song. I won't give it away, just buy it and enjoy!
B00003CX5P|2.0|A lot of sound and fury... signifying NOTHING. The first clue that Lucas didn't have a compelling idea for this film was the mind-numbing &quot;crawl&quot; at the beginning of the film. The Pod Race: nothing more than a vapid video game on the big screen. J.J. Binks? More annoying than the Ewoks. Let's get back to the great storytelling and human dimension of the first two films!
B00005QK3W|5.0|From Lonley Road through to Freedom,Driving Rain is as solid as any album Paul has recorded since The Beatles!You have got to give him credit for still delivering the goods after all these years.One track,&quot;Heather&quot; has the most beautiful melody.While others like &quot;About You&quot; and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; rock as hard as anything that Paul has ever done.The song &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is the perfect pop tune,with a great bass line.The ballads are also strong-&quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; is as chilling as &quot;Your Loving Flame is warm. In all you can't go wrong with driving rain-A tremendous job done by Sir Paul McCartney!
B00005R2IS|5.0|Sure, this has been available on DVD in the US before, but this version will finally, thank God, include the original Austrailian dialogue. I have been dying to see it this way for years &amp; I am confident that it will enhance my enjoyment of this film (even though I'm pretty sure Mel did his own dubbing in the American version, it's always been a nuisance to listen to...takes away from the authenticity somehow). Now, if I can just get my hands on some subtitled Godzilla movies...
0684847817|5.0|This book is a must have; a keepsake for all.
1559408898|4.0|I bought this DVD at least a year ago from an internet importer. Living in the UK I found that this title along with many of my other choice movies is sadly abscent from UK retailers shelves. <br />I was pleased to see that Robocop had been given the Criterion Collection treatment . The disc itself has a few extras including the obligatory trailers, but where I was disapointed was with the lack of deleted scenes, although it is a bonus to see the film in it's full 'Un- Rated' form with stomach churning heightened violence, the context of which is reassured by the directors commentary (which is probably the best part of this disc). The presentation is good  with logical and informative menu screens. My only  big complaint with the package is the lack of an anamorphic transfer which leaves the picture looking grainy in places, also the price of the bundle is a little inflated. That said this is becoming something of a collectors item so it is definitely worth getting hold of.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This pristine restoration of the godfather series of movies is spectacular!  The sound and picture quality enhance these movies that did not need much to improve.  The included disc with the extra features is truly a bonus.  It includes all of the scenes from the complete epic from a few years back plus others. Watching these scenes makes you wish they were included in the movies themselves, because they enhance the story so well.  This set is a must have for Coppola fans, and Godfather fans alike.
0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender quartet is a brilliant analysis of the human mind.  I completely identified with the characters, and was drawn into their lives.  Great book.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Insurrection is a fun little film, little being it's problem. It's simply too short, and doesn't have an intriging story line at all. Although lighthearted and full of moments that are comedica and silly (largely thanks to Data) it just doesn't live up to what I expect from Star Trek. I do like this movie, but it's just no where near as good as other Str Trek films. Like most trek films of the past the odd number curse applies to this film. It's fun, but it's just not necissarily purchase material, though my copy of Insurrection is one of the first DVDs I bought, so it does have some sentimental value.... collecting dust.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I just finished watching the entire disc, including supplements! Its just fantastic. The presentation of the film is fabulous with a gorgeous transfer and a very sweet Dolby Digital 5.1 track! One of the best sound mixes Ive ever heard! The extras are exciting. The movie is just fantastic too, mixing action, suspense, and mysticism. Angelina is fabulous as always! She IS Lara Croft!
0783217048|5.0|Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo as drag queens!!  Now that's something to ponder.  This movie is hilarious!
6304696515|5.0|The story itself is superb. I've read the original book in both English and French, and seen the other film adaptations, but this one is IT. 18th century French aristocrats amuse themselves by playing power games, and the weapon of choice is sex. Glenn Glose, John Malkovich, Michelle Pfieffer, Swoozie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, and Keanu Reeves (believe it or not, those last two actually act in this movie) all do incredible work. The layers of intrique range from delicate to crude, but each is captivating. Mix exquisite acting and biting dialogue with sumptuous costumes and sets... you get this masterpiece. It improves with each subsequent viewing.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This album in not a dissapointment. If you hate j lo you'll love shakira.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This album is quite a departure from the usual McCartney fare.  It's content is light years away from the fluff and comercialism of Off the ground, and at times more brilliant than the best moments of Flaming Pie.  At first I was taken aback by the overall experimental feel of the album, but the more I listen, the more I like.  Particlar favorites so far include:  &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; &quot;Magic,&quot; the very Wings-like &quot;About you&quot;, and the very Beatle-like &quot;From a lover to a friend.&quot; The title track is the albums best rocker, and the addition of &quot;Freedom&quot; from the NYC concert is a nice bonus to an already fine album. Overall, one of the most creative McCartney albums to come out in quite some time. A must buy for Paul fans.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is absolutely incredible, and is appealing to everyone, whether they prefer jazz, blues, or just some exellent guitar.  This CD is also really good for any Dave Matthews Band lovers, because not only do they have similar voices, but his guitar playing is just as good, and if not superior to Dave.  I recommend this CD to everyone, and also check out some of this other songs like Victoria, Sucker, and Comfortable.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Why aren't their any new songs on this collection??? I was also disappointed in the butchering edits of the songs,  especially the \\"clean\\" version of  \\"Human Nature\\". I would've liked to have heard the \\"video version\\" of the song that included a door slam (...) and her saying \\"Absolutely No Regrets\\" at the end. The dance remix of \\"Don't Cry...\\" would've been preferrable. A nice surprise would've been the Calderone remix for \\"...a Girl\\" using the Spanish lyrics, as she did on the \\"Drowned World Tour\\". What stunned me the most is the glaring omission of \\"Rain\\", one of my personal favorites :( Also, it would've been nice to have these songs in chronological order because you can understand her evolution as an artist better that way.<br />But I didn't put this compilation together so who am I to say anything. So why the four stars you may ask. Well, despite it's short comings, it's still A GREAT COLLECTION OF SONGS and hearing them together like this you realize she's always been one step ahead of everyone else who might've been more popular in the 90s, but have since bit the dust (um, Boyz II Men, where are u guyz?) And the design with all of her incarnations layed out was a nice idea!<br />I Look forward to another decade of great and innovative \\"music\\"!
B00005R2M3|3.0|It took me awhile to get used to Shakira singing in English. But I have to say that it's overall a pretty good album. <br />A reviewer on Entertainment Weekly gave her a C-, stating something to the effect that we should not expect songs like &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and that she could not decide if she wanted to be Alanis Morissette or Shania Twain. This could be farther from the truth. It looks like the reviewer didn't do his homework. She's never been a pop singer a la Christina Aguilera; I've always thought she was a 'rockera', forming part of the Rock en Español crowd. I recommend he picking up her older albums.<br />The is basically a rock-pop album, with a few ballads and some songs in Spanish. Don't expect any dance tunes to tap your feet on the dance floor. I wish the lyrics were a bit more polished, but for someone who just learnt to speak English and insisted on writing the songs herself, not bad eh and because most of the song are good, this can be forgiven. Nevertheless, compared to &quot;Piez Descalzo&quot; or &quot;¿Donde Están Los Ladrones?&quot;, this would be, in my opinion, her lest best effort.<br />The best songs are &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot;, &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot;, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Rules&quot;. The worst one by far, is the translation of &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; (&quot;Ojos Asi&quot; in Spanish). I learnt long ago that translation is hard, especially between languages that are unrelated (if we spoke French or Italian in America, that would be a different story ... maybe). They could have left that song off of the CD; I wish I could erase it because it takes too much away from the Spanish version.<br />But as I said, a pretty good effort.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Of course this review will be the small voice of dissent in a sea of praise, but I'm writing for the few who will listen. Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as &quot;art&quot;. At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an &quot;artistic masterpiece&quot; so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: &quot;look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' &quot;. What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most &quot;beautiful scene in the whole movie&quot; - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.
B00003CXXI|4.0|When I first saw this movie at the theatre, I was laughing so hard I was crying. This movie was too funny. I then rented it at home, and it was still good. The only thing that I didn't like in the movie was the gross humor. I wouldn't recommend it for young children. Only teenagers and adults can truly enjoy this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend that you do. You will a least laught out loud once. I'm sure of it!!!!!<br />There needs to be another movie like Shrek. Somebody should take a fair tale and twist it around to make it funny.
B000001E7L|5.0|This album definately captures The Cranberries at their best.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes mainstream alternative with an acoustic flare.
B000002GF8|5.0|It's hard to believe, even over a decade later, that this was the last album from The Police.  Most bands release albums that build on each other, reach an artistic (not necessarily a commercial) peak, and then decline.  Not so this band.  They made it to their peak, and then that was it as far as new material.  This is an album no fan of '80s music should be without.  It's also one of those albums that makes me appreciate the CD format, because I long ago wore out my casette copy.  Luckily, I can listen to this CD for years to come and the sound will be just as awesome every time.  <br />The lion's share of the songwriting of this album was done by Sting, who is an absolute virtuoso in creating rhymes.  This is showcased on the first track, Synchronicity I.  It's the perfect choice to lead off the album.  It and its companion piece, Synchronicity II, form an interesting contrast.  SI is fairly light, and SII is extremely dark and disturbing.  Both songs, however, are masterpieces of lyrical composition.  SII draws a disturbing comparison between a harried corporate drone, doing a slow burn as he fights traffic on his way home after a mind-numbing workday, and a monster emerging from the shore of a certain &quot;dark Scottish lake&quot;.  <br />This album contains many of the songs that the Police are now remembered for, 15+ years after their last album, including the classics King of Pain and Wrapped Around Your Finger.  The most under-appreciated song in the album is the intruiging Tea in the Sahara, and Murder by Numbers is laugh-out-loud hilarious.  But the absolute best song on there (and maybe the best song produced by the Police ever) is Every Breath You Take.  I remember when this song first came out in 1983.  For several months, it had an iron grip on the Number 1 position on the charts.  What seems at first listen to be a beautiful love song is actually a sinister song about possesiveness and jealousy.  Only Sting can produce stuff like that.  <br />The two songs written by the rest of the band, Mother and Miss Gradenko, are both decent, but not as good as Sting's work.  Mother is interesting because of its annoying, grating melody.  But the thing is, it's SUPPOSED to annoy you, given the song's subject matter.  I didn't really appreciate this song when the album first came out, but now, as an adult out on my own, it takes on a whole new significance.<br />Overall, this is an excellent CD, especially the remastered version.  This is an album that no fan of 80s music should be without.  The Police were a stand-out act in an era full of excellent music.  Part of me wishes they were still together, especially given the high quality of Sting's solo work, and part of me is glad they chose to go out on top.

0767836324|2.0|Steven Spielberg is arguably the most talented and most succesful movie Director ever. I love most of his films to varying degrees. He is an incredible talent but I'm sorry I, like Siskel and Ebert before me (and many other people), just don't like this movie. It's not that it's awful, it's just not very good and generally forgettable I'm afraid to say. Okay it's got a stellar cast (Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, Julia Roberts and Bob Hoskins etc.) but it really fails to catch the imagination of either kids or adults (and even Spielberg reportedly conceded this).<br />You'd have to ask whether it was a good idea in the first instance to make Peter Pan an adult in what is essentially a kid's story in this unfortunate adaptation of the classic JM Barrie tale, that just doesn't work. What was wrong with the original story that they had to change it? if it aint broke then don't try to fix it is the old addage that Spielberg should have heeded but on top of this the film is even, dare I say it, technically ropey. I mean is it just me or do the movie sets look like movie sets and isn't the script amazingly poor by the great maestro's standards? The cast can't save it either, they're all fine but essentially wasted and is it any coincidence that this movie went 40 days over its 76 day shooting schedule, during a particularly turbulent time in Julia Roberts life (does anyone remember Kiefer Sutherland?). Don't get me wrong I'm not blaming Ms Roberts for the movies failure. It wasn't her fault and I greatly admire her work but it's symptomatic of a movie that just doen't work and it goes to show you that even the greatest occasionally get it all wrong...( and so there's hope for us mere mortals yet)!
0136879721|3.0|When I read this book 18 years ago or so it left a powerful impression. I still use the methods quite effectively, and at that time I often had a lot of success with them. However, recently buying and re-reading it, it seems to be quite a different book. There is a lot more biblical content, certain stories don't figure at all, and it just isn't as accessible or catchy. Was it really totally revised and when? WHY? And does anyone know where I can get an unrevised copy.... or is it my bad memory? There were some very inspirational angles I enjoyed, which are now lacking. This book does not seem to offer what the original did...
0061020710|5.0|I first saw a kid at my school reading &quot;Small Gods&quot;, a novel by the same author. I was intrigued by the title, and delved deeper. I picked up &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; along with &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot;. The first 20 or 30 pages of &quot;Magic&quot; are mildly difficult to understand, but overall the book was good. It featured the tourist Twoflower (you'll like him) and Rincewind(spell &quot;cynic&quot; for me). They are accompanied by the Luggage (sapient pearwood, sapient pearwood, sapient pearwood!) They also met a host of other characters, including DEATH (WHO ONLY SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Hrun the Barbarian (I outnumber you one to two!) and Luck (the Lady). If you liked &quot;Monty Python&quot;, anything by Adams, Wodehouse, Vonnegut, Hiaasen, Carrol, or Twain, or just humor in general, you'll love &quot;The Color of Magic&quot;. And remember, the greatest spell is the spell that turns a frog into a frog.
6305750750|2.0|No, I take it back...that would be an insult to the real &quot;Muppets in Space&quot;. I have no idea what George Lucas was thinking when he made this movie, but the result is an embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise. At least the DVD version is packed with some decent extras...hopefully the original Star Wars will be released on DVD in a similar package and in the process of putting it together Lucas will be reminded of what made Star Wars so popular in the first place.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|&quot;Love and Theft&quot; the latest CD from the man the myth the legend, Bob Dylan lives up to all that and more.  It takes time to get used to, it's new and different and it is not all Along the Watchtower.  It has a lounge feel in some parts and a rockin river blues feel on other tracks.  Listen with an open mind and you will never be disapointed in this album.
0767903854|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  If I hadn't of wanted to visit Australia before reading this book, I certainly would want to now!  Bill Bryson writes with a great mix of humor and history.  He made me laugh so hard sometimes that I would have to close the book and catch my breath.  I really enjoyed the small &quot;history lessons&quot; that were interspersed throughout the book.  Not so much a lesson as an insight on what it was that he was seeing or describing to you.  I look forward to reading more of his books and I also look even more forward to the trip I'm planning to take &quot;down under&quot;.  I highly recommend this book for anyone with even a slight interest in our Aussie neighbors.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!
6305508550|5.0|Very few people have seen the film in England and I keep having to lend my copy out to spread the word about this film.  I first saw it when I was working in NYC and I couldn't stop laughing.  I usually hate American comedies and I particularly hate Beavis and Butthead.  But this is funny from beginning to end.  Lumberg is the boss no-one wants to have, the waitress is the girl every man wants.  The comedy is very subtle and clever - the &quot;bobs&quot; are hysterical - I mean - who &quot;celebrates a guy's entire catalogue&quot;?  I think my favourite scene has to be the very beginning where Michael Bolton is listening to rap music and singing along with it when he spots a black guy SELLING FLOWERS walking towards him and he winds the window up and goes quiet.<BR>Or it could be any time Lumberg goes &quot;yeaahhh, Whats happenin?&quot;<BR>Please buy - its as essential as your Dilbert book in the toilet!
B00000K19E|5.0|Sounds great on DVD with surround sound, just like being there.  A must for ANYONE'S DVD collection.  Am anxiously awaiting the sequel.
B00004Z459|5.0|Loved it! Especially papercut and In the End. Why? cause I'm a rock and rap fan. I also like eminem.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul is experimenting, with great success, on this new recording. I very much like the musicians and the bluesy, almost jazz feeling throughout. This could be a Sting album, for the way that it sounds. Paul's bass has never sounded better, and it's the best playing that I've heard from him since Abbey Road.<br />I had a feeling that, sadly, Paul's music would improve with Linda's passing.<br />&quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; is not the best track, by far.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|As I went to watch this movie I had never played the Tomb Raider games so I never understood the mystique of Lara Croft.  After watching the movie now I have an understanding of why this charocter is so popular with gamers.  After watching the film I want to buy a PS2 and play all the Tomb Raider games.  I think Jolie was the perfect choice for Lara Croft, she was smart, witty and oh very sexy.  This movie is extremely fun to watch, granted the plot is not complicated but the movie will have you smiling in the end!
B00005QXXO|5.0|of course it's going to be good, it's radiohead.  anybody who buys a live album from a band is probably already a fan.. but by itself it is still a good cd.  the tracks are good selections i think, and ordered nicely.   <br />i would recommend this cd for the average fan with maybe one or two or thier cd's.  if you dont know their music already, this is a good cd, but if your looking for a radiohead cd, go buy the bends or something.  those of you who already have live recordings or their music, you'll probably find yourself i nthe same situation as i did, and end up buying the cd anyway -- trust me, it's not as big a waste of money as you think it is.  it is by no means an essential, but it is a damn good arrangement of well-recorded live material.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this film.  The relationship that Shrek and Donkey have is very nice, funny, heart warming relationship.  Eddie Murphy did such a good job as donkey, half the time I could not concentrate on the movie because I was laughing so hard at what Donkey did.  Myers also did a good job as a big mean oger, I liked the way he made a mean tone in his voice to scare off people.  The best part of this movie is the moral of the story:  Beauty comes from with in!
0345440757|5.0|My baby was labeled colicky. After reading this book and using the &quot;listening&quot; and &quot;observing&quot; techniques I realized that my baby did not have colic but was &quot;overtired&quot;. I now know what my baby wants by the cries or jestures that he makes. Life is so much easier for my baby and me! I would recommend this book to anyone with a baby. she also has charts to keep track of baby's activities as well as feeding, diaper changes, etc. This book has literally given me time to sleep again!! Thank you Tracy Hogg!
B00005QGAV|5.0|MJ, largely aided and abetted by New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley really produced a great album here!<br />Originally released in two LP package, the first half (written in main by Teddy Riley) is so funky it hurts.<br />&quot;Jam&quot; is a real stomper of a tune and is followed by my personal album favourite, &quot;Why You Wanna Trip On Me&quot;. This song although simple lyrically has such great vocal layering, Princely funk guitar and hard beats. It's very defiant, almost angry and dark as a large amount of this album proves to be.<br />This similar uptempo New Jack vibe continues through the great single &quot;In The Closet&quot; and &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;. <br />&quot;Remember The Time&quot; (A massive hit) is the most commercial of the upbeat material but is excellent with it and contains very addictive melodic refrains.<br />&quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; brings to a close the uniformly, superb, themed material before the vibe changes greatly...<br />&quot;Heal The World&quot; while too sickly for some is a well conceived anthemic ballad and sincere enough to merit musical acclaim (Unlike those it spawned: &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;Litle Suzie&quot; and some of the &quot;Invincible&quot; ballads such as &quot;Lost Children&quot; one could argue). Criticise if you will but back in 1991 it was done profficiently and is ultimately well intentioned.<br />&quot;Black &amp; White&quot; is another commercial (What else do you want from &quot;The King Of Pop&quot;?) song, which bar the embarassing Macaulay Culkin intro and throwaway rap is a groovy, addictive call for racial unity.<br />It then get's much darker with the brooding, dark &quot;Who Is It?&quot; and unoffical Dirty Diana Pt 2, &quot;Give In To Me&quot;. Both are excellent and it just goes to show what a master of all trades MJ at his peak can be.<br />&quot;Will You Be There&quot; is a real highlight. After an operatic intro the song segues into a rousing gospel number. MJ's pleading vocals are truly on top form here.<br />&quot;Keep The Faith&quot; goes to lift the dark mood with it's inspiring lyrics and mid tempo funk instrumentation on the chorus.<br />&quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is a peaceful little tune with string accompaniment. It's good enough but is arguably amongst the weakest on the LP and perhaps the album as a whole whould have benefited from a shorter length (It's 77 minutes long!) with this track edited off for B-Side duties.<br />The final joint &quot;Dangerous&quot; takes us back to the opening New Jack Swing material and is equally as consistent as the other Teddy Riley songs. A worthy title track and great way to close out the album.<br />&quot;Dangerous&quot; (The album) proved an exciting evolution for Michael. Teddy Riley really laced him with top class material here and broke him into the 90s with ease. The album is universally superb with few (if any) weak moments and this over 14 tracks and 77 minutes! It ranks comfortably alongside his previous three legendary Epic albums and that says a lot.<br />This new re-mastered format can only add to the experience when the original CD album sounds great anyway.
B00004XQ83|5.0|this is THE movie soundtrack of the new millenium. though i could not normally stand the type of music on this cd, they picked the best songs from the genre, and made it so that essentially anyone can own and love it.
B0000026WD|5.0|MJ, largely aided and abetted by New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley really produced a great album here!<br />Originally released in two LP package, the first half (written in main by Teddy Riley) is so funky it hurts.<br />&quot;Jam&quot; is a real stomper of a tune and is followed by my personal album favourite, &quot;Why You Wanna Trip On Me&quot;. This song although simple lyrically has such great vocal layering, Princely funk guitar and hard beats. It's very defiant, almost angry and dark as a large amount of this album proves to be.<br />This similar uptempo New Jack vibe continues through the great single &quot;In The Closet&quot; and &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;. <br />&quot;Remember The Time&quot; (A massive hit) is the most commercial of the upbeat material but is excellent with it and contains very addictive melodic refrains.<br />&quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; brings to a close the uniformly superb themed material before the vibe changes greatly...<br />&quot;Heal The World&quot; while too sickly for some is a well conceived anthemic ballad and sincere enough to merit musical acclaim (Unlike those it spawned: &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;Litle Suzie&quot; and some of the &quot;Invincible&quot; ballads such as &quot;Lost Children&quot; one could argue). Criticise if you will but back in 1991 it was done profficiently and is ultimately well intentioned.<br />&quot;Black &amp; White&quot; is another commercial (What else do you want from &quot;The King Of Pop&quot;?) song, which bar the embarassing Macaulay Culkin intro and throwaway rap is a groovy, addictive call for racial unity.<br />It then get's much darker with the brooding, dark &quot;Who Is It?&quot; and unoffical Dirty Diana Pt 2, &quot;Give In To Me&quot;. Both are excellent and it just goes to show what a master of all trades MJ at his peak can be.<br />&quot;Will You Be There&quot; is a real highlight. After an operatic intro the song segues into a rousing gospel number. MJ's pleading vocalsare truly on top form here.<br />&quot;Keep The Faith&quot; goes to lift the dark mood with it's inspiring lyrics and mid tempo funk instrumentation on the chorus.<br />&quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is a peaceful little tune with string accompaniment. It's good enough but is arguably amongst the weakest on the LP and perhaps the album as a whole whould have benefited from a shorter length (It's 77 minutes long!) with this track edited off for B-Side duties.<br />The final joint &quot;Dangerous&quot; takes us back to the opening New Jack Swing material and is equally as consistent as the other Teddy Riley songs. A worthy title track and great way to close out the album.<br />&quot;Dangerous&quot; (The album) proved an exciting evolution for Michael. Teddy Riley really laced him with top class material here and broke him into the 90s with ease. The album is universally superb with few (if any) weak moments and this over 14 tracks and 77 minutes! It ranks comfortably alongside his previous three legendary Epic albums and that says a lot.
B00005QATY|4.0|in general, this is an all-around fun movie to watch, with a fantastic plot, and great acting and music. in fact, the music essentialy makes this movie, so i suggest you find yourself the cd as well..
B00003CXCT|4.0|Now these are good movies.  I barely remember when I was 6 or 7 or what not and saw Star Wars in the theater.  It wasn't until high school that I became really interested in it.  Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi had a lot of continuity with Star Wars. Besides, Han's Falcon is really cool!  These movies had Lots of adventure and sci-fi as well as some fantasy, but who says it's fantasy, there is a science to the \\"Force\\" it's a energy eminating throughout the Universe and I quote \\"If there's a bright center to the Universe then this is the place it's farthest from.\\" Quoting Luke Skywalker referring to what he did not know at the time. true Wisdom is what you do not know but know anyway.  I already have the tapes on Original and 'Special' edition.  I usually watch the originals and won't be buying this new release.  However these are good movies.  Not because they have the name 'Star Wars' stamped on the cover but because they are good, plain and simple.  Phantom Menace also has 'Star Wars' stamped on the cover/movie poster but was a terrible movie.<BR>Clone Wars is coming out soon and I'm not to gung ho about it either, but I will watch it once(...), if I like it, I'll buy the DVD, if not, I won't. that simple. When this comes out as the Original version, I'll buy this DVD simply because DVD's last 100,000 years and tapes last a mere 5.
0671027344|4.0|If I didn't know this was a work of fiction, I would swear that these really were the letters of a teenage boy written to a far away friend. Chbosky has truly captured the voice of a teenager in this book and tells of all the emotions, experiences, trials and tribulations of oneyear of growing up. Charlie may be a bit over sensitive and his high school experiences may vary from those of your average American teenager, but this book shows that not all kids fit into the same mold. While the book spans one full year it seems like a small snapshot into Charlie's world and development. This is one I would not mind having a sequel to read.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As soon as Nicole Kidman starts belting out Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend [she actually sings quite good!], you know she deserves at least an oscar nomination ! If better, the actual award itself! With her performance in The Others aswell as this great movie, she leaves all those visions of Mrs Tom Cruise far behind her. Her career will not rot away like another certain divorce [namely Bruce and....well Demi Moore].<br />A naive poet named Christian [EWAN MCGREGOR] arrives in the town of Montmartre in 1899 to become part of the Bohemian Revolution! He accidently takes part in a modern play called Spectacular Spectacular which just happens to be involved with a certain  Toulouse Lautrec [A delightfully campy John Leguizamo].Impressed by his performance, Toulouse and co. take him to the Moulin Rouge to 'audition' for a beautiful courtesan named Satine [our Nicole]. She mistakes him for a slightly gay 'Duke' [Richard Roxburgh] and they instantly fall in love admist flashy can-can courtesans and under the watchful eye of Harold Zidler [Jim Broadbent]. But their love cannot last forever so will they face up to reality or keep their love alive till SHOWTIME....<br />If I had to be picky, I would say that Moulin Rouge was a tad overlong and it had too many characters that just weren't interesting enough....Harold Zidler and The Duke being two. Yet who REALLY can pick out faults in such a beautiful movie?? The set designs and all [yes ALL] the songs were near perfect. Miss Nicole Kidman will be around for VERY long time... I GUARANTEE YOU THAT!<br />5 OUT OF 5
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira's first attempt at an English language record, &quot;Laundry Service,&quot; succeeds in still being Shakira, only in English. Her English may sound a little off and &quot;Rules,&quot; &quot;The One,&quot; and &quot;Ready For the Good Times&quot; may throw off the album's streak of good songs, but &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is worth a listen, if your a fan or just curious.
B0000024Z7|5.0|Jazz ideas had already been creeping into Santana's music on tracks like &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; and &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot;, but Caravanserai boldly moved deep into jazz-rock territory.  The upbeat and catchy Latin rock of the band's first 3 albums was replaced by a more meditative, abstract and instrumentally-focused style influenced by Miles Davis's early electric bands and Chick Corea's Return to Forever.<br />  Most of the band's original members are still here (Gregg Rolie, Mike Shrieve, Chepito Areas) but their roles have changed dramatically.  Mike Shrieve suddenly steps up in the compositional department and his drumming really improves.  Check out his Elvin Jones-isms on &quot;Waves Within&quot;.  Gregg Rolie sticks to keyboards (lots of electric piano) and the remaining vocals are pleasantly inconsequential.  Guests make a big difference -- Tom Rutley's acoustic bass is a nice touch on many of the tunes, and future keyboardist Tom Coster makes his first appearance on a Santana album.  Carlos and Neil Schon play off each other really well.  The tunes range all over the map, from the epic &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot; (the guitar riff that ends the intro is awesome) to serious funk (&quot;Look Up&quot;) to percussion duets (&quot;Future Primitive&quot;).<br />  The influence of Latin music is still here in a big way with the gentle Jobim cover &quot;Stone Flower&quot; and the grooving instrumental &quot;La Fuente del Ritmo&quot;, but people expecting the Classic Santana will be disappointed.  Nevertheless this is one of Santana's best albums, right up there with Abraxas; whereas their later jazz-rock efforts were often mixed bags, it works here in a big way.

B00005A46T|1.0|Well well well.  I'm writing a review without actually having listened to both albums entirely through, but I see nothing about Slipknot to justify all the hype.  They're Slayer in funny masks minus thoughtful lyrics.  Not that Tom Araya is Hemingway or anything, but at least he attempts to be witty.  <BR>Maybe I'm just getting too old for this stuff, but the innovation of Slipknot is nothing musical.  It's pure image.  Maybe someday the Maggots will grow up and listen to something a bit more diverse.  I've always liked the hard stuff, but one must be able to make a differentiation between a good metal/hardcore band and one that's just ugly and loud.  Sure, it frightens and pisses off the parents, but look what happened to Marilyn Manson(or what didn't happen to MM); the guy's almost mainstream now(didn't I hear a cover of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; on the radio yesterday?).  I guess this stuff is for the midwestern kids who have no city to go to to see a real hardcore band.  Go to NY, DC, LA, Cleveland, Baltimore and check out Next Step Up, Integrity, Darkside, Clutch, or at least visit Victory Records.  Just as hard(or even harder) as Slipknot or anyone else, but with an actual social agenda instead of vomit and feces.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Great work from this gifted singer and composer who has grabbed on to the star quality and genuine material of her Spanish albums. I loved &quot;Wherever, Whenever&quot; and &quot;The One&quot;. Pop rock, latin and other rhythms (even Tango in one the songs)converge in this amazing piece of work. Diverse, fun, inspiring; you'll love it!
0671027379|5.0|Playing with a range of sciences the same way he played with art history and religion in &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, Dan Brown has created another fast-paced thriller.  What makes Brown's books stand out is their intellectual content; they are thrillers for the thinking man or woman, as distinct from the more formulaic writing of Tom Clancy, for example.  Brown is a fiction writer who makes the reader think; as the plot twists and turns, as the protagonists struggle with information, the reader is swept along with the flow.  Another exciting, involving, read, hard to put down.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I kind of stummbled on to The Strokes.  So, I didn't know about all the hype surrounding them until after I started listening to the music.  The music, that's what's important, and this band carries through.  While it's not a deep and sonically diverse album, it achieves brilliance through its attitude.<br /><br /> There's a quiet confidence in the songwriting that gives me hope that this band could really be on to something.  In the meantime they have really good songs that are just flat out catchy.  Do not buy this record hoping for a rock n roll saviour.  If you're one of those people, you'll miss it when it comes.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This great album encompasses almost all of her biggest hits of the last nine years. <BR>First of all, I must say I was slightly shocked at the unusual cover, with no big flashy letters telling the world whose album <BR>this is. Then I noticed the title was printed in her eye! The gorgeous booklet is also fab... anyway, on to the album.<BR>It was eleven years ago today that Madonna released her first hits album, the ten-million plus selling &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;. Though &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; is a must-have, &quot;GHV2&quot; not only covers a longer time span but what's more shows her even more dramatic evolution as an artist in the 90s more than the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; showed her artistic evolution in the 80s. From her ultra controversial &quot;Erotica&quot; to the grown-up &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; and on to the simplicity of &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna's career has gone full circle and it isn't more apparent than on this album.
B00005QXXO|5.0|first of all, let's establish that radiohead is god. they produce the greatest music to ever grace the human race's sweet ears. this cd proves it even more. the wonderful rythym of idioteque live before a singing audience. the beautiful guitar sounds of true love waits, and the magnificent piano of like spinning plates are all orgasmic. that's all
B000002AS1|5.0|I don't know what it is about Alan Silvestri, but his scores have the ability to stir up emotions in me that no other artist can do.  Some of my favorite soundtracks of all time are works that he has done - the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, &quot;Cast Away&quot; and the &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; movies.  &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; for all intents and purposes, is some of his best work ever.<br />None of the songs are very long (the entire CD is not much longer than a half-hour), but that doesn't mean they aren't beautiful.  A lot of tracks on the CD are these meek little songs that act like they are afraid to bloom.  Others are full of life, overflowing with vibrancy.  Both represent the character of Forrest, as well as the events and people in his life, extremely well.<br />About the only gripe I have with the CD (and it is a minor gripe) is that you pretty much have to turn the volume all the way up on your CD player or stereo to hear the music.  Whoever recorded these CDs did so very poorly, and anyone who has this CD is well aware of this problem.  Other than that, however, there are no detractions from the overall quality of Mr. Silvestri's music.<br />The score for &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a classic, as the main theme is practically known the world over.  If you are one of the few people who has never listened to this CD, I guarantee you that you will not regret picking up a copy.<br />This is Alan Silvestri at his best, folks; he doesn't get much better that this.
B000001ESN|4.0|Permanent Waves was a commercial breakthrough for Rush. I remember when they released Hemispheres (a much better album though)they were half filling the local hockey arena as a headliner. With Permanent Waves they sold out a larger venue in DC,bypassing Baltimore until Power Windows. This record sold, made radio without too much musical compromise, and is still one of their most progressive albums from their golden era (Hemispheres through Moving Pictures).&quot;Natural Science&quot; is my favorite cut and maybe the most underrated song in their catalogue.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira has been around for awhile, and I am glad the US is getting to finally see her and hear her.  I bought this CD about an hour and  a half ago, and already love it.  The songs have a rythm that is intoxicating, even the slow ones.  Her voice is powerful and sounds incredible!  Shakira wrote ALL the songs on this CD, and she also produced ALL of it!  Talented, Charismatic, Beautiful, she has it all.  There are only 3 songs in spanish, one which is  a remake of her single &quot;Whenever,Wherever&quot;  She also remade her hit &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; in english (Eyes Like Yours).  Her songs do not lose any meaning in their translation, and her sound is just as good in english than in spanish.  My faves are #2,3,5,10,11,12.  This CD is a must have for Shakira lovers and for anyone who wants to check out a woman who has incredible talent, and will be around for a long, long, time.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Having seen Radiohead last summer in Chicago, I knew they were awesome live, one of the few bands who can bring studio brilliance to the stage, and I had high hopes when I heard a live cd was being released.<br />What is on the cd is great, but I docked it a star for the compact length of the album, only 8 songs.  They could have EASILY added another 3-4 songs from Kid A/Amnesiac that were mesmerizing live, namely You and Whose Army, Pyramid Song, Packt Like Sardines, or How To Disappear Completely.  The only reason I can think of that they kept it this short is that they will release a dvd next year of an entire show, and they didn't want to let too much out of the bag at this point.<br />What is on the album is excellent though:<br />1. National Anthem:  this song truly transcends the studio version.  Colin Greenwood rules on the bass, providing the twangy foundation for the song, and the keyboard and echo effects make one wonder if they are listening to Dark Side of the Moon.  Thom is his usual great self.<br />2. I Might Be Wrong: the song on the album that most closely matches the studio version, though there is some cool jamming at the end of it.<br />3. Morning Bell: this performance of the song is based on the Kid A version. The song starts out slow and erupts with emotion about 2 minutes in.<br />4. Like Spinning Plates:  Most people will buy this album for two songs, this one and True Love Waits.  I am not a big fan of LSP on Amnesiac, but this song is SO GOOD live.  The piano brings a tenderness to the song, and Thom's voice bleeds with melancholy.  Truly amazing.<br />5. Idioteque:  an interesting change in tempo, following the slow and somber LSP.  The song starts out powerfully with Phil's drumming, along with Ed and Jonny's electronic whirly sounds, and it has an edgier sound than on studio version.  Thom continues his brilliance on vocals.<br />6. Everything In Its Right Place:  another song that has a more atmospheric, dreamy sound live than the studio version. At the end of the song Thom makes things interesting by kicking in the voice modulation/echo effects.<br />7. Dollars and Cents: The rhythm section, Phil and Colin, impress again with the beats.  Another song I am not too crazy about on Amnesiac that comes alive onstage and has some great improvisations.<br />8. True Love Waits:  glad to finally have this on an album.  It is a fitting end, and the highlight, of this live album.  Coincidentally, it is also the most simple, just Thom's captivating voice and an acoustic guitar.  This song really shows the true versatility Radiohead have.  They can move from psychadelic, cutting-edge electronic songs to guitar-based anthems to stripped-down acoustic affairs, and blow us away equally with all of these approaches.<br />This album would have been better with 3 more songs, and way better if they just had released one single concert they thought was particularly good, but at least we finally got a live album out of them.  Get this and enjoy what doesn't come around often enough in the U.S.: live Radiohead.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Alright ... just gave a listen to &quot;Driving Rain&quot; on little computer speakers .... nothing too offensive or annoying on it.  Song called &quot;About You&quot; rocks, and &quot;Magic&quot; may very well be a single.  Near end, the track &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is very nice, too.<BR> <BR>Amazing track is the next to last one called &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot;; it's a 10 minute + jam of a track that may very well be the most raucous thing Paul has done since, dare I say it, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.<BR> <BR>The whole record seems to be a full outpouring of all of Paul's works over the past few years, rather unedited and unabashed -- he can release and express whatever he wants.  It also is extremely personal-sounding, with very direct lyrics, much in Lennon's vein of singing clearly about himself and his own experiences.<BR> <BR>It is topped off by the added live &quot;Freedom&quot; track.<BR> <BR>All in all, pretty good for a 58 year old rock legend.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Man's &quot;soul&quot; is the sum of his collective experiences.<br />Man is, by nature, amoral.<br />Man's existence is made bearable only by his own invention.<br />If Memento doesn't sweep the Oscars next March, the Academy should be disbanded.
B000001ESF|3.0|Rush made some of their coolest epic music on Caress Of Steel, a record that they nearly lost their contract over. 2112 had to be more produced and marketable or the band would have probably folded. Yes the production is turned up more than a notch here,but the music is far more basic rock with a lot of sound effects replacing actual challenging playing on most of the side long title epic,which is probably their most overrated piece,though in junior high I was impressed,as an adult it seems a little pedestrian. Side two is full of filler and throwaways. &quot;Passage To Bangkok&quot; is the dumbest and only drug related song that Rush ever did,guaranteed to please the High Times and Beavis and Butthead crowd.&quot;Tears&quot; was a nice gentle ballad,a rare thing for this group.&quot;Something For Nothing&quot; is probably the best overall track of this bunch, and a little closer to the superior Fly By Night material.&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;is the most obvious filler trash.The band didn't really make the full transition to prog rock until Hemispheres,which is their best record.
B00005OM4N|2.0|She's not the best singer in the world. Actually she really can't sing. In her latest cd her singing has gone downhill. Most of the time you can hear her trying to sing as if she could but can't. The beats are good, but most of the beats are the same for the most part. Since this is her first cd where she wrote the songs, don't be suprised if they aren't as good as her previous singles. I say it's just one of those 3rd releases that aren't worthy to be released.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is my second favorite movie.  I could talk forever about how great this movie is or about all the &quot;things&quot; that one is supposed to &quot;get&quot; from watching &quot;American Beauty,&quot; but I won't.  <br />For those of you who have not seen &quot;American Beauty&quot; I say only that the movie tells a story (albeit one that many people don't want to see, or perhaps be confronted by) and tells the story truthfully and beautifully.  Whether or not one wants to see a 40-something year-old man obsess over a teenage girl (or any of the other stories and circumstances in the movie) is not important.  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is one of the few movies brave enough to expose many of the follies and inhumanities of individuals without wavering; but it also presents the beauty and humanity that lies within every individual (even in Colonel Fitts...watch very closely).<br />To sum things up, &quot;American Beauty&quot; challenges the viewer and makes him think about his or her own life in new ways and about the war between humanity and inhumanity.  And if the viewer learns &quot;something&quot; after viewing &quot;American Beauty,&quot; then the movie has completed its mission.  Some of you may have to meet &quot;American Beauty&quot; halfway...and that's ok.  I promise that watching this movie is a fulfilling experience.  If you can just give it a chance, then you're giving yourself the chance to become a better person.
B00005Q66T|3.0|This is a great compilation of Madonna hits but where are the new songs...The thing that made the Immaculate Collection was the new stuff...I would have even preferred some remixing at least but most of these songs are radio edits...which means they are shorter than the original version...not a must have for a Madonna fan/collector but a must for the new/casual fan. The highlight is the radio edit of Beautiful Stranger...
B00000255F|5.0|This is an album that can surely hold its own with any released over the past half-century, ever since rock-n-roll was in its infancy.  Everything about it seems to have been said in other reviews, so I'll make this brief.<br />There is barely a weak moment on this album, and any perceieved weakness is only in comparison to the rest of the songs on the album.  The best songs on the album (Jungleland, Thunder Road, and the title track) are timeless classics (to use a tired cliche) that will be listened to for years to come, and even the weaker ones would be amongst the highlights of a lesser album.<br />Not much else really needs to be said about this album; if you have even the slightest interest in classic rock, or rock music in general, this is a must have album...
B000002IWQ|3.0|This one's closer to a four,though not quite in the league with their earlier albums that I would rate in that range (Permanent Waves,Moving Pictures,Fly By Night),but definitely their best post Signals work. Music changed in the 90's and Rush followed. Gone are the big 80's synth sounds,a trend that started with Presto and Roll The Bones,however those albums were marred by the weakest material in their history.Counterparts is guitar driven and ballsy,something that Rush had not been for a long time. Definitely influenced by grunge;check out the Soundgardenesque &quot;Stick It Out&quot;. Geddy Lee's vocals are also his best in years.Overall the material is not as formulaic as a lot of their later material tends to be.In short they sound like a band again on this record,which is an improvement.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This is a great movie to watch,i have to give credit to all the people behind this film, especially since every charachter was done by a different artist to give it powerfull flavor. I think the film is getting known by word of mouth so hopefully it will come out on dvd so i can view some special features on it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I was standing at a Wherehouse listening station examining the cover of the now McCartney album wondering what it contained... I remember doing the same thing to &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; four years ago, in the samme building, although then it was a Blockbuster Music... The album had impressed me, and I felt it was a good solid Pop album, a very good one, but nothing more.<br />Anyway, so I pop in &quot;Driving Rain&quot; and decide to give it a spin.<br />Wow.<br />Paul takes us on a journey... down a lonely road, to a classroom, into &quot;outta&quot; space, across broken ice... many places, and he encompasses a bizzare and impressive mix of musical styles along the way. Yes, we do get the silly Paul love songs, many of which are more impressive then usual, some to note would be &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;Your Way&quot;... Though, at the same time we get some interesting electronic noise in tracks like &quot;She's given up talking&quot;... We also get a listen to some really fun, rocky tunes... Lonely Road and Driving Rain are both playful and at the same time serious and contemplative... at the end, both will have you slapping along on your kneww or steering wheel or whatever...<br />Personally... I feel there are a few special Gems on this record to look out for... &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; is the single off of the album, and a very nice love song at that, in which Paul is obviously exploring the events of his life over the past few years, very Impressive.  The above mentioned &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot;, which is a mostly instrumental love song which kind of reminds one of the Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper Days.<br />Now are my two favorite tracks on the album... &quot;Rinse the Rain&quot; is a 10-minute hard rock JAM that closes the normal portion of the album... AMAZING... indescribable... I remember sitting in the Wherehouse (this was only this morning) with chills running all up and down my back as a listened to Paul and an awesome four-peice band deliver amazing instrumentals withg the man himself delivering a VERY impressive vocal delivery of some awesome, although short lyrics.<br />The last track is a bonus track taken from the all-star benefit concert last october at RFK stadium.  &quot;Freedom&quot; was written by Paul shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is a beautiful way to end the album, and features a shockingly good delivery by McCartney...<br />The entire album is lovely... highly highly recommended, and should give Dylan a run for his money when the Grammys come up.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Shakira's music, which was, previously, all in Spanish.  I have always been impressed with her strong voice and lyrics that were generally not in the mold of the inane and overproduced Latin female pop singers.  On her new album, &quot;Laundry Service,&quot; she deserves credit for trying to write her own lyrics in English, and also for producing the album.  Unfortunately, the songs reflect her relative inexperience with the language and, consequently, lack sophistication.  She is all over the map stylistically (although, come to think of it, her albums in Espanol are kind of the same way), but this is a difficult way to introduce her to the English speaking world. With her (bottle) blond mass of hair and sexy clothes, I'm starting to think she now wants to be Britney Spears instead of the singer-songwriters she says she admires. <br />&quot;Wherever, Whenever&quot; is quite good and probably the first single; &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; isn't bad, neither is &quot;Fool&quot;, but of the rest of the album I truly prefer to hear her songs in Spanish.  I was disappointed that Gloria Estefan's translation of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; (On this album, &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;) loses the magic of the original.<br />I hope Shakira keeps trying because I think she has true star and crossover potential, but it wouldn't hurt for her to collaborate with someone who understands her artistic sensibilities, but can help her craft more meaningful lyrics in English (Brian Eno, Glen Ballard, are you listening?).
B000002O5L|5.0|I'm not sure I go so far as to say this is the best album of Tom Petty's stellar career, but it is very close.  The only one that can make a serious case for being better is Damn the Torpedos, which I do give the nod to, although many of his albums are very good.<br />This album, produced by longtime Petty friend Jeff Lynne, is made of largely lighter stuff than the majority of his work.  Despite the fact that is often viewed as his most commerical album, any limited pop sensibilities is has are more than balanced out by the deceptively meaningful lyrics.  <br />This album also marks Petty's first solo effort after a long stint with the Heartbreake (although all of them make at least one appearance on the album).  <br />Full Moon Fever album opens with probably Petty's best song in Free Fallin'.  It is a largely acoustic coming of age anthem that is among the most beautiful songs he has recorded.  It doesn't miss a beat from there as it heads into the best rocker on the album. &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; is another one of Petty's strongest songs and fits the upbeat tempo of the album perfectly.<br />There is nary a weak moment on the album, although some people argue that it does lose momentum as it nears the end with such tracks as &quot;The Apartment Song&quot; and &quot;Zombie Zoo&quot; (both of which actually number among my favorites).  <br />If you are looking for some of the harder-edged material Petty did earlier in his career, look elsewhere since this album is definitely the most polished and produced album of his career.  Full Moon Fever provides an interesting contrast with the more somber music he would record later in the decade, as well as with the rawer music from earlier in his career.<br />This album is worth a look, and probably more..
B00005Q66T|4.0|As everyone knows, Madonna is one of the world's most celebrated divas. No, make that THE most celebrated diva. This second compilation disc proves that fact very much so. Yet, I can't help but notice that some of my favourite Madonna recordings are not on this disc. And they are not just any old recordings. These songs, 'I'll Remember, 'You'll See,' 'This use to be my Playground,' and 'American Pie,' are substantial hits by many standards. In place of these are tracks like 'Erotica' and 'Bedtime Story,' which, I think, are less stellar than the 4 songs just mentioned above. And not just less stellar, but also less successful are far as radio play and sales are concerned. Thank god though that favourites like 'Ray of Light,' 'Music,' and 'Secret' made it on to the album. Overall, this album is worthy of the Queen of Pop.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Animated or not, this movie is a scream!!!  My three year old daughter loves it, as do my wife and I.  There are dramatic moments, humor galore, and a great story.  The voices of Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers are stellar.  After the movie is over, DO NOT shut it off.  After the credits comes one of the greatest surprises.  I won't say anymore, but prepare to laugh!!  Dreamworks scores a great hit with Shrek!  Five animated stars!!!!!
B00005LOUS|3.0|Ron Howard's The Grinch brings Dr. Seuss' classic tale to live action life. Maybe it would've been better if it just stayed animated. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun, visually dazzling film, but it's just so busy!. Jim Carrey was the one and only choice to play The Grinch. There is no one else who could've brought him to life. He is fabulous in the role. Everybody is pretty much aware of The Grinch's story by now. What this film delivers is a little bigger insight into our furry green grouch's life. Who he is, how he came to Whoville, and his childhood. It was a nice touch. Now, onto the bad points. There are moments in this film that might seem a little scary for some little kids. I've had friends who have kids tell me their kids were afraid. So, be warned. The other bad point is that the film is just all over the place!. It has so many things going on with so many visuals crammed into every single frame. This film is an overstuffed stocking just waiting to explode!. But, still, the movie is high on the entertainment factor. Jeffrey Tambor, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski co-star. Anthony Hopkins narrates the film too. This might not become an annual classic to be watched like the animated Grinch, but it still has it's own, zany fun.
B00003CXMG|5.0|~This has got to be The BEST film I have senn in all time. Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, literally shines in every scene.<br />Set in San Diego in the early 1970s, Almost Famous subtly introduces the element of rock'n'roll music as a venue for freedom. Finding moral support in the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel, 18-year-old Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels against her conservative mother Elaine (Frances McDormand). Deciding to leave home, she urges her younger brother William to let himself be influenced~~ by the music of the era. Over the years, William (Patrick Fugit) develops an interest and befriends legendary music critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman: Flawless, Magnolia, The Talented Mr. Ripley), who asks him to cover a Black Sabbath concert for \\"Creem\\" magazine. His article earns the mature-sounding 15-year-old an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to join the more accessible \\"Stillwater\\" band and interview lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and lead singer~~ Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) during their \\"Almost Famous\\" concert tour. Postponing his obligations at school and at home, William develops emotional ties with the band and with the coquettish groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers the contradictions of being a subjective journalist.<br />Almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor. This is explored within the arena of William's responsibilities toward his~~ editor (who thinks the writer he has hired over the phone is much older) and his mother (who wishes her boy is mature enough to resist peer pressure and drugs, but young enough to obey her). Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film. Still, rather than interrupt the boy's tour/trip with the band, the~~ editor/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty. The comedy rises from William's efforts to be seen as a free adult --a status the band members claim to have reached-- while he struggles with his evident inexperience. Never quite reaching a dramatic point, Almost Famous maintains a comfortable level of seriousness as it explores the main character's doubts and decisions in relation to his role as \\"The Enemy\\", or the critic who \\"writes what he sees.\\"~~ Not letting his perceptions be influenced by the illusion of friendship, nor letting them deny the validity of his subjective reality, the protagonist finds freedom in those attempts that \\"almost\\" fail or \\"almost succeed\\". In this sense, Almost Famous finds a temperate --almost happy-- middle ground in its treatment of such commonly temperamental issues as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.~/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty.

B00005QXXO|4.0|Nothing that Radiohead seem to do is misconceived, but it's impossible for every single record to be as life-changing as &quot;OK Computer&quot; or &quot;Kid A&quot;. And this isn't -- it's a pieced-together live set of eight songs. But it is also a fine general representation of the earth-shaking show I saw in Chicago in 2001 (though the actual recordings were taken from European shows).<br />It has moments, surely. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; sheds some of the electronic inaccessibility of its studio version to display a beautiful framework; &quot;True Loves Waits&quot; is simple and wonderful and never again to be the very rare and desirable oddity known only to the devoted; the swelling cacophony of &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; is, to my mind, one of the great rock concert moments of this year. <br />Truly, the reinvention of the &quot;Kid A/Amnesiac&quot; songs that was required to play them outside a studio is enthralling to listen to. While perhaps not essential to the casual fan, the devotee will we well rewarded.
B00003CWL6|2.0|This movie was good but it rip off one of the best movies of the 90'es a film called Happiness. A brillent protray of the dark side of Suburbia. I will admit American Beauty had better photography but thats about it there are so many things the same with both movies. The only two difference is Happiness came out a year earler (thats why its riping it off) and Happiness is way more contreversail and is for adults only before you watch American Beauty watch Happiness than you decide.
B000002UTY|5.0|Less of an artifact of psych/rock 60s days than a many &quot;so-called&quot; classics, this record is the real deal, full of powerful and intelligent performances. Its symphonic quality is unlike anything heard today--and hardly heard then. Almost forgotten today, Happy Trails is a true classic rock record that works on several levels all at once. Plus, as an extra hip bonus, it was THE record constantly played at Apple Records according to Apple &quot;house hippie&quot; Richard DiLelo. Buy it.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna's Greatest Hits Volume 2 is a nice collection of her best hits of the 1990's. This CD, however, isn't as essential as the first volume. There are a few songs on here that were not hits at all. \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Bedtime Story\\", \\"Drowned World\\", were not hits. There are also a few glaring omissions from this collection as well. \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", and \\"You'll See\\". All of those would've been much better to of included than the three that weren't even hits. Besides that, you get a first rate collection of her best 90's hits. \\"Secret\\", \\"Take A Bow\\", the great 60's-ish Austin Powers song \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", and more. Her three recent big hits \\"Music\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\", and the song with the controversial video,\\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\". Thankfully, her rendition of Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\" is absent. Breath a sigh of relief. Madonna is a one woman powerhouse. She's undeniably talented and smart. She's released the best collection of hit songs from a female artist over the last 20 years or so. Her singing voice wasn't great when she first started. It was a little like Britney's. Over the years, it's been tuned into a great voice. This is smart pop. It might not seem like it on some of her songs, but it is. It's intelligent with great melodies and clever lyrics. Nobody can touch Madonna. Don't even try. You are much better off with Volume 1 than this. But it is a nice continuation piece. It's good that Madonna is stil around to show people how it's done. Long may she reign. I wonder what she'll come up with next?.

0790729687|5.0|Neil Jordens vampire epic is brillent since Anne Rice did the screenplay you are geting it the way anne rice wants you to just like her book. This film is so good its not just a vampire flick its a very well made movie with a good story, brillent photography, and great acting. Watch it you will fall in love with it just like I did.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am so proud of Britney on this CD. It shows her true talent as an artist and now songwriter. It sounds so much different than all her other CDs. I especially love, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. All these songs are unique and say something about Britney. Buy this CD. You won't regret it.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney's third album is definitley her best. While her voice is still in dire need of improvement, that doesn't stop the album from showing maturity on Britney's side. &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; is catchy, but hardly a memorable Britney song. &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; is very pretty. It's the big ballad she's always wanted. Her cover version of Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock And Roll&quot; is questionable. Might want to skip that one. All in all, this is the right direction Britney needs to go in. The negative reviews with one star on this page are obviously based on personal feelings towards this music. From the sound of it, I seriously doubt those reviewers even heard the album. If you read the positive reviews, you know your reading a review from a true fan who is going to tell it like it is. That's the reviews to go with.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Although it's been a long time in coming, Epsiode I has finally made it onto DVD and we can only hope that originial triology will follow soon.<br />The quality (sound, picture, etc) is simply amazing.  It makes the experience of watching such a fine film even more enjoyable.<br />If you haven't had the chance, watch the DVD on a complete surround sound system and see if you can hear the difference.  Its quite spectacular.<br />Anyone who has anything truly negative to say about this film isn't a true Star Wars fan, and probably wouldn't be bothered to buy the VHS in the first place.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Who else could produce such a solid Greatest Hits collection?! No one. Madonna has spent the past 18 years entertaining the masses.  In 1991 she released The Immaculate Collection containing her greatest hits from the beginning of her career. At that time no one could have imagined that the &quot;Material Girl's&quot; greatest material was yet to come.  The music contained on this album is more artistic and profound than anything from the early years. No song should be skipped because unlike many other greatest hits albums, this one contains only the best. The content is terrific. Perhaps the only complaint is the omission of several hits like &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;Fever,&quot; and &quot;I'll Remember.&quot; No other artist in music history has maintained such a steady and prosperous amount of hits. Certainly no artist has ever released two Greatest Hits collections that are worthy of such notice. So heres to Greatest Hits Volume 3: Long live Madonna!

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I am listening to the CD as I write this review, and I have to say that this is some of the best stuff I ever heard!  I can't resist singing along to the songs as I listen, and everytime I hear some of the songs, I swear to G-d, I get tingles inside, however corny it may sound.  The selection of songs is so wonderful, it has ALL of my absouloute FAVORITES! I am a huge beatles fan, although I am only 12, but I think this CD will convince all those non-beatles fans how incredibly brilliant they are!  You have to buy this CD!  The beatles once said &quot;You can't buy me love&quot; But buying this CD is pretty darn close!!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira may have came a year too late from the big Latin explosion, but so be it...there must of been a reason for that. Maybe - the phrase &quot;save the best for last,&quot; plays a major role in the reasoning for her year delay?!? No?<BR>The album is 100% produced by Shakira, and all the songs are written by her as well, which definitely shows her credibility as an artist! Each track on the album has it's individuality, but &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; the first single from her debut, is GREAT! <BR>The tracks, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot; are definitely single-potential and my personal favorites. In addition, the remaining tracks are awesome, creative, sung beautifully, and unique only to Shakira's voice.<BR>Resembling a more rock flavor with Latin splashes and influence, her voice can sometimes be mistaken for Alanis Morisette's (I don't know if that is bad or good...I like it though!). <BR>Overall, a great album and a must for anyone looking for good, true, and beatifully crafted artistic music! This is album is the best English-language debut I have heard, and a great debut far surpassing that of Nelly Furtado's (And yes...it's that good!)!<BR>So if you want a singer with a gorgeous body, beautiful, cultural, rock-oriented music, and all that is between...HURRY UP AND BUY SHAKIRA'S &quot;LAUNDRY SERVICE&quot;!
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a must have for all Madonna fans, i love this cd. And all the pictures included don't hurt either.
6300182770|5.0|Okay, so i got nothing better to do on a friday night, so i take out the VIDEODROME tape (out-of-print unrated version with scenes not seen in theaters or on this edition) that my friend's mom let me borrow. It is such a horrible movie. Weak plot, bad acting, BUT ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER! It's so unique, and even though you wanna turn off the VCR and watch CLERKS or something, you keep watching, because it keeps getting more and more intriging. This film is not for all tastes, though. Once the movie is over, the only thing you can say is WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?<br />&quot;Death to Videodrome, long live the New Flesh&quot;
B00004T37H|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time, of any genre.  I have yet to buy the DVD, and so I cannot review on its quality, but I would like to participate by giving the movie the maximum possible endorsement I could - 5 stars.<br />Incredible. Speechless.
B00005NIDK|4.0|THe first track I heard from this album was &quot;In the Presence of&quot;, and I cringed when I heard it. I was looking forward to Yes' orchestral collaboration, but if this tepid work was the product, then count me out! Then I heard the rest of the tracks, and now I know that the first impression of an energyless album was incorrect. I'll go track-by-track in review, and give each a rating out of five..<br />(1) Magnification (4/5)- a great way to start off the album. Perhaps just a touch long (about 7 minutes), but it's catchy, and you'll be singing along to it in no time. <br />(2) Spirit of Survival (5/5) - the second-best track on the album, and a classic Yes song in its own right. Starts out with Jon in depths-of-space mode, then rocks hard for the next 8 minutes or so. Strong backup vocals from Chris.<br />(3) Don't Go (4/5) - This is getting some mixed reviews from fans, but I think it's an excellent song. We won't hear it on the radio, but it's a catchy song, and is more down-to-earth than Jon's usual lyrics.<br />(4) Give Love Each Day (3/5) - This is where things start to go downhill a bit. The orchestral intro is beautiful (on par with some of the best movie score arranging in the past few years), but the song really doesn't go anywhere. Pretty, but it won't stick with you for long.<br />(5)Can You Imagine (3/5) - Chris originally wrote this song in the early 80's, if I remember correctly, and it shows. It would have been an excellent addition to BIG GENERATOR, and here it's a great showcase for Chris' distinct vocal style, but it's a waypoint, not a destination.<br />(6) We Agree (3.5/5) - I just can't get into this song. I have a feeling it's one that will grow on me, but for now, I can't give it a higher rating.<br />(7) Soft As a Dove (2/5) - Ugh. The lyrics are somewhat touching, but it's like cotton candy - it melts away, leaving nothing behind. On the wrong side of sappy.<br />(8) Dreamtime (5/5) - NOW we're talking! Instant classic Yes track. Driving, vigourous, the orchestra keeping up - when Jon arpeggios down with the violins following, it brings a chill to the spine. Chris sounding like an avenging spirit. A Quality 10 minute piece, right up there with recent Yes classics like Homeworld and New Languages.<br />(9) ITPO (3.5/5) - Not so much as a comedown as a change of pace, it loses a half-point for letting the sappy gremlin to get ahold of Jon's pen. Musically, it's very textured and interesting, not as monotonous as on first hearing.<br />(10) Time is Time (?/5) - Perhaps it's bad that this song doesn't even make an impression. Sounds like the closing credits for a TV show.<br />Even though I've given short shrift to some of the songs above, this is still one of the best albums this year. In short, if Yes wants to be heard on the radio, they should lead off with a four-and-a-half minute edit of Magnification, then follow up with Don't Go. Not that that will happen, but it's too bad that an album this good will undoubtedly disappear into the back bins of record stores.<br />All in all, it's great that a band with Yes' longevity is still trying new things and making new music. Keep it up, guys!
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Turn down the lights, turn up the bass, and light one- this CD is bound to blow your mind. The precussion and bass will make your jaw drop, especially on tracks like War and Exudos. This CD is really what Bob Marley is all about. Listening to Bob live is really a different experience and this CD does a good job capturing his live energy. Its worth every cent.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Let me start by saying Shakira is one of the best artists I've heard... This being her first english album, it needs work... but it (isn't totally bad)! Listening at the spanish songs on this album, you will understand her power... but her art is lost in the english language, mostly because you can tell she \\"thinks\\" in spanish...<BR>I love her, but she needs help with the language, after all, if you can speak it, dosn't mean you can do magic with it... <BR>If you've never heard of Shakira, buy \\"Pies Descalzos\\", her best work to date! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for another english album from her, I'm sure the practice makes perfect!
B000002JAX|5.0|It is nowadays rare and joyfull to listen to such remarkable, sensuous voice. Peyroux talent is excepional, it fills the gap between pretending noise and real art of singing. My dream is, she should edit another CD, in her Dremland.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I felt that i enjoyed this album at first, however i feel the more i listened to it the more i began to dislike it.  I wouldnt recomend this album to anyone unless they want to pay money for only a few good tracks.  I particularilly enjoy listening to track 7...&quot;Livin It Up&quot; also known as &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot;.
0385505833|4.0|This is a very fast read, with just 177 pages.  Very enjoyable.  This is not typical John Grisham writing.  The book shows it is clearly the time for giving, with not necesarily expecting anything in return.
B00005Q66T|2.0|Where is: &quot;You'll See&quot;? &quot;Rain&quot;? &quot;I'll remember&quot;? &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;? &quot;Bad Girl&quot;? I'm sorry, yes GVH2 is a decent collection of Madonna tracks, but the omission of these, some of her biggest (and arguabley best) 90s tracks, is a crime for long time Madonna fans. I know she's been trying to make us forget for about 4 years now, but Madonna's wasn't always about cool European DJ's mixing songs on sprituality and inner peace. As a collection of her 90s greatest hits, this package really falls short.
B00005QXXO|5.0|This is a great selection of live tracks from Kid A and Amnesiac, plus one new track, &quot;True Love Waits.&quot;  There are only 8 tracks, so it seems a bit short, so I'd only recommend it if you were a fan, not just a casual listener.  If you have seen them play live, this would be a great way to relive the experience, or if you're like me, this may be your only chance to hear them perform live.
B00005R2M3|3.0|This album would have been fantastic had Shakira stuck to singing in Spanish.  The result of her English album sounded forced and trite.  She sounds like Britney Spears for crying out loud.  The few Spanish songs on the album are the only things that make it worthwhile.  Only a true diehard Shakira fan would forgive her for this.  :(
B00005QXXO|4.0|Considering how some jaded critics said how impenetrable Kid A and Amnesiac are, the live reworkings of seven of the albums' songs on I Might Be Wrong are a remarkable statement by Radiohead. Not only do Radiohead deftly recreate the sound of their past two albums in a live setting, they actually make all the songs sound better than the studio versions.<br />I Might Be Wrong is less a live album than a remix EP, and thankfully, the crowd noise is kept to a minimum in the mix so listeners can enjoy hearing Thom Yorke, Johnny Greenwood, and Company deliver blistering, desperately urgent versions of 'The National Anthem', 'I Might Be Wrong', and 'Idioteque'. The quickened pace of the title track alone is chilling, while 'Idioteque' works strangely well as a stadium rocker. More downtempo songs like 'Morning Bell' and 'Dollars And Cents' showcase the band's skill at subtle accompaniment to Yorke's impassioned vocals. 'Everything In Its Right Place' posesses as many kooky effects as the studio version, but also an all-too-human flub at the beginning, and the band hardly miss a step and begin a few bars later.<br />The most startling improvement is on 'Like Spinning Plates', a song which I originally considered to be Amnesiac's worst. Instead of being an indecipherable miasma of loops and effects, the song is given spare treatment, in the form of a piano ballad, and the result is enthralling. The previously unreleased track 'True Love Waits', which goes as far back as 1995, makes a long-overdue appearance, in atypically simple form, just Yorke and his guitar, and compared to Kid Amnesiac's esoteric lyrics, the song is startlingly honest.<br />I Might Be Wrong is so surprisingly good that it makes one wish for a complete live recording, either on cd or dvd. Besides, many of Radiohead's fans, like myself, live in cities where they'll never, ever visit. Radiohead is a terrific live band, and proof that you don't need big power chords to connect with the audience, and this new live collection leaves you thirsty for more.
B00005Q66T|5.0|So you are a basic Madonna fanatic fan if you purchase this cd. Why? With two greatest hits packages already in stores, 1990s Immaculate Collection and 1995s Something to Remember, Madonna has released most of her best works and then some.<br />With GHV2 Madonna is releasing her hits since the early 90s. What is missing is new releases. Unlike the previous collections which resulted in new tracks, GHV2 does not contain any new material.<br />Drawing heavily on 1994s Bedtime Stories and 1998s Ray of Light, GHV2 showcases a Madonna who has evolved from dance pop smash queen to reniasance woman!<br />Starting things off is 1994s hit, Deeper and Deeper. Kind of a metaphor for the Madonna today. Hits like Secret, Human Nature, Bedtime Story, right up through Ray of Light hits and with her latest endeavor, Music.<br />What can you say? Critics alike will be alarmed at the omission of hits like American Pie, Nothing Really Matters, and You Must Love Me, they can find those hits on other albums.<br />What does this CD really matter to us fans, it is a chance to her latest round of hits to be included on one cd. <br />Interesting to note is the liner notes and nothing from Mad herself. A rather bizarre story is included from someone who just recently met her. Odd, isn't it? The photo collection is impressive that is included, the photos are basically thumbnails of shots spanning her entire career.<br />I look forward to GHV3 as Madonna is constantly is improving herself and her style.<br />Kudos to you Madonna, you make this &quot;world go round!&quot;

B00005R23S|4.0|It was good when it aired on TV, but the DVD is even better: it includes the complete TV broadcast, plus an extra 90 minutes of live performances that were omitted from the original airing (including Jungleland and Thunder Road). The sound is stellar, and the camera work and editing are first rate.  And my thanks to whoever decided to release this in 16x9 anamorphic widescreen! Watch this one on a big widescreen TV (like the Toshiba 57HX81) and it's almost like being at the concert.  (There's some quite noticible pixelization in spots, but I think this has to do with the quality of the source material, not the transfer.) First rate.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Growing up among old Beatles records, I couldn't help but develop a deep appreciation of the Beatles' catalogue, but Paul McCartney's solo albums never really did it for me; however, instead of jumping on the Bash Paul bandwagon and assuming a false hipster stance of how he totally lost his edge over the years, I tended to feel good for the guy. After all, he had a great marriage, happy kids, the money to live the way he wanted with minimal fuss, and a pretty successful solo career. Why need grit when you're so happy?<br />However, the passing of his longtime wife Linda has seemed to make his music sound more passionate. His covers album, Run Devil Run, was a more intense return to live-to-tape rock &amp; roll, and his first album of new material since Linda's death continues in the same pattern. There's a grittiness present on Driving Rain that I haven't heard from Macca in years, a urgency that's aided in part by his good backing band of younger musicians, and his lyrics seem to be either speaking to Linda, his new fiancee Heather, or both, like he's trying to seek some kind of redemption.<br />Driving Rain is overloaded with songs, which muddles things up a bit, but the highlights are fantastic. The opening tracks 'Lonely Road' and 'From A Lover To A Friend' set the tone for the entire album, with the latter's refrain &quot;From a lover to a friend/let me love again&quot; being some of the most heartbreakingly personal lyrics Paul has ever written. 'Your Loving Flame' is a classic Macca ballad, while 'Riding Into Jaipur' is a bit of a departure into George Harrison territory. Best of all are two songs: The rambunctious ten-minute 'Rinse The Raindrops' is as adventurous a song McCartney's ever written, remarkably not as self-indulgent as you'd think, and with fabulous vocals by Paul and tight musicianship by his backing band. 'Heather', though, is one of the best songs McCartney has ever written, utterly gorgeous, and proof that he's found another muse.<br />There's the usual filler that is always present in a Macca album...some lyrics were a cringeworthy (&quot;1-2-3-4-5, let's go for a drive&quot;...sheesh), and the jingoistic song 'Freedom' that was tacked on at the end is catchy, but ultimately rings hollow. Paul could have done better. Still, the Goofy Paul moments are keprt to a minimum, and the rest of Driving Rain holds up very well. It's quite a good album, one of Paul's best.
B0000027DJ|5.0|This is a great, great album.  I can't think of any song on it that I even came close to not being absolutly in love with.  If you wanted to list out all of Alice Cooper's great hits, I can guarantee that a half dozen of them would be comming right off this album.  Each song is individual, powerful, and awesome.  It seems more like a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, rather than just a regular one.  It should say enough that in &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;, Slash is on guitar, and Ozzy in the chorus.  The best of the best of the best, ne?<BR>&quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; also spawned an amazing video, which I now know was the video I saw when I was a kid, and scared me to death.  Which makes me laugh now, thinking back on it.<BR>&quot;Love's A Loaded Gun&quot; was also a hit video, and I've played it over, and over, and over.<BR>Buy it, if only for &quot;Might As Well Be on Mars&quot;.  This song is simply too amazing to be described in words.  <BR>Hey Stoopid = GOOD ALBUM.<BR>Oh, and the lyric booklette unfolds into a mini-poster of the image of him from the back cover.  Currently, I need another book, because right now it's on my wall, worshiped daily.  (All a girl could ever want!)<br />Of course, this album isn't for everybody.  All the media-controlled hArdcORe sLipKNot gOThIc nINjA WARioRs of HaRdCoRE (teenybopers in black clothing) probably won't apreciate it.  Afterall, everybody knows that music didn't exist before KORN.  (I say this VERY sarcastically.)
B00005JKHP|5.0|Finally, it all makes sense.  Star Trek fans should forget about the critics and go and get this DVD.  The director's cut has several new and enhanced scenes, a terrific score, and revealing commentaries.  It's a shame the theatrical version wasn't edited right when the film first came out.  But all should be forgiven with this widescreen director's edition.  This is a movie that justifies Dolby surround sound and the extra features of DVD. Fans who don't have a DVD player will surely want to get one.
0345413377|5.0|There are two kinds of great stories -- those that fit seamlessly into the body of thought and make you wonder why no one thought of it before, and those that are remarkably imaginative and compelling and make you wonder how the author thought it up at all. Pullman's trilogy fits into the latter category.  He is a fine writer -- balancing multiple story lines that interconnect and support each other; each character is well drawn, complex and believable; situations are dramatic and interesting.<br /><br />This final installment of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy is not disappointing.  It lives up to the preceding volumes, which is a rarity in serial publications (even Tolkien fell down a bit with Return of the King).  I was prepared for a rotten ending after reading many criticisms of it in the reviews here, but I liked the ending -- bittersweet, tragic and hopeful all at once. I would say that the only thing I didn't like was that Lyra slept through one-third of the book!  Without giving any spoilers I will say that there are several scenes that are as emotionally packed as anything I've read.<br /><br />Two notes:  (1) People who DO put spoilers into their reviews should warn or label them as such beforehand.  (2) Frankly, zealotry is tiresome, and it would be nice if commentaries did not have to include reviewers' belief systems. Can't you just relax and read for enjoyment? This book is in the *fantasy* genre. Open your mind a little bit and don't be so threatened by ideas.
B00005QXXO|5.0|An amazing live recording from an amazing band.  Everything on this EP is album worthy.  Unlike most live recordings, the crowd noise is kept extremely quiet, and the result is beautiful alternate versions of the best stuff from Kid A and Amnesiac.  Everything in its Right Place has an awesome new opening, and ends on a beautifully placid note that makes you loose yourself in the song even more than the Kid A version.  The National Anthem has a more distorted, faster bass which really peps up the song.  It is missing the brass section, so it looses a bit of the &quot;Art Rock&quot;ness of it, but it's still very powerful.  The highlight of this EP, however, is the piano/moog version of Like Spinning Plates.  Unlike the choppy, confusing Amnesiac version, the true beauty of this song's progression can finally be realized, and it is breathtaking.  It alone justifies a purchase.  I do wish Radiohead would've thrown in about 5 more tracks and released a complete live album, but this is still an unexpected pleasure, and one of my favorite live records ever.
B00005NWRS|5.0|This CD helped me bury my Dad on 10/22 in SC.  I listened to it the whole week I was there in a rental Mustang convertible.  In my mind, there is no &quot;filler&quot;, only great original songs.  I think it's fantastic that he can sound like so many people on one album. I like Jay Farrar on &quot;Sebastopol&quot;, but he is so one dimensional by comparison.  Now for the best part, I get to go see Ryan on 12/7 LIVE!
B00005QK3W|5.0|The first thing I noticed about Driving Rain is Pauls bass playing, the man is just so innovative on the instrument.  It's good to hear his bass more dominant in the mix, on so many of his albums the bass is buried so deep.  Paul is rocking just listen to Lonely Road,  Driving Rain,  About You,  and Rinse The Raindrops.  He's also soulful check out Tiny Bubble,  and Back In The Sunshine Again.  Paul is the master of variety and this album won't let you down.  The stand out track on the entire album is Your Loving Flame, a power ballad if there ever was one!  It's been a long time since Paul wrote a ballad this strong, it deserves the full treatment (promotion, video, etc).  Driving Rain finds Paul carrying on with his greatness, and Your Loving Flame is one of Pauls best, a definite McCartney classic!!
