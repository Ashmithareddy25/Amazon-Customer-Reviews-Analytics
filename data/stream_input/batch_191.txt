B002RT09E4|5|I'm seriously considering buying this in a gallon jug because I'm addicted. I've had sinus infection for THREE months and this has been the only blend that has really moved my congestion. Including the three antibiotics I've been on. It's a pleasant smell too! Most of the sinus blends smell like Vicks vapor rub but this is actually nice!
B004RPRG9C|5|Recommended by my stylist, so I purchased from Amazon, and I love it.  Easy to use, pleasant fragrance and stays on forever
B001TH8Q72|5|Previously I had purchased Gilette razors but I decided to get this when I noticed it was on sale (Amazon \\"clip this coupon\\").  The trimmer is phenomenal---small, which is actually a benefit considering the bikini area.  No nicks or cuts, just a satisfied customer!  The razor works just as well.  I liked it so much I purchased one for my sister and my best friend.
B006FD1OOW|5|I have been using Cal Tan Bronzing Powder for 13 years and love it.  It give me a nice glow that lasts all day.  It's a great enhancer to a spray tan as well.
B00KSLK86M|5|Best balm I've ever used!
B004RILTDS|4|Helps relieve pressure build up in my ears. Works wonderful with warm water couple of times per week when I shower.
B0006NXQXE|5|I found this product in a shop in Colorado last summer - and it lasted almost a year.  It's a wonderful lilac scent - which is my favorite and so difficult to find.  One of the best things about this body mousse is that it blends well with some of my perfumes, so I can layer my scent.  It's about as perfect a product as I have ever found.  LOVE IT.
B007HOCQVS|4|The Spring Gardenia Green Tea smells absolutely amazing! And WEN products really do make your hair awesome! I'm still just a little hesitant about the price though, because if I use the recommended amount of pumps for my hair, I go through 32oz a month... when it's \\"supposed\\" to last me three months. Maybe it's not intended to be used daily? Either way... 16oz every two weeks can really put a dent in a person's cash flow... and cash is definitely something I do not have right now.
B001FOR01C|3|I got these flossers for my 4 year old, since she has pretty bad teeth. She complained that they didn't taste at all like bubblegum, so I tasted one, and it was completely without any flavor or smell. I think either we got a bad batch or they were mislabeled. They are cute, though.
B00A2C4Z16|5|really happy with this one.  Gorgeous when lit. Everyone I bought them for is thrilled with them  Will buy more
B008HP2AD0|1|I truly expected this item to last a bit longer than a regular lipstick - it did not! It has no redeeming features.<br />I would advise you not to waste your money, or not to expect anything.
B00J8UJNU6|2|I've been using this gel everyday for about 2 months. It's not bad as a moisturizer and brightener but it didn't help with my circles, I don't have darkness under my eyes but I do have the lines, I'm 29, and this gel didn't correct the tear troughs, so I won't be buying again.
B000RJUZMW|5|I bought these for my husband and son.  They are first time users of the double edged razor and they love it!  The weight of the razor feels so good in your hand.  The razors are elegant and affordable.
B0019KAAOQ|5|Mary Kay did it again with a wonderful powder foundation.  I have olive skin tone and Beige 1 is perfect....could even go Beige 2 next time.  It is silky smooth!
B00AEINQ9K|5|My fathers fav razor so far - but they dont last too long
B009MOF820|5|I love it, love it, love it!  Fantastic!  It smells so fresh and clean.  The texture is rich and is good for dry skin.  I love Bath & Body Works!  Thank you!
B009OU6LWS|4|I LOVE all the Scotch Naturals colors, they are excellent, however you must use the base coat and they soy remover. Regular nail polish remover will not get the job done as effectively. Quick to dry, needs a few coats also. Otherwise its a good product.
B00GHI8L4Q|5|I really like the shoes, just like the picture, it is for my 3 month old baby  alittle big now but she will be able to wear them  Price is great. I will recomend.
B000F4GINO|5|This conditioner is very good!! It brings out my highlights & imparts mirror like shine, helps tone down brassiness alot. I will definatly buy again!!! The matching shampoo is also wonderful ( a Mothers day present from my son) I picked out of course!!  ( 5-23)I had to add more to this reveiw, I am so pleased with this product, usually 3 weeks after coloring, my roots are really showing & my color is fading & brassy. My color looks like it was just done, I also use the shampoo. I am so!!! pleased to be able to touch up my color less often, so much better for your hair!! If you have a cool blonde shade you have to give this a try!!!
B00J86HFB4|5|I love these Rollers......
B0054Y1O9I|5|This was considerably less than I could have purchase it anywhere else. I did wait a while for it to arrive from Germany. But, it was worth the wait. I've used it & it's the real deal & deal of a price as well.
B001DYQELG|5|I am not as particular about my blades as others that write reviews.  Having said that, these blades have been as good or better than the other I have tried in the &#34;sample packs&#34; that I have gotten to try out various brands.  The best part is that as good as they are, they are also among the least expensive.  I am very happy with these and will be ordering more of the same when this supply runs down.
B00QSG3BEC|5|Makes my skin feel great! I love that it doesn't dry my skin out either. I really love it.
B0009OMU0A|3|I was a bit disappointed when I trimmed with the first notch. Besides that, it's a nice trimmer which make it job.
B0002JHGYC|5|Great product and I use daily.
B00MSZR44U|5|I gladly recommend this fragrance. I have been using this product for years and I have more compliments on this fragrance than any other fragrance.It makes you feel very feminine.
B002JPJ2ZS|1|Doesn't work...if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a ***** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together
B008JWW7MK|5|The quality of the cosmetic brushes was great.  I will recommend my friends and family to shop at this store in the future.
B0093OHLM4|5|I am a stay at home mother of two who doesn't have a whole lot of me time. I have been taking this product for a little over a month now and have lost ten pounds!! I have not changed anything about my daily activity. The other wonderful thing is no side effects!!
B004SIIHXM|5|Love, Love, Love this product.  Use it on my wet hair and brush it through and then blow dry.  Leaves a great shine and straight hair.
B000XPB60U|5|I would recommend who wants to buy natural non-chemical toothpaste to their family. We like to taste and you feel clean and fresh .....
B000V2ACHI|4|I've searched for the best hair styling product for me and have settled on a few different products that I use depending on the situation.  Gatsby Purple has found a slot especially for when I have a fresh haircut, for day-to-day situations.  My hair stays in place all day with a nice, matte finish. The only drawback is that my hair seems to be stuck together - I can't use that sexy, run-my-fingers-through-my-hair move.  Also like others have noticed, its a bit tough to wash off your hands and out of your hair in the evenings.
B00150LT40|5|i have always seen this in stores but they have been $10-$15 dollars so finding it online for less than $5 was a steal and i has to get it and it works great.
B003I8KDLM|5|Love this product, hence why i bought 6. I orderded it and in less than a week it was at my house! great
B00L726T3W|5|I ordered 1 bottle of this... Loved it so much, I ordered the larger size! I have noticed that I was getting cottage cheese in my user arms. It's going on four weeks that I've been using this, I already am seeing a difference!!! Can't wait to see more results!!!
B008AKVJB6|2|Sure the crystals are nice, but my nieces didn't like them because every time they put them on (including the very 1st time), when they went to take them off they were stuck in their hair because of the unclosed loops on the ends. Also, the &#34;metal&#34; is VERY bendy, will not stand up to 4 year olds.
B005PUZZR8|4|very nice trimmer, im on 2 months on my first full charge. The adjustable guard works great as well as the changeable blades. the only complaint i have is when you try use guard level 1 and try to go down to a stubble it often grabbs and pulls and that sucks. I just wont push down so hard. Other than that i think is a excellent choice.
B001BO0KMC|5|Perfect!
B004UQ6Q62|4|This is my second one and I really like it. Does a good job charges fast and is durable. The foil stays good for months.
B00SMIIR0W|5|Recieved a free product. Works great, close smooth shave, best razor by far! My favorite.
B003USGM9M|1|The worst hair coloring experience of my life. This is off the shelves with good reason....the smell almost made me faint..I could barely breathe. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Horrible fumes!! These days they dont put all that stuff in hair products anymore...buy your hair products in a store..not online!!
B004FKAA6U|5|beautiful color and lots of compliments
B00KH56O12|2|Not sure
B003U3CJNK|5|THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I HAD ORDERED SOME YRS AGO FROM THE &#34;AS SEEN ON TV&#34; INFOMERICALS.<br />THIS DO WHAT I NEED  THAT LITTLE HAIR THAT SEEMS TO APPEAR SINCE I PASSED 50 IS SO ANNOYING. THIS GETS RID OF IT NO PAIN.
B001AJ6QNA|4|I owned this product for several months now. I can say that it does what is expected, but it has some features that avoids it to get 5 stars.<br /><br />- The pop-up trimmer doesn't get fixed to its position while in use. So, it gets retracted when you most need it.<br />- Even though the shave is really good, I always end with some extra trimmer time.<br /><br />The design is very very comfortable and I don't care about the no battery issue.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for about 12 years now. The one I replaced was still working but not as well as the new one. I have a bridge and my gums are very pink and healthy using the Sonicare.  Won't ever go back to a regular brush again.
B002KAOAUE|3|Unlike some of the other negative reviewers on here, I actually like the taste of the Biotene Mouth Spray; I find it both soothing and subtle and have no problems with it at all.  It feels great to use when you have a dry mouth (as I often do due to medication) and provides much-needed relief, especially since I developed all sorts of horrible cavities before using this stuff because of my constant dry mouth, so no problems there either.  What I do have a problem with is the fact that it just doesn't last very long...within an hour or two I'll be tempted to use more.  I also find that I need 5 - 8 sprays in order to truly get relief (although that may just be due to a rather extreme case of dry mouth) so I go through the bottles of this stuff very quickly.  I'd say each individual bottle lasts a week at most...and at 8 dollars a bottle (from my local pharmacy, the only store in the area that carries it), that adds up to 32 dollars or more a month or 384 dollars or more a year in mouth spray, which is much more than I want to pay, no matter how good the product's relief is.    I haven't tried any of the alternatives yet (none of the stores around here carry any) but it looks like I'm going to have to switch to something else that lasts longer or is less pricey because a bottle a week of Biotene Mouth Spray is just too expensive.  Btw, if anyone has any recommendations for good alternatives, I'd love to hear them in the comments section for this review!
B000C1W38O|5|Wife loves it.
B00JNSNLEW|2|I am middle aged south asian woman. My skin has patches some oily and some are really dry.This cream is too thick and oily. I got breakouts, after I used two days. I will say if you have really really dry skin,this cream will work for you.
B008WG7X8Q|4|Love it
B006W7RUGM|5|Love love love this scrub so much that I subscribe.  Leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  Also it heats up a little as you use it (a result of the salt scrub dissolving in water)--fantastic.
B00NLKAVL4|5|I just received this yesterday I love the way it feels it's so refreshing and it made my face feel really fresh and clean
B00A31EGYC|5|It looks better than the picture, and is large like I wanted. It has 3 zipper pockets and is a cute design. Definitely worth the price.
B002LFQ4OS|5|This mascara makes my puny lashes look thick and stand out. It stays on all day without leaving clumps, even throughout my workout.
B006Z8B5HS|5|I love it, it made my hair feel really smooth and soft!
B0017U074G|5|Over the years, I've tried all different types of deodorants, ranging from plain deodorants to sticks to gels.  This Old Spice Sweat Defense is a new type that I haven't seen from any other company.  There are holes in the top (like with a gel deodorant), but it's a white solid material that comes out when you turn the applicator dial at the bottom.<br /><br />When it comes to anti-perspirant effectiveness, you want one with a high percentage of Aluminum Zirconium.  This Sweat Defense has 19%, which is the highest I've seen (unless you splurge for one of those clinical strength anti-perspirants).  This high percentage is also why this item is on the higher end of the price scale.<br /><br />The package says 2 clicks of the applicator is enough, but I think that is being ambitious, unless you rarely sweat or are never in a warm environment.  3 clicks is probably a better standard, and on warm days or days I am doing a lot of activity, I find that 4 clicks is more appropriate.  Unfortunately, this means one stick won't last as long.<br /><br />I've tried a few different scents and Fresh is my favorite, by far.  It has a clean, soapy scent.  I don't like the recent trend of deodorants that smell like cologne, but you should check out the other scents if you are okay with that.<br /><br />Overall, despite the high price, I will continue to use this product.
B0017Q1RMG|5|Perfect
B003XU8ABA|5|GOOD Deal!!!! Love it!!!!
B003QOZ2C8|5|I am always leery of trying facial moisturizers and creams as in the past I have tried some brands and on applying my foundation the sunscreen just rolls off.  Not this one...it goes on light and not heavy and I have no trouble applying my foundation over it.  I also love that is has Helioplex in it which is a great addition to this product.
B0079R6BD2|2|I have a dry scalp from this shampoo and have been getting dandruff for the first time in my life. I will never use this stuff again.
B000ALCJR6|3|The blowdryer is light weight and results in a decent style but I have had two dryers that broke down within a year after I purchased them.  I do not think this blow dryer is worth the price.
B009JN0QHG|5|Deep #366 makes my face look fabulous! I recommend daily use of Deep #366 to really achieve that natural look.
B00631ZHGC|1|My Conair curling iron I had for years finally died. I decided to treat myself to a nicer curling iron and decided to go the ceramic route. So I went purchased this curling iron from Sally's. After only a few uses the coating on the curling iron started to wear off on the inside and fried my hair. I have healthy hair. I use special conditioning treatments on my hair. I also use heat protectant spray on my hair. I also have a hair straightener that gets hotter then this curling iron and never have had this happen to my hair. VERY disappointed with this purchase and returned it!! Do not recommend this product at all.
B003CH7YIE|4|Been using the product for a while now and have noticed less breakouts and softer skin-wish I could have gotten the whole line- part of the prodct kept breaking in shipment so did not get to use it, but overall I really like the line. I have oily skin and the product did not over dry my face-even when used daily.
B005IR3D90|5|I found these guys at the Seattle Pike's Market. This is the ONLY product that has ever helped relief from my eczema almost immediately. It's all organic so unlike most cortisone creams, it won't thin your skin or cause discoloration. I swear by this. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
B008MPFQFE|5|It works really well without having that dry feeling after you wash your face.  I would certainly buy this again as it makes your skin feel clean, smooth and refreshed.  Great price compared to other products that do not even come close to the results.
B0043OYFKU|4|This product works great. It is so affordable and works better than the more expensive cleansing systems that are advertised.
B00GXFRF8Q|5|I bought this oil after recommendations from friends and I love it. It's so versatile and this bottle is huge for the price. I use it to remove eye make up, to soften cuticles and calluses. I still have to try it out on my hair. But if you like me and like to make your own skincare and body products I recommend getting this. It has no scent and it's relatively thin, and I like it this way. There are so many ways to use this oil and it's really good for your skin.
B00SKR6KFY|5|Smells great, works well, good price!
B0053CMMBA|5|This is a high end product and my favorite bubble bath.  The company is no longer advertising this particular scent but we found it on Amazon.  Richly scented, low bubbles due to the purity of the product.
B000GZBWGK|2|I don't really like the smell & it came with broken box ~ make me wondered if it is used !
B001ZG5CXI|4|I have a litlle problem. I don;t read that the product was for pillow. I think was for the body. Then, good for pillows.
B002XQ1RY2|2|Unfortunately this is a bootleg version of the real thing. How do I know? I went to Nordstrom first and smelled the fragrance myself. When I purchased this one I smelled a strong smell of alcohol on it, which then were calmed down. To further my investigation I bought the Nordstrom one to compare. And I was then CERTAIN the one bought on amazon was a fake. I will be honest and say this is a pretty good fake(it even smells funny like it was made in some hole in the wall place in India), and that's why I give it 2 stars. 1 for being a fake and promoting it as the actual one. 2nd star for it being close to the original.<br /><br />The amazon one had a new UPC code and the factory numbers on the bottle didn't match the package either.
B00G6MR7VG|5|Great product
B0055S4CRY|3|Does not spread easily... too thick!
B00ATFDOTK|5|LADIES!  I love this hair color, been dying my hair for over 20 years. This actually dyes my hair dark brown not orange. Very easy, I clean the house while iit's in my hair. Maybe 2 hours. Love love love this. Very easy to rinse also, not like the other henna's.
B00IPVCCVQ|3|The box was mislabeled and instead of six samples, I got a bar of Rosemary Mint, which irritated my scalp.  Amazon as always was great about crediting/replacing, but instead of trying the samples I replaced it with Charcoal Bamboo and was very happy.  The only other one I really wanted to try was Moroccan Mud, but its easier to buy individual bars than the sampler so this worked out.
B00028ORTK|5|My mom recommended this for under the eyes, and I got it despite it being quite expensive for the amount of product. I absolutely love it. I put it on my face first thing in the morning, rub it in gently, then wash my face. The serum moisturizes your face like nothing else, without leaving it greasy at all. I would definitely recommend, especially if you have dry skin like me.
B003H897AQ|1|I took a chance, but this does not work like other eyelash enhancers do. They may require a visit to a Dr. but it's worth the time and money if you want more  lashes.
B00N6Y54Y4|5|muy bueno
B00A0J0ABK|5|Works great! The fragrance is not overwhelming either, very subtle.
B002GCKWHQ|3|I have wanted a pair of fake bangs since they came out a few years ago. It is a cool idea, but I feel silly wearing them, as they do look fake. I wear them around the house for fun, but would not wear them out as I would be too self concious.
B002RK5902|5|my son is a tattoo artist and loves these colors and this product! i bought this as a gift for him and he loves all the starbrite colors. i have been tatted with them several times and can honestly say that my tats done with this brand are my faves!!! the color is always bright and bold and doesnt fade with time and the price is awesome. customer service is amazing and shipping is good also.
B0045O2U9Q|4|I love this lotion, it smells really good! My only complaint is that when it arrived the top wasn't screwed on tight enough and some of the lotion has spilled out of the bottle. I found this a bit disappointing, especially because it was a gift for someone and now it looks used. Although, accidents happen and that's okay.
B008PEMOV6|5|excellent tooth brush .  most professional.  good deal too.
B00A78TEAM|2|Not impressed at all. Not for semi tan people
B000X1LOKQ|5|The best eye cream I have ever used! Lasts a long time also!
B00C1NAQ8U|2|I was very disappointed with this product. I carefully followed the instructions, but the strips did not separate properly most of the time. All of the wax would stick to one side of the strip and it would not be sticky. The wax is supposed to separate so that half of it sticks to each side of the strip and you end up with two sticky strips. Even when it did separate, it didn't work very well. Don't waste your money on this.
B002ON11RW|5|Great pigments, great colours, your MUST-HAVE everyday look palette. As well as a very good palette to transform from day to night looking sultry and classy without looking over the top !! I highly highly recommend it  :D
B00GUNYDAE|4|does the job
B001SERK9G|5|The first one I purchased almost 4 years ago, was great. I purchased a second last Dec as a gift, but my niece had already purchased a similar product. I kept it & opened it back in June, charge it & it went haywire, wouldn't shut off, then completely stopped. I had to contact Pretika because of time that had passed, they said normally they wouldn 't replace as it was beyond. 90 days , but were very nice, replaced it, but now, 100 days later, it stopped working, & now is turning itself on in the middle of the night! They said they had changed design. Don 't buy it! I'm sending it back & probably eating my $$. The new design is defective! I've contacted Amazon & told them to discontine relationship with Pretika! Hope this saves someone else the headache!
B00H1C5O9M|5|Love it it smelles fantastic and great for your lips! I smell more rasberry then anything but that's my opinion, some sniffers smell different things but I really recommend this and if you don't have a amazon account you can find this one at meijer, Walmart, rite-aid, ect.
B0015KHMRS|3|These are meant for touch-ups and for that, they're okay at best.  They're also very noisy and applying a drop of oil doesn't help.
B00R1W99VQ|5|Great designs, pick up flawlessly!
B001AYG2U2|5|Exceeded expectations! Will purchase again from same supplier.
B004UA2SLU|5|I'm over 50 and use this every other day and it has improved my skin. I've even gotten compliments since I've started using it.
B00EYMWQRA|5|AWESOME......great product smells REALLY NICE.  I buy and re-buy!!!
B000RFS118|5|I have been using this product for a while now. it is great and I will definitely buy another one. If you are looking for a fresh clean line up every time you step out of you door this is the right kind to get.
B00NI8LNX4|4|Got this for my mom for Christmas -- she collects and loves the eos lip balms. These are smooth and it all smells really nice. Still a bit pricey, but she loves it.
B001B1T2SS|5|Firstly, it's China Glaze (and I understand why so many people love this brand). Secondly it's &#34;fairy dust&#34;, so it adds the slightest hint of shimmer to nail polish (IMO best for matte colours). It works well as a standalone topcoat as there is minimal grittiness to touch.
B00007M0CP|2|These rollers do not work well for fine hair. The rollers do not get hot enough for the curl to stay. I used these and it was a wast of my time and money. The curl did not stay in my hair. My hair is fine and dose not hold a curl easily. I read the reviews and I was excited to try these but I the results were  disappointing.
B00112DS64|3|Two of them were opened and used
B00K63FE48|4|LOVE IT!
B00GLFBC2I|5|FITS GREAT
B0013L9V2S|5|I love this oil.
B0032B3RTK|1|This makes my hair look worse.  I cannot recommend this product at all.  It makes my hair sticky if I use a little too much and no matter how much or little I use does nothing to make it appear thicker.
B003YY5LLC|1|I did not receive the correct product. The ingredients listed in the description are different and the product itself is not the same as the other bottles I have used. I've used this cleanser for a while now and could tell something was off.... Maybe it's an old formula???
B004BCXAM8|5|LOVE THIS MASCARA SO MUCH! I rather use this mascara than my mac mascara ! Love it so much!
B00JAOUJ6M|5|I haven't been a fan of bar soap for years - it got too easy to get mired into the body wash game. I was attracted to the Vi-Tae Oatmeal Spice Soap because of the ingredient list - it's simple to read. I don't lead an extremely crunchy lifestyle, but I do find myself reading labels more as I get older. Why do we need so many chemicals?<br /><br />The Oatmeal Spice Soap lathers up, make me feel clean, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I don't feel the need that I have to slather on body cream as soon as I get out of the shower so that my legs and arms don't feel scaly and dry. I haven't tried it on my face, but for winter skin? The oatmeal is also a natural method to exfoliate, so my skin looks a little brighter, too.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my inspection and unbiased opinion.
B00JO0DC3E|5|I absolutely love and ADORE this product! It's honestly the perfect combination of color and moisture! Imagine your favorite lipstick, got a little hot and heavy with an Eos ball, and nine months later had this little gem! ;)
B00D5TB1LK|4|Mine arrived safely! Awesome size, seriously way bigger than I imagined it would be. The colors are nice, the only thing is the middle bottom color is like a peach color. That's the only reason I gave it a 4. It was packaged nicely, and with so much bubble wrap. So no worries on that!
B004RRH7R6|4|This hairspray has been around forever and still holds just as well. It is unscented which is nice. Good product for a reasonable price. Ordered it here because it is no longer being carried in our local store.
B0010H687Q|4|great product saw a difference within two uses. the taste is not so good but goes away within 30 minutes
B00A8DHHNC|3|They are alright! they don't look the same as the picture, mine are square, but still work. Just unexpected! One of mine was also cracked, but it doesn't leak(:
B001SAUBOQ|5|I waited for several weeks before I wrote this because self-tanners weirdly morph on me.  I have bought and used many high end salon/cosmetic counter tanners that cost well over $40 for a bare 6 ounces and they *pale* in comparison to this product.  First for me, it has zero chemical preservatives, it smells perfectly fine when applying, but the color I achieve is way better then what I get if I'm in the sun.  I'm fair-skinned and burn easily, and the results usually aren't that great.  When I use this, I get that perfect golden tanned color and it works amazingly well on my face also.  There will always be that self-tanning aroma, but with this product, its very slight.  The tanning process is fairly quick and it has not stained or transferred to my clothing.  I am hoping that this will always be available.
B0018FNUXU|5|Excellent for cleaning my Invisalign retainers. When used with Retainer Brite all stains and odors are removed in just a few minutes.
B001G7POTI|5|Not finding this item in stores anymore, thought I'd give Amazon a shot. The order was promptly processed and was received in record time. Targon is a wonderful product for smokers.
B004Y9H1QO|5|I love this gloss it is really pretty and it smells wonderful as well I always get compliments. Make sure to wear lip balm under it, it can be a little drying.
B001BKLGHY|5|This is what my mom wanted for mother's day and so I tried buying it online.  It arrived so fast and in a little cute bag which was perfect to give to her in.  She loved it.  I wouldn't mind buying one for myself.  I love bobbi brown.  I am really glad I purchased this for my mom!
B000NFEX46|5|I shave my head everyday, and I have been for about five years.  The Dead blade makes it quick and easy to do.  I use the AstraPlus blades in mine.  This last one, I bought the finger loop is flexible, and makes it feel pretty good in the hand.<br /><br />I do fine that I end up replacing the shaver about every 18 months.  I end up breaking the piece that holds the blades on.  Other than that I am a completely satisfied.
B00193BONE|1|Couldn't hold me up
B004B8AZH0|5|Good value.
B001ET764E|5|I'm a large (overweight) man, and sweat A LOT.  I had tried many different types of products before I found this one.  It's the only one I've found which works, but I want to make sure it's clear that this product needs to be applied AS SOON AS POSSIBLE after you finish washing.  I get out of the shower, dry my arm pits, and then apply this.  Doing this, it lasts for more than 24 hours.  If I wait, and apply it after I finish doing my hair, or shaving, it doesn't work anywhere near as well.  I apply it liberally both above and below my armpit.  I've seen other reviews talk about the fact that after a while, it will come out of the holder.  I don't have a solution for this, and agree it's an issue.  But, it's one I'm willing to deal with since this eliminates body odor for me for over 24 hours.
B0073FCJQS|4|Works as it says.  Takes one use to get used to.  After that it takes five mins or less to be hair free.
B001CT079C|5|Very good
B00EB55GCW|5|Love this product
B00IPNEHB2|5|great quality and it really helps my face to make smooth. I have really dry skin and even the lines near eyes were gone once I put the oil couple of times a day. I can mix with your moisturizing lotion/BB cream/makeup base etc. Or put one drop on your palm and apply to eyes and it really works to make fine lines gone away.
B00EUFZR72|4|not to bad. i really like the smell. i bought it for my girlfriend, i fell in love with her wen she wear it lol.
B0012JY4G4|5|This worked like a charm. Just follow the directions by the letter. I had reddish hair that wouldn't fade out on my blonde, so I used this to get the 8+ month dye out. No issues. The smell bothered my husband, but not me. Worth it for the hair correction. Way cheaper than going to a salon.
B00GKHE28S|5|They have the right weight and feel to them. Jade is a wonderful stone. I'd like another pair. They are large but easily manipulated. Definitely recommend!
B0014XAGMO|5|Great
B00PYMVPEY|5|Using the Anti Wrinkle Cream has lessened the wrinkles and almost diminished the crows feet.  With continued use i'm sure the remaining fine lines will be removed.
B009CJHXDW|4|Great product.  Fast affordable product.
B00HJDIAGC|5|I've only ever used the Crest whitestrips before I tried Shine Whitening; I have to tell you, they work really well (much better than I first expected). Definitely worth the money - especially when comparing to Crest
B00HFRJH14|5|This case is the same high quality of the case that my orthodontist provided me for my custom retainers.  The difference is that this one looks much better because of the wonderful colors and shiny finish.  This case has an air hole to allow the retainers to dry out so that they are not slimy the next time I put them on. I actually bought several so that I could keep one each place where I might need it rather than having to carry it around with me.  This product was shipped promptly after I placed the order.  I highly recommend these cases!
B0076JA9OA|5|Works and feels great on hair.  Makes it smooth and shiny. You only need a tiny bit as Aalittle bit goes a long way.
B001U0OQN6|5|Thanks!  I received  item as  expected, very satisfied.
B000FKGRMK|5|I love this stuff!  Great for curly hair that gets those frizzy flyaways.  Smooths them all out.  Price for 2-pack is cheaper than in salon buying one at a time.
B004LZA5J6|5|I Am soooo happy I bought this straightener. It works amazing and the nail polish was very pretty. I'm a very happy customer
B00CFNVWRA|1|Cream smells badly
B00KQC7X5M|5|I am really pleased with this cream. I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area. I apply the cream twice a day at morning and night.  The smell is light and to me smells a little summery. I was actually really surprised how well this cream works. I used it one day and then went clothes shopping and when I looked in the dressing room mirror with horrible fluorescent lighting my thighs looked a lot smoother. I have also been exercising more so I think in combination with a toning regime this helps reduce the appearance of cellulite and make your skin firmer. The formula is not sticky or greasy either which I like. Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too so I don't need to use an additional lotion on top of this cream. I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym. Or, if you just want smoother, firmer skin.
B004TSFBVW|5|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CLEAN SMELLING PARFUM
B000E7STAM|5|Excellent scent
B00381A7OW|5|My ophthalmologist suggested that I had &#34;dry eyes&#34; when I complained about burning and the constant need to put drops in my eyes.  When I started washing my face with Sebamed (pH balanced) face wash, the problem - caused by washing my face with strong body liquid soap - disappeared.  I keep a supply in the shower and at the sink and only wash my (rather oily) face with it.  Great stuff.  I told my ophthalmologist during my next eye exam and he was pleased, but had no clue that soap could have been the cause of my problem.
B007RIEYGO|5|I have been using anew for the past year and it works great! I am 52 and have senseitive skin and have to watch what I put on my face. I use this together with the night cream and eye cream. I always get my puchase earlier than it says it will arrive and you can't beat the price you get on amazon!
B0081CWUE8|5|Don't know how this stuff could clean hair when it's made of oils, but it does! My hair is dry and damaged from constantly coloring it, but it definitely feels softer when I use the cleanser instead of shampoo. Brings out my waves without them looking like a hot mess.<br />Does take some getting used to since there's no lather. I use more pumps than the instructions call for, massage really well, and then leave it in a clip while I do my other shower stuff. The smell is awesome too! Only downside is if I'm in a hurry, it's faster to just use shampoo.
B008VU6ZN2|1|I was very disappointed when I received these as only half are really glitter and the other half are just color powder. Guess I should have been a little more diligent in reading prior reviews and the product description.

B000NL20EK|5|I have tried MANY of Special Effects brand's various shades of hair dye and I think I'd have to say that this one is by far the strongest. I recommend being very careful with it, however, and bearing in mind that it takes some time to stop rubbing off onto things. That's the only con I would apply to it. It will stain EVERYTHING and ANYTHING that it touches, it seems, which is a side-effect of how strong the dye is. For me, it was absolutely worth it as we have cleaning products that were able to remove it from the sink, walls, etc. where I may have accidentally splashed purple water or what have you. Our cleaning products are natural, BTW, nothing insanely strong or anything. That all being said, I am extremely pleased with the color and resilience of this dye. For many years now I have bleached my hair and dyed it wonderful, bright colors and frequently. However, once I became pregnant, I was determined to abstain from all unnatural chemicals - including hair dye - while pregnant and into breast feeding and so on in order to minimize exposure for my child. My hair, unfortunately, was already chemically treated and I knew that it would only look worse over time so I decided to try and use this dye to color it in the hopes that it would last throughout pregnancy - perhaps even somewhat permanently...? Well, my wish was granted! Oh boy, was it ever. I only had to use it one time and even after rinsing and shampooing it THREE TIMES in a row immediately after rinsing, the water was still rinsing purple and it had not faded in the least. It's been many weeks now since I dyed it and it has hardly begun to fade at all. It's still very dark and looks awesome. I'm very confident that it will not be fading to any kind of undesirable color anytime in the near future which is exactly what I'd hoped for. :) As a plus, it looks great with my natural brown hair which is growing in - another thing I was hoping for. I highly recommend this color to anyone who wants a dark, truly deep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first. After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first. Naturally black hair will attain a very dark purple sheen to it but any other shade of hair color ought to come out full on dark eggplant purple. My natural color is a fairly dark brown. However, I cannot promise that it will last quite as long on hair which is not chemically treated in any way prior to using it as my natural roots have faded back to brown by now. The rest of my hair had been dyed a natural shade of reddish-brown and that portion of my hair is still entirely a quite dark shade of purple. I would say that the color is identical in my hair to the circle in this small photo provided.<br /><br />To re-cap:<br /><br />Pros - Works like a dream! Lasts seemingly forever on previously chemically treated hair, will cover any color, although will most likely only tint actual black hair, and initially shows up just as well on hair which is not previously chemically treated. I believe that it will NOT fade to any undesirable shades! Possibly ever. Haha.<br /><br />Cons - Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner's soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two. My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple. :P (Everything else which came into contact with it and was stained has been cleaned successfully) It might be a little bit rough on your hair, depending on your hair type and how damaged it is to begin with, but the texture improves over time while the color remains. My hair feels fine now. :) No other cons here!ep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first.

B00D879BFW|5|Excellent
B003O4H2L4|4|When I ordered this item, I thought it was just like my regular cuticle remover before. I'm happy when I used it, it's much better and easier. Just need to apply it on top of the cuticle areas and after a minute or so, they are easier to remove. Glad I ordered this. It helped me in my Do-It-Yourself manicure and pedicure. :)
B005F4DRWE|5|Very pleased with the product.  It did what I wanted it to do.  It moisturized my hair without leaving it oily.
B001841FKQ|3|Hair clips are thin and cheap. One of the brushes arrived all twisted to one side so I can´t even use it. The other items are ok and useful. I like the plastic bag it comes with. Overall feels kind of cheap but it does the job, so its OK. I loved the big comb- so, mixed feelings.
B00L02X6BM|4|I absolutely loved this piece but one thing is that it kept falling out. Other than that it's good to use for work or for places you cant have nose jewelry.
B00B4C35IW|5|I really like this facial cleanser.  It leaves my face nice and clean feeling and doesn't cause my skin to burn or itch
B0033EWRSI|5|I had used this product for a little over a year, then tried another upper eyelid lifter that I had heard was good and was less expensive.  It did not work at all.  I went back to Bremenn and immediately my eyelids appeared much less droopy.  I don't intend to use anything else ever again.  This product delivers on what it promises.
B002XITX8C|4|Gave it as a gift. Good price. Arrived on time.
B00005NAOD|2|used this product for 2 weeks. I developed a rash. Not for me
B002RT09E4|1|I have ordered from Eden's Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we've ordered quite a few, and every time we've received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!
B0009MFUN6|3|I am giving this 3 stars although mine is broken.  Let me tell you about the good first.  The cleaning system is pretty cool, and works well.  I just wish the liquid didn't evaporate so quickly.  &lt;Hint, if you want to have your liquid last a while, put only about 1/5 of the bottle in at a time, you'll only clean the razor about once a month anyway, and it will evaporate in about 2 weeks.>  But it being part alcohol - that makes sense that it evaporates.  The shave is close, although rough on the skin.  The head doesn't move as smoothly along my face as my old norelco.  Another positive is that is uses the same recharging cable as my old norelco (I think all norelco chargers are the same).<br /><br />Now the bad.  At home, this razor was perfect.  It has about 80 minutes of juice in it and i only need to charge it about once every 3 months, since I have a secondary norelco I keep in my gym bag and use that one when I'm at work.  My secondary battery finally wouldn't hold a charge, so I had to replace it with my new 9170XLCC.  Well, every time I would take it out of my gym bag, the head would be popped open.  This is because the button to open the head actually sticks out from the body, and anything can snag it and it will spring open.  You don't even need to 'press' the button, you just need to touch it.  Well, today it was, as usual, popped open.  The only difference now is that it won't close.  It probably twisted a little while in the open position and now the blades are unaligned with the head, and it won't snap shut.  I can get a piece of tape and tape it shut, which works, but that is not the point.  Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  Not only is it bad in the sense that the head can twist when popped open, but I also have little hairs all over the bottom of my bag because it kept popping open.<br /><br />So that's my review - it worked as a razor, but don't plan on travelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I'm very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.  I mean, what's the point of a cordless razor if you can't take it anywhere with you?ravelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.

B004N26SSE|3|After using daily through two bottles, there is not any noticeable change in the amount of tartar on my teeth. It does not appear to do much besides other than add flavoring to the water in the water pic.

B000C1Z66U|5|As an unrefined, working class girl who isn't adverse to drinking boxed wine, never learned to walk gracefully in heels, would take a Ford over a BMW, prefers Egyptian musk scented oil to Chanel No5, and would choose hot wings over the most expertly prepared sushi, take my review with a grain of salt if you have expensive taste and actually care what other people consider fashionable:  This scent is timeless and sexy.  If you can erase from your mind the Ghosts of Guidos Past and their souped up Camaros, really bad techno music, freakishly rippling muscles, roid rages, gold chains, Z Cavaricci pants, and crunchy hair, then please resurrect this hypnotizing fragrance.  You no longer have to be named Vito, Tony, Vinny, Paulie, or Joey to wear Drakkar.  It works on Edward and Brian and James too.  It's outdated and out of style and you'll probably be the butt of all jokes if you wear it around your friends, but I can almost guarantee that when you're alone with your special lady, you won't be sorry.  It's an aphrodisiac ...  clean, masculine, and just plain intoxicating.  A little squirt of this manly ambrosia (LOL) on a strong, warm, slightly hairy chest and I can almost guarantee that MILF panties will be flying off.  I won't let my man wear it unless I'm with him.  I don't want to have to fight off an army of cackling Real Housewives of New Jersey wannabes.
B001EGQ12U|2|This is a great mousse--when you can get it to work. It is so difficult to press down the nozzle I ended up throwing out several bottles in despair--and gave up.
B000NBQUNW|5|A friend of mine told me about them.  Her doctor recommended them to her and I thought I'd give them a try.
B001EU78DC|4|Love the smell.  I don't like how small the pads are.  They feel &#34;dry&#34;.  Takes 3 pads to really do the trick.
B00006JN4H|5|I have a tad bit of brassiness, but i am over all very,very happy with the color. Thankfully, I have a toner to cover any brass.<br />I grew up a blonde that would go almost white in the summer. now that I am over 50, there's lots of ash grey with white. I was very hesitant to try to color again on my own, but my history with L'Oreal has been good prior to all this grey, so I gave this champagne blonde(8.5) a go, and I am very pleased with the results.
B001VD2DMI|3|I was hoping this was like the one that my stylist used when she did a blow out on my hair. Either I am really clumsy or this brush isn't what I needed. Where her brush gave me volume and a soft curl, this one gave me frizz.<br /><br />I'm holding on to it, hopefully with practice my style will look better. The one pro, my hair did dry really fast.
B00MBVR96O|1|Despite the great reviews, despite the fact that the description says it's calibrated, this product did not work for me.  Maybe mine was just defective, but the ends did not meet properly (one side was bowed) and they didn't grip anything I tried to use them on.
B000JR59LY|5|I like the way it slightly tingles, not much but you can feel it working.i will definitely<br />will be reordering this scalp creme.

B00KWP3SA2|5|Love It!!

B008GOR6O0|4|I really like this palette. It's great and it doesn't make my skin oily either.
B00E3P7NQC|5|I used this stuff about 10 years ago, and was happy to see it was still available. Great for sensitive skin, so moisturizing that I only use it at night. I am allergic to everything and have had no reaction to this product, other than smooth moisturizer skin.

B009O3BCT2|3|Very happy with my bamboo brushes. Will recommend to others. I just started using it, so not sure how long it will last, but so far, my mouth is pleased.    Update, 12/16/14: I took off the very because: They don't last too long. I like the feel of the brush and love the ecological aspect, but the bristles don't really last that long. One thing to consider is: What type of brusher are you? I'm a dedicated brusher, who usually does the approximate 2 minutes of brushing, everywhere, every angle, at least twice around. That might be longer than the normal user. Still, I suppose a brush lasting for a couple weeks to a month isn't horrible, if you can stretch the month. Normally, I change a head or get a new brush once the bristles start going (as dentists recommend). I used this brush until I felt I had to dump it, just to try and make it last. One my second brush and bristles are starting to go (started a week ago). Will continue to monitor and see how they go. Other than not lasting as long as I'd prefer, I do really like the brushes.
B000F4EMP0|5|Have used for years once a week for thinning hair.  Good product.  Big bottle, good price
B006U32H66|5|This is a awesome fragrance that Bath and Body Works has decided to discontinue.  Words can not express how refreshing the sleep is that you receive after using this.  I ordered it and it was delivered before expected and I am very pleased with my product.
B000LQ30AA|5|This little gem of a sample bag packs a HUGE punch! It's filled with a great cross section of goodies from Indigo Wild, the maker of Zum products. It makes a perfect hostess gift, welcome gift or just an anytime day brightener. I found myself using products that I never thought I would, such as the lip balm, simply because they're all so good. Now I want more Zum -- especially the fabulous soap that heals my hands, rather than triggering a breakout.
B003B6QNJW|5|Excellent
B0014P8L9W|1|Dont let all the good reviews fool you! I have acne scars so I hoped this mask would get rid of them for me. I didnt have much acne before I used this.

B004FDSD8E|5|This product was initially recommended to me by my salon professional. Although I generally don't purchase higher end products like this, I was sold as soon as I got the first product home from my salon as within a day or two, the dryness around my eyes disappeared.  Other &#34;drugstore&#34; or department store products - including high end products - could not compare with this bioelements prodcuts.  Pair this with other bioelements eye products and you will not be disappointed.
B002LE54P4|5|Arrived quickly as promised.  Love this eye cream.
B0008ENT8I|5|I've been using this hair dryer for about four years now, and have no quarrel with it at all.  It is mounted on the bathroom wall, not far from the sink and mirror, and I use it after I shower and wash my hair.  It never fails to operate, is effective, and simple to use.  Perhaps if I had long, lush , thick hair I might not be satisfied, as some previous reviewers seem to feel, but for my everyday usage it is perfect.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and I like it.  It was reasonably priced, and quickly shipped.
B006X1H2P6|5|After chemo I found I had curly, thick, tough toenails that were just about to dig into the skin of my toes.  I couldn't find any standard clippers that could cut these toenails but this nipper was a wonderful surprise.  I ordered them with little expectation that anything could help me.  Using this nipper, I easily cut my toenails.  My feet feel so much better in shoes now because my nails are cut.  Also, my nails look much better now that they're that they're evenly cut.  I would definitely recommend you get these if you've got &#34;challenging&#34; toenails like mine!
B007N19E74|3|okay not as good as living proof flex shaping hairspray
B000EPJNMW|2|Not very happy with these rollers. The large n medium rollers are not as big as I thought. They heat heat up well. But the clips spring off the rollers and the rollers fall out of your hair. :-(

B0001IVKYG|5|Have used this for years. Recently the old one stopped working after several years of daily use, and I was unable to find the size 1 1/2&#34; anywhere. I had to use a smaller size that was not appropriate for my hair length. When this finally came back in stock I was thrilled and ordered right away! The model has been updated, but all good. Am considering buying a second one to have on hand.
B001J0V7S4|5|One thing you have to know about Marseille Soap (\\"Savon de Marseille\\") is that its name is not registered or protected by a trademark. Therefore, anyone in China, Turkey or any other place in the world can make  cheap industrial soap and name it \\"Savon de Marseille\\".<br />So, how do you make sure you are buying REAL Marseille Soap?<br /><br />Well, the only way to be certain is to only get soap that comes from one of these 4 factories :<br /><br />-Savonnerie Marius Fabre, located in Salon de Provence (brand name \\"Marius Fabre\\").<br />-Savonnerie Le Sérail, located in Marseille (brand name: \\"Le Sérail)<br />-Savonnerie Le Fer à Cheval, located in Marseille (brand name: \\"Le Fer à Cheval\\")<br />-Savonnerie du Midi, located in Marseille (brand Names: \\"La Corvette\\" and \\"Compagnie du Savon de Marseille\\")<br /><br />To my knowledge, these are the only 4 factories that still produce Marseille soap the old-fashion way, cooking it and stirring it manually for several days (the whole process of making this soap takes about 10 to 14 days, when industrial soaps are produced in just a few hours).<br /><br />I hope this helps you! :)<br /><br />And... do you know that Marseille Soap is also great for  washing your laundry and for brushing your teeth?
B003987CL0|5|The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle is easy to grasp and use and the shave is like nothing you've experienced before.  The ProGlide razor I used was from a free offer from Gillette.  When I first used it, it was so smooth that I stopped to check to see if the plastic cover was still over the blades.  Unlike my old razor, the ProGlide massages my face such that I don't even know I'm shaving.  There are no more pulls and snags on my beard like my old razor.  I also used the trimmer blade around my sideburns and it was very effective at shaping the sides with excellent control.  Hands down, it is the smoothest shave I have ever experienced.
B003WYSZKI|4|This powder seems to work just fine.  However I found it to be only slightly cheaper per dosage than Lactaid tablets and capsules.  It's much more convenient to keep tablets/capsules in my purse/desk, so I will be switching to Lactaid when this product is gone.  The other slight negative is that it does not always mix into whatever liquid I am using.  Fine for me, but not a great thing when using with a younger child.
B0068YUBCE|2|I can work with the colors if I really want to, not as pigmented as I expected at all. I'd go ahead and get the actual Coast Scents palette that they offer, because ive heard it is a lot better quality. Contemplating purchasing that one to compare. Spend more money and get an actual brand one.
B00OH3NWBK|5|Worked great for the holes in my windchimes, so I could resting them.
B00009RF1E|5|It works okay and it is an excellent bargain at that price
B000L978FU|5|Before using this product, I tried Tom's natural deodorant, Earth Science Rosemary and Mint, and a third I returned so fast that I do not remember the name. Tom's was the worst offender: causing a TERRIBLE rash with peeling and raw skin. I moved on to the earth science brand, hoping that would fix things, but the rash never healed (this was with minimal use of the ES deodorant.) Then I tried the third brand, still no healing.<br /><br />FINALLY, a month later I am having relief and healing because of this brand! Even better, it works better than the other natural deodorants! It is not as good as the regular, toxic brands, but it does keep body odor at bay for the most part! And that includes while being at the gym, which I do 5 days a week, and this stuff works great!
B00J86HFB4|5|Works great.  I love the electric plug-in.  No changing batteries constantly!
B00BKUHIBI|5|Packed great, it was just what I was expecting!  I had looked several places for this particular color and finally found it online!  Thanks!
B0010L8XZM|5|works great
B00QMP79QK|5|A great mini facial for busy people! I love it. I have a job & 2 small kids and no time for myself. I wash my face and put the mask on and it's like a mini facial ~ it smells really good, doesn't give that &#34;over tight&#34; feeling that some clay masks do. And you don't need to moisturize afterward because it's a hydrating mask so it leaves your skin feeling soft. It only takes about 5 - 10 mins. It also pulls toxins out and my face was clearer once I started using it.
B006D634Z8|5|Great product and great price. Easy to use, nice case & even the sheep don't seem to mind it....too much! ;)
B00JKRGVB6|3|Bristles are shorter than what my husband is use to
B00FOGZPUU|4|Sally Hansen Moisture Twist lip glosses are amazing I have gone throught multiples and keep going back. My favourite colour is Berry Blend which gives a natural berry colour while still moisturizing my lips. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is the packaging feels cheap but other than that they are amazing. Wonderful for daily use.
B0058DBV20|5|I tried this product while staying at a hotel for a week. I was hooked. My hair is wavy and can get a bit frizzy. Somehow this product helps with the frizz and volume even while I let my hair air dry.  This shampoo leaves something behind but it's not greasy. I do however,  have to wash my hair every other day. I love this shampoo. I had to order it on amazon because I couldn't find it at the local store.
B00GQ9I9IO|2|I wanted to love this stuff, because of the great reviews, but honestly it seems to do nothing whatsoever except dry on your face....I won't bother to purchase this again.
B006RFZ66K|1|Its after-effects are horrible. My skin felt assaulted even an hour after using it and it left marks on me as well. It only de-clogged SOME of my pores, but not all... I don't have many blackheads to begin with, so I expected full cleaning of my pores. I was disappointed to say the least.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone.... it's very harsh on the skin and not effective overall.
B009RNUH4A|5|Can I just start by saying that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!!<br /><br />Why do I love it???<br /><br />1. I suffer from eczema and staying moisturized is a major concern for me. Anything that helps with that is a major plus.<br /><br />2. It is designed to spray from any angle!!! Yes, ANY Angle!! Even upside down.<br /><br />3.There isn't an over bearing scent so it doesn't irritate my eczema!!<br /><br />The spray is continuous and steady. It covers well and leaves no greasy residue! I will definitely by using this product from now on!
B00HOHLKY2|5|Excellent product. I have been using almost a month and I notice my skin with less wrinkles and less dark spots. I recommend it to anyone.
B003B9DWMA|4|I love shea butter and this one is good quality. It blends well with other oils and feels great on my hair and skin.
B000NL0T1G|5|Nice and heavy. Beautiful. I hope to use this for many years to come.
B00CHTK5U2|5|Really works on my dry skin and a bottle lasted over a year.  Great buy.
B003UBK5II|5|Love it! Arrived quickly. Nicely packaged. Looks and smells great, nice and fresh. Looks just like the block at our local natural foods store but it's $7 less on Amazon. I chopped a hunk off (carefully because it's not easy to cut) and made a lovely salve. This will last a long time for me.
B00CFBHEHY|5|First off, it's not often when I buy something that has no product reviews on Amazon. But I gave this a chance. I am very happy to say it is the product I wanted.<br /><br />Now on to why I love this product! I first bought for the first time at a mall kiosk and I was running out. So I started to see if I could find a cheaper substitute at my local Target. That didn't happen. What makes Premier Dead Sea Salt different is that it doesn't dissolve in water. So you can use it in the shower, or to just wash your hands. You can easily wash it off and even better, it leaves you feelings EXTREMELY clean.
B0006PQ6D4|5|I use it all the time to do my massages, it's easy to work with washes out of the sheets and everyone seems to love it.
B000JFBD5W|5|Been using this for years....good product
B00GMDIKV0|5|Took a while to get here but I love it! The material is so nice and it applies my foundation flawlessly!
B00I6E4FQM|5|I am in love with this duo, I reach for it every single time I wear makeup. I love the bronzer for contouring - while in the pan it looks like it has some sparkle, that doesn't really transfer to the face, so what you see on your cheeks is a matte bronzer which is easy to blend and simply perfect for getting that chiseled look (I am fair skinned, so I cannot use this shade as an overall bronzer - I don't like that look anyways, so I have no issues with the darkness of the bronzer). It's great that it doesn't look orange at all on. The blush is very nice as well and it's pigmented. What a steal for the money ($3 each on the ELF website)! ELF put out two new shades of this product some time ago. The Powder brush is full and absolutely awesome for liquid/powder foundation, blush or bronzer.
B00NTB6CPE|5|I absolutely love this brush for my daughters hair.  She has long fine hair but lots of it and gets knots that are hard to get out.  She uses this brush on her own and finds it easy to hold and gets the knots out with ease.  I would reccomend this to any parent that fights with their child when brushing their hair.
B001A0CTLW|5|Love it!
B001PLOMJS|1|Received product in great shape, Looked for Expiration date. Could not find, Bottle had a Junk sticker applyed to back, Carefully pealed sticker back and it was convienently covering Exp date which is NEXT month, Cannot use whole bottle in 1 month, Unless I used it on 100 people? What a waste, Cheap company seling expired products,
B002UQAUGG|5|I have very complicated hair but this moisturizes it completely. Also if you have the most tangled extensions ever this will revive any human hair extension. Leave it in for hours and it's a miracle.
B001MIZMP2|5|Good
B0068M4E6A|3|Fast shipping but the color and scent is a little off from my previous one I had bought in a salon and this one seems more clumpy but I will still use it since I already paid for it.
B00I4A9PMM|5|this stuff works
B00AYCOLMC|5|I love this palette. I feel very fresh and pretty without looking overdone.
B00U21WRIK|5|I feel like I'm back cheerleading using these. Love them.
B008X20V6A|5|Perfect Valentine Gift in a nice shaped gift box. Beautiful colors to enhance and beatify facial appearance. I would order again.<br /><br />Thank you
B00KQVTX06|5|Love it! works great!
B004OEBRDW|5|Anything sulphur will stink but it feels like I am doing something good for myself and beauty always comes at a price.  I love that you can were in day or night and the odor does go away after a few hours.
B00C8YCFU4|5|This product is amazing! After the first week of using it, it left my skin really smooth but I did notice a lot more acne. I have used this product for three weeks now and it has started to clear my face up well! Remember that when using a new product you won't start seeing big differences until a couple of weeks so I would say even if it doesnt do anything in the first week or two keep on using it!
B007B469MG|5|I have used this product for years and it really does do the job ..Thanks
B004DUEN9M|5|usually I can only get the small 8oz bottles in my country. It was great having this size. I love this brand and this product in particular.<br /><br />It is rich and it makes the hair moist right through unlike the organics olive oil brand which is water and dries soon after.
B004DBB60A|5|My grandson had never heard of soap on a rope.  He was quite excited on receiving it.  He loved it.
B003983I1S|4|Let's get this out of the way before I jump into my review: I received these Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades for free as part of a promotional program run by Gillette.<br /><br />I have been a long-time user of Gillette products and typically use a Mach3 razor with the corresponding blades. I have been satisfied with the shave that I get using the Mach3 blades, but was curious to see how the \\"latest and greatest\\" from Gillette compared to what I had been using.<br /><br />As far as closeness of the shave, the ProGlide blades provided a similar shave to that of the Mach3 blades, but due to the 5 blades I was able to significantly cut down on number of blade strokes and therefore saved a good amount of time shaving. The blade head is flexible and easily moves along the contours of the face and neck. The blades are thin and sharp allowing for a comfortable and smooth shave without pulling your facial hair or causing irritation. The blades seem to be staying sharper longer than my typical blades and the lubricating strip, which really helps with the comfort of the shave, is definitely lasting longer.<br /><br />The only negative comment I have about the blades is the size of the blade head. Due to the 5 blades, the blade head is significantly larger than I am used to. This took some time to be accustomed to and was generally not a problem, other than in the areas of shaving my upper lip and chin. Due to the size of the blad head, I felt like I had some trouble comfortably shaving around the fold in my chin and also felt like I had some trouble fitting the razor head between my upper lip and nose. In the end I did get a close shave in those areas, but just felt I needed to take a little more time shaving those areas so I did not end up with cuts.<br /><br />I am happy with the blades and will likely continue to use them as I feel like they allow me to cut down on my overall shave time. I am taking just one star off my review for the slight awkwardness in shaving around the upper lip and chin.ound the upper lip and chin.
B00A3Z68VC|5|Love this stuff. Reasonably priced, smells fab and leaves your skin dark, smooth and streak free! Really does get noticeably darker tanning on the sunbed. Wouldn't buy anything else now!
B00Z75ZDAU|5|Have only used a few times but notice pores are reduced and face looks clearer. Has a good fragrance and easy to remove.
B007Q0WW0S|5|Great product!  I use it every day after I blow dry my hair.  I have color treated (cover the grey), shoulder length hair and just a tiny bit of this product each AM makes my hair shiny, soft and easy to work with.  i do not use a flat iron as it is intended for use with but and sure it would work great with that tool as well.  Great product!
B00396VE7U|5|I first bought this at my derm's office.  I am always looking for great ways to incorporate sunscreen into my daily regimen.  I mix some of this with my Lancôme foundation to increase the protection.  If I'm going to be outside on a super sunny day, I use it alone.  It also evens out your complexion and reduces the redness, which I like.
B005N3FBO4|5|It got here quickly and looks really silky, i just have to buy a wig brush because since its so long it tangles alot
B00C3HQB9C|5|I finally figured out the best way to use this (for me) and it's heavenly.  I am unfortunate to have very fine, thin hair. I have avoided conditioners all my life due to this hair and the disaster combining with anything to make it worse. My first attempts in using the Ghost Oil did not go well.  I began using it on my face and love the way that feels.  Finally, suffering from severe static electricity in winter, I spray a bit on my hands and rub together and gently smooth down the fly-aways.  A miracle!  It worked great and added a shine to my hair without the added weight.  I love this and will be getting more.
B000ST7OEI|5|This moisturizer is fabulous for combination skin.  It makes skin look smoother by reducing redness, so it's great to wear with or without makeup. It provides lots of moisture without clogging pores and it improved my skin over time (most other products do the opposite with my skin - usually they look great in the beginning, but over time can clog pores and make skin rougher.  This product doesn't do that).  Finally, a product that delivers on its promise...
B00KRAN6R2|4|They are perfect extensions. Recieved them in good condition. Great customer service. Their amazing. Had no problem with them.
B0029DEJ1M|1|I got suckered into buying not only the set with this day cream and night serum, but a year ago got suckered into the fit chews and energy fizzes.  My fault I guess!  Spent a total of $300 for about $15 worth of actual product.  Ill just write about this day cream now........I have tried a lot of day creams in my time and for $5, it wouldn't have been totally terrible if it were bad.  However, the price for the amount you get is sky high, and my eyes burned the entire day because one small fleck of lotion touched my eyelash in the process of putting it on.  I'm very careful but come on....It also made my 32 year old skin feel super dry after about an hour, so people that are even older than me may have a tough time with this as an all day moisturizer.  I have to say that I will never again buy anything Arbonne after hating each and every single product I've gotten.
B000FIFH46|5|Great for very short hair that still needs to be curled.  Iron gets nice and hot very quickly and stays hot for the duration of the curling!  This is a professional iron and has a nice long cord, adjustable heat control settings, and a comfortable handle.  Comes with extra spring clips, too.  I am a hairdresser and I have and use daily all Hot Tools irons, so does everyone I work with.  I have every size available, from the very large diameter to the smallest (this one the 3/8 inch).  They hold up for years even with heavy use.  When the springs get worn out all of the Hot Tools irons come with at least 2 extra springs so you can change them out.  In my opinion, Hot Tools customer service has always been nice to deal with should you ever need to contact them.
B000GGJCDY|5|I've been using this threader floss for years to get around my retainer wire bonded to the back side of my bottom teeth.  It's the only one on the market that works for me without shredding or leaving anything on the wire.  I have yet to find an acceptable substitute.  My only complaint is that every once in a while, when I pull the floss out of the package (they are individually wrapped), it knots up.  Sometimes I can work around the knot and sometimes I can't.  Minor issue, though.
B000P22WX6|5|believe it or not, this has been my personal scent since i discovered it in 1997. i had to use others before amazon came along (this is a really tough one to find in stores, actually) but would buy 2 or even 3 at a time when i did find it in any store.
B008JA27OK|3|I like the reviews that say which brand (and era) of curler the respective refill fits. It'a also helpful to hear the length and widths compared WITH A SPECIFIC BRAND. Also, I like to hear if the material is accurate, rubber, silicone, etc.  For the record ladies, it is so UN-helpful when you say a refill pad does (or does not) fit your curler, and then you fail to identify which curler you have.<br /><br />*What I haven't seen in the helful reviews is the key-to-the-differences between the Rosallini colors.* Some are clearly longer, and others shorter. 1.6&#34; for hot pink, green, 1.2&#34; for black, white, light blue, 1.3&#34; for light pink.  From the reviews the hardness also varies by color.  Does anyone know the key? I couldn't find a rosallini website.<br /><br />The Rosallini Colors are each different -- but how????<br /><br />SO HERE IS A SUMMARY. When you write a review PLEASE say which pad you bought, including dimensions, and what brand of curler you have, and how old it is.<br /><br />PINK (HOT)<br />Pad Length : 4.1cm / 1.6&#34; (Length)<br />Net Weight : 3g Package : 6 x Rubber Eyelash Curler Pad<br /><br />PINK (LIGHT)<br />Total Size : 3 x 0.3 cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.13&#34; (L*W)<br />Net Weight : 3g Pacage Content : 8 x Eyelash Curler  Pad<br /><br />ORANGE (Pale)<br />Flat Size : 3.4 x 3.3cm/1.33&#34; x 1.29&#34;(L*D) (MUST BE INACCURATE)<br />Weight : 10g Package Content : 8 x Eyelash Curler Pads<br /><br />ORANGE (Bright)<br />Flat Size : 3 x 0.3 x 0.3cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.12&#34; x 0.12&#34;(L*W*T)<br />Weight : 7g Package : 8 x Eyelash Curler Pads<br /><br />GREEN (DARK)<br />Pad Length : 4.1cm / 1.6&#34; (Length)<br />Net Weight : 8g Package : 6 x Rubber Eyelash Curler Pad<br /><br />GREEN (LIGHT)<br />Pad Size : 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm / 1.4&#34; x 0.16&#34; x 0.16&#34; (L*W*T)<br />Net Weight : 10g Package : 6 x Eyelash Curler Rubber Pad<br /><br />LIGHT BLUE<br />Each Size : 3.1 x 0.4 x 0.35cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.16&#34; x 0.14&#34;(L*W*T)<br />Weight : 10gPackage: 8 x Eyelash Curler Pad<br /><br />BABY BLUE<br />Total Size : 3 x 0.3 cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.13&#34; (L*W)<br />Net Weight : 3.0g Package: 8 x Eyelash Curler  Pads<br /><br />BLACK<br />Total Size : 3 x 0.3 cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.12&#34; (L*W)<br />Net Weight : 19g Package: 12 x Eyelash Curler  Pads<br /><br />WHITE<br />Flat Size : 3 x 0.3 x 0.3cm / 1.2&#34; x 0.12&#34; x 0.12&#34;(L*W*T)<br />Weight : 7g Package: 8 x Eyelash Curler Pads<br /><br />THESE ARE PALE PINK, CALLED &#34;PINK&#34; (But the hot pink are called pink too.)
B000A1FFRM|1|I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try. <br /> <br />Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge.  After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews.  <br /> <br />You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver. <br />
B000P22TW0|5|Best old school 90s cologne. Period.
B005UL1B34|5|I was scared that it would arrive broken up but thankfully nothing was. The colors are so pretty and pigmented. Glad I bought it.
B004RXI7T2|5|great product
B006HB0KW4|5|amazing clippers and trimmers very very lightweight and very very quiet. I would highly recommend these to anybody who is looking for a professional pair of clippers.
B00EP5S7HE|5|i have used this stuff a couple times...just got it...im pretty happy with it.....everytime i put it on...i apply it better....make sense...it is simple to do...it dries instantly....the price is great......i think i will try extreme next.......
B000BNG5I2|5|I absolutely adore this lip balm. It has a delicious scent and mildly sweet flavor. In fact, it smells exactly like the Cinnamon Buns shower gel. It has a nice shine to it and feels great on. I like this stuff much better than the Kiss Me balms. I'm officially hooked.
B00158N0V2|5|Nice scent, and not too overbearing. Lathers very well! Taylor of Old Bond, will be the only shaving soap that I use going forward! Love it! And, I'm looking forward to trying there other scents. However, it seems like this refill will be lasting me for several months! Great Product!
B0002EB0NU|1|This product may work for someone with very smooth skin, but for me it was blotchy and cakey. Couldn't wait to wash it off, I mean scrub! Undoubtedly with some expertise, the product could go on more evenly, just not my luck.
B002QFGKUQ|5|This product arrived within 24 hours of ordering it. It was packaged extremely well and survived shipping with no issues.  The tray is beautiful and is of great quality.  I will definitely re-order this product when I am ready for another.  The colors are great, although a little different than they appear on the computer screen.  Basically the lightest color is white and the contrast between the 2 med shades is greater than it appears in the photo.  This makes it even more valuable to me because I was really only planning on using the darkest and lightest shades and one of the blushes.<br />This is a great value! Enjoy, I know I will!
B00G6T4U2I|5|Awesome product.
B0002Z8GEK|3|It's ok not really worth spending the money. Would not want anyone to buy this product. A waste of good money.
B0065MXKM2|5|This is definitely one of my favorite body oils ever! They have so many great scents and whenever I wear it I feel like I'm wearing just the right amount of fragrance - not too strong and not too invisible. My favorite scents are Coconut Verbena, Ocean and Strawberry. I usually apply it on my neck and wrists, and feel like I smell fresh and sweet all day.
B000F7E79I|5|Nice product
B00JAJNDZ6|5|I would never expect a pill to give me healthy hair, and yet this pill is doing just that.  I've on my second month of these and couldn't be happier.  I suffer from plaque psoriasis of the scalp and a recent breakout left me with a LOT of bald spots.  I began taking these pills along with my psoriasis treatment to hit it from the inside and outside, and I'm thrilled with the results.  My hair is thicker, longer, fuller, and the bald spots show new growth.  The seller is a dream to work with too!  It's just an excellent vitamin to take that benefits the hair.  Top notch, never stop selling this product!
B005Q06WBU|5|Just got it today....Applied it per instructions once...absorbed fast ....puffiness almost gone....this can't be for real...Will try it again two times per day as per instructions...
B0001B433I|5|These trimmers cut very precisely straight out of the box.  Being an andis man I was very skeptical about buying these but whal has made me a proud and almost surly a repeat customer but hopefully not for the same product...
B003LFP79A|2|I was expecting this to be more of a creamy butter, similar to Shea butter consistency so that I could blend it in with my other natural oils that I put in my hair and it was not. I actually would not purchase this again and I guess depending on what you are looking to use this for I wouldn't recommend it either.
B0080KLYBQ|5|If you like BareMinerals and have tried to purchase something from their website, it is difficult to do so without purchasing a package of some sort.<br /><br />With Amazon, I simply scanned in the barcode on the bottom of my empty jar, and voila - it was in my mailbox in just a short time.  (not a premier member).<br /><br />just don't pull off the sliding top as shown in this photo.  the idea is to help regulate the amount o powder by using that little door thingy to open and close the powder.  I sprinkle a little in the lid and use it that way rather than tearing the thing apart.
B00MXHN2L2|5|this is a great product! I love that it is so natural looking and super-easy to apply. The dark blonde color is what I use, and I apply it with a few quick strokes. The pale pink highlighter is great and subtle for the brow bone, and just gives a very polished, natural look.
B00AUFS3UO|5|I used this mascara, tonight. I used an eyelash curler first and then I applied the mascara, wiggling up my lashes.  This was not clumpy, have me longer lashes and was really nice looking on.  I'm glad I bought this product.
B004L2B3BS|5|I purchased this product for my dad as a Christmas gift and he loved it. He always had psoriasis and recently had cancer which due to radiation and chemo caused him to lose some hair... since he always took pride in his hair (which is waist length and curly) it was depressing to see him so upset with his recent situation. I was on a mission to find a gentle shampoo. To say the least, I bought him some more for his birthday a few months later!!
B0090W21XS|5|These woman wipes are great because their not overly &#34;scented&#34;, easy to carry, and are perfect for women who workout a lot. I use them for all of those in between moments... from the gym to shopping or work. I would recommend these wipes to all my female friends. My only concern is the way they close... could be a little less cumbersome. Great value... would purchase again.
B006HKR50A|5|I used this on Friday morning and today is Monday afternoon and have had my hands in a lot of water, scrubbing dishes, cooking and my nails are still looiking shiney and ready for a night out.<br /><br />I'll update in week to ten days and let you know. Stay tuned.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-9-12: The polish and Top Coat stayed on (left hand) for 2 weeks and remained beautiful and shiney. Normally I prefer clear nails, so I'm on a hunt for just clear gel polish. The reason the other hand came off, I put it on to thick and it ran on the side of my nail when I cured it, so I tried to file the sides and of course it broke the seal. I watched YouTube and found out all my mistakes I was making. You really do have to put it on as thin as you can and maybe not even get close to the \\"free edge\\", skin/cuticles. It is so nice to have nail protection for 2 weeks.
B00AEO3A54|4|It make my face nice and tight, but when I wash it off, the wrinkles are worse, so I have to keep using it over and over.
B007B3T47Y|2|I was disappointment with this product.  Do not like the scent that it leaves nor the the texture of my hair  after I spray it on.
B00BG1538G|5|Best color in Milani lipstick collection. Excellent!
B00KD74628|5|I have been using the Philips Norelco electric shaver foe many years and their HQ9 replacement  heads are excellent and last longer than one would expect, beyond the recommended 2 years. I do recommend this Philips product to all my friends.
B00EUST6V2|4|...since I have only been using your product once a week for a couple of weeks but you really<br />seem to be anxious for a response so here it is.  Your product arrived quickly and I am hoping<br />to leave for Hollywood just as soon as it starts working it's magic.  Sincerely,  L.G.
B0085RZLQ8|2|I've used a Sonicare for several years, regularly replacing the heads. This is the first time I have purchased the replacement heads online. These seemed to be of extremely poor quality. After just a few uses, the brush bristles were coming out in my mouth. The return policy for this product happens to not be worth the customer's time and trouble--I pay for shipping and then I only receive a partial refund. Just thought I'd share a warning.
B002GUUO9O|1|Returning it. it doesn't protect against UVA1 rays, only UVA2.
B00RDN9KQW|5|Will be ordering again in the future.
B00CQKWTP6|5|This lavender oil is wonderful! I use 10 drops in a 16oz brown glass spray bottle to mist my dreadlocks which keeps my hair hydrated without getting greasy and smells great. Adding some tea tree oil is nice too. This oil has a great smell and potency which can be hard to find. It came a day ahead of the estimated delivery date which is also a plus. I will be buying again when I run out!
B009I4PRI4|5|Makes your lips soft and add a slight mauve tint at the same time.
B000P22TIY|4|Nice for the price.
B005PUZZR8|2|The snout on this thing is very poorly designed. With the guard in place, the clipped portion of the hairs VERY quickly build up on the blade head. This makes it very difficult to do more than minor trimming. I have pattern baldness, left with only the ring, and I like to use a trimmer like this to do my hair. But this thing builds up so quickly that I had to go over my hair three days in a row to make sure I didn't look like an idiot. My old Remington, that would no longer hold a charge, cost me much less and did a MUCH better job. I wish I could have this battery in that trimmer.
B00NJ0BPPW|5|Great! Recommended!! Give it a couple of weeks and you'll feel the boost. No side-effects, blushing or headaches.
B0002PU86E|5|I am so happy I followed the advice of other reviews.  I live in NYC and hate to throw away $100+ every month on waxing services.  I ordered this Parissa kit yesterday and it arrived a day later.  Within 5 minutes my arms were hairless.  The instructions are so easy and the cleanup is effortless.  I especially like the fact that everything can be washed and reused - strips, stirrers, and spreaders!  This is a generous amount of sugar that seems like it would last for a few months.  You can't beat the price and the simplicity of this kit.  I hope that I have the same results on my legs when I try next week!
B00G6POFIQ|2|when I received this it was very liquidy and watered down.  nothing like a lotion should be. either old inventory or bad duplicate.
B0077PLO60|5|It's been about 10 years that I have been using epilators. I had the Braun Silk-epil in purple (I don't really remember the model number) it was working perfectly until I moved to USA and because of the voltage difference it didn't work properly, so it was time for me to get a new one. Being a brand loyal person that I am, I was sure that I wanted Silk-epil only. Finally decided on getting this one and received it today. Oh, boy, I love it! It epilates hair faster than the previous one I had. I love the fact that it has a light as well so you can find those hair you sometimes miss.. I am used to the pain and pinching feeling, so basically it's painless for me which is not bad at all. The accessories that come with this package are great- Love the concept of the gel pack for cooling and the pivoting head.<br /><br />The hair regrowth is definitely reduced and they grow back finer and lighter with time.. Will definitely recommend it to a friend.
B000XED28U|5|My husband loves this fragrance.  It can be hard to find, but is worth the purchase.  Light and fun fragrance.
B003KMXQXI|2|I wish it was darker (I am extremely pale) , also stayed on more than a day..
B00743VJ4W|5|My favorite shampoo!  Adds a nice highlight and shine to my grey hair.
B008PEMOV6|5|Wonderful Cleaner for my teeth.  I will do anything to keep my teeth in my head.  So just brush away.  Keep my teeth until I am in the grave.
B00J46TY3A|5|My dentist recommended this tooth paste and I works great for me. It protects my gums and I have no bleeding or pain. I used sensodine in the past but that did not work for me.
B0057N3TPS|2|The base colors are dried out, I can't get any color on the eyeshadow applicator. The lids colors are fine but I'm very disappointed .
B000NDMMAK|5|these are the only combs that work for my hair......very thin and fine.  I've used them for- probably 30 years.  I was so grateful to have found them on your site because they are no longer in stores.  I just LOVE them.  thank you.
B003GDKH9C|5|They work good
B00H71AVHM|5|First of all I got to say these's curls are gorgeous I have them on now and they are just BEAUTIFUL the hair clips matches my natural hair color everything I can't stop touching them or I don't want to take it off I will refer this clip set to a friend 😊
B001PSJEVM|2|When I did get mine in the mail it was broken. But I still use it. Love the makeup bronzed especially during summer months!
B00G5R6ZQA|1|this prouduct seemed to be ineffective as I have had a very good experience in the past. I`m bummed that its ineffective. Has the product changed? I have stocked up on a useless product. Did I get bad batch?
B002EP9OUG|5|This is the very first home waxing kit I have ever used. I like that they offer an instructional video, that was helpful since I had no experience at the time. I especially like that the warmer is of generic size so I can use other brands of wax and am not limited to their product. The wax itself works great and is fairly painless on the face. But I have found that if I don't apply it thick enough it breaks off while ripping. I have ordered a more expensive brand of wax to try as a comparison.
B00M16MHHA|5|I think it's too soon to give a review.  Used it two days only.  One thing for sure I received it really soon.  I ordered 4 different items on this brand, but I wish they were bigger in size.  These won't last.
B000VX96HE|5|Best headband.  i have waist-length hair and I love this.  I can wear it all day long and it keeps my hair back, but doesn't even feel like I have one on!  I have received many compliments on it, too.
B0038IA8XA|1|I used this product a handful of times. I followed directions on it to apply it to half the nail at first and not touch the nail beds but it burned anyway. It burned really badly!!! This product also chips a lot. Not worth it. I found a product that a friend recommended - Nailtique to work better.
B004PI3YOW|5|Shipped fast.  My favorite scent!
B0035Z6HX6|5|This home spray is wonderful.  It smells really good and is a richer, higher Quality scent than the sprays found in the store. I could almost wear at as a perfume!
B00J4N18PK|4|This soap is gentle on our children's skin and doesn't seem to irritate or dry out their skin during the winter. I love that it can be dispensed using one hand because I'm always holding a slippery child when lathering them up. I do wish it covered more area when soaping them up. I always have to go back for more soap after scrubbing their hair or face which means I go through a bottle pretty quickly. But we've tried many different bath soaps and keep coming back to this one.
B00CRKHGUS|4|The straightener heats up quickly. I wish the temperature readings could be read in BOTH Celsius and Fahrenheit rather than just Celsius.<br /><br />It does leave hair smooth and doesn't leave hair with a after smell. It's nice to find a straightener that doesn't leave your hair smelling burnt.<br /><br />It glides from roots to end very well when you use smaller sections.<br /><br />I don't like how the buttons are so close to where you have to hold it. I constantly kept pressing the buttons, which can get annoying after awhile even though I know it won't turn it off from a single press. The directions could definitely be clearer that double clicking the button locks temperature in place and then double clicking the button again unlocks. I didn't know this until I got an email from the manufacturer after being sent this device as a sample to review. The email also said that the directions in the future would be redone to make this clearer.<br /><br />I wish you could get a tighter clamp down on the hair. I think the price is a little high (today on Amazon it is $94.50). It's great hair straightener but there are a lot of options out there that come with a smaller price tag.<br /><br />\\"My hair is long, thick, and curly and it got the job done.\\"<br /><br />This review is a joint effort with my daughter-in-law who has the curly hair.
B0095JWPOQ|3|I have been purchasing this particular style for a very long time because it suits me. But recently I have noticed two things. It does not hold up very nicely past 2-3 weeks.<br />Also the hairline does not always sit the same on every single wig,  even though it's the same style which is very annoying. The true style sits nicely and the texture was great for at least a month. I will order and get the perfect hairline and get a lot of compliments. Order another one when it wears out and I get one with a hairline which looks like it is receding and it looks fake.<br />The original was by Beverly Johnson Britney-V, and completely gorgeous! Then Vivica took it over and there was a change. It was not as beautiful as the original, but ok. But now, I may have to just move on to another brand pretty soon. Giving it one more shot!
B00BZB22YU|5|It is a good moisture barrier for the day tini ted green for my roseca
B000I5MJ8S|5|Perfect. Love them
B003RJ165Y|4|I ordered on recommendation of a skincare technician, however then learned it was not a good product for my skin type. I returned with no problem.  I would definitely reorder from this seller.
B00FW73WE2|3|I am a HUGE fan of Mac and have a rather large collection of their lippies. However, I didn't really care for this one. I bought it on Amazon because it was sold out on the Mac website, and I think it was a waste of money. I saw this lipstick used in a tutorial on Youtube and it looked beautiful, but I felt it washed me out and made my lips look dead. It settles into lines and the staying power isn't great. Not a fan of this one.
B001H9657K|4|I love this eyeliner, its by far the best I have used.     Its smooth application, no smudging no racoon eyes and true black \\"intense\\" color is perfect for me. I like a dark look and even with the brush they give you its amazingly easy to put on as thin or thick or a line as you would like.     It nevers hurt my eyes, like some other eyeliners did.    What I love the most is probably that there is no sharpening, which is the worst I hate haveing to sharpen eyeliner as I feel like I'm literally throwing away money. When I first purchased this I was worried about how much I was paying for such a small jar of product but trust me when I say that a little goes a LONG way. And although I suggest you change your eyeliner every 4-6 months this would probably last you at least a year.     When applying this product I would sometimes go over it with a black powder on the lower lids so there was even more no smudging.    Warning however...this product will be absolutly NO good if you leave the lid off the jar. Once you take the lid off and leave it for about 7 hours the product WILL dry out and the eyeliner will loose the creamy texture and when you try to apply it after that it will flake off.
B00004TUBN|5|I recently bought this item and had no problem installing it--clean wall area first and let dry, squeeze adhesive on dispenser, press against wall, wait 24 hours.    Also no problem priming it--press button, put finger over hole where liquid will come from, release button, remove finger--repeat two or three times.  I imagine that the people who had a problem were not removing their finger, but just pressing the button numerous times.    It's a pleasure to use.  No bottles to open or pick up at the back of the shower and liquid soap keeps the shower cleaner--no soap scum that bar soap leaves.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B00OHXPMCM|5|This is a really nice night time moisturizer. It is really silky and doesnt have a smell like the other ones. It doesn't list this in the ad, but I have noticed that when I leave it on over night, it helps to shrink my pores, especially on my nose. I like it because it doesnt leave any greasy residue, but I love it because it is guaranteed to be organic and natural. I love using products like this, so I can actually know what I am putting on my skin.<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]
B002DV7I0Y|1|The mirror is fine, however the product I received has a battery compartment cover that falls off...I received it that way.  I don't want to pay for return shipping.  Disappointing!
B003T87PV2|5|Fantastic lotion.  I've been using it for years and feel as though I am always pleased with the way I look.  So I would hope it's this awesome stuff that's doing the trick.  Great scent and texture,too.  Good if you tan regularly.
B00WB8843Y|5|Goes on fast easy smooth and soft. I cannot think of one con of this product the smell is nice not over powering it does not come off on clothes and the softness last all day.
B00AK7UZBW|2|Product was ok, very small containers. They are about a quarter size round and four quarters sized thick. But still very pretty
B0046KFZC8|5|I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my thin gray hair for a long time and Clairol Shimmer Lights met my expectations.  I love this product and will buy it again
B0001ZZ7TS|5|Not oily at all.  Very good massage oil.
B00CE2JC9W|5|I purchased the derma roller because I have very bad acne scarring and am getting lines! Ahhhhhh... old age is creeping up on me! I am almost 57 and had really given up hope of ever having nicer looking skin because bad skin runs in my family. After using this once a day for about 3 weeks, I have really noticed a difference. The scarring seems to be lessening and my face is now smooth to the touch. I've also been using it on my neck, right under my chin and I believe it's plumped a little so the wrinkle onset isn't so noticeable now. I follow up with hyaluronic acid serum, and wow! I am impressed. Will try it on my legs next!
B004I94DF2|1|Shipped fast, Nice colors and last long. But I don't like how it takes a long time to dry and I don't really like it at all. I'll stick with Sally Hansen.
B002V15XUS|4|This stuff works for sore muscles. It smells quite medicimal, but that's not a bad thing.  Nothing like a nice long soak.
B002QG0TWA|5|I've been using a can of this stuff for well over a year, and I like it. I use more now at once than I did before, because I tend to like the cream thick, and it never seems to run out! You will most definitely get your money out of it.
B00II9C7YW|4|Like the sent and it is very soothing when you shower.
B004L7L28M|5|I'll keep ordering this product
B000P20TAY|5|I bought it for my sister's husband and  he really liked the scent
B00C7WMKDO|5|Thank you
B005GMY81O|3|Okay the color on the packaging is a light pink the actual color is a bright icy pink. Packaging is inexpensive but it only costs 0.97. Second of all it is very drying on your lips and makes lines and cracks in lips more noticeable. Overall moisturize lips before use and apply to get best results.
B000Z61NKU|5|I love this moisturizer. it's light and not greasy. feels great on my face. I wish nars still made it.
B005QCP1L0|5|My daughter had this perfume and I loved it so ordered one for me and one for my sister-in-law for Christmas.  She loves it as well!
B002WDPJ6S|5|This is so much more mild than the commercial adhesives, and no taste.  It works even better than Super Poligrip. Much healthier formula. And it last longer too.  Would highly recommend it.
B003BGWR8S|5|I love Salvatore Ferragamo.  I fell in love with the brand since a smell the first perfume. I already have a collection of Incanto by Salvatore Ferragamo. I have Incanto Bliss, Incanto Heaven, Incanto Shine, Incanto Charm, And now Incanto Bloom.
B007WODJ7I|5|I'm not a person who normally uses lotion with any frequency, but I travel often to areas with severe winters and my skin gets dried out. I hate lotions that are oily/greasy with lots of perfume. This stuff is perfect. Light, non-greasy, and a very mild fragrance. It's the stuff furnished in the guest rooms at the Crowne Plaza hotels.<br /><br />I would like to know who makes this stuff (the OEM). I have yet to find a similar formula on the shelves in local stores- can't say I've tried everything, but the big name lotions have all be disappointments. Therefore, I took the chance and ordered this 12 pack of 1.25 oz bottles. These are exactly what housekeeping leaves in your room- same size and all.<br /><br />Seller delivered quickly and the items came well packaged.
B0056GDG90|3|I bought because it's horrible trying to use a blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, I thought this was a good alternative. Although it does not have a lot of power ( I dry my hair about 90% of the way prior to using this brush) it does make getting volumn a lot easier. It's not super volumn but enough to make a difference.
B0085YKPAI|5|Very good quality polish and great size for the price. I received the polish in perfect condition.
B002ZJW1WE|5|This is still the best bath soap ever--and trust me, I've tried lots of others.<br />Surprisingly, Amazon sells this product in bulk and the price is much better than my local superstore.
B0034BV6KA|5|I can wear my light sweater again!!  I have black crop cardigan sweater that I like to wear when it is a little chilly outside but I mistakenly washed it with something that left while cotton balls (whateva) on it.  I tried to use a velvet lint remover to get it off but no luck so I got this little gadget and it ate all of those little cotton balls up...looks almost as good as new!!
B009CHS4EQ|3|Love the shampoo and conditioner, but the pumps were broken:(
B004RRGNXU|5|Best dry shampoo i have used.  Doesn't leave any residue behind in your hair as others I have tried leave some white powder behind.  I have tried a few others to save, but I think I will be going back to Klorane.  It's worth the extra
B00BPXLTI8|5|The cocoa butter came packaged in a plastic bin, as shown, and shrink wrapped as well.  It smooths on beautifully, and smells fantastic!  I look forward to using this in my body butters, and on its own as well.
B00QHAYUE4|5|I have been using this for years. Sad that Max Factor has left the US.
B0031Z352G|5|They kip you fresh 25 hr love this 👍👍👍
B0046KGAR2|5|This is by far the BEST product on the market.  I have spent a lot of money over many years buying every product at the various hair salons and nothing compares to L'Anza. Over the years I have permed my hair and colored it.  It is naturally thin and it was damaged, badly. I tried it all and then finally a new hair dresser I went too after I moved sweared by L'Anza so I figured why not, I've tried everything else.  Within a few weeks my hair was no longer brittle and dry looking.  Felt soft, looked fuller, and I noticed I didn't have to color my as often as I have in the past because of the protection it gives to color treated hair.  It's truly Amazing!!
B008R5NC0K|4|Great product.  I wish some instructions would have come with it.
B002LITTB0|5|I've just discovered EO products (have the mint and rosemary hair care) and I love that they are organic and use essential oils plus being free of the bad crap. I love the smell of roses so thought I'd try this.<br /><br />Amazon royally screwed up on the packaging and the products was spilt inside the bag. My first thought was man is this strong, more so of chamomile but it has grown on me. Using in the shower is different than cleaning up an exploded product and I like it. My pump was also defective thanks to amazon so I just swapped it out with another. I made sure to review the packaging with Amazon.
B0041PFJ10|5|Item was delivered as promised and was as described
B0018COTPG|5|I gave it a five rating because, I feel that it deserve it.  I don't use the numbing gel on it, I just put a good moisturizer on my face, and go for it.  It does take a little getting used to, because, the little needles do stick you.  Nothing that I cannot handle.<br />I watched Youtube to see exactly how this work.  My face turned red from the blood flow.  I'm black, about a carmel color.  The redness only lasted for a little while. This is what you want to happen, to get the blood flowing, this activate the cell's.  I can see that it is working.  :-)
B007FJWNY0|5|I have never in life gotten a pack of 10 nail art stickers where I loved each and every design.  Whether you have short or long nails these designs are very beautiful and show well on the nails even from afar.  I use them on french manicure to give my nails a little extra class and it works beautifully.  These stick on the nails well so they aren't massive or bulky on the nails.  I bought these because I loved what i saw in the pictures and when I used them they lasted forever.  Didnt chip or peel off over time.  I hope everyone buys this who loves to do up your nails.  It's so worth it and you will get complimens everywhere you go.
B00GAQLIH2|5|It is made of pretty sturdy plastic on the bottom, and the top is beautiful and sparkles with all its might, love it!
B0012C8TXU|5|Love this product for after tanning!!! The best moisturizer that I've ever used for after tanning, nice light scent too!!!
B00006FRW7|5|Great for my skin, soft scent and makes my face so soft.
B000C1VYK2|1|The source for this product is a fraud. They try to pass off another fragrance in place of what you ordered. Stay away from this resource.
B004C0UYUA|5|my child in big delight, thanks
B007ZUENUQ|4|Good choice for the price obviously its not gonna.smell 100 % like the original but It is close enough for the price
B0033RWF6Y|5|I have used this product for a few years, recommended by my hairdresser.  I have fine hair and this adds volume so my style lasts and doesn't flatten out.  I wear my hair short, and don't like it flat!<br />Ordering thru amazon saves me time and money drIving to purchase.  Thanks!
B0002TSCZY|5|I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas 6 months ago. She uses it on a daily basis and it heats up beautifully and has yet to have any problems. When I shopped around for straighteners this one had some of the highest reviews, best reliability and price. The Chi ones seem to crap out rather soon and are more expensive. I have had friends who were able to get their first Chi replaced but the company refused to replace the replacement once that one died.
B003WR3QSG|4|Definitely worth the money. You can easily spend 2-5 times as much on a brush, but this one will work just as well. It's badger hair (the top of the line in shaving brush material. I'm told), and it's soft on the face. Lathers nicely. Yes, I have lost a few hairs the first couple times. Don't worry, it happens. The rest will stay put.
B00J7W7JW4|5|very nice
B006SM4SG6|5|This amazing serum just soaks into your skin... I have been using this product for several years and still love it after trying several other brands. I highly recommend it !
B000GCQ05G|5|I bought this from Amazon because finding gentian violet is getting harder and harder to do.  I use it primarily for mixing up an ear remedy for my dogs.  However, I also found that, not too long ago, I developed a very stubborn case of athlete's foot that just wouldn't go away.  since it helps prevent yeast infections in my dog's ears, I figured I would try some on my problem.  I put a little on a cotton swab and coated the affected area.  Let it dry and then put on the usual cream.  After doing this for a few days, my athlete's foot was gone.  it didn't not burn but helped ease the itch, which was nice.  Now if you never have used gentian violet before, I have to worn you, it stains.  I mean IT STAINS.  I mean Everything and it is very difficult to get out, even if you get it on your fingers, you will have purple fingers for a while, so avoid using the applicator directly on an area to avoid drips, but instead dab it on a swab and you should be OK.  I love the stuff and it is sad that it is getting harder to find locally.  At least I can get it here on line.
B0050QF5RW|5|excelente producto..
B003BT7MO4|5|My favorite hair ties!
B00SA729I6|1|The original formula was wonderful, I recommended it to friends, it slid on  my face smoothly and I didn't look like a clown.  They changed it, put something toxic in it. The next bottle I bought was THICK, it was difficult to put on and blotchy and I sparkled in the sun like one of those stupid movie vampires. The third bottle I bought, the color changed. It was orangutang  orange. I threw it away and bought the next lightest color thinking I must have been confused.  This last bottle is fine color wise, but I still look like I have been dipped in glitter and my face is breaking out it huge zit like bumps that are painful and swollen and then scab over and appear to never go away.  Today, I scraped the sides of an old original formula bottle with a q-tip so I can go to work... but I cannot use Revlon Airbrush Effect foundation anymore and I mourn the loss of what was once a wonderful foundation. I am so upset (and my face is in so much pain) that I am writing this to let everyone know what you have done to real people with your &#34;progress&#34;.
B00I0HJZ7Y|5|Great product. My face is glowing :)
B00006ANDK|3|Just what the dentist ordered :-)
B005XTQYEO|5|Love this stuff. Put it on my feet and hands every night.
B000LN3BLG|5|Of all the skincare products I have ever used around the eye area, and I've tried many, &#34;Neova Refining Eye Lift&#34; is THE BEST! It does not irritate my eyes, it doesn't contain waxes that cake up and roll off after application. It penetrates and literally disappears, leaving your eye area firmer and more youthful in appearance! A small amount goes a long way! The pump container is clean & efficient! No leakage issues with this pump container! LOVE THIS PRODUCT! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B000LJDNIG|5|A year ago I received a single bar of MIstral soap as a  gift. Not thinking, I tossed it in a seldom used drawer in a seldom used room and forgot about it. A few months ago I revisited the drawer and the fragrance of the  soap &#34;pink grapefruit&#34; just jumped out at me.  At this point, I knew I would have to look for MORE!  Fortunately I found it and immediately placed an order. The packaging on the 3 bar combo is beautiful, the fragrances are wonderful and it gives good suds when washing hands. I'm hooked-- try it --it's a winner.
B00BH0N072|1|Broke two days
B000RFS118|4|came already opened inside the original box , no signs of previous use, Overall it still looked and works new so im happy
B002N0MZLM|5|Purchased directly from Amazon. Note: if you're ordering this during the summer, make a note during shipping to sign for your package (if your delivery guy was like mine, he may drop it off without ringing the doorbell and you'll end up with a ruined product -- I exchanged it for a new bottle and that's what the review below is based upon).<br /><br />The quality seemed potent and fresh. I called Now Foods to find out when the production date was, and it was made like a month before I bought it. Nice. Their customer service was knowledgeable and friendly.<br /><br />Overall, I've been happy with my purchase. It's a high quality 100% pure tea tree oil.
B001C60YA2|5|Been using this for years.  My hair dresser recommended it when I was coloring my hair.  Now that I no longer color my hair I still use it to keep my gray from turning ugly.  Can't beat the product for the price.
B00DV6PUT6|5|I suffer from Arthritis and have found comfort with Gel. I have used for many years & highly recommend to anyone with aches & pains. It is odor free which is important to me.
B00KD73PBQ|2|Greasey
B00GR945A4|5|This is my fourth eye shadow from Shiro, and this eye shadow, OohMyGod, this eye shadow. It has to be one of the most beautiful deep glittery greens I have ever seen. The picture that the seller has posted does not do it justice. I prefer to wear it over a black base to make the greens really pop, but even alone this eye shadow is beautiful. You get a good amount of product, and the quality is really good as well. With most loose shadows, patting instead of swiping generally works better, and it is the same case with this. However, you can still swipe this shadow across your lid and blend it into your crease and it still looks beautiful. And surprisingly, I did not experience much fall out with this shadow, or any of the shadows I have purchased from Shiro.<br />Bottom line is, they are amazing quality for the price, come in fantastic colors, and have good staying power. I highly recommend Shiro's eye shadows.<br /><br />(I currently own Lingered in Twilight, Aurora Borealis, Gems are Outrageous, and Yazma's Essence of Llama, and my review would be the same for all of them.)
B000C1VSUS|5|this is something i give over and over again this is my husbands favorite fragrance and he really appreciates the gift
B003UKM9CO|5|Excellent product! ! Had this product years prior and had exellent dental checkups! ! A++++
B000TN26H8|5|they last longer than other batteries for me and they cost less than any I can buy in the store or at the ear clinic
B0014P8L9W|5|I really do see some difference after using this product.  It cleans my skin wonderfully and<br />seems to tighten it up a lot.  At my age thought it will not do wonders but I am very pleased<br />with the results after using this only 3 times.
B009O3I64G|5|Thank you
B002LIXTFC|5|Amazing flat iron with the perfect heat and it does heat up fast btw. No complain at all i even used it with my BK treatment and it was perfect.
B0020MMCB6|5|This is a great shaver !!!    I use it every day.  And it's close to fine !!!!
B00WLGUJGQ|5|soft , comportable and colorful utensil.  i like it.
B009JVQS8E|3|The product worked okay. It didn't work like I would've liked it too, but everyone's skin reacts differently to these kind of products.
B00BMUXQ6W|1|This nail polish has a horribly strong smell and chips immediately after applying. It is incredibly thick after first use, making it impossible to use more than once. The only thing remotely good about it is it is matte. 0/10 would not recommend
B008K1LNBQ|4|I just receive the product. I didtn use it yet but I have very good recommendations about it. I receive it in time and perfect condition.
B00KTLXB4C|5|Since using Nivea Cocoa Butter lotion I no longer have scaly skin on my legs.  And I love the subtle scent.
B001UFO816|4|My hair is gray and brown. It dries out very easily. This product is awesome at keeping my hair nice, soft and healthy!  I gave it 4 stars because of the price is a little high for my budget but it works so I sacrifice to purchase it.
B004USSC6M|5|Great product. Wish they had not stopped making it. I could not find this anywhere else but here. Also, the price was great!
B000C1VZQK|5|In high school I wore this, and later on in my life I could never find this!! It still smells good!!
B000GHGGKK|5|Tried and true moisturizer. One of those products I don't know how I lived without
B00HWTAAC0|3|Good lotion but needs too be in a jar.  It is very thick which is good.  However it is a challenge to get it out of the bottle.
B003X4G25C|5|Love this cleanser.  It's gentle, slightly foamy, smells like lemongrass and effective.  Used it for the last year and will buy it again.
B002RC8TBG|5|GLEES: Product helped my husband with his turtle feet. Have gone through 3/4 bottle. I used it on my skin where some areas were flaky, worked very well. I am happy with the product and I will no doubt purchase more. DOWNSIDE: It is a little expensive.
B000ALDK1A|5|I rub my feet with aloe every morning to keep them cool, clean and bacteria free (that is why my feet don't smell) Because I walk just about everywhere I go!
B002AEDMOU|5|These lashes are almost identical to the Darkness K-ma 1. I think these may be more natural looking than the K-ma 1. I love Darkness eyelashes because these lashes fit the asian eyes very well without trimming.
B000FKJZKG|5|The mister on this spray bottle is simply perfect for the application of a fine mist of sea tonic all over your face or you could even use this all over your body after a shower.<br /><br />Most of the toners on the market have alcohol. This is alcohol-free so it doesn't sting or irritate your delicate skin.<br /><br />You could even add some of our own essential oils to this tonic water or just enjoy it as it it. The Zia products are natural and wonderfully soothing. Recent favorites include the Zia Treatments line. The Acne Treatment Mask is filled with Colloidal sulphur, camphor and tea tree oil which is perfect for oily skin. The Fresh Papaya Enzyme Peel mask uses the power of papain to gently and effectively remove dead skin cells on the skin's surface.<br /><br />The toner is wonderful to use after the other products<br /><br />in this line or just to use anytime during the day.<br /><br />Keep in the refrigerator in the summer.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B0054Y1MZ4|5|Great
B004UMRRAK|3|I've only been using this a few days, and it's okay, but not spectacular.  It won't hurt or irritate anything, but it's particularly moisture rich, which is what the eye area needs (at least mine does).
B004A4SSNI|4|Loads of creamy lather and a rich clean Neroli scent. I tried most of the Neroli soap on Amazon, and this one is my favorite.
B000F5DRCS|4|I had this one before and I think it was a little bit better, now it doesn't have the tiny thing in the plates which use to hold your hair better, I'm even thinking on changing the plates from the old one to the new one, but I like the shape that allows you to give the hair the form you want and overall I am happy with it.
B008XXLL9U|2|I have been using this for almost 3 weeks. I find no change or benefit from this. It is odorless and non-greasy though.
B00OAJ0YIK|5|Love it! I mix 2 or 3 and they match my hair perfectly! Thank you Mane Street!
B00646121U|5|This is a great mini hat clip.  It is great for an adult or a child because it is mini.  Great accesory to dress up any casual style.  A must have.
B0012ZMDBG|5|The Maquis scent isn't everyone's favorite but I love it. Best to give it a try before buying.
B00K2O3NV2|5|I h Ave never used serums on my  skin,until I discovered INSTANATURAL products.U am glad I tried them my skin is so much better now.This serum is easy to apply,it leaves your skin soft moistured hydrated  with natural ingredients  that did not irritate my skin,really does not have a smell.I love IT I GAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.
B00ARF428O|2|It is a fancy shaver but has only the looks. The battery stops holding charge after first 2 months and now I have to plug it directly in the power socket top operate.<br />Once plugged in, the shaver works fine. If it weren't for the battery, i would have rated it near a 5 star product.
B0080CO2F4|3|When I received the piece two of the crystals had fallen off and it took along time to get the piece being it was from hong kong,but all in all was really cute.
B0009OAGRE|2|I did not like the smell at all.
B00PLOPP50|5|This is my favorite exfoliating peel! Super fast shipping. I'm very happy with my purchase :)
B003KRDKZC|1|The Chi Velocity flat iron pulled my hair.  I had to go over sections of my hair over and over before it would straighten.  I am definitely returning this product to purchase something else.
B003OELYFO|5|This is a really great product for those of us who have a problem with thinning hair.
B004BD9152|5|This is one of the best toners that I've tried. There's no odd smell and I don't break out or get dry skin. I have very sensitive skin but this toner makes my face feel really nice. I've also caught my boyfriend using my toner! I used it on him once during the night when he had really dry skin and he said his face was smooth throughout work the following day. He doesn't like my other toners because they &#34;smell&#34; according to him.
B00CP4H3T0|5|This item was everything I expected in a razor.  An extremely smooth shave that lasts all day.  This razor cuts quickly and no drag.  Easy to hold in your hand...recharges quickly and stays charged up to three weeks.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a clean shave at a low price.
B00N9DL9SW|5|I am always skeptical of 'to good to be true' products.  It works!  I noticed a marked improvement after the first use!  I would definitely recommend this product.
B000KOHRX4|4|works good for your skin, but if you have oily skin not as good.
B00112AFQU|5|This body lotion smell just like the perfume.My favorite fragance.
B001ANTYAS|5|Haven't found anything I like better for discomfort in my body.
B001E6QC1U|5|I live in Iowa where the winters are bitter. Expecially this year it got to -40 with 35mph wind gusts! BRRR! So everything got painfully dry and cracked. This is a lip saver! You can feel the cooling sensation and it is availble and wal-mart and other stores like that. You MUST try!
B0015KI362|1|This hair dryer completely fried my hair--I bought it because I was told it would dry my hair quickly--It does dry your hair quickly but leaves it extremely damaged!  I would NOT recommend buying this hair dryer.
B000GP1AXK|5|These clippers have really done the trick for me. I do not have really thick hair, but these clippers seem to be very powerful. I have been using them for about a year now and they work great.
B00IQZ9PG6|5|Works exactly like it should.  I use it every couple to lighten up my blonde.  Highly recommend this brand.
B003JN0U1E|5|I'm actually going to use this product for a prolonged period of time to see its results on hair growth. But do far i am pleased with it.
B003SZ4BP4|5|great quality and great product overall I would recommend this product to anyone its worth your money and it last long
B0029L1LI8|1|Everyone's skin type is different and this product just didn't work for me. It left my skin oily and a got a small red rash after using it.
B00EZM9ESS|1|Very bad, wheel Is very small and it's not even full...so much empty space.<br />It's just a false good pic representing the cheap product.
B000S83DMG|4|Love!
B00CRSA1JS|3|Perfect! Thank you!
B0051D2KTA|4|This shade isn't something I would normally wear--but it's pretty and has interesting undertones to it! Can't wait to try it!

B00016XJ4M|5|Great toner for a great price, no reason to buy the expensive stuff.
B00ALB397Y|5|Doesn't leave  your face greasy. I put this on every am before I put on my foundation. Does not make my face sweaty.
B003949V36|5|I started using this years ago when they use to have jafra parties all the time. I'm glad I went online and saw this. It really works wonders.
B001PTFXGG|5|It seems to work for me..and that is very good..:)  It absorbs very nicely..!!  Have been using this for at least 4 mos.. or more..  I have another bottle ready to go cause you can't tell when you are running out..  My only complaint..
B005V1XNEI|5|simple i love it, is very precise to apply makeup, and the material of the brush is very soft. i recomend
B000056W5Y|5|thick feel that worked great. No stretch marks after birth!
B000F5KFZU|5|This is my favorite shaving soap.   I use a brush and I barely dab the bristles into the soap, it takes VERY LITTLE to make a good lather.  You will not be wrong by choosing this one.  I will purchase this product again.
B00KGO8XY0|1|My mac mascara does the same thing I was disappointed
B0080L9FHA|3|With rumors of brand name toothpastes being hazardous with certain chemicals in them, I decided to try Earth Paste as a natural alternative.  It's not all bubbly like the known toothpastes, but it cleans well and has a good taste.  I never understood why all things good for you have to be more expensive, but Earth Paste is more expensive than your average toothpaste.  Will I try it again?  Maybe.
B0013LSWXM|1|I was reading an article on Yahoo a while back that mentioned this product as being missed by consumers (apparently it is no longer on the market). Considering the lack of quality it displayed from my experience using it, those consumers should actually be overjoyed by it's demise.<br /><br />The product gave very poor, shall we say, \\"coverage\\". The amount to use as the directions stated would have been inadequate to shave a single cheek (facial cheek, that is!) let alone your entire face. It sort of reminded me of using shave cream that had gone totally flat in the can.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a non-aerosol product, any of the King-of-Shaves products is vastly superior to this anemic product. If it has in fact been taken off the market, hopefully it stays there.
B001LIE876|5|This products works better than all competitor's products. I have used it for years and will continue to use this product.
B002SVIKLK|2|Liner is not very dark, and there isn't enough contrast between the lid and crease colors to have an enhancing effect.
B00GXED94G|5|Works will with my Clarsonic.  I will buy again.
B004S0T05Y|4|Good solid shampoo, even for a mom with no dreads. Like the vanilla scent.
B005PKLUMM|5|I love all NYX lipglosses, and both Tea Rosa and Beige are my go-to lip glosses.  They're thick, not sticky, and have a great cherry scent to them.  They last a decent amount of time, and have great pigmentation.  I would highly recommend NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss to anyone who has an obsession with lip gloss but doesn't want to pay a fortune.
B00HJD8NLY|5|Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum  is all natural, so I immediately felt at ease trying it on my skin. This product is also made in the USA.  It contains Vitamin C 20%, Rosehip Seed Oil, and Sea Buckhorn Oil. You can also tell by the amazing smell that is contains Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil. It is alcohol free and paraben free. It is a yellowish, orange color, but does not change the color of your skin once applied. It absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. My skin feels smoother immediately and I am looking forward to continued improvement.
B00GTC1JVM|5|Son loves it
B00QE4H9SW|5|Tried 3 treatments of permethium,I had nodules from scabies on both arms..I rubbed the mite sil on and overnight everything was gone..would recommend this to anyone...
B0047EPNZC|4|Perfect relief especially for your hair's tips. Smell so good and I blow dry my hair everyday it is not looked damaged anymore.
B00F5KDIC2|4|Cute
B000NN3H18|5|using product for years, great product
B00GOXV6VY|4|Smell isn't that great but it did not leave a sticky feeling.
B000KDZDU4|5|I just absolutely LOVE this shampoo! The smell is amazing and it last all day! I wish it was not discontinued in the stores, but I am so glad I found it on-line! THANK YOU!!!
B004C5V8I2|5|Awesome scent I love this perfume very nice. Yes I would purchase it again maybe for a family member  for there Birthday.
B00JJ4JSC4|5|I really appreciated what they were trying to do when they made this... BUT from reading the package, you'll see that this is basically a stick of bees wax.  So, whats the problem, you might ask?  Well, you remember that phrase, &#34;An elephant never forgets?&#34;  Well, the original phrase was actually &#34;bees never forget&#34;.  They know you have their beeswax.  Being the idiot that I am, I was ignorant to this well known fact, and sure enough as soon as I took one step outside, the bees came back for what was theirs.  Have you ever had hundreds of bees crawling all over your armpits, with their tiny little insect arms pawing at your skin?  I've never laughed so hard in my life; pure torture.<br /><br />And Ozone?  I thought that was harmful?  I remember hearing the word &#34;ozone&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; in the same sentence in a news broadcast in the 90s, so it must be bad and I'm not even going to do any further research.
B00WRN3TBU|5|Love this gel! I use it in natural cosmetics and it has a wonderful consistency.
B002ZJ5Q1C|5|My hairdresser has recommended this product...I use it 3X times a week.Been a Redken user for 15 yrs, just love their products.
B005JK6B72|3|It is just okay!
B000053L6Y|5|It is an inexpensive but great product. Feels nice on the skin - wife loves the smell too! I do recommend it.
B00BN1538O|4|Works well. Feels cheap and not sure about longevity of item but very inexpensive and it works well.
B0051VE5DQ|5|I added a little of this product to my regular moisturizing cream for my face.  It has not been 3 weeks yet but so far it is doing a good job of keeping my skin looking somewhat healthier ... lines seem less visible. I am going to continue this for as long as I think it is doing better and see how it does.  I would recommend this product to the ladies!
B0098MLBAO|5|I really liked this tooth gel and I will order it again in a few more weeks.<br />After I use it my mouth feels so fresh and clean.<br />I do highly recommend this tooth product.
B00CR68MQY|1|These are TINY I have small lips and the bar doesn't even fit. at least 15 of the are broken too. You get what you pay for!!
B0054KO2AU|4|Nice, smooth and velvety oudh. Not over powering but distinctly oudh nonetheless. Musky and simi-sweet notes can found in this oil.
B002RAR0B8|5|This is the best hand sanitizer ever made.  Non alcohol so it doesn't out your hands.  I use this product at work (grocery store).  My hands tend to get very dry, crack and bleed from handling money, etc.  Using Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer and Moisturizer is a tremendous help.  I highly recommend this product.
B002EF0FAE|2|I am a bit disappointed in my last batch of shea butter.  I purchased for myself and my mother and it turned white and smells horrible.  I have been buying shea butter to make my own lotions for years and this has never happened.  I thought perhaps was because I was in Florida (with the humidity, etc) but it happened to my mothers batch as well, she is in Ohio.  It ended up being a waste of money.  I did research this happening and found it has happened to others but it seems in a lot of cases theirs was old.  I guess I will have to find a different Amazon supplier or quit being lazy and utilize my farmers market.
B00KLA4INE|1|Dont work but hurt instead
B000GCXVV2|5|I only ran across this stuff because my boyfriend uses it and one day I forgot my hair gel for my wavy/curly hair. I typically would NEVER use a gel so strong but when I used this, I found that it makes my hair look really good. Not only did the curl in my hair stay bouncy and pretty all day, it gave it some extra curl. I think the name of the gel is a little misleading...it makes it sound like your hair will be crunchy and not move all day. That was definitely not that case for me, at least. It brought my hair to life! Bye bye crappy, weak \\"curl gels.\\"
B00354XMH6|5|Amazing how well this comb does on a beard or mustache. I was hesitant to buy but glad I did
B007B469MG|5|It goes on quite thick and is similar to a paste, but it really is intensive healing. This stuff is great for very dry hands. I like to use it at night just before bed & wake up to soft and well-moisturized hands. A little goes a long way, so I suggest no more than a dime's size.
B0015G58SM|5|I am so glad that I found this product here. My Mother loves Vanderbilt Powder. There are not many places that stock this product. Amazon.com was the only place that I could find this product. You are a life saver. Wonderful product and great job on stocking what people need.  Keep up the good work. Amazon is a great place to shop. It is so easy to find what you need or want.
B0010V5MKG|5|I like this stuff.<br />gets wife off back.  pleasant smell.
B009FKNHUG|5|I received a sample size from INflenster and I love love LOVE it! it smells great and feels great on my skin after I just spent time in the sun. I defiantly will be using this a lot more!
B003AX8KME|5|Product was as expected.
B003TNQG4E|2|This works well if you want to spend a lot of time.  I used a couple times but you need to be in shape.
B008AEEJ5U|5|Very good product. Cleans up good. Leaving skin nice and soft. Have a refreshing smell. I  have purchase this item several times. And will buy again.
B001331ZX4|5|Son likes this. makes great birthday present.
9790799829|5|I was susprise to get it this quick and it is the real thing at a cheaper price. So macy bye
B00IOWYHJ6|3|Nice colors. However, i expected them to be more richer and longer lasting.
B00152SA1S|5|Thank you! Love this product. I could not get it locally in that size.
B00A3BWYU0|5|Not sure but I think some people received the incorrect product! Theses in this box are definitely chalk! No oil pastels and box is the same.  They are so fun and cool! Maybe order from a different vendor but the ACTUAL product is great!
B00023EPEM|5|Awesome scrub! I use this when I'm feeling like I need to be extra-cleaned :) There are tiny bits of walnut shell in it and it smells absolutely delicious!
B000WDTXHG|1|Buyer be ware<br />You are purchasing advertisements  and a few samples.<br />For 16.00<br />NOT (48pc)
B000WI055A|5|Received and used with pleasure. Works great! Immediately you can feel the quality of the product. Requires zippo training. More rugged than I expected from concerns of its potential for breaking. I would suspect that if it isn't dropped that it could last decades. I did wash it to check the cleaning process and I can see that it would be *very* easy to drop it during this activity, I almost did.     Special Note: (Important)  -------------  When you open the metal box containing the porcelain file, you will see inside the lid a black with white lettering insert with \\"Tweezerman Porcelain Nail File - Hand Crafted in Germany\\" imprinted. Take something and remove this 'instruction' card. Inside it tells about the product and care. Now flip it over, and on the back it says for anyone concerned about breaking it: \\"THE BEST IMPLEMENTS THE BEST GUARANTEE! If file breaks, do not use. We replace damaged/dropped tool for one half the purchase price. No S&H charges. Send tool *insured* in a padded mailer with your name, address and phone number to: TWEEZERMAN SERVICE, 235 Blue Bell Road, Houston, TX 77037. Allow 4 weeks. [...]\\"    I'll update my review if I experience any failures or performance reduction.
B0043DMNHS|5|I'm 65 years old and this razor is the best I have ever used. Would highly recommend it. Better than Braun!! Cannot beat the price.
B0050PWTMM|5|This is the only product that I can use that doesn't make my skin peel.
B00UM9ZTS2|5|These tweezers are awesome!  I love that they come with 3 different kinds for all different types of uses.  The really pointy ones work great for any sort of ingrown or super short hair and the other too are great for just regular grooming.  I love these, so happy I purchased!
B00ITEBAHG|5|I've only been using it for one week, but already I can notice a difference.  My skin feel really good!
B003ZJH4CU|5|Hi there! I would really like to know how we can make the color choice. In other similar products there is a range that you can choose before you add it to your shopping cart. It would be great to have some clue for this one as well. Thanks a lot!!!
B0095BWGIE|5|This is a very good product pack that I find is one of the few products that actually work as advertised. Application instructions are easy to understand and are supplied on each product. The product is very easy to use, and offers subtle results. The one thing you don't want to do is use too much product, or you may experience some tingling or irritation, perhaps worse if you are a sensitive skin sufferer. The product itself is not greasy feeling if applied as directed, nor does it leave a sticky residue. As with all skin care products, your own experience may vary greatly.
B00F8OOBLC|4|I like this one myself. The women who talk to me about it, like it as well. Will buy again.
B001F51XFK|5|Best mouthwash you can buy, my teeth have become much more white after using this product, now when I buy I buy 3 at a time and I have invested in their toothpaste which also works great.
B008L3H99S|4|I wanted to try this because it's not a harsh soap and using Ayurvedic methods took too long to prepare my hair. I ended up going back to them once I had my college breaks and I noticed my hair liked them a lot better than this. This product made my hair feel dry and a bit greasy after a while. So after I would wash my hair I would rub some coconut oil into the wet hair and once my hair was dried it felt superb. I love the smell of this product and I still have a small half of the soap left over. I bought it to try and see if it would be better or easier for my hair and I would say it was easier to wash it out and what not but at the end of the day I felt my hair needed more attention to make it feel &#34;itself&#34; when using this kind of soap. I do like it better than the shampoos you buy at the stores though. It was good product all in all.
B000143R3W|5|best color ever. wella is part of schwarzkopf, which is the best hair product manufacturer in europe. the color is beautiful and it stays. doesn't compare to other brands. i'm happy i found it on amazon
B00I5H5Z1O|4|The handle is shaped perfectly to fit in my hand and the grip makes sure it doesn't slip. A great product for on the run or a home. Compact and saves space.
B009PFVUFA|5|I love my new brushes.
B0016A3GYK|5|This deodorant has a nice fresh scent but is not to strong. Its natural but works really well even on hot days.
B002NPB8F6|4|After-market parts sometimes don't fit because they're knock-offs but these seem to be the genuine article. They seem to work just like the ones that came with the machine.
B0032ANCZ0|3|I love Skintimate shave gel but as far as getting a package of 6, the first can did not work. The 2nd can so far so good! We will see how the next 4 cans go!
B0007CXQUW|1|painful and does not work as advertised
B00I50OI1O|5|Love my Floor mat
B00L2REOC0|5|Luv this! Luv the colors. It lasts all day and leaves my lips moisturize
B00ARF44N2|4|ok
B008X20V6A|2|There was absolutely no mascara in the tube.  It is bone dry.  I am so disappointed.  The lip brush bristles come off on your lips.  I could live with that and use another brush, but the lack of mascara was a complete and utter disappointment.  The shadow and blush are okay I guess.
B00HXAIK3E|5|love the way teeth feel after use.
B002993P16|3|A great deal of soap was required to create bubbles, which means that I went through the container much faster than I expected to.
B003BWG0AS|5|The first microdermabrasion product that didn't leave my skin red and angry or dry.  I have very sensitive skin that flakes or turns red when it gets windy.  My skin has improved so much that I don't have to wear foundation everyday to cover up. I can get by with a tinted moisturizer (dermologica tinted med).  Can't live without this product!
B00QH13OX6|4|So i have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, and so far it is just great. The lotion has a very nice scent to it, some people might think it is a bit pricy for a lotion but it is definitely worth it. The size of this bottle is great, honestly i don't know how long it will last but it seems like it will last forever. It is good for many different reasons, with me  have very dry skin, and using this lotion my skin is no longer dry, it feels very smooth and nice. I have been using this lotion nonstop. One squirt is enough to cover a lot of your skin, a lot of lotions out there are very sticky, but this one is not. After i put it on while looking at my skin it practically looks like my skin is wet, but when you feel your skin it isn't, but your skin feels very smooth. Overall i think this lotion is a great product, and definitely worth the price. I totally recommend this lotion.
B002JC5XEK|5|I can't live without these! I have adult acne and for the last year have been using Rodan and Fields Unblemish [...], with amazing results. I have sensitive skin, typically dry, but yet have acne (and rosacea). I have tried every product line possible - over the counter, high priced cosmetic counter cleansers, spa & salon product lines, all organic lines, dermatologist/ prescription only products. No combination worked like the Rodan and Fields. The problem? The Rodan and Fields product line did not have a toner that was easy for travel (at 4.2 oz - their toner was over the carry-on limit).     So, I supplemented with the Acne Stress Control from Neutrogena - amazing! No irritation, no burning, and a ton of dirt/skin cells removed (eww, but at least I know it was working). These are perfect for travel (a quick wipe to get all that stale airplane debris removed), perfect for the gym (use after, don't want it to sweat into your eyes), perfect for the beach (although apply a good sunscreen after- the active ingredient will increase sun sensitivity), perfect for use when driving in a convertible (you'd be amazed at the dirt from the highway that clings to your skin!) Keep them in your car (add a tiny bit of water if they get dry in the summer) and use them in between an unexpected change of plans/make-up change.    I found this product at CVS pharmacy several months ago, and they have since stopped carrying it in the store. I have looked at three other pharmacies, Walmart, Target, grocery stores and can't seem to find it. Thank goodness I can still order online!
B00QR6SS6O|5|I use it to clean my bathroom with it  I don't use chemicals I use this instead of cleaning with chemals .
B003TP2M9A|5|Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.
B00FT5HJEG|5|I love this As I Am for my hair.
B00EXW52UE|5|Left my hair feeling healthy and gave it a great shine. It also smells nice.
B003YMJJSK|5|This stuff is amazing.  It is inexpensive, and works better than any luxury brand cleanser I have used.  It removes eye makeup easily, and when I use toner afterward, there is never a trace of leftover makeup on the cotton pad.  I am also prone to rashes from certain products, but I have no issues with CeraVe.
B000LJDKN4|5|Smooth & creamy.
B003TQU1Q0|3|I had high hopes for this lotion.  Based on the reviews I really hoped that it would help my daughters eczema.  Instead it's just been okay.  I apply this to her skin twice a day.  I've been using it for almost a month in conjunction with the Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash.  It seemed to work pretty good at first.  Her skin was pretty receptive to the lotion and it did soften the rough spots and made the rest of her skin soft to the touch, however when I applied it to her face it made the patches on her face redder.  So I stopped applying it to her face and just applied to to her body.  Recently, I've had to stop using it after baths because she writhes in pain when I rub it on her and her dry patches turned redder.  From this reaction I have to assume it's causing a burning sensation.  I have tried everything from organic to Aquaphor.  And nothing seems to eradicate the problem, so I continue to use this in the mornings and a different lotion after baths that doesn't burn when I apply.  After this is gone I won't buy anymore.
B00HJD8NLY|1|Would not buy again. Made my face rough and red..  Wish I could send it back.
B00JY5UR0K|5|like it
B007MPD5YE|5|I love it. Pre washed with Oragnix Keratin oil shampoo & conditioner, blowed it out wit hair dryer, then applied Moroccan<br />Argon oil which gave the hair a soft feel pretty shine and delicious smell! I love it for the price I paid.. ordered 4 bundles for a full head natural look. Waves didnt stay after wash but no worries there are curlijg irons and hair products GALORE that could bring back that wave im sure! :) You should try!
B0001HAEJE|5|Arrived quickly and have noticed that going to the bathroom is easier.  My research on BarelyLfie indicates that is has other health benefits so my plans are to continue using it for the next 3 to  months and then reassess.  They price seems high as I have found it on-line cheaper so shop around.
B00AEINQ9K|4|Good
B00IQ0RD56|5|Works great, smells good, very light. A little goes a long way. A must have for any man or woman
B00027D8IC|5|Love it. Worked as described.
B00H2B4H5Y|3|I've used my share of trimmers, but this Remington still seems unique due to the vacuum feature. The vacuum does work, but not perfectly. There's always a decent amount of hair on the sink, but it probably sucks up 90%+ of it.<br /><br />The trimmer is very lightweight and has good battery life. The motor feels powerful enough, though not as robust as a corded Wahl. It's been doing the job. I use it to trim my beard, and also find the nose/ear attachment to work well.<br /><br />The foil doesn't get as close as I'd like it to. The guide attachment blows. It's sometimes difficult to get it on properly, and setting it on the correct position is tricky. Overall, it feels wobbly and cheap and will most likely break sooner than later. The guide is a major letdown in what could have been a great trimmer.<br /><br />Update (3/2015) - Well, the guide has totally disintegrated now. It's the Achilles' heel of this groomer and now this thing is pretty useless for my needs.
B001B2KOMA|1|Went straight in the trash. Not worth returning. I could barely hear it go off in the same room much less sitting in another room. I ended up getting the thermoworks commercial kitchen timer. Best timer I have ever seen. Adjustable sound that I could hear outside if I needed to.
B00HRGBSYW|5|love the product from the first try. I use it after shower and it works for my skin just right. Smell is good too. I would recommend it to people who is looking for organic :back to nature: products.
B0007MW1VC|5|I used to use Mac's Glass lipgloss before Juicy Tubes were around. Any time the wind blew I had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which, as you know, is extremely unpleasant and annoying. Juicy tubes stays on, but doesn't have the overly-sticky feeling which is wonderful. <br /> <br />I don't wear much makeup and find Juicy Tubes to add that \\"something special\\" to a dewy face. I recommend Daiquiri or Berry Bold for the most natural looks. Daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while Berry Bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. You will adore this gloss. I can't live without it.
B00D7NJWRY|2|I got these to donate to a homeless resource center where I volunteer.  For the price they are not even worth it.  The bars are so teeny tiny you probably can't keep a grip on them to wash with, and half of them were broken upon receipt.  For fifty cents per bar I can get Irish Spring and Dial full size bars so this was a total waste for me.  If you want them as hand soaps for guests or a motel it might work but again, a lot of them were broken.<br /><br />These things are maybe 4cm x 2cm (estimate...I didn't actually measure) and less than 1cm thick.
B004VGSVHS|5|I am a big coffee drinker and my teeth suffer terribly for it. I have tried a lot of toothpaste's and even pointless (and painful) whitening treatments that claimed to work, but didn't.<br /><br />This was suggested by my dentist. Well, his main suggestion was for me to stop drinking so much coffee but that's not happening.<br /><br />I gave it four weeks and even though I STILL drink coffee, my teeth actually look white!<br />How this is done, I have no idea. Going with magic here folks. My teeth don't hurt after using this product and it's gentle enough to use multiple times on a daily basis.<br /><br />The flavor is awesome as well. It actually tastes like a sweet, minty hard candy.<br /><br />My only issue with this toothpaste is the high cost.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I brush my teeth three times a day. In the morning, at work after my three cups of coffee and lunch, and in the evening before bed. After about two weeks of consistent brushing, I saw an improvement. After four weeks, I can't believe how white my teeth look.
B002QASVFS|1|I order this palette 88 eye shadow but I got 26 blush eye shadow palette although I didn't order it<br />can explain to me why this happend<br />regards,,,
B003FZIWZW|5|I don't go anywhere without heavy black eyeliner on. EVery single day. I've tried so many brands and styles but I like this one best. The brush is firm so I can control where I want it to go, but still has enough give to not feel like I'm gouging my eye out. It stays all day long and I never have to touch it up.
B0000XMQHW|3|It doesn't really do anything I haven't really noticed a difference in my skin but it arrived here in a week and it was expected to get here a bit longer. But the box was a little damaged and its texture is thicker than I would've imagined
B002CMLHEC|5|Great Product!
B00DOXAWLW|5|I've been using this chapstick every morning and every night for about a week. I just keep it in my bathroom & apply when I'm putting on my makeup and when I take it off. I've always suffered from extremely dry skin & lips with lots of cracking and bleeding during winter. Since using this product regularly, my lips are the smoothest they have ever been & look amazing with or without lipstick (normally can't wear it because it looks terrible on my dry lips). I've still found myself applying my trusty carmex a couple times throughout the workday, but that is to be expected in subzero temps! I definitely recommend this product and don't understand how it has such a low overall rating.
B004369ILY|3|Sometimes it's mind over matter.  If you thinks it helps then awesome.  But it probably really doesn't....  My son loves these.
B00KOT949U|4|Bought it on recommendation of hair dresser to combat summer frizziness. Smells wonderful, works fairly well. But honestly, I much prefer my Wella Velvet Amplifier; works better and much cheaper.
B006U98T08|5|great product
B00AO4EKSU|2|Not much to say about these. I like their practice behind their ingredients. However these are almost completely ineffective in removing makeup ESPECIALLY mascara and I don't even wear waterproof.
B002V9X78U|1|Chinese item ... Not helpful
B001E0ZQ54|4|I have been hunting for a natural deodorant which keeps me odor free. I have tried many other deodorants however I eventually felt I was &#34;stinky&#34; and became self-conscious of odor. This has not yet happened to me with this product. I have been teaching in a third grade classroom since September and teaching is a sweaty job. I definitely sweat, yet the odor isn't there. If there is, it is extremely slight. This roll on deodorant is best applied BEFORE dressing. It is extremely liquid so putting it on after your clothes leaves the underarms of your shirt feeling wet. If you can remember that small detail I think this is a great product.
B001CT053U|5|I read the reviews before I bought this item and to my surprise my bf really loved it he really don't like change but I don't like old spice do it does smell pretty nice on him
B00D5TB1LK|4|I really like this contouring kit, I use it every single day. I would say the color directly under the white is more yellow than the picture shows. It comes on very easily, I'm very pale skinned and I use the top far right for the cheek contouring. I put the bottom middle color on the cheek bones and around my hair line, looks very nice like I am sun kissed. The white color is a bit powdering, I do not use it that often.
B0085RZLQ8|5|These brush heads fit my Sonicare toothbrush with no problem, and appear to be from the original manufacturer of the Sonicare. Sonicare is of course AWESOME, if a little expensive.<br /><br />I got the manufacturer packaging rather than the frustration-free packaging because, surprisingly, it was $5 cheaper. The manufacturer packaging is plastic clamshell which required scissors and some strength for me to open, but at least the heads were in pristine shape.<br /><br />The new heads make a HUGE difference compared to my worn out ones! The brushing action was more vigorous and the bristles were more firm (but not painful).<br /><br />I got these on Amazon for 75% of what I would have paid from Walgreens. And, delivered to my door. Very satisfied!
B004L4EING|5|Excellent product (cup, soap, brush, and brush holder)! So nice to get back to shaving this way! Very pleased!
B002UECXPY|4|very good product! I gave 4 stars only because it is a very small bottle for that price. It really works,my hair stop falling and became thicker. I also used the same type of shampoo. I would recommended to a friend
B0002ZA8SC|4|The curling iron works well and has a large range of heat available.  The large portion of the handle makes it a little difficult to handle, but one learns to get around it.
B008E78YM2|5|In love with the pigments of the colors so far. Just used it for a photo shoot yesterday and had me and all the girl looking real model ish and stuff. I love CoastalScent products they have yet to fail me.
B004RQVCUK|5|Very cute!  Not really sure what else to say other than that haha. The bow is very cute. Only thing, it gets a little noisy with all those bells, but I don't mind. c:
B0061YRVNS|5|I REALLY love this makeup apron. Holds SO MUCH! Great quality too!
B002TQ4AO0|2|This shaver was received in a crushed box but still appears serviceable.  However, the quality of the razor is definitely less than the P-70 model shaver that I have been using over the past two years without a single problem, other than the blades have become dull. But the price of new blades plus a new screen (recommended) nearly equal the price of the new M-90 razor. Maybe this explains why the M-90 is so inexpensive.
B000F54AQA|1|Just received this product today and was assembling the lid (Reservoir cover) to the Reservoir of unit.  I thought it should be very easy to do, but with a little bit push to let the connection part of lid sliding into the hold part of Reservoir and one end connection on the lid broke.  Although it is made by plastic material, but should not be broken so easy.
B000X21996|5|I bought this walker for my 85 year old aunt who has difficulty walking.  It is easy to set up & was light enough for a frail person to handle.  After my 90 year old mother who resists using a standard walker saw it, she wanted one herself.  It has made a major improvement in her mobility.    Although, I would recommend a sturdier model for an over weight person.
B00UA2A0XK|4|this product so good quality and its perfect
B008TYKDHO|5|Love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair so soft! Very light yet great conditioning! Not at all greasy and very soft hair.
B00IAA8N0G|5|love it
B000FED5DU|5|This is a great trimmer - small, really easy to use, a number of interchangeable heads and the power it delivers makes it great for use - whether as travel-gear or as your everyday trimmer. Comes with a nifty little string bag that looks good and carries everything. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great deal, cos the same thing was marked $22 at Walgreens and $19 at Walmart.
B00TXUP9M2|2|i have not seen any difference ! i have been using it 2 time a week .
B001BO9NBQ|3|At first I was pretty pleased with this bubble wash, until my partner walked into the bathroom while I was taking a bath one day and asked me what the smell was. I explained it was my new Agent Provocateur bubble bath and he proceeded to inform me that it smells like Ajax or cleaning supplies. :/ Now that's all I can seem to think of when I smell it.. because he's kind of right.
B002FDLMI4|1|This smelled like old oil found out of a storage facility...DON'T do this.
B00G2TQNZ4|5|I love this product. I am 50 and my younger cousins want to know my secret because I always look so young. I have been using Vitamin C serum after I wash my face for awhile. It seems to be working.
B0054J38CE|5|Love this stuff. Makes my hair feel great and smells wonderful. Does what it says it should do. Will buy again. Thank you
B00KA1QNJQ|1|Opened bottle and found a gooie mess
B00B6A22QS|5|This is a great soap.  After brain surgery my skin type changed from normal to oily and adult acne.  I started to use soap my skin is back to normal and acne is gone.
B00390DN34|1|Big &#34;STICKY&#34; hair, need I say more!
B004I5FEEK|5|my husband love this so do i
B001GCVJHE|2|It doesn't work half as good as they said. I have used it 8 times. Will probably not use it again. And I bought 6 boxes.
B003WHF148|5|I'm new to using Eminence products after using regular cosmetics and skin care most of my adult life. This brand is organic and is widely used in prominent spas in California. I'm more conscious about chemicals and wanted to do a switch to organic full on and this seemed to be the only line to offer that with a lot of good reviews. So far I have used a bunch of products and I'm satisfied, specially since I had tried other organic products that didn't really seem to work and were a waste of money.<br />This scrub is made of small rice grains that don't hurt the skin but gently seem to exfoliate as far as a scrub is concerned this is as good as any. The price is not so bad compared to other high end products and a little goes a long way. You just put a little bit of it in your fingers and slightly wet it with water then massage it in your face. For an extra umph if you have already one of the eminence toners you could us that instead of water and it is amazing. (I use it with the stone crop toner).
B000RLG8JE|1|Although I'm not pleased with the short life span of the handle, the product has helped with my gums so I'm willing to replace the handle on occasion. I thought Amazon would have these at a lower cost then the waterpik site but it was not even close. Waterpik sells them for $8.99. I purchased three and paid $5.95 for shipping plus California sales tax. Total was $26.97.
B004EWBYSC|4|This product is the same as what you would get at your local beauty counter - just without the packaging and price.
B00MQPSP4A|3|I got my hair today I got it fast like the product said it came on time I liked the package that it came the hair is a little thinner then I thought I thought it would be thick but for the price you cant complain but the hair smells good it wasn't all messed up or tangled when I got it so that was good I brushed threw it no shedding so far so that a good sign I like the texture of it it is soft like it say so I put three stars because it just was a little thinner then I thought but all  in all its good hair for the price
B004IQA3TU|4|Love this product! Not greasy. First introduced at my salon. Have been using it for about 2 years.
B005Q1NQRM|5|I'm a small chick, these help me fill out pants in a way that looks and feels natural. They aren't obnoxiouly thick. I do suggest hand washing, only because the pads are not removable but they can get wrinkled and warped in the machine.
B002GJE7UM|5|I have used these towelettes for several years. While they are good on my sensitive skin, they remove makeup including eye makeup quite easily. I would never leave home without them! They are packaged in convenient small packages that are easy to take on the go. Don't hesitate to try them.
B00752ZINU|5|There are Enough to last a lifetime. They have a  good price as well. They have the rounded head. Thanks
B000MXHG66|5|I love this product it makes me feel young again. Skin is healthy and smooth, easy to apply and most of all it didn't cost that much.<br /><br />I definitely want to recommend this product to my friend, for them to have same experience
B00CVL860W|4|Just what I wanted for softness. The head was a little larger than I prefer, but overall a great deal.
B004G8NI56|3|We recently had the plumber out.  Found wipes clogging drain pipe.  So we did a test - soaked wipes in water overnight.  Other brands fell apart, but Fresh n Flush were still strong........not good.
B0084Y5AMW|1|I have used this product for years. This purchase though was flat without the usual cleansing feeling I usually get from it. I needed to use three times the amount to get a small cleaning tingle.
B0017ZDH52|5|I was worried that my seche vite dry fast top coat was getting too thick.  A few dropper fulls of this restored the top coat to usefulness
B00KNRN9EY|5|Desert Beauty's premium oil is AMAZING! My hear looks unbelievable, even better than after a trip to my hair stylist, and my finger tips never looked better. Perfect gift for people you really love.
B0058E3XJI|2|it just wasn't for me , i am a fair skinned person so it made me stained looked. As for someone else they may like it.
B006ILBK1S|5|absolutely great
B00N0FOK1M|3|Pros Convenient Easy to apply Dries quickly Not greasy  Cons Not very economical  The bottle says Spray & Go but it doesn't literally mean you can spray and not have to rub it in. You want any kind of moisturizer you use on your body to really penetrate it only spraying obviously wouldn't do this well. I didn't buy this expecting that I wouldn't have to rub it in anyway. That being said it doesn't really take much to rub this product in. I definitely spend less time making sure my skin has absorbed this lotion and I can put on my clothe on pretty much immediately without having that sticky or greasy feeling. It applies very well and really does dry fast.  You save on getting the two pack over just one and this lotion is great, I like it, but it isn't economical. You'll notice you'll run out of this much quicker than you would any other moisturizer.
B006H2ZBKY|3|Love the idea. Still haven't master stamping yet. Thick nail polish works great with these plates. Good luck, would rate higher if  the plate worked with all nail polish.
B0034BV6KA|4|This thing actually works!  And it's kind of fun to use.  This little guy transforms all those old sweaters of yours into practically-new sweaters.
B00PC7YG88|5|Love it
B00557OUEU|5|Good quality Almond Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection against breakage. Wonderful carrier oil for Essential Oils. Recommend product very highly A+.
B00RY936WE|5|This stuff is amazing! If fixes so many ailments on my skin!!
B001VIT45M|2|Works great. But pricey.
B004FHZKOA|5|This has been the ONLY lip balm to ever help my chapped lips. Have tried multiple more expensive brands in the past, but this seems to be the only one that worked for me.
B009XTXVEG|5|I love this perfume!!! It's one of my few favs!!! I recived it earlier than I should have… even tho it's a sm roller ballot was worth it, and I plan on buying the bigger gift set for myself near Christmas so it's an early Christmas to me!!!!
B003NBPP6C|5|great stuff good for back pain
B009FP1ESI|4|Good product...would order again.
B004NJ8WFO|5|I love and appreciate this.  It cleans better than my other drugstore scrubbers.  I especially appreciate it when it's late and I'm tired and I don't have to do much work to get my face and pores clean.
B00113FENI|5|Have had this for awhile now, and appreciate it anew each time I use it. This thing works! Yeah, it feels really weird &#34;grating&#34; ones feet, but let's face it, we women do a lot of things that aren't pretty to stay pretty. All I know is this thing takes all that disgusting dead skin off where it needs to come off, and for that, I am grateful.
B000F3DXLU|4|I use this as an accessory to fix minor fashion issues.....like blouse gap.
B009IA7542|5|skin feels refreshed after use.  Seems to remove oils which accumulate during the day./
B0040PDKPI|5|I work in a shop and my hands and body are subject to everything!  My skin is always dry.  I especially love this stuff in the winter.  And you can use it on your face.  Goodbye Olay.
B000068PBT|5|Perfect fit and working well
B00583QVDO|5|These are great! Best beauty secrets ever! For entire face! Recommended by a well-known dermatologist --similar to derma planing but a fraction of the cost!
B00T4JR96Q|3|This product does smell nice.  It seems light enough but was still too much for my fine hair.  I think it might be better suited for thinker hair types.
B004GV8HA4|1|I didn't realize that this item has been discontinued, which could explain why I got a rank bottle in my order. I came online to recheck the reviews and it seems as though the newest review had a similar problem. Most of the older reviews give this item high marks and a lot mention the nice smell. Mine smelled like mildew. Really disappointed because I had high hopes. I have contacted Amazon to process a return/refund.
B009Q1YPTG|5|Love it! A lot of colors to choose from. Ordered it and it came fast.
B00QGBDLEO|5|We purchased 3 Vox Madelyn products and I was very satisfied with my choice. My boyfriend's mother started using the Ser Bella collagen and retinol serums after we bought it for her as a birthday gift. She says she has never tried a retinol products before and was amazed at how it improved her skin texture. Her face literally feels softer and smoother and she looks more radiant... She complained about dull dry skin and I can see clearly that her face is brighter now and looks really healthy. What surprised me the most was when she mentioned that using the serums actually makes her moisturisers last longer. So it seems as if using the different products together works better, and it does not really cost much more. I am definitely convinced of the benefits!
B00DPE9EQO|4|Just got it. My wife said its still too early to tell
B003NRAXPO|5|I absolutely love this product. Goes on smooth & leaves your skin radiating! I wish it were more easily available!
B006Z43V3S|3|it really doesnt hold curls, but its ok if u put rollers in your hair after using it and go to bed
B001707PLE|5|I have been using this product for years and am very satisfied. I definitely recommend this product. I am very pleased.
B000P2755G|5|I have an assortment of colognes ranging from True Religion, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, this being my favorite of all of them.
B005EQOEXE|5|Perfectly with a few extras please all out he's asking forward to it he's just like girls go all out tricks finish doing anything fun with your friends to play the role that is a very long detailed with you guys are coming to do with the going out tonight in to go out for you guys I know what really the best way to go with that one is going to be a funny story were going to go on a tweak.  the most part in between your friends with nothing to be ashamed of looking heavy duty on a new level of control that is the most important Parr and a lot right to any  much more than a here on my way to go with the most extreme example of how much Is to much on most. Want make most outstanding anything to do that for you guys have the most but nothing to go out with the look of right after you guys have the most crazily layer on the most important thing is to go to do it all in all of over a looks like it is to much.  Maximum vs the most unique and special effects of nothing overwhelming to go to much more of a lot.
B005MQK2VE|5|For a few very important reasons, we needed a lotion that will not only soften skin, but help to heal extremely dry, flaky skin. My daughter has 3 different skin diseases, including allergic dermatitis. She has very sensitive skin. My skin is dry and damaged due to severe weather conditions, such as intense heat, and monsoon season in AZ.<br /><br />I've used over 20 different lotions for the last 35 years, and thus far, this lotion is the best up-to-date. It softens the skin, and keeps it soft between applications. Only a small amount is needed, and you can feel the healing power of the Cocoa Butter. There is a marked difference in my daughter's skin and mine, just weeks after applying.<br /><br />There is no harsh, overwhelming scent, and the container will last a while, because only a small amount is needed to penetrate and soothe  the skin. My severely dry skin was actually peeling off and itchy, prior to use. My daughter's back was red, itchy, and very dry, prior to using this lotion. We apply it once a day, and our skin feels much better.<br /><br />Most important, no skin irritations or reactions are noted, after using this lotion. We will be ordering again-and-again in the future, to make sure we don't run out. This lotion is worth every penny, and the price for a pack of 3 is reasonable for a top quality product that works! Highly recommended.
B00FSKMWDU|4|I've lost a lot of weight on a special diet and am working hard to keep wrinkled skin down. I feel this cream has been beneficial in that regard.
B00F9X34XS|5|love it
B002PR2GLM|5|Good value and does what it say on the label just has good has the other expensive brand does the same thing why pay more.
B00NQOZVQK|5|Works great. However the longer your hair gets the more difficult it is.
B003U8ESI4|5|Even better than I expected. I had been using the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer since Christmas 2006 and I really loved it! But it finally became sort of worn out. Yet it was difficult to think much real improvement could be made on that great product. I was WRONG! The QT4070 is far superior in almost every way. It is smaller and lighter and thus easier to handle. It is also MUCH easier to clean! It is a dream come true for this type of appliance. I could not be happier!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/4/2013:<br />STILL proud of this purchase! Been using it for 2 months now. Battery lasts MUCH longer than the T980. The cuttings chamber appeared smaller than the T980 yet somehow it isn't so I can usually get through a complete usage without having to empty it. Some background why that is significant. I not only shave my beard but also my entire head--at the 1 mm shortest setting! I hate having to shave but not as much as I hate not shaving. So I shave only every 2 weeks or so. Not only is the chamber big enough, but even the vacuum \\"tunnel\\" (between blades and chamber) remains pretty free as well. So that makes the whole job quicker and easier. But even after shaving my entire head, the battery indicator is still full or near full so I don't usually have to recharge until after at least 2 shaving cycles. THAT IS NICE! And no, I don't work for or own stock in the company. I'm just a happy user.
B000BNHRZC|4|My skin has never looked so good, used to struggle with acne and red patches but now looks really great, the only down side is you dont get very much of the mositure defense lotion, but I still have alot left of all the others and I have had it for over a month.  Fabulous line!
B0015IXRWY|5|Love this stuff!!  Truly softens features and gives an airbrushed look to makeup.
B003K7EK92|4|needed
B002C7487U|5|Excellent all natural facial product.  Delievered on time as promised.
B000L596FE|5|Really detangles and is very durable.  Saw that other brushes didn't last so I bought this one and it's a great brush.
B004L4EING|4|For the price, this is a great set! The brush does need to be gently cleaned before use. The logo on the brush handle was barely visible and came off with the first use. The shaving soap that comes in this kit is also has a very mellow and calming sent.
B00T2JM3VE|5|I love it! been using it for 2 weeks! It works almost as good as my anatasia beverly hills duo eyebrow brush. the Spoolie is a bit softer but it works and the bristle of the brush is semi soft. It doesn't pick up a lot of the powder, but that's how i like it. It's a good blender brush and I don't need to apply it as much as I did with my anatasia brush.
B00BFS89SQ|1|I have been an user of the Braun Smart Shaver series 1 for over 20 years now. This is the fifth consecutive unit I buy. However, this is the first time I got really disappointed with the product. The blade is coming off from its holder during the shaving process what is unacceptable. I am struggling to have this issue solved via Amazon and Braun.<br />The shaver head with its blade costs 1/4 of the entire shaver unit, so I refuse to buy a replacement blade.<br />Braun lost a loyal customer here.<br />Bye
B008V5VRKS|5|Darling!  Perfect for the lady who travels. :)
B002ARKAZ6|3|Does the job I bought it to do, but it's waxy and requires multiple layers to get any kind of real color.
B00932C572|1|Disappointing! Clogged pores with unnecessary ingredients.
B006FKXWCW|3|Since I'm a female mastectomy survivor and wanted a 'spare' left boob without the $450 cost of the medical replacements, imagine my surprise when I came across a PAIR of these beauties online at less than 10% the cost of my usual ONE.  Other than getting the an extreme case of the giggles when I opened the package and saw them staring back at me they are very usable for a short jaunt to the store, etc. They are not  heavy duty but suit the use I will be putting them to and since they are switch-able for left or right side use I can switch them out. Also, next time I will not order the 'narrow' size.
B00GQU5YY0|2|Doesn't stay on very well
B001A7YGSE|5|Makes thinning areas look as if you have a full head of hair.  Comb out before going to bed because powder residue will stain pillows.
B0046VGPHQ|5|This stuff is great! I love it and so does my fiance' (he used it first). He is a ginger and is either white or red no tan ever! We did it on him for 4 days and he was very tan! He looked great and felt great. I have never sprayed anyone before and it was so easy! I even did his face neck and ears without using the cream I read about and the only part that was bad were the tops of his feet. I dont remember reading the care or washing of the mitt so I just hand washed it every other time I used it.  I used it on my legs and upper arms because of my farmers tan and I had a wedding so I had to wear a dress and I never wear shorts so my arms were very nice and tan just nothing else! So I used it for 3 days on my legs and upper arms and it looked great.  I wears off if you dont do it every few days just to maintain the color (which I didnt do) but you shouldn't do it every day I think it said every 3-4 days? I would buy this again and my fiance' (now the tan ginger lol) LOVES IT!  I have a friend that spray tans people at a salon and she didn't even know he was using anything untill he lifted his arm and his arm pit was white hahaha. Long story short, I would buy this again and again and the tan looks even untill about day 3 or 4 after you stop tanning when it starts to fade then you look splotchy ( for a ginger) but I really didn't get splotchy. So good luck and happy tanning!
B00MITGRLC|4|Super cute and fun.  They just only last about a day or two so you don't get much out of them.
B008BHO53M|4|I've had this brand before, works well and is moderately priced. Easy to maintain and use. Guards can be broken, so don't drop to floor.
B004F86F7U|5|When I use this mask at night, I can feel the difference in my skin texture next morning. It feels softer and hydrated. I really like how easy it is to use this mask because once you let it dry completely, it is very easy to peel it off. It does not leave any pieces and peels all at once. It leaves my face feeling clean and soft, and if you want you can apply some moisturizer to make that effect last longer.
B002C9KQJW|5|I have developed some hand pain issues due to playing the piano for so many years.  This little piece of equipment has brought mobility back to my hand and fingers.  Great investment.
B009L6ZSME|2|Does'nt run as smooth as it should.
B001FVGKN4|5|Works great
B001E38194|5|Best blades I have used. I can use one blade for about a 1.5-2 weeks. I use art of shaving sandalwood cream, also a good choice.
B004FRZNMO|5|Using this product on my double processed hair keeps color intact and beautiful.<br />Makes my dull and burned out hair beautiful and shiny.
B00BT76SZY|5|i just received this kit, so happy, wonderful and fast service, i definitely recommend it.
B004V904J8|2|This atomizer worked fine at first, but after traveling with it for a short amount of time, it leaked. I would not recommend it.
B001VDENBM|3|I know there are several uses for the facial whips but I prefer to use mine either as eyeshadow or a base for powder eyeshadow.<br /><br />I bought three different colors, Spotlight, Toasted and Pink Lemonade. My favorite is Spotlight- it can be used as a highlighter as well. However, 2 of the 3 tubes ended up separating into a watery substance. Literally 3/4 of the tube down the drain. Very disappointing. I tried shaking what was rest but every time I open the tube it seems to happen. :/<br /><br />With some improvements it could be a lot better. I'll probably continue to use them but I won't buy them again.
B000H83G0Q|5|Non-greasy and smooth, absorbs quickly. LAB makes some great products for men.
B000VEUSHU|5|I like this product and have been uning it for sometime.  I have seen results and would recommand this product  to use.
B003S9ZBFE|5|ive had dreads for almost 5 months now and i started using this kit  on month 2... and boy i gotta say! its shown a significant difference  i am very satisfied that i picked this up!
B0060F5YUA|5|loved it on my granddaughter and now I have my own
B0032F8G4W|1|After taking one capsule per day at night and the end of two weeks I notice the bust line was increased to a whole size bigger then before.  I stopped taking them.  The capsules do not taget wrinkles but other parts of the body.
B00KYUXIOG|5|This is a great product. I have been useing Yeouth for 2 months and i'm no longer self conscious about the appearance of my neck. :)
B002GJND8O|5|I thought the product would come 4 days afer I ordered it, like other products I ordered online. But it arrived Right Away.One and half day after I ordered it. Wow. Super! I couldn't wait to try it on. It's mild. I left it on for 3 minutes for the first time use. A little redness after I washed it off and it's gone in 10 minutes. I hope there will be some good change on my face after several uses. I think The Products from Skin Laboratory is mild and safe. It's worh to try.
B00LYRDJL0|2|Very stringy and sticky.  Felt like plastic...
B006GL7TII|4|Awesome deal pretty great lashes for the price. Package was a little smooshed but nothing to crazy and lashes weren't damaged at all.
B003TBYW74|5|OK
B004K0MSOM|5|I've had this sharpener for about a month now, and it works perfectly! No matter how many times i use it, it's still spick n' span! Considering the quality, the price is a great bargain! Definitely deserves a 5/5 rating :]!
B000U4WNC4|5|This is the best hair treatment for dry and damaged hair. Just a little product leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. Well worth the price!
B00I3VHKVK|2|Strong chemical smell. Eye makeup brushes too thin.
B003OFB0RK|5|I have used this product for a very long time. I ran out and could not find it. Went to Amazon and found out it is discontinued so I stocked up. I have frizzy hair to begin with and the grey coming in makes it worse. This product is amazing. I can now wear straight hair without the frizz.
B00AW691IY|5|My face looks amazing with only two weeks of use.  I'll use this product for the rest of my life.<br />Judy
B0029U0YKA|3|This is a decent nail filer but when I received it the end was already peeling off when I took it out of the package. I will probably look for a different brand next time.
B00BMLZGL4|5|its hard to find all four products sold together and for such a great price. they work extremely well and i highly recommend them to any one looking
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|Quiet, runs for a long time on one charge and provides a very good shave.
B006JF2X8C|5|I'm embarrassed to say that I bought this exact same straightener from the mall a couple years ago for $100!! I feel like an idiot! Thank you Amazon for selling it at  MUCH more reasonable price! This product is of excellent quality and gives fantastic results. My hair feels softer and smoother in seconds. I love it!
B006L4GTFO|5|great stuff, not powdery smelling at all like other cheaper stuff , costs a lot less online. Great value in larger quantity. Never overwhelming at all, just natural orange and / or orange blossom but this actually  grapefruit peel essence so it is unique, a proprietary formulation. She will wear little else. Hard to find, get it while you still can. Imported, France.
B000NJE14E|5|I have mixed, biracial hair which means it's kinky and thick. I used to hate straightening my hair because it would take 2 hours and usually ended with less than desired results. I looked as if I had just been electrocuted instead of having tamed, flat hair.<br /><br />I use this product and a flat iron set to 310 degrees. It now takes me about 30 minutes to flat iron my hair and the results are beautiful. I also like that this product allows the user to brush the hair while pulling it straight without getting burned. Major plus!<br /><br />The only thing I'm worried about is if the tension is causing hair breakage. I haven't noticed any unevenness yet, but the product does pull the hair quite taut.
B0055BZ37O|5|If you care about your oral hygiene please buy this product. Toothpaste is smooth and mild minty flavor. Keeps your breath clean. The same with the oral rinse. My gums were bleeding everytime I brushed my teeth, now it is very rare.
B000GR7KCS|5|Nice light scent to go with my Ivory clean!
B007AS52DK|1|I bought this item because it is cruelty-free but I haven't had much luck with it.  I have left it on for almost 10 minutes with only patches of hair coming off
B007K6K0IY|5|Secret Oulast Clean Clear Gel is an excellent product.  I can use this with confidence all day long.  Avoid white marks on your clothing and do not worry about it wearing off.  It is totally clear and smells fresh all day.  The product packagin is mess free and dispenses the right amount with each use.  I was lucky enough to receive this product free from BZZ Agent as a promotion but will be purchasing this in the future!!!!!!!!!!
B003E1D8N8|5|Fantastic product.  Absolutely what my colored hair needs.  Does not dry my hair out and if I forget to use a conditioner, no big deal the shampoo has got me covered.
B00CR20BSU|5|This is an amazing purchase for a great price.  They are all really good colors and came packaged very well.  They also arrived very fast they arrived before the estimated delivery date even!!  I would definitely recommend this product to others.
B003ICXD4M|5|Got this for my daughter. She has short hair & natural curls. She likes that its small enuff to straighten her hair. Unlike most straighteners.
B001ET7LRG|4|So it's only been 3 days since I've bought this product and my scars already have significantly reduced in size and color. I have very sensitive skin and so far it has not irritated it at all. I make sure to gently rub it in for the full 3 minutes and then i will put a small glob on the scar before bed. I have been applying it 3 times a day. I was a little skeptical because the reviews are always in the middle, but everyone's skin is different- if you've tried thousands of products like I have for battling my skin, why not give this product a try? I have not tried putting it on an active pimple since I would be too afraid of irritating it further, but as far as hyperpigmentation it works!! I have been an acne sufferer for half of my life so I am happy to find something that diminishes scars much faster than anything else I've tried. Even faster than aloe vera in my opinion.
B00662Z24A|5|This kit is just what you need to do gel nails at home.  I am not good at doing my nails but I followed the instructions and they came out perfect! I am going to save so much money! I do wish the light fit all 5 fingers but I can live with it. I am one of those people who read review after review before I buy and I can tell you this is the best one to get if you are just starting out.
B0001EKYRO|5|Live in the desert, have sensitive skin and initially purchased this from my dermatologist, now I am on the web trying to purchase another before it runs out. Good control but doesn't cause any irritation even with my sensitive skin. My doctor suggested every other day to start and then work it into a regular routine. Turns out, I only needed it every other day for breakouts and then it turned into about 3 times a month during periods of breakout. If my skin starts acting up I start it up at night and can wear it during the day under makeup for a few days and then \\"wah la\\" back to good control again:) Highly recommend this. But a caution from my Dr. was to use sunscreen as it does have Mandelic Acid.
B00A9XNPWS|5|The fragrance ONE BILLION lived up to its hype and met all of mine and my husband's expectations. It was a good purchase.
B002G1XA08|5|I have been using organic products all my adult life and this is the best body wash I have ever come across. It is paraben and sulfate free, plus it is biodegradable and organic. I find the company to be particularly picky about what goes in this line of body washed, and reading the ingredient list is like reading a grocery list - all good fruits and veggies and no unpronounceable words. I have a paraben and sulfate sensitivity and I have been using this body wash for a while now with no problems. It is gentle enough for sensitive skin but tough enough to clean immaculately. It leaves no icky residue and it lathers well. Was one of the only soaps recommended to me by my surgeon after I had abdominal surgery which was gentle on wounds but cleaned well :).
B00336EUTK|5|The Pro Effects white strips really do work! Unlike the regular ones, which don't adhere well, these actually stay in place and get you the results you're looking for!
B000BTAVIQ|5|I bought this shampoo when I was desperately lossing hair and hoped this would help. I can't really say that this shampoo does all of the work but my hair has stopped falling out and I can already see tiny hair everyone on my scalp. There were 3 main components to my regime that stop losing and start growing hair:<br />1. Vitamin: Daily vitamin and Nzuri Elixir diligently<br />2. Folicure Shampoo. I use it every day since I have thin baby hair and it gets oily after my work out so I have to wash my hair every day. It cleans very well and sometimes leave my hair a tiny bit dry but some Biosilk fix that right up. No problem there.<br />3. Wild Growth hair oil. I use about 5-10 drop every other day.<br /><br />With these 3 steps, I feel less stress about my hair and look forward to see the tiny hairs grow longer!<br /><br />It's a must to get!
B00009RF1E|4|Despite the fact that I bought this trimmer at Walmart for $ 19.95, when I use it, it feels like a razor of much higher price and value. It cuts very well and I am very pleased with the result. On the short, \\"stubble\\" setting, I get an absolutely excellent result.     I do agree that the plastic attachments are cheap and it is kind of bogus that we have to switch them out for each different setting (a different attachment for each beard length. So I give this product four, instead of five stars.
B001G5HZCY|5|I have tried the cheap blades, 12 for 2 bucks, the murker blade that came with my razor, and the wilkinson swords. The feather is by far the best. they are all unbelievably sharp, but the feather just has a different feel on my face. Its smoother going across the stubble on my face. Where as the other blades started going dull around the 3rd or 4th day the feathers last and work well through the 5th and 6th day's use.
B002RO5ZHK|1|There is hardly any arch support contrary to the claim of the seller. Can not feel any springs on the heel portion. I will not recommend this to anybody.
B00QWB7MLQ|4|Very pretty, but very small even when linking to the last chain. You will need to pin it in your hair for sure.
B000M17DDE|5|I have always liked the Schick band. I stopped using Gillette when they switched to the new style. I tried the Quattro and I have never gone back! Actually I bought a lot of blade replacements just in case they decide to discontinue the razor. The reason i prefer this razor is the angle on the handle. It actually has one! The new Gillette's do not, and it makes me feel as if I am shaves with a straight blade with no protection. On the other hand with the Schick, with the angle in the handle, I can use it with little presure or a lot, up or down. No problems. Great Product!
B004QI271W|5|I have the same model in my country, so I know this epilator. The price is very good and the model is easy to use. The results are perfect. It`s fast so you only need 15 minutes for your legs.
B00GJQN5YC|4|this is an amazing product and we use it often
B001TAIFZM|5|Great product! Use carefully!
B007W255HW|5|I first learned of this product on Sephora, but I knew I could get it for a better price on Amazon, so I bought some. I have only used it 3 times, and already I can see a significant difference! To all you women who fall victim to hyperpigmentation in the summer or when overexposed to sunlight, this is the product for you. I have always had freckles, but as I am aging the sun is less and less kind to me. I'm getting married in mid September and I am confident that my face, chest and hands will be beautiful by then. Use this product at night ladies and sunscreen in the day and before you know it, your skin will be beautiful!!!
B004RSU1F0|5|My girls loves this fragrance! It has a lemony, masculine scent and you only have to put a little on!
B00GY5XVWY|4|So I love my sudsy shampoo but I decided to try this, the \\"naked\\" one and pantene's cleansing condish for color treated hair. Ok, these all smell great. Like heavenly. I used only the very tiniest shampoo before, but only a penny sized amount, then fully saturated my hair in each of these. I left them on, washed, then rinsed. This will take getting used to but I can see the benefits, and it's so much better than wen, which I used only once. This stuff spreads really easily, is buttery without being waxy, and does seem to cleanse my hair and scalp. Since my fav shampoo is prell, I'm going to use it as a body wash only and let my hair rest. It's hard to imagine straying from shampoo. I don't plan to never use it again but since these conditioners have such amazing fragrances, I'm liking this new cleansing experience. One thing to note is it might take a little longer to rinse. However, if you're desperate for clean AND moisturized hair, this is for you. Also, it makes brushing it out post-shower very easy. I have wavy hair prone to tangles so that's a huge plus, but as I mentioned before, it takes time to get used to washing hair without loads of bubbles.
B007B3LQRU|5|This product was recommended by my stylist.  I was skeptical about ordering the product online because she warned me about possible knock off products.  She suggested that I get the product from one of the local exclusive hair product stores.  I returned to her shop but I did not tell her where I pruchased the items from I was waiting for her to comment on the quality of the product.  She had rave reviews which made e feel great !!!!!
B002KRMFM2|1|These glasses work okay, but the flip top case fell apart the first time I opened it. The hinge is plastic, and it just broke off. Since I bought these glasses to carry around in my pocket, they aren't much good without the case. Save your money and look for a better product.
B000YJ2SKM|5|gentle & good price. not a miracle product but gets the job done without the irritation.
B005D2VGPS|5|I am trying to make my own mentholated arnica rub for migraine relief due to stress. Arnica soothes sore muscles and helps them to relax. This oil was perfect for my needs. I added it to coconut oil, beeswax, petroleum, camphor and menthol crystals. I also added some other essential oils. It is really hard to find arnica oil so I was happy when I got this.
B000F5DRCS|5|I have a thick long hair and always hoped that I could get a product like this that makes me look like I just came back from the beauty salon. I could not believe my eyes the first time I used it. It gives me a fresh beautiful look everytime. Convenient, fast and sturdy. I've had it for over a year now and wish I had it long ago. It is a GO!
B00A3LVMMQ|5|This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was very pleased with it.  I can't say a lot more as I have not seen the item.  But, if he is happy, I am happy
B001ET787O|1|The product description is misleading as a very important detail is omitted; The toothpaste includes extra whitening. I have been using sensodyne for 10 years and like the product, however, i did not want to buy the version with extra whitening.
B001399LNY|5|For someone who not proficient with a curling iron, this curling brush is definitely the answer.  Just watch out for burning your ears!!!
B001B3PL5Y|5|Every time I use this, I have a GREAT hair day! No kidding! I use it sparingly & on special occasions!
B005KSZKTI|4|I like the emphasis on conditioning rather than shampooing. Shampoo strips my hair and by the time I restore its moisture its time to wash again. Its cleans and conditions sufficiently and I can always condition afterwards if I need extra conditioning.
B004ID39I0|3|The coverage is good but the brush is terrible. It causes lashes to clump together so I ended up using a different brush all together.
B000E3YPIG|5|The best cream for face . I love it
B00FT9Y2QU|5|This is my first time trying this lip scrub. I didn't realize it was edible. I use it every night. I just rub some on my lips and lick off the excess. It is like a tasty little dessert that really does a good job of buffing your lips. This is a great product! I also love the sticker on the bottom of the product that tells you who made the product, when it was made and when it will expire!
B001J6O3N4|5|It has none of the cloying and, in some cases, repugnant scents of other deodorants. I wouldn't use any but Speedstick--ever. Excellent product. Robert Graysmith
B00C7DYBX0|5|I have been using this product for about 3 months, I am 66 years old, I have no<br />lines around my eyes, not many wrinkles. I really know this product has helped<br />my skin to rejuvenate. I just gave one to my secretary to start using.<br />Update been now using this product for about 1 1/2 years, still love it!!!<br />Thanks for a great product, more people should know about this formula for their<br />face.
B009V8BUA6|5|Love my makeup case perfect for what I have don't have any complains enough room and also comes with a key which I didn't know but good cuz my daughter can't get my make up any more
B009G4C0FY|5|Perfect replacement heads for my Oral B electric toothbrush
B00JRUXH4K|5|These are just cute.  I am getting them put on my next fill.  I hope the stone isn't to big but they are so cute.<br />The color on the stone is just perfect.
B001KYMKH6|5|I absolutely love this stuff. I have short curly hair and it keeps the curls in place and looking good all day. I have tried many hair curling products and I always come back to this one.
B007K6K0IY|5|Loved this deodorant! Got to try it free and went out to buy more the next week! It goes on clear and stays all day. You still smell fresh even after a long hot day! You can wear any color and not worry about marks too!
B00KUTUNU8|5|I have only used them for about 2 weeks, however, it has made a difference in the comfort of several pairs of shoes.  Easy to use ---I sleep with them on as well as use them when barefooted or in my wider toe bed shoes!
B000X1YIOU|5|Recommended by a a lady who did my facial
B004OLSB8Y|5|I hesitated for a while about spending this much for a tube of mascara.  I ordered it anyway and begin using it right away.  The masscara is great,lasts all day, dosen't smear, is waterproof and goes on smooth and defines each lash.  The shipping was fast and the packaging excellent.  I will buy this again and always order from Amazon.
B009IROB8S|4|If you are looking for a neon orange, this is very neon orange. I didn't love it on, but it will be a perfect color once Halloween rolls around.
B003YBP0N4|4|A doctor recommended this and it seems like a good product but no dramatic difference. I'm not sure how to know if it is working.
B0000ZLEJG|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance! The local hippie shop that I used to buy it at stopped carrying it and I am so glad I stumbled upon it here. It is very sensual but down-to-earth. Auric Blends \\"Love\\" fragrance is also very sexy, but in a sweet way. This one is much more primal and sensual. It should come with a warning and a can of mace, it is so effective at attracting men! And this is a great price for one bottle. It lasts for quite some time.
B00JJAIMLQ|1|can anyone use some heart and soul towards making a product that your own baby will wear.  These are of such poor quality.
B001T0HHDI|5|Curls the hair without burning your fingers. Plenty of area to grab and style. Heats fast and consistently. Creates beautiful curls.
B000143MVO|5|Great tweezers
B0043D7O0E|5|Great service. Nice for small handbags!
B00DSPFI56|2|Im sure I ordered an X&Y Angle wig and I received a really awful knock off. Its thin, yellow and no where close to the picure. looking through the reviews and the customer photos it seems some people received what is pictured and some received crappy fakes. I suppose it's a gamble and I lost.
B00XGVV2H0|5|My hair is in much better condition.  I got this to use when I pulled my hair back in a pony tail to go to the gym.  I didn't want to shower before and after the gym and I hated it when my hair looked greasy.  It worked great for this use, but then I took it camping and I used it as my only hair cleaner as we had a shower but the water was cold and so I didn't want to shampoo every day.  My hair is in so much better condition without shampooing every day that I am now using in on a regular basis.  I just dust a bit at the roots with a makeup brush and then bush my hair as usual and it completely disappears leaving my air looking and even feeling fresh and clean.
B00007M9SU|5|Product as described.  Works great on the go.  Seller was on time and very responsive to my emails.  Would definately buy from again.
B003NULDZA|5|Previous 5 blades would get stuff caught in between the blades constantly, I wouldn't say they spread it apart as much as I think they should, but it isn't a problem and shaves better than any razor I've used before.
B005IQ34A4|5|very good
B000C235WQ|5|I bought this product online because it wasn't available in retail outlets any longer. The price is too high. Service was as advertised.
B00FEMQUKS|5|I have very thin hair and this is genetic problem. I didn't thought to give it a try due to genetic problem but when I tried this shampoo I found that my hair are getting thicker and even the salon person saw this difference.
B000273RFG|5|Too bad this product is discontinued.  Works great on problem skin.
B001EWEPD6|1|This is not a scent I prefer.  Otherwise it works just fine.
B00ADCXEC6|3|It can be taken anywhere. The toenail clippers are not that sharp. I like the variety of tools.
B001ET765I|3|My hair gets oily easily but after using this, it actually stays dry and nice for a long time. I haven't had any major improvements, it's an okay shampoo. The thing I don't like about it is that it requires a pretty big amount if you want it properly dispersed throughout your hair and get that nice smooth soapy feeling. Even so, it's one of those shampoos that won't give u very smooth rub on your hair.. So, when you're rubbing your hair with the shampoo, your hair gets stuck to each other or something. So, I've accidentally pulled my hair many times bcoz of the texture this shampoo gives. But it's only bcoz of dat, dat my hair remains dry, un-oily, and strong(er) I think.<br /><br />It's okay. If you like these kind of shampoos, go for it.
B0012JY4G4|4|Works well, but be careful about leaving it on too long.  It left my hair porous and a little brittle, but I was applying new dye & keratin afterward anyway to seal the shaft back.  I've been using 30 level processor with my dye, so my hair wasn't my regular color underneath all the dye.  If you're not planning on putting new dye on after using this stuff, ABSOLUTELY do a strand test.  My hair was orange after I washed this out.
B000PI2W94|5|Looked like a professional blow out
B006YC3UP0|5|Great brushes for an even better price. Girlfriend was very happy with the quality of these brushes!!! Give em a try, they're well worth it.
B004VGSVHS|2|I really didn't notice a difference in the whiteness in my teeth after using this toothpaste for months.
B0014WJQSA|4|real nice manly scent...like it very much
B0012QK3HG|2|Smells great but just doesn't do the trick. I have thinner hair and this just seems to weigh it down. Maybe it's not meant for my hair type. I honestly bought it for its great smell. Going back to my tried and true.
B00KPEK0QK|5|Love it! Shipped fast and looks great!!
B002SV55FE|4|Lovely lipstick
B004750DQ0|5|Granddaugvhter loves it
B003WN1ELQ|5|My dermatologist recommended this for my husband and myself.  It is not greasy and absorbs very well.  Love that it has 50 spf.  Works well under my makeup.
B00ER9MK26|1|Very tyipcal of Beyonce to copy yet another fragrance from Britney Spears. First there was &#34;Midnight Heat&#34; which is a very CHEAP mock of &#34;Midnight Fantasy&#34; from Britney and now this. First the perfumes have the same notes, but for some stranger reason Britney's last longer and smells a lot better (hmmm) and also she copied Britney with the &#34;Carter World Tour&#34; edition which Britney has &#34;Circus Fantasy&#34; which is from her Circus Tour and the bottle is the same freaking COLOR! If the perfumes smelled different with different notes I wouldn't have a problem, but this is just too similar to ignore how Beyonce can not be original in anthing she does.
B006BA3BAY|2|I bought this after reading that coconut oil was a good natural leave-in conditioner for bi-racial hair.  The package came with two bottles.  When I opened the bottle and tried to squeeze some out, the little round plug on the top of the bottle popped out.  I put it back in and squeezed again and it happened again, so I just let it come out the big hole and that's when I figured out why it wasn't coming out before.  This stuff is really thick.  Even with the plug out, I had to squeeze really hard to get any out.  I ended up putting it in the microwave for about 45 seconds to make it more like oil.  For comparison, this stuff is the consistency of crisco and when melted is like cooking oil.  I put it on my girls' hair and it got like crisco again, because their hair was cold and wet.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this is not what I expected.  I will stick to argan and jojoba oil for now.
B002GKC3MU|5|I was tired of the loud noise of the new clippers that we had just received not to long ago, and the fact the the teeth on the old clippers liked to bit the skin. These cordless clippers are fantastic! Quiet, smooth, and painless. I couldn't ask for more. My hair cut is to simple and not worth spending $11 plus a tip at a shop every three weeks, this thing paid for itself fast. Easy to clean as well!
B005DKKBU6|5|This was a gift for my son-in-law. He said he loves it and that it him a closer shave than any blade he's ever tried.
B008FZZSCC|2|Nothing special - esp given Mizani's excellent reputation.  This stuff doesn't do anything for my relaxed hair.  Wont buy again.
B008N5KLGC|5|Other than the fact that this was such a cute hair-dryer ( loved the Giraffe Print)  it was at a great price for professional grade. Comes with two attachments. I can have hot or cool are to dry much better for my hair, no frizzys.  Also a Limited Addition.
B00V4PX9XK|1|I just ordered this, so I can't say how well it works, perhaps I will update my review. What I don't appreciate are all of the bogus reviews about this product. If you look closely, you will see all 5 star reviews from individuals with &#34;interesting&#34; first and last names. I have a strong suspicion that this company posted bogus reviews in order to bump up the ratings of this product. I, for one, buy items based on the reviews, and at this point I feel duped. I should have looked more closely at the reviews before I ordered it. Buyer beware.
B00OQNG8LW|5|This type of brush is a must have for guys who want to have add a little style to their hair. It is so comfortable to roll and is great at shaping hair while brushes and combs can really only push hair back or forward. Great product.
B00F1COSFU|5|Awesime. Stops the itching on my scalp. I will be ordering it again in the future. It seems to be helping my hair grow back too.
B00BKZQJHW|4|Husband is satisfied and it helps keep the whole bathroom smelling nice.
B00VW1HNZQ|5|Great nail cutter
B004VLXD8K|5|This is one of the few sunscreens that does not make me break out or clog my pores. It also has a delicate, light scent, that is almost unnoticeable. It wears well, and does not make your face feel hot.
B008ND3044|5|I get plenty compliments when I wear it and I feel like a queen. Its perfect! Happy with my purchase, great fast and easy shipping.
B00639DLV2|4|I actually really like this.  Normally I hate applying sunscreen; I'm diligent about my skin routine but the truth is I'm sure I have sun damage because I hate the feel of thick, sticky lotion.  This is great-light, moisturizing, good scent.  Worth it-especially if it's on sale.
B00MPDXHOG|5|It's good for me.
B0067YUFSA|2|I used to have the Paul Mitchell brand of this, I like it better as this one I found a bit sticky and my hair looks dirty very quickly.
B00LEFJM7M|3|I ordered brown sugar but received peppermint...the peppermint has a tingling affect to it and it did scrub the dead skin off of my lips well.
B00CLET9DW|5|awesome
B0083WXLLW|5|A great non-cakey, translucent powder that keeps oil away and sets makeup perfectly.
B000YB8B3S|5|This Lubriderm with Oat Extract is the best lotion I have found for dry skin.  My skin is super dry during the winter months.  This lotion softens and moisturises the skin when you apply it and it also seems to \\"teach\\" the skin to hold more moisture.  So gradually I need less of it to maintain the moisture and softness in my skin.  I like it better than the Aveeno (with oat extract) lotion.
B00BDLVWIE|5|its great, you feel the minty gel doing it's job.  use it the right way and you'll be thin in no time!  haha well I used it about a week before my bffs wedding and I gotta tell you I noticed the post-pregnancy pouch diminished.  definitely recommend!
B001FB5OAO|3|Pros:<br />*The smell is fruity and pleasant, but mild. You have to actually be hugging someone to smell the apricot.<br />*It definitely keeps you defunkified - although not in the weird 72-hour way mainstream deodorants do. You'll need to apply every day, or twice a day if it's humid.<br />*If you are a hippie-deodorant kind of person, the ingredients are probably okay for you.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*I only have one con, but it's a serious one. At first, all of the ToM natural scents (this one, lavender, lemongrass) work fine and feel fine on my skin. But after a couple of months, they start to give me, um, armpit rash. The skin darkens and becomes irritated. It does go away, but it takes a month or two. I wonder if I'm especially sensitive to the propylene glycol, but I don't know.<br /><br />The bottom line: My spouse really likes this deodorant, and has no adverse responses to it. I really wish this stuff worked for me, because it was so gloriously easy to just have one Subscribe&Save order going for the whole household, but I'm back to looking for some other variant of hippie deodorant.
B0018C0MJS|4|The clippers are some heavy,but do a good job.
B0097XQ33Y|5|Love it
B00IDHW5Q4|5|This handle coupled with the fusion blade is extraordinary. Not only is it a work of at in its beauty and design but it is functionally efficient as well. Simply love it. Additionally, the service packaging and delivery were excellent,  now how can you beat that,  and yes,  I would purchase this again in a heart beat. JW
B00JQ6XF1A|4|Did come a lot quicker than the shipping estimate that they told me. I ordered on November 21st and it was received on December 9th.<br />The color is a lot brighter than the pictures. The curls are not darker or tight. I opened it and put it on right away. Wore it for about an hour and took it off. Cute
B007OQD9AQ|5|Perfect gift for my 14 yo niece!
B00IOZ2H4U|5|Best products I've used in along time.
B0012XZAKE|4|Very nice scent, decent lather. Great for travelling or for those days when you don't want to mix lather in a bowl. It's odd that it's produced in Europe, since I've always considered Palmolive an American product line.
B004Y78YJO|3|I have fine curly hair. I was hoping that this product would provide moisture to help tame it, but it did no more than OTC brands.
B008BH0CHK|5|I was blown away when this little brand by Avon, mark, came out with this pigment-packed palette. The formula of these nine little shadows is SUPER intense pearl, like MAC loose pigment pots in pressed form.<br /><br />How can you tell? don't use the applicator --in fact, toss it! -- The trick is to touch each shade with your finger and \\"break\\" the surface press till it starts to feel \\"broken in\\". Once this happens, you'll see the *true* texture of this velvety, frothy powder that feels almost \\"wet\\". You know how MAC pigment pots look, upon opening, \\"spongy\\" or \\"curdled\\"? Like large particle bunches, instead of individual fine particles? and when you press it into the skin the platelets form a metallic sheet that's like \\"foiling\\"? That's what this formula looks like and PERFORMS like - intense, metallic, and gleaming.<br /><br />Take the teal green and smear it across your lid. Wet a thin brush, dip it in the cobalt blue and draw a streak across your lashline. This is no delicate \\"shimmer\\". It's bold. Seems tailor-made for dark skins. I dare you to compare this to one of the most pigmented MAC loose pigments. it is makeup professional quality, which still stuns me. But i guess that's why the price is way higher than other mark. products and the pans are teeny tiny in comparison (!). But the pigment punch gives you bang for your buck and the colors are such accent pops! Even the neutrals get full use.<br /><br />Just remember -- toss that applicator and get the most payoff with your fingers.
B007768ZCA|1|This product leaked during shipping and the pump failed to work after only three uses.  The only good news is that I did not spend a lot on this product.  Container and pump for sprayer are not well done.
B00DM4MTUU|5|Im so happy to find these on Amazon! They are the perfect length at 2 3/8 inches and dont hold a whole lot of hair--they are more for pulling a few strands up or back.<br />They come in 4 different colors as shown but the gold are faded-looking and do appear silver in certain light. Not a big deal to me but just wanted to share that for those who may be looking for bright gold barrettes.
B000VSG1PO|5|I was very skeptical about this curler, I assumed they were all the same, but I was delightfully surprised.  I have no idea what makes this curler so unique, but it curls my lashes better than any eyelash curler I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.
B002SE2OX2|5|My wife loves it!
B006GQYSC8|5|I've bought two of these now, one for my brother and one for my husband.  They are a bit older but work wonderfully!  Both men have no complaints and use them almost daily.  If you want something to take in the shower, spend the extra money because this one is better outside of the shower.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|I owned the small portable one but I love this one with the cord and a smaller unit to hold while I floss.
B004UAWB76|5|When I initially opened this tube of lipstick, I was seriously disappointed. It looked like an orange shade my grandmother would wear. I didn't touch it for weeks. Just a few days ago I swatched it on my hand and liked the texture, so I thought I would try it. Boy was I surprised when I applied it and saw it was the PERFECT nude shade for me! Not orange at all!<br /><br />The formula of the product is very moisturizing, very smooth, slightly shiny and gorgeously pigmented. It's not heavily pigmented but it's also not at all sheer. It's probably one of the nicest lipsticks I've tried in a very long time. Love this stuff! I also got it at a very good price!<br /><br />Will definitely be on the lookout for more of these lipsticks in different shades.
B0052P0XBO|5|Perfect for someone looking for all natural cruelty free face cream with spf. Smells great but doesn't linger with you all day. My new permanent face moisturizer.
B001FSK8SU|5|AXE Spikey: Well, based on reviews here, I tried american crew fiber, stuff didn't hardly work at all. I used to use axe shaggy look, which is not produced anymore (tragedy) and was reluctant to try the spiked look as I didn't want my hair to look sharp and pointy. But after using it the first time, my fears went away. Your hair looks dry and holds all day. Good stuff.<br /><br />Update for AXE POMADE: oh my this stuff is amazing. I bought it on a whim at target. I don't like gel and the spiky hard look. This stuff goes in like gel, but softens up and doesn't look all shiny. It's super forgiving too when styling. It takes about 5 minutes to actually dry, and when it does, your hair separates and looks very natural. Plus it has a pretty good hold. I HIGHLY recommend this stuff.
B00TWZDA2O|5|I'm in love with the consistency of this product and its build able and gives a full coverage ,its not tacky on the skin and co ers all of the acne scarring it does the job
B001A4H756|3|It okay. The reviews made it seem like this stuff was the best thing since sliced bread. It was &#34;ok&#34;. I actually felt like I had to use other conditioners to supplement it.
B00JQ2UXOQ|3|The shade is too dark. I haven't worn it enough to notice if it helps the skin.
B00D4KB80E|3|This gum has great a great taste but I rated it a 3 because it loses flavor quickly. I'm not a big gum chewer and I will probably purchase again simply because the ingredients are a much healthier option then the rest of the gum on the market.
B001AFFBCG|5|Great dryer. It dried my hair in under 10 min. And I have thick hair that reaches my bum. Powerful, my leave your hair a little frizzed.
B00GY5TJ5W|1|Smells like urine. It reeked while I used it and my skin smelled so bad I took another shower!
B00NMZVXL0|5|beautiful almost rose gold color! So pretty. Received lots of compliments
B00PS9263C|4|Good quality. Looks real. Be careful if you cut them, if you drag the scissors down them the strands will curl up like a ribbon. So just be sure there's no strain on the hair when you cut. One of the clips was broken when I received it, an easy fix though thanks to the extra clips they send. Overall, a great buy.
B003XX793W|3|I used it for a few months, but I've stopped because it's a pain in the neck to get the lotion to rub all the way in. It takes me awhile. But if you have those skills, enjoy yourself.
B007SZCG0C|3|I cannot imagine this hair product lasting a long time. It did not lather and it smelled &#34;ugly&#34; day after using it. I returned it and seller reimbursed me completely.
B000OO2YYM|5|Castor oil has a zillion uses. This company is reputable and the castor oil is cold pressed, unlike the junk laxative from walmart. I use this on my eyelashes at night. Who knows if it actually helps them grow longer, but they remain conditioned and strong and I attribute it to this oil. I also use it for the oil cleansing method, mixed with some grapeseed oil and essential oil of my choice. Cleanses great and doesn't break me out. I've used this in hair masks- it is sticky and oil residue in my thick hair is sometimes difficult to remove, but no fault of this oil, just my hair type. Lastly, this has been used in castor oil packs on myself and my husband..<br />Castor oil is a versatile oil and when choosing a castor oil, make sure it is of good quality and cold pressed. You can google all the different uses of castor oil. Definitely a staple in my bathroom.
B000NHTGTQ|5|I've used magnifying mirrors for years but this Big Eye Mirror has the best optics and clearest image. Its not the 2x, 5x, 10x that counts it's the quality of the optics.
B009GYVMAS|5|I love this stuff, it's like a magic wand, and kinda gross how much oil it absorbs but really good for skin. Expensive but if you use sparingly it'll last for a long time.
B00J2P9LHW|5|Love these toothbrushes!!
B002D1MZ34|1|I would rate this less then one star if I could.  I just bought this product today.  Trimming ear and nose hairs is fair at best.  After a test run that didn't impress me very much, I attempted to clean out the blade by opening the top part of the trimmer.  The head opened up easy enough,  but when I tried to put it back together the tiny little plastic switch that was supposed to lock everything back in place wouldn't latch.  Then I took it apart again to see if the little switch was perhaps stuck, I barely touched it and it flew off the instrument probably never to be seen again.  The switch is so tiny that it could very well be stuck between the fibers of my sofa.<br />I sure miss the pre-China syndrome where things were made with quality materials and the companies that sold products actually seemed to care about quality and not just selling as many cheaply made throw away junk like they do now.
B003TQPRGY|2|I don't use hair dryers all that much. My last hair dryer, I think I easily had 5 years. I have long hair, so on winter mornings, I like to partially dry my hair before going out in the cold. I decided to get a new dryer because my old one was starting to get the weird burning smell. I figured I didn't need an expensive dryer, so I bought this one. Within a couple of weeks, using it less than 3 minutes a day, I have already started to get the burning smell. I have taken off the back vent to see if there is hair caught, and I can't see anything. It dries my hair, but I don't like the smell of burning motor/hair.
B002KHM7FW|5|Very fast shipping, thank you.  For me the best clay ever, I use it several years and be very satisfied. I can use it inside and outside. Mostly I use it for my face and for detoxing.
B00CRU3PLM|1|I think I have a defective bottle.  I can't return it either.  The eye dropper disintegrated, so when I went to use it, all the oil fell over me and nearly hit my toddler.  Large amount of tea tree oil on skin can cause poisoning.  I'm not very happy with this.
B000PARERW|5|The positive reviews prompted me to give this a try.  Spending time in the sun has led to some unattractive wrinkling which is really noticable when I wake up in the morning.  I try to find clothing to button higher up so no 'wrinkled cleavage' can be seen.  In just one use there was a huge difference in what I saw in the morning.  I purchased 2 more - another for me and one for mom.  I do wish the adheasive was a little more durable, but a lot has to do with forgetting NOT to apply lotion after a bath.  Recommend Highly
B00BBF6ZIO|5|Excellent JUMBO cupcake liners.  No problems and quickly shipped.  I have already ordered again!
B003UH0528|5|This is my first sigma brush and just as everyone posted and the videos on youtube, its perfect.  I can't wait to order more.  I don't wear make up daily but I will now!
B0017TBKAW|5|Good price
B0015G8IDO|2|Nasty and dry when it arrived. I was so bummed, my friend has this a shade darker and I really like it. I donth know if it was the shipping or what..
B0000AKADC|5|I've owned 3 of the Wahl Custom Shavers specifically this model. It is an amazing shaver i have very thick facial hair which many other shavers cannot hold up against or get jammed which can be quite painful to have to pull it off my face with hair stuck in it. With the close head alone i get a perfect shave and i have to say closer than any razor I've every use. Great technique to get close is use your other hand to stretch the skin to get in closer, don't over do it because you can break out from the heat and abuse on the skin but it works wonders.<br /><br />With that being said the shaver probably has about a 1.5 year life span and this is with regular cleaning with a brush and the Oil/Cleaner/disinfectant spray. Also the battery life dies rather quickly on the rechargeable battery I think for the 2 previous shavers it was about a month or two then they stopped charging and only function if left plugged in.<br /><br />I've used this new one about three times and the charge lasted me two shaves but this is right out the box with out charging. Wahl has changed the AC adapter to a lighter and smaller one which is nice but the power plug does not sit securely in the shaver. I find that it kept falling out after about 20-30 seconds of shaving due to the vibrations.<br /><br />I'm hoping this 3rd one lasts longer due to picking up a separate trimmer to cut down long hairs rather than using the one built in.<br /><br />Hope this review has helped some of you even though I do have some negative feedback about this product but it has been the best one yet and provides a very close shave and for that I gave it 5 stars.
B008B673NW|5|I bought this trimmer at a local store for about one dollar more than listed here.  It comes with a small instruction booklet written in english and french and one AAA battery.  It works well and does what I want.  Very handy to have available for touch-ups around the ears, nose and eyebrows as needed. It probably works as well as other similiar priced trimmers.  I am satisfied with it and would recommend it.
B0002JKPB8|4|I have incredibly straight, hard to curl hair that damages easily. This gives me great curls very quickly without damage.  However, because it is steam set, the curls do not hold up in humid weather. This is actually my second one, I had one years ago that went missing, and I just had to have another one.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the covers often leave a mild kink in the hair, but depending on how you wrap it, this can be minimized.
B000ZLVUYO|3|I have dry, curly hair so I really wanted this to work. I need all the moisture I can get. But I went through this bottle in a few weeks, and I don't wash my hair everyday. I don't feel as though it did much repairing in that time, and considering it costs $25, it's not exactly economical. I get better results leaving coconut oil on my hair, and that's much cheaper! On the other hand, my BFF who has fine, straight hair loved it. So I guess her 5star review will counteract like 3star one.
B0040I44N2|5|I seen a lot of reviews and it seemed like something I would like, it looks great I am thinking about ordering another,anyone that loves natural hair should order this wig.....love it
B005OZM810|5|Fast shipping. Absolutely my go to brush for packing on shadow on the lid
B007530BP4|4|My very first safety razor. I have to say, there is a bit of a leaning curve, but that takes nothing away from the quality of the product itself. Built solid, user friendly, and works well...
B0025YNHH2|5|Works great but it smells terrible.
B0057VH06O|2|The eyeliner in this is very difficult to apply because it always breaks and smears all over.  The primer and mascara are good however.  The shadows themselves were disappointing. The glitter gets all over your face and the colors aren't very pigmented.  Usually I love tarte products and their other eyeshadows but these shadows were incredibly disappointing, they seemed like cheap drugstore eyeshadows. I've had better luck with $6 nyx shadows.
B001800I44|5|I had purchased a smaller size before and loved it.  Wen does clean without the foam like the other shampoos.  Hair stayed cleaner and shiner.  Will recommend to others.
B0002JIM9U|3|I like the oil, it's very light. The problem I have is that it doesn't really help my very dry skin. I believe that it would be good for spring and summer use .
B00H0FD4WO|3|It's very nice quality, but the teeth are too long and the scalloped edges don't sit against my head, but sticks out about an inch when I use it for a french twist.  My hair is fine so it tends to slip after a few minutes.
B003I34FPW|1|I got my lipstick in mail today and I was so excited! I opened it and put it on right away.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Its a beautiful color, feels creamy, smooth and hydrating. I know some of the reviews said its a bright pink but I find it to be a softer pink. Pigmented but not over the top. I have pretty fair skin and it looks great with my skin tone.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />IT TASTES LIKE PERFUME! I accidentally licked my lips and it tasted like sprayed perfume in my mouth... after about 10 minutes the taste still hadn't gone away and I had to brush my teeth it was so overwhelming.  I have tried to wear it multiple times, and every time I take it off almost immediately. I finally just threw it away. What a waste.<br /><br />I am super bummed. I use a lot of NYX products and this is the first time I have EVER had anything negative to say. I recently bought the \\"Soft Matte Lip Cream\\" by NYX and it was absolutely wonderful! Maybe a good alternative to this one.
B00NW5H2DS|3|I thought they were cute rings ,I haven't wore them yet but for the price I got five and granddaughters Will get the rest, cause there's different sizes .
B00TSTZQEY|5|I use Lavender for many things - works great on lambswool dryer balls! Always come here first for best deals o essential oils!
B005LFR17O|3|It's compact and it's cheap.  Not much else to say for it.  Buy it and keep in your glove compartment. This is not designed for everyday use.
B004UAX8VO|5|Love these products
B000OYJ9AO|5|This is the best cream I've ever tried!<br />It smells nice, leaves my skin soft and moisturizer!<br />I don't have dry skin anymore because of this cream.<br />Highly recommend for everybody!
B000ALMQWO|5|This set is a great price and the soap and lotion are great quality as well.  They grapefruit smells fantastic and it's not a heavy soap, it lathers well and rinses easy.
B00J5K9DKE|5|This is the best styling get I have ever used.  It keeps my thin hair in place and makes it look full and stylish.
B000W7N79C|4|Softens my skin and feels light. I use it under makeup and sometimes at night. Not sure if all the ingredients are listed though.
B00A9ZTXRM|1|Not the same formula has before. This one dried out my hair and did not cover the gray for more than a couple of days
B00GWBR5N6|2|This only works for about 1min and then lips go back to normal..0
B00NMOS058|2|No magic here....... I can't believe I got duped into paying $19.95 for this. I used the entire jar, just like it said. It helped dry up some zits, but nothing beyond that.
B00JI5JEV4|5|Great brush nice and soft for a cheap price!
B00KUTUNU8|5|Bought these for my mother-in-law, and she LOVES them.  She says the toe spacer is so comfortable, she wears it all day and night.
B003TT6NHS|5|Super aesthetically pleasing
B001KOTQIM|5|nice
B00008BFXK|5|As a General Dentist, I have used the Sonicare line for years.  This particular model is better than its predecessor, the Advantage.  The handle is smaller, as is the brush head.  It provides superior cleaning in smaller places.  I like this model because a variety of patients can benefit from it.  If you have never used one, take advantage of the feature that allows you to \\"get used to it\\".  To be fair, I also really like the Braun Oral B excel, and the Triumph, but these are NOT sonic.
B000VXVEGA|1|Fried my hair left it for 5 minutes had to cut all my hair . My hair actually burned with this never buying it again worse thing ever
B00KISWGSS|4|I love these! They work great!!!  My lashes look so full and natural and long and i love that they are just a one time application and you can where whenever.
B000JL7WT2|5|Lasts a very long time, smells exquisite and rich. Found this product by accident and want to continue using this as my main scent.
B00ANSXMMC|5|I love this, so great, and cheaper than the more expensive hair chalk that is on tv all the time, the other one is quit expensive, so I haven't tried it, but I have tried the liquid brush in ones, and they wash out as soon as water touches them, not so good with kids and a pool, when they want their hair streaked, you have to redo it all the time, this stays in until you actually use shampoo and wash it out, and no problems at all getting it out, comes out easily, it took twice on my blonde niece though, but that's still not so bad, and I use this myself as well, and I am and adult, and mom, and I love it, its nice to change it up, and add a little color! its super easy to use, and not at all measy! this is the best colored chalk or dye or ect that I have found so far, and it is a great price, better than 10+ $'s for some streaks that wash out and the tubes, or whatever don't last no time! this will last a while, it don't take much at all, we all 3 have used it a few times and you cant even tell! as far as the stick chalks on here, they normally come in a varity of colors all together, don't go there, just go buy some craft or school chalk, that's all it is, make your bathroom a multi colored mess, and have mad kids with no color in there hair at all, cus it does not work, doesn't add color, and just make the biggest mess ever! ugh! this is the BEST, so I highly recommend this, and the other colors as well of course, im ordering those asap!<br />*this is the second one of these I have ordered, I got the purple first, then this one, and I plan on getting a few more (probably all the colors!)
B006JKX5RK|3|it's very convenient, but super greasy.
B00MP10N2M|3|I've only used the blue color so far, and plan on updating as I go along. It's a beautiful color and it's true -no base/top coat needed, which is worth it, if you enjoy doing your nails at home. Unfortunately, it was SO hard to get off! It's actually still on my nails and I'm online to see if anyone else ran into this issue. The only way I'm able to get it off is to sand off my nails, which as thin as they are, I'm very upset to do so. I'll reach out to the company soon.
B000WS1HGQ|4|Loved the jar for my homemade stuff.  Only gave 4 stars bc it was pricey. Wished it was cheaper.
B0017T29IE|5|I have 3 little kids and this isy favorite sunblock
B0002LJ1DE|3|It's ok, not great.
B001DYM62C|5|I use this to maintain my pixie cut with the help of some online tutorials. By now it has saved me hundreds of dollars. So worth it and awesome!
B00971E41O|5|This smells so good!!!
B000RL0OYE|5|As always, the Cover Girl Perfect Point Self Sharpening Eye Pencil was of wonderful quality and I will order the product again.
B00517W45G|1|Very disappointed in the performance.
B001DKQ3O8|5|So, I bought this item for myself, but the family has taken it over (especially hubby) Needless to say it has its pros and cons. The pros is that you can see everything so close and the cons is you can see everything &#34;soooooo&#34; close.
B000FS05VG|5|Super lightweight and great output options. Diffuser works great as well. Highly recommend for the price.
B000A3V2PE|4|I ordered this product a couple weeks ago and the day it came I dyed it. My hair was already a Reddish orange so I used a 20vol developer and I must say it came out RED. I love the color I was trying to get this color red for a few weeks couldn't get to it so I said hell Ill use this one since I looked at other reviews. I'm glad I used this color and will keep using this.
B000H30FO6|5|I used it daily. I does what I need it to do. It detangles well.
B0013FMS0G|2|I will recommend for everyone thank
B00008QQN2|3|I decided not to take these on a 3-day backpacking trip because of the weight of the full package.  For &#34;suitcase&#34; travel, they are good for freshening up.
B002QAR8QG|4|This stuff smells great. It's just a little weak. You have to use 3 sprays.
B00203Q90U|1|Terrible - left hair feeling dry and broken!
B00X629R2G|5|This is my FAV facewash! Leaves your skin really clean & smooth!
B001MGS4YK|4|Only gave it four stars because I haven't used it yet. Haven't needed to. Yet. The package was also a little difficult to open, but it's made very well.
B000XVSNTQ|5|I am particular about razors.  And I have the right to be.  I shave my legs every day.  Yes, every single day.  Even in the winter.  I am not kidding!  I don't like stubble.  I also don't like nicks.  So, when it comes to razors, I am particular.  I want something that gives me a close shave so my skin feels silky smooth, but I don't want to nick my knees and ankles along the way.  I want something that fits in the curves of bikini lines and glides over my kneecaps.<br /><br />And I found it with Venus Embrace.  Before you give me an argument, hear me out.  I tried Venus razors years ago and wasn't overjoyed with them.  However, they must have improved things over time, because after trying again, they are my favorite razors.  Not to mention, now, any Venus blade refill fits on any Venus razor handle.  So, now I am inclined to try other Venus blades.<br /><br />I really like the Venus Embrace because the razor just seemed to glide over my legs, kneecaps and bikini line.  It \\"fit\\" everywhere.  I don't use shaving gel, just plain old soap, but the strip on the razor really makes it smooth.  The shave is close--even at the end of the day, my legs still feel smooth and without stubble.<br /><br />I also love that I am not adding to the landfill if I change razor blades.  Think about how many people every year dispose of the handles when they get a new blade.  That is an awful lot of handles in our landfills!<br /><br />Disclosure: As a member of Influenster, I received a Venus razor and extra blade.  As always, this review contains my honest opinions.
B0086VI9TE|5|Excellent replacement brushes for my sonicare toothbrush.
B004HAI0SI|5|great primer under foundation. Neat applicator. Product applied with brush is better than applied with fingers. Will purchase again
B00FBG8OPG|5|I love this set!  I have been looking for a real &#34;train case&#34; and this set is perfect both in style and function.
B001D97P1Y|5|Great for fine hair.
B0091JV52I|5|I generally leave this conditioner in longer than is recommended, but I get great results. This conditioner leaves my naturally thick, course hair soft and manageable.
B00BEUAZTG|5|As advertised. I was initially skeptical because the price of the Acnefree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System kit in stores is much more expensive, but this is the real deal. Great price, no hassel! I will always purchase my product on Amazon from here on out! So long as the price remains the same.
B0009DSQMC|2|Good price, but will expire in 4 months.  Beware! Unless one plans to use it soon.  I love this product.
B00LUZ7LJM|5|Very well made chopsticks and lotions
B008A1KSX0|4|Excellent cologne, scent lasts for a decent amount of time and the smell is real good.  The price is excellent as well as this is a 100 dollar bottle at Neimans.
B00H1Q86SY|3|You get what you pay for....it is cheaply made. I am hoping it will last through a few wearings. I bought 4 of these in different metal colorings, and my husband had to completely remake the darkest colored one! He had to use a needle nose pliers and unhook several of the leaves--readjust them. It was really a mess. Someone in the factory was really having a bad day!
B003JMYAAW|4|This is a great mask that makes your skin feel clean and absorbs oil very well.  This is one product that I really like.  Clay masks shouldn't be expensive.  I really don't think there is much difference between cheaper clay masks and those that are more expensive, why not keep your money in your pocket?<br /><br />The only drawback of this product is all of the mint in here, if your skin is easily irritated you may want to take a pass on this one.  It works well, washes off easily, and it is priced right.
B000C213ZM|5|This was my second purchase of this Cologne. I really like it so I decided to re-order and it's really hard to beat Amazon's price and they also have great shipping options. 5 Stars all the way, thanks Amazon..
B000UY9OKS|1|i have minor acne and this stuff did not help one bit. waste of money and time.
B001CIEREY|5|I just got them yesterday, they are very pretty.  In the picture the look blue but they were clear.  My daughter already wants to use them..
B00D86VPHK|4|These bags are pretty basic.It would be nice to see some better designs on them though.One is a navy blue and the othr a light green.Both have a printed design on them and are large enough to put all kinds of makeup in.One is for home and the other for travel.They are lined with vinyl so you can clean up spills and that's nice.The zippers work fine and I would think any lady would be happy with  them.
B002V5JHCE|2|My eyelashes have straightened out as I've gotten older. I use an eyelash curler but read that by adding heat the curl would last longer. This does not get hot enough to make a difference. But it is cute.
B000I98JR4|2|As an eyeliner this works great, stays on my eyes and works as you'd expect. However, the as an eyeliner pencil it's pathetic. The wood is very tough and rough, trying to sharpen it is hopeless. You start to get it showing above the wood and the color breaks off in the sharpener. I'm not using their sharpener as I already have two at home and the whole point of using a vegan product is to save the environment. Honestly for a natural product I wanted to love this eyeliner, instead I'm just disappointed.
B009S3PZBO|5|😀
B00K7CE28C|5|These brushes are the best quality brushes I have used in the market - as a professional make up artist, they are brilliant value as well!
B001BG9YJ0|5|Keep in mind that this sword is nothing more then a wall hanger... it has a flimsy handle that could not sustain any kind of real impact . However i knew this when i bought it.... i wanted it for display purposes only... and let me tell you its mighty fine...    The pain work was a lil s***ty but i touched that up myself to make it look legit as can be.    It's a shame the dude who sell's these doesnt know how to paint in between the lines haha
B000OYJ9AO|1|Fragrance-Free? This lotion smells like cheap bubble gum, don't be decieved. It may moisturize well, but the smell makes it unwearable. Buyer beware
B0019ZEVZU|5|We use to use Oral-B toothbrushes and our dentist recommended that we switch to Sonicare. After reading the reviews that tended to rank the Oral-B as high as the Sonicare, I had trouble justifying the cost, but the dentist was instant. The difference between the Sonicare and the Oral-B are like the difference between day and night. The Sonicare no only has a harder scrubbing action, it actually forces water between your teeth. My teeth got noticeably whiter within a week of receiving it. It is miles ahead of the Oral-B in cleaning.. getting junk off my teeth that the Oral-B wouldn't touch. Truly miles above the Oral-B (and I was a huge Oral-B fan). One suggestion: I would let the toothbrush do the work.. it is so strong that I fear that it could take enamel off (although I am not a dentist).<br />The best part is that when it died after 25 months, I called Philips and they are actually replacing it for free even though it is well out of warranty. That's what I call customer service!
B00N933RHS|5|Excellent!
B000NYL3NQ|5|Fine product
B003SSTL42|5|This is the best skin care product I have ever used. I got the bar of eucalyptus soap (black bar) night cream, peeling treatment and a body lotion, also eye cream, all for an unreasonable amount of money. I was ticked when I saw the Amazon price BUT my skin is so soft and clean after only two days I don't care! It is brighter, smooth and more even already and I've only used the peel once. I love all the products, I have never experienced quick results like this. No lie..... it is terrific.
B00QMRPG5O|5|Great stuff!  Love the smell, taste, feel & ease of use. Love that's its all natural - something you can tell in the quality with first use. My only issue was that I found myself applying it more often than I normally would - could be that I just loved the natural sugar taste ;)
B00005R1H4|5|Wonderful product
B00DPKF296|5|This color is absolutely gorgeous! It is supposed to be really close to MAC's Satin Taupe. It is very nicely pigmented and you can pick it up at the drugstore for just $2. I'd definitely recommend this!
B0085BVFZK|5|I've tried all the big makeup brands and DIY and nothing gets my brushes as clean as this soap does. Works wonders on the beauty blender sponge and my brushes. It's a little pricy for the amount you get and I wish it came in a larger size but it gets the job done. I will be purchasing it again.
B00021DV4O|4|Just be aware a little goes a long way; the color is really intense and if you use too much you look like an 80's rocker. If applied sparingly, it adds a lovely color and lasts all day. I've found that mixing it with mineral veil first makes it less intense and more like a bronzer, rather than a really strong blush. It's a brownish bronze color, and with the mineral veil can be moderated nicely. If I don't mix it first I need to go over it again with the foundation or it's just too intense. I got a jar of it 11/05 with the starter pack and it is STILL mostly full, and I use it a few times a week. I think it's a good product, I just had to learn to modify it so it worked best for me. I think that's what is so good about the BE products; you can use them in a way that works for you, but may be different than how others use them. For future purchases, I think I'll get a less dark/intense shade.
B00KLK80VU|5|This color show polish &#34;rose rapture&#34;. Is very pretty. It is a metallic rose pink with silver microglitter scattered throughout. It goes on very easily and it is not streaky at all. Two coats of polish gave me beautiful even coverage. This is easily removed with regular strength nail polish remover. Overall this is a really cute polish and is perfect for spring.
B00AUVJ8W0|5|gorgeous.... pictures do not do justice... love it, and will defin buy more
B00ALB397Y|5|I had some of the driest facial skin one can imagine. Redness, major flaking, etc.... I was ready to go to the doctor for to get help. Thought I would try this Garnier stuff. To put it bluntly, it worked a miracle on my skin. I now have a perfect complexion once again. My skin hasn't looked this good in many years. I often get comments how good it looks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by how small the container is. 1.7oz. will last a long time, as only a small dab is needed to cover a good sized area. I'm guessing I'll get 2 months from this using it twice a day. Well worth the money. I use it on my face, but I'm guessing it will work on other problem areas also. Anything that can save me a doctors visit is worth its weight in gold to me.
B003UKKH6O|4|After using the Oral-B for a few months my routine dental cleaning went very quickly.  There was not much work left for the hygienist.
B00K8BU9HA|5|Great product....blends easily, nice color and lasts.  The berry is not at all what it sounds like....very natural looking.....and only $2.97 at Walmart.
B00KQMG7UE|3|Product say it is electric. It is not. It is BATTERY operated. Disappointed in product. Does it work?  It does. I assumed electric ment with cord, not battery. That is what I get for assuming.
B001TEOGCO|2|Didn't provide any white coloring. I was looking for a white base for eyelid. All this is, is a flakey thin clearish sparkle. More like something you'd add over your finished product for shimmery effect.
B00J3DO4AW|5|I love the smell of the shampoo it's just a natural soothing smell,
B001KYO32G|5|I purchased this nude lip shimmer to give my lips and sometimes my lipstick a shine.  Upon using this product I found to my delight that it not only makes your bare lips or lipstick if you prefer shine, it also gives them a golden glow.  Plus it goes on so very smooth.
B00BZI2FP4|5|good seller
B00B2B2VGW|5|This shampoo takes time to work like around a month or so, but I suggest stick with it and you'll get results. I use it sparingly and mix it with other my regular shampoos for longevity. What made me interested is it's organic, targets hair loss, and leaves your hair feeling refreshed. If you are looking for results in a week that's too soon, but given time you notice your hair is stronger, thicker, and stays on your head not the floor.
B003AYEFSG|5|I have chemically treated hair and this leaves it super-shiny and hydrated, which is almost impossible to get with any other product.
B000XGC3SS|5|I started using Zia Skin Basics Daily Moisture Screen SPF 15 about seven or eight years ago and I've never looked back. I used to use Oil of Olay's daily moisturizer with sunblock and liked it, but wasn't too happy about the strong smell. I researched earth-friendly/body-friendly (aka less toxins) skin care products and Zia was near the top. I use this everyday without problem, love it. It's not oily, doesn't smell at all...it does exactly what I want...moisturize and protect. Only down side is the packaging: you can't get the last little bits in the bottom of the bottle because it's glass with a pump. However, I highly recommend it!
B00JJQ73EM|5|Really good. Smells great!!
B00027DMSI|4|These do work. A little annoying to wear at night but they get the job done if worn cosistanatly
B000GCQ04C|5|This toner makes my skin feel so smooth and healthy. It does everything it's supposed to do. The smell took a long time for me to get used to because it is very strong, but I highly recommend this toner!!
B00016XJ4M|5|This toner smells fantastic. It is moisturizing but doesn't cause me to break out. I haven't seen any miracle results like some other people have, but it's still a great product.
B00D36EKJU|5|Wonderful product. I've been using this line of shampoos, conditioners,and treatments for years. They are worth the price. I have fine hair and this is the best product I've used by far.
B000BTM2K6|1|I never did recieve this purchase. I got in touch with Amazon which sent me to the company. They told me it was sent to my town and told me to canvace the neighbors to see if any bof them got it. Do you think any of them would tell me? It was droped at that.I would not recommened ordering from Amazon.
B00LSSOCSY|5|buy your true size
B000KEIPC6|5|I've used this product for years. It's the only styling product I've found that has a perfectly creamy texture and moves my hair where I want it without being too powerful. In fact, it's the only styling product I use! I take a dime-size amount on my finger, rub it over all my fingers and run my fingers through my hair in the general direction I want it to go. (I do this when my hair is modestly damp, after it's mostly dry after a shower). After this, I continually take very small amounts and run it over the tips of a few fingers for minor touchups. The product washes out well and doesn't damage my hair like other waxes or gels. Each container lasts me a long while as well (about 6 months on average).<br /><br />VERY highly recommended!
B00APV7OWG|5|Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn't get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !
B008L2OKAK|5|I love this product except for the fact that it has sulphur in it and I'm allergic to sulphur.  Regardless, it worked and cleared up my blemish in record time.  I just have to be careful of how often I use it.  It also turned all my sterling jewelry black because of the sulphur in my system.  Oh well.  The price we pay for beauty!<br /><br />Bottom line, it worked for my blemishes.
B004KEU3Y0|4|Great product! Fast delivery!
B000KJZGOG|5|This stuff is great! I've been using for a few years now and can definitely tell when people react to it.  It's not always a sexual thing, although that can be a NICE side effect, but it attracts conversations and interactions with people you may not have sought out on your own.  Great for networking!
B00AEIVIGS|5|This has a nice feel to it but I was disappointed that it didn't smell good at all. I use it in making body butter and lotions and it works great.
B0013E7ZB4|1|The wrong brush was shipped.  All Trish McEvoy brushes are wonderful, but I wanted the eyeliner brush. Oh, well.
B004Q85JV2|4|well priced and my mom loved it for mothers day. This is her favorite perfume! i think it smells like fruit loops but as long as shes happy with it.
B00AYR8BK0|5|Excellent shape, thank you.
B00005A442|5|my wife still is thanking me for these. and if she's happy, well you know.
B0015XWQLW|5|I knew what I was ordering, so I already knew I loved the product. Shipping was fast and I was very very satisfied!! Thank you!!!
B00011JZWW|4|Product works great along with a rasp however do not start using it if you ever plan to stop! Once the girl at the nail salon started using this during her pedicures my heels started becoming dry within a week. The good side is, right after the pedicures it was like baby soft skin on my heels!
B00O84208Y|4|This device is obviously similar in many ways to the Clarisonic.  It's not cheap, but it's cheaper.  It looks and operates in a very similar fashion to Clarisonic.  There are 4 modes, high and low, and high pulsate and low pulsate.  The unit times out after 1 minute and doesn't have shorter timers for separate zones.<br /><br />The motor does not seem as precise as Clarisonic's.  Clarisonic has that high-pitched sonic sort of whine, much like my Sonicare or Panasonic Sonic Toothbrushes.  Silk'n sounds more like the cordless shoe polisher that I never use.<br /><br />But does it work?<br /><br />Yes, it does seem to work reasonably well.  While I haven't used it long, my face felt fresh, clean and smooth.<br /><br />Is it better than Clarisonic?<br /><br />I suspect not.  If I was spending my own money on this or the other, I'd probably go with the other.<br /><br />While it seems to be a bit on the pricey side, it does seem perfectly functional.  3.5 stars rounded to 4.
B00ACTL94A|5|Love. I have been wearing this polish for 4 days now and now chips. I also love that this polish is vegan. Which is why unordered it in the first place.
B00HV8TMMG|5|Yummy
B00SY2JSUE|4|My brother is using daily! He is happy with it but hoping more hair will grow with more time! it has a good smell and it lathers well! after thirty days i will come  back in and show growth.
B000LNWUIG|5|No fragrance and is a great styling product.  It doesn't give me the volume I like but without the fragrance of other products, I will buy again.
B00K3DHR9Q|5|Fun
B00H1Y8AXW|4|Arrived when it was suppose to, haven't used it as I am giving it as a gift for Christmas. Will post after I find out how she likes it. I love the jar it comes in and it doesn't smell bad.
B003RK8ONU|5|These colors are amazing! I love the feel of this eyeshadow and I notice it doesn't crease nearly as much as some of the other shadows I have. The box it's in is awesome too!<br />Not sure on how to use the lip colors. I like the one on the right the best but I don't think it's my color.
B000C1VSSU|5|Subtle scent that is only for people you care to get close to. Spray lightly, nobody likes smelling you from ten feet away. I love how this product does not announce your arrival but you know you smell great!
B000EVKXKM|4|i was looking for a thermal protection spray to use when I straighten my hair. This product actually does that AND works as \\"hairspray\\" to hold your style. It even smells like the aerosol stuff. I made the mistake of spraying it all over before straightening, and then it kinda dried before i got to it, so it was harder to straighten. Also, my hair was really static after using this product. Normally I just use it on my bangs for when I plan to just wear the rest of my hair curly. OR you can read the directions and \\"spray-as-you-go\\" so it doesnt dry and lake your hair unmanageable. I use it maily for it's thermal protecting abilities, because I'm not a fan of hair spray for hold.
B0000YI9Y0|5|Very nice and would recommend to anybody that likes this scent, well made, price was fair, delivery was quick, thank you very much
B0023UTL7S|2|I did not help me make my hair more thinner and it was itching so bad that I had to wash my hair again... Sorry everyone is different with what they use..
B00DXKKLQM|1|Unfortunately my product came with a crack in it, which caused the whole thing to crumble and crack into pieces within a few days of having it. It doesn't stay all day when I apply it on. It's a pretty color however I don't understand the hype of the product since the staying powder is not that great.
B005V2UI5Y|5|I mix 1/4 of a bottle in with my shampoo.  This is an essential product in everyone's household.
B007SBHO4Y|5|This is awesome!,,,  I have dark hair but crave blonde highlights.  This makes my hair so radiant.  For real.  Just saying.
B001JICYU6|1|I had been using Hope in a Jar for dry sensitive skin for awhile and loved it, and I was pleased that they had added an SPF to what I thought was going to be the same product. The smell is overwhelming, it's greasy, and the SPF caused major irritation and breakouts...bad news! If you're considering upgrading to the SPF, don't bother...the formulation is entirely different and needs major work. Don't make the same mistake I did. A big disappointment!
B00B7QEBHE|5|Once upon a time, a few days before a beach vacation, I hit my toe on an unmovable object. My toe instantly swelled up & my toenail lifted up & away from its bed, but didn't come off. When we arrived at our condo, the toe & toenail were still looking bad & feeling bad too, so I dissolved a cup of Epsom salt in very, very warm water, as hot as I could stand it (the warmer the water, the more germs it kills) and soaked my foot 20 minutes every evening. If you have time, soaking twice a day is better. After about 5 days of soaking, my toe & toenail looked much, much better. Epsom salt will help prevent infection, drain the wound, & heal it faster. It is dehydrating so you might need to use lotion to counteract the drying.<br /><br />My muscles were tired & sore from a lot of gardening & planting the other day so I decided to test [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt 2 Lbs]] in my bath that evening. I dissolved 2 cups of Epsoak Epsom Salt in very warm bath water and soaked for 15 minutes.  Don't use soap because it will interfere with the action of the salt. Also, if you have arthritis you should move those joints  after the soak as much as possible to help prevent congestion in the joints. Epsoak really did work for me...my muscles weren't as stiff & painful the next day. I'm glad I tried it.<br /><br />By the way, Epsom salt is not really salt but it is a naturally occurring pure mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate. It's a natural remedy that has been used hundreds of years.<br /><br />I learned quite a bit about Epsom salt when I did some research for this review.

B005JUTA0M|5|Fun new color.  Delivered exactly as promised in good shape.  Good value for your dollar.  Great color and unique idea.
B001EJOPWU|5|I LOVE THE BUFF PUFF!! I have suffered from the occasional pimple or zit (3-5 a month) for years and years. And typically once they show up they stick around for a week or so.  NOT with the buff puff!! After using the buff puff for about 4 months, I'm down to 1-2 zits a month, and they go away really quickly. My skin is also glowing and always looks fresh. No need to purchase expensive highlighters or moisturizers with glow elements in them. The buff puff will give you all that by using it just 3 times a week. It's so convenient and easy, I just use it at the end of my shower when my pores have all opened up. I rub some of my White Dove bar soap on it, and lightly swirl it around my face. At first it felt really harsh, but I just applied little pressure and I got used to it. Now I'm addicted. Change the sponge every 3 months. I can't believe women pay hundreds of dollars for various motorized Sonic brushes....so not necessary and a waste of money. I purchased the Gentle sponge, and would recommend that to everyone.
B000I5HJ2Y|5|The sponges are the best way to apply make up for a flawless finish. Glad I bought two instead of one
B004KXGHOQ|5|I am just about out of my last bottle and wish I had purchased more. This matches my body chemistry like no other. Everywhere I go I'm asked &#34;What is that you're wearing? Or my word you smell great and my friend gave me a greeting by hugs and said boy you always smell sooo- goood!!! It's the only Parfum I wear now. When it was first introduced on a shopping Network I purchased it and now my favorite retailer in the World Sells it AMAZON. I have one question though, I have the 50 ML / 1.7 FL oz bottle and I can't find it anywhere. Did she drop an ounce from this? Because I can only find the 1.6 oz size now for the same price as the 1.7 oz size? Does anyone know what happened to the 50 ML Size 1.7 FL oz??
B003S516XO|4|Not really being an expert on hair straightener's, and definitely not being very proficient with it yet, this product is good enough for me.  Sometimes I can get a very good effect with it.
B00GRS9SZ2|5|I tried it last night and my skin seemed to drank it and wanted more!    It is going to replace my other serum. I will give this product 5 stars!!!
B001F51TNQ|5|this cream is light enough to use everyday, I added some essential oils to this and I love it will buy again.
B00BQ76XK2|3|Good until you have to wash or reuse them.
B00CD1QU80|5|I replaced my Braun 7 with the model.  It was cheaper than getting replacement blades for my Braun..  In fact I get a better, closer shave with this shaver.  It is cheaply made mostly of cardboard, so I clean it with a dry tooth brush after each shave.  When it stops giving me satisfactory shaves, I'll just get another.
B000ZMAL2U|5|so happy with the clipper made my to get them right on time too. for any one looking for clippers can't go wrong with a pair wahl professional clippers.
B001E6TV7M|5|I bought this to avoid using chemicals on my body. This is absolutely the best shave cream. It is soft, moisturizing, and cooling. LOVE it. And this is a great price.
B00KCFAZTE|5|This has really been the only product that has worked for my eye puffiness. My eye puffiness hereditary combined with allergies. I have used several products, priced 5X higher. I have seen greater results with this in a few weeks, than with months of consistent usage of other products. They have been reduced so much that I go without concealer on most days for the first time in years. I really can't say enough good things about the product.
B001GERET4|5|Very pleased with this developer. Did not seem to be harsh on the hair.
B00KBXUBOG|5|Arrived just as ordered. Best flosser for bridge work on the market.
B00BL0L9IU|3|To be honest I'm very disappointed, it doesn't look like the picture at all. So the hair doesn't match my hair color at all. I feel as though I payed Alot of money to get my hair fast.. In the end I'm not happy
B002LK66J6|5|After MANY different shampoos and conditioners I have finally found something that works for my very dry, damaged (highlighting) freezy-ish, aging hair!  I use this in combination with the Kiehl's Olive Oil Fruit Nourishing Shampoo and have been very happy with the results - soft, shiny, healthy looking hair!  Finally!!
B0038KA5RC|4|If you're a double-edge shaver, this is a great deal. 80% of the blades are fantastic quality (hence only 4 stars). There are a couple brands in the pack that will only give 5-6 decent shaves before needing swapped, but the majority of the brands will last at least twice that before requiring a change.
B005KDI284|4|Smells really good! also gave very smooth skin!  I'd give it 5 stars but i prefer the spray.
B00I04D262|5|Works good
B008B9L6WS|5|Perfect, Exactly as Described.
B006VGMS8E|1|Lasts max 5 minutes:((( too bad product
B001E7BAG6|5|I have been using this for as long as it has been available.  I am to the point that I don't even know if I have BO because even three days later on a hunting trip I am still smelling pretty.  Goes on easy, doesn't stain anything.  It doesn't handle plane rides well...you need to roll it back in before you put it in your luggage.<br /><br />I sure hope they don't discontinue it.  Can't find it locally.  Had to order from Amazon.
B001HTTBWQ|5|Versace Pour Homme is my favorite men's fragrance - elegant and clean.  Recommend it highly.
B0046BHZSO|4|I have used other whiteners before and purchased this because I noticed my teeth could use a spruce up. It seems to work well. It came with trays you can mold to fit your teeth but I use the ones y dentist made me a few years back.
B000RNPQI6|1|I don't know how one would describe this perfume except stinky and maybe like the closet of an elderly person.  Just awful.  Yuck.
B00HHR0SYW|5|I used to have bad acne that resulted in terrible scarring.  For a while I was using a different vitamin C serum and recently I decided to switch over to this one because it was a better value for the price.  I am pleasantly surprised and I do not regret my purchase! The serum is smooth and has the consistency of water and almost no scent to it.  I have been using it once daily and occasionally twice and I have noticed the same skin brightening effect and lightening of scars.  It reduces redness and any blotchiness of the skin.  This is a really high quality product with fantastic ingredients and I can tell that my skin loves it.
B009WZQRTM|5|This blush is a beautiful color and it gives you a healthy glow.  You don't have to use a lot because the color is generous.<br />This is my first time to try NYX products and I am very pleased.  Worth trying.
B00F89JKKO|5|This is just A beautiful and fun way to make your hair look so good and colorful.
B00008ZPG9|1|This product is terrible - the scent is much too strong for a product that is used on the face.  I didn't get it anywhere close to my eyes, but 2 minutes after using it, my eyes started to itch, burn and swell so badly that I had to take an antihistamine and put ice cubes on my eyes to get the irritation & swelling to go down.  I am going to call Olay to get my money back.
B008RP6GGC|5|Great diffuser, does exactly what it's supposed to nothing more nothing less, and it looks great in a living room. Would definitely recommend
B004KU6CRG|5|I can't even describe how happy I am that these nails exist. They are so flawless, last FOREVER and are inexpensive. The first ones I tried were the French manicure kind, and the 15 minutes it took to apply them left me with such a beautiful manicure that people were asking where I got them done! I left them on for over 11 days, while I packed boxes, scratched at tape,  did dishes, scrubbed the house, played football with kids, basically didn't hold back in any way, and I didn't get a single chip. The only reason I removed them was because I was dying to try the pink glitter ones for valentines day. I love love love these!!
B00FH692PQ|4|It works great for hairfall. Only concern is that it makes hairs dry.
B004FEKA3E|5|One of my favs!  Nice bronzer but not too much that you look orange!!!!
B000X2DMEG|3|This is hands down the best smelling pomade for sure, the only thing is the hold is terrible. This might work for a slick back or spikey style, but if you're going for a traditional tall pompadour you will be upset.
B0009EILZI|5|I love this scent and I don't really care for calgon products but I have been buying this spray off and on for years and I love it. It's a very sweet summer scent and it's not over powering or strong at all. Plus for the price it's worth it!
B00NLO0YDA|5|This hair brush is amazing . I have 5 kids and often after the shower they cry getting there hair brushed cause its tangles up . With this brush im able to brush there hair with ease and no tears . My kids love it and love the funky design and i was surprised that it had a mirror on the back . Its perfect size to throw in the diaper bag or your purse . We have used it on wet hair and dry hair and loved it both ways . Think we will buy a second one . I did receive a discount to provide my honest and truthful opinion .
B00LVPDBA4|5|great，worth
B00EIRGM58|1|I read an article in More magazine suggesting to try this if you have sparse eyebrows.  Sorry to say my 2.00 eyebrow pencil does a better job.
B00EC4M2HE|5|I didn't have high expectations of these eyeshadows that you can get for just $1 on the ELF website, but they are very pigmented and creamy and do not crease on me with a primer. I now own all the colors except for 2. I also love how you can switch them up in the ELF compacts, customizing them for travel. A hidden gem and totally worth trying!
B004CCP7XC|5|I love love  love this item. I cant be with out this razor specially since my body is very sensitive. I give it a 5 stars.
B00DX6R2ZE|1|This product took so long to get here. Also it doesn't even work! Horrible product don't bother purchasing it!
B000HQ0L2E|5|This is the most impressive product design I have seen in a long time.  The engineering is amazing -- kudos to the team that put this together.   <br /> <br />It does a good job, although it does irritate my skin.  I have a hard time getting the right angle.  \\"Works best with a 3-way mirror\\" -- now that's funny.  Most people do not have a 3 way mirror in their house, and I am not about to go shave my back at J.C. Penny haha. <br /> <br />I use a handheld mirror and my bathroom mirror.  It works well.  Even though it irritated a lot, it didn't cut, and as I learn how to do the angles better, I will have less irritation. <br /> <br />I am surprised that this doesn't mention shaving the neck.  I used it on my neck and it did a good job.  It also did a good job on the shoulders, upper arms, and underarms. <br /> <br />After placing the order I regretted it -- I thought it would be $40 down the drain, but I was happily wrong -- this product is EXCELLENT.
B000XE1ZI4|5|Love these. I live in NYC and in the summer time I use these at the end of the day to wash my feet. Very nice, light scent and sorta skin softening.
