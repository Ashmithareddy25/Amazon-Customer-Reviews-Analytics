B001PPLIEG|5.0|Take a deep breath -- you're in for a very fast thrill ride.  I felt like I had run a marathon after watching this movie -- out of breath, very tired, but completely exhilirated.  Daniel Craig  is terrific in this movie!  It seems like he has  reinvented and definitely rejuvenated James Bond.  Craig is so muscular and fit that he brings a believability to his stunts and fight scenes that has been absent from the other Bond films.  For those of you who enjoy \\"ACTION\\" movies with a shot of adrenelin -- this one is definitely a \\"must see\\".

1591843162|5.0|As of today, I am a changed man. I see things more clearly and look at the world through a different lens. All because, I know I am a genius, an artist, a Linchpin. I know that it's not going to be an easy transition and there will be times where fear and resistance are going to ring through in my lizard brain, but I know I have a unique gift to offer, not only to myself, but to those around me. I vow from this day forward to stand up and stake claim to my future of being indispensable all thanks to the amazing writings of Seth Godin in Linchpin.    With a unique combination of storytelling and fact delivering, Godin elicits the messages that were whispering in my mind, but were afraid to come out. Describing that inside each and every one of us lies a genius in our own right, Godin creates a compelling argument toward greatness and becoming that person we all wish we were; that voice that is whispering wanting to come out; that Linchpin.    Godin turns traditional thinking about career, marketing, and education on its head. The \\"if I perform at my highest (within corporate culture) I will be rewarded in the long run\\" mentality is quickly becoming the downfall in our society. There are fewer and fewer great thinkers out there and more cogs in the machine. But Godin believes an artist lies in each of us. This book Linchpin is the awakening of that artist, that genius. He empowers us to speak up in that meeting to make a difference, to voice our concern about a certain strategy, and the tools to deliver on these new found revelations. The difference between you right now and a Linchpin, is the confidence to stand up and the act of delivering.    Overall, Linchpin is an amazing, eye-opening experience that I am going to recommend to everyone from my cousin in college to the CEO of my company. If my entire organization were filled with Linchpins, the world would be our oyster. Thank you Seth Godin for awakening the sleeping giant.

B002HFWAWW|5.0|I am not sure how I missed this movie but it completely flew under my radar. A girl I was seeing recommended this film and I ended up taking a chance and picking it up on Blu-Ray. I am so glad for the recommendation and that I took a chance on this. This movie did not disappoint at all. Great action sequences with highly choreographed and impressive gun battles.<br /><br />This movie has a very interesting view on the future; a society that tries to strip away everything that makes us feeling human beings in an effort to quell emotion, that the society leaders claim, leads to violence, anarchy and inevitably - war. The movie lets you peer into a culture that squashes, with swift brutality, any and all things that spawn passion of any kind.<br /><br />Christian Bale is very good in this and the little known supporting cast does an admirable job as well. This is an Alliance title released in Canada primarily and comes to us via import through Amazon. This studio also has current Blu-Ray titles like Kill Bill 1 & 2, From Dusk til Dawn, Blade 1 & 2 and Gosford Park; all of which are very respectable 1080p transfers with great picture quality and DTS Master HD sound tracks.<br /><br />Though it does not say on the cover (cover mentions only a Dolby 5.1 and French 2.0 sound track) this Blu-Ray sports a very cool DTS Master HD soundtrack, which sounds fantastic. The picture is very clean and crisp in 1080p HD. The corporate cold and gray culture, which dominates this film, is occasionally met with some very rich colors that pose a nice contrast.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised how good this was for a relatively unknown film. There are plenty of scenes of brutality and highly stylized graphic violence to wet your appetite for good action and entertainment. If you enjoy Sci-Fi action films this is a must have to add to your Blu Ray collection.
1591843162|5.0|Only had Linchpin a month and it is already getting dog eared. The first time I read this book, I raced through it. The second time, I read it slowly and soaked it up. Now I keep going back to certain chapters and pages that resonate with me. Seth's ideas about fear, resistance, and the importance of moving ahead gave me understanding and courage in dealing positively with important parts of my life, both personal and in my business. Today, I'll be buying another copy for my daughter, a college student, because I think this book will matter to her - and I won't part with my own marked up copy!
B00005R24K|5.0|I saw Evil Dead 2 before I saw this one and loved it. Then I saw this one and it blew me away. Its a really good movie.   Made in 82' This is a story of a group of friends that go out to this cabin in the middle of nowhere. The friends find the book of the dead and a tape recorder and play it, big mistake. That awakes and evil in the woods that possesse some of the friends that go crazy and try to kill there friends. The trees come to life and the bridge which is the only way out of that place is gone. So they are stuck out there. They have to hope and pray they make it out of there alive.    I think this movie is a must for any horror movie fan. Pick it up at amazon.
1594202249|3.0|Sometimes when a writer of straight-up dramas or literary works takes a crack at the mystery genre, the results can be interesting.  I often reflect on Martin Amis' \\"Night Train\\", for instance. Amis made use of the conventions of the mystery genre without allowing himself to be pulled along by them, ultimately delivering a gangbusters, heartbreaking story that delivered satisfaction by, well... not delivering satisfaction and clarity on every aspect of the story.  The lingering mystery of \\"why...?\\" on certain character points can be just as resonant as an \\"Aha!\\" type explanation, as Amis ably demonstrated.  But, just as importantly, he told a clear story along the way to his ambiguity-laced conclusion.<br /><br />But we're talking about Thomas Pynchon's \\"Inherent Vice\\", aren't we?  Anyway, the thing starts out well, and throughout delivers much value: lots of well-drawn, imaginative scene setting, description, and characterizations (Doc, the central character, is both smart and ridiculous), but soon the story gets so complicated and meandering that all one can really enjoy are individual scenes, which- to be fair- are often quite well-crafted.  However, any momentum, novel-wide architectural craftsmanship that builds on what has gone before, etc., occurs in minimal fashion.  So, Pynchon doesn't even get to the point where he has to choose between haunting mysteriousness and total explanation in the resolution, because the hundreds of pages of story before the closing sections are muddled and unclear already.  In other words, while the resolution in \\"Night Train\\" produced many questions to think about afterward, Amis' comprehensible, well-crafted story clearly laid out those questions beforehand... we easily followed what was going on up until the ultimate questions are laid at our feet.  Pynchon doesn't do that; his whole story is all over the map.<br /><br />To be clear (can't resist that), \\"Inherent Vice\\" offers some good banter, observation (especially of the cynical variety), humor, and the imaginative description I mentioned before, but in the end the book was a chore.  Not as painful as other chores, but- with its muddled story and muddled final viewpoint- a chore nonetheless.  The book does work as a kind of mood piece, I'll give it that.  And if that's enough for you, give it a shot.  For me, \\"Inherent Vice\\" fell into the trap of many literary works: it disregarded craft in favor of self-conscious artiness.  And that can often result, as it did in my case, in frequent distraction and yawns.ical variety), humor, and the imaginative description I mentioned before, but in the end the book was a chore.

B000MV8ZD6|5.0|This is a rare cult horror movie that alot of people dont know about. That needs to change because this is a great scary horror movie to watch on a dark stormy night. I first saw this movie in a 9 movie set called The Living Dead. It was the first movie that I watched and it was my favorite movie in the whole set.   Made in 81', its a story about the Boyle family moving into a house next to you guessed it a cemetery. Strange things happen right when the family moves in. The family finds a headstone in the living room and for some reason they cant open the basement door. Good thing they cant though because there is a rottet zombie that is down in the basement.    This is one movie that I can watch over and over. If you like good gore cult movies you will like this one. Its one of many movies that Lucio Fulci directed. Evey movie that I watched of his I loved. This is a real great movie. Pick it up at amazon
B002SJIO4A|2.0|Great if you like big handheld weapons and people spectacularly being blown up by them, special effects were good. Basically its a buddy movie, the \\"bromance\\" is between an alien and a human scientist filmed like a documentary. Plenty of gore, violence and cussing...one for the kids!
0792841344|5.0|Phantasm, the first in four scary sequels. This is a really good scary movie to watch by yourself in the dark. I was eight years old when I first saw this movie and it scared the crap out of me. But I still love it.  Made in 79' The movie is about two brothers Mike and Jodi that live alone because there parents were killed. Strange things happen at the Morning Side Cemetery. Bodies come up missing and there is one guy that is taking them and turning them into little demons. The person behind it all. The Tall Man aka Angus Scrimm.  This is a real good underated movie. Check this movie out and if you like it. look for the other sequels that go with this movie. They are just as good as the first. Pick it up at amazon
B000NQR7NO|4.0|This is my second Arctic Monkeys album, the first being Humbug.  I bought Humbug out of impulse and I was largely rewarded.  I absolutely love that album and I needed more of the drumming punky brits.  Favourite Worst Nightmare, in my opinion, is not as developed and creative as Humbug, but it holds a lot of the core essence and talent of Arctic Monkeys.  Both albums feel like concept albums.  Humbug is a slow dreary concept, while this album is a little more playful.  Songs I connect with are Teddy Picker, Balaclava, Fluorescent Adolescent, Old Yellow Bricks, and most importantly 505.  \\"505\\" is definately one of my favorite monkey songs and it has the best exiting track in the history of music.  Somehow cd's are plagued with bad closing songs, but this one closes softly and moves you in a deep manner.<br /><br />If you bought either the first or last album and you wish to hear more, don't be afraid to try Favourite Worst Nightmare.  While it may not be an instant classic such as Humbug, it's definately got great material.  Arctic Monkeys are a one of a kind band with genre-bending talent.  In fact when I listen to them I feel like they have created a new type of music.  Music like this is hard to come by, so I'm happy to eat each of their albums up and take my time doing it.  By the end of these two cd's Arctic Monkeys have raced their way to the top of my list of favorite artists.
B00005R87K|5.0|Scary, Diffrent, Exciting, these are some words that sum up this all time classic horror movie. This vampire movie has what all vampire movies should have. Back then vampire movies were scary. Now we got Twilight and crap like that.    Made in 1922, The story is about a vampire who comes to a town to drink the blood from the young. He was from 'The Land Of The Phantoms' which is a scary place where there are vampires    This movie may be silent but it dosent need sound to make this movie scary. If you like silent movies or classic key word CLASSIC vampire movies pick it up at amazon.
045122499X|5.0|Great follow up to pillars of the Earth.Very well written with no slow spots, which is amazing considering the book is over 1,000 pages. Not quite as compelling as P O T Earth but excellent nonetheless. Amazing attention to historical detail, especially the way medevial buildings were constructed.  I wouldn't say the characters were as well developed as they were in pillars and the line between good guy and bad was more nebulous but perhaps more realistic.  The ending seemed a little rushed. Maybe at page 950 with no real end in sight Follet was compelled to wrap it up.  Overall an excellent read.  In my top 10 all time with Pillars.
0790744295|5.0|The two best horror writers of all time team up and do this masterpiece. This is such a great movie. There are five great scary stories to this movie. First, Its fathers day and this zombie comes from the grave wanting his fathers day cake. Second, and my favorite, King plays this hillbilly that finds a meteor in his yard. But this is not a normal meteor..... Third, Leslie Nielson \\"who would have guessed it\\" plays a bad guy that buries a lady and a man in the sand and waits for the tide to take there lives. But they dont stay dead. Fourth, a crate with a wolf beast in it kills a professor and others. Last, a mean millionaire has a big bug problem with his office.   This is a real great movie. If you are a horror movie fan, I think that you will really like this one. Pick it up at amazon.
B002ZE85YW|3.0|3 stars because I like the movie, but the Director's Cut is as the others have stated. Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer. Personally I think they could've kept it at a PG-13 rating...
B0010ZR160|1.0|I'm from South Boston and I really hoped to like this film.  Unfortunately, that was not possible.  I am mystified by the fawning reviews.  The foundation of the movie is the working relationship between Casey Affleck, as a young, naive, bratty gum shoe, and seasoned, grizzled Boston detectives was unrealistic.  As a criminal defense lawyer, I know Boston police detectives would never permit a private investigator to tag along on their investigations, never mind negotiate a ransom in a high-profile kidnapping case.  Following a \\"botched\\" exchange of the missing girl for the stolen money, the girl is presumed dead.  No body.  No resolution.  No leads.  Didn't make the slightest bit of sense.  From there, the movie descends into painfully cliche, sanctimonious drivel as Affleck obsesses over the child's death and the white-trash, drug addicted/alcoholic mother grieves her \\"dead\\" daughter.    Just when it appears the movie is over, it abruptly switches gears -- into another child kidnapping.  And by solving this kidnapping, Affleck stumbles upon just enough clues to solve the original kidnapping and unravel a top level conspiracy within the Boston PD.    Casey Affleck, who was very good in Good Will Hunting, was not believable as a tough guy, private investigator.  Ed Harris -- who usually gives a solid, credible performance -- overacted.  Morgan Freeman, nearly always flawless playing a distinguished authority figure, was at best mediocre.  With that kind of acting talent available, I can only conclude the less than compelling acting by Harris and Freeman was due to bad directing.  The bad script, of course, did not help matters.    Finally, as a life-long Bostonian, I was relieved that Ben Affleck chose real-life Boston based actors to play the supporting roles.  But while the Boston accents were authentic, he must have gone out of his way to find the least attractive Bostonians available.  I mean, most of the cast appeared sub-human, as if Bostonians sprung from some caliginous, recidivist, contaminated cesspool.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Overall I think this movie imitates the book pretty good. I like all the actors except Anne. She seems a little too timid and can barely get a word out which is kind of annoying at times. The movie does have places where it doesn't follow the book. I think they tried to bring in some excitement and 'suspense' to the movie so they added some stuff that wasn't in the book. But like I said the rest of the movie is really good!
0740748475|3.0|Though the collection is wonderful, the binding is very poor.  After two months of occasional reading, the binding started to sag.  We've had them now for a year, unfortunately, the pages are falling out and the covers are barely clinging to the backs of the books.  The only thing that looks good is the box the books came in.  I am very disappointed.    I wish now that I'd bought the paperback copies.  I'd give five stars for the content, and one star for the poor binding quality.

1591843162|4.0|When I received my advance, review copy of Linchpin, I started to devour it with the intent to read it cover to cover in a few hours.    But,    As I read a few pages, I had to sit and reflect on what I just read and how it applied to my life.    A couple days later as I was only through the first 50 pages, I brought the book to Huntington University where I was a guest speaker and recommended it to the students.    Each day, I read a few more pages and let them sink in.  This is not a quick bite to curb your hunger, it's a tasty meal to savor and enjoy, bite by bite and see where it takes you.

0393075966|5.0|Nobel aureate Joseph Stiglitz produces one of his best books, in which he interprets the reasons leading to, and the possible ways out, of the Great Recession that started in October 2008.<br />Stiglitz wrote: \\"Growth (in America over the past decade) was based on a mountain of debt.\\"  By 2008, Americans had to suffer from their \\"unsustainable levels of consumption,\\" and the economy crashed.<br />Sitglitz, a Keynesian economist, had predicted looming problems for the economy in Davos 2006, and according to this book, he felt embarrassed in 2007. He therefore told skeptics that either his theory was wrong, or crisis would hit harder. His second guess proved to be the right asnwer.<br />In Freefall, Stiglitz blamed most the greedy bank managers, brokers, lenders, rating agencies for what he described as \\"preying on\\" what they knew was destined to inevitably collapse: Subprime mortgages, or high risk people who borrowed beyond their means to buy houses.<br />He argued that many wrong assumptions led to the housing bubble, the first and foremost amongst them being that housing prices would keep on rising. American home owners were therefore engaged in further debt, often borrowing against their houses.<br />Stiglitz also blamed deregulation that started in 1987 under President Ronald Reagan.<br />\\"Interests, ideas, and ideologies\\" were the main drive behind such deregulation. The Nobel aureate showed some bias, and rightly so, toward former Fed Chairman, Paul Volker, who brought down America's inflation from 11.3 percent in 1979 to 3.6 in 1987, mainly through regulation, before Reagan replaced him with Alan Greenspan in order to reverse the regulation process.<br /> And for those who call him socialist, Stiglitz wrote that he is a staunch capitalist, except that sometimes there are \\"flaws in the capitalist system,\\" especially in the \\"American version of capitalism that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century.\\"<br />According to Stiglitz, America exported its flawed version of capitalism to the world, thus leading to a global crisis that should to be rectified. To do so, \\"it may be difficult to have a strong global economy do long as part of the world continues to produce far more than it consumes and another part - a part which should be saving to meet the needs of its aging population - continues to consume far more than it produces,\\" he wrote.<br />On the way President Barack Obama handled the 2008 Great Recession, Stiglitz wrote: \\"Hope with Obama was only partially fulfilled as the financial system remains less competitive... the too-big-to-fail-banks problem persists, and the [bailout] money to restructure economy was spent to save old and failed firms.\\"<br />Stiglitz argued that the bailout was too small, and that it was mainly designed by people from the George Bush administration, who led the economy into its current crisis. These include Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Chief Economist Larry Summers.<br />Stigliz believes that the government should have stepped in to rescue troubled homeowners by offering loans at low interest rates (say 2 percent), as the government was borrowing at zero percent interest rate. He criticized how the government made the cheap money available to banks, who lent it to Americans at an interest rate of 6 percent, therefore making 4 percent profit off the government's cheap money.<br />The government should also take into consideration the ratio of multipliers (i.e. the return on each dollar it spends), and should invest in long term projects that would certainly update America and make it more competitive - in the world - for the coming century, according to Siglitz.<br />\\"Other aspects of Obama's economic policy have been decidedly movements in the right direction,\\" Stiglitz wrote.to the world, thus leading to a global crisis that should to be rectified.

I also went to the mp3 downloads where they have Michael's Suites I to IV. I picked out some great ones there as well and made another complete CD. They were a little hard to find so I went to the MP3 area and typed in \\"The Michael Jackson Suites\\" and I to IV came up. I got 2 versions of ABC and both are flawless and sound completely different. Note: on Remix III the 3rd song \\"Who's Loving You\\" has Michael's voice so clear but the DJ who mixed it ruined it and it is unlistenable. Don't waste your money on that. I'm taking mine off my I-Pod. I can't say enough how bad it is.<br /><br />I just ordered [[ASIN:B002GJWTXO The Stripped Mixes]].

Jeremy Irons and Robert DiNero does an excellent work, they have a chemistry such deep and strong that its worth looking out for.

The scenery, cinematography is breathtaking. A journey worth witnessing, a film worth seing again and again.

1904633013|5.0|These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built.  And the price is RIGHT.  They are my favorite reading books -- nice binding and pages.  I also enjoy the occasional illustrations.  And they look very nice on my bookshelf.  I'm so glad Amazon is stocking them!
1591843162|5.0|Fabulous book! \\"Linchpin\\" is modern-day \\"Wisdom Literature.\\" The book includes proverbs, rants, pep talks, parables, prophecy, creativity, systems-thinking, leadership, and identity formation. Godin sees today for what it is, and he offers his giftedness and art to all who will read. The book is eclectic, creative, challenging, and inspirational. I highly recommend reading Linchpin, an indispensable book!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Wonderful book. I recomend it to everyone. As long as you are prepared for a few sobs every now an then. :,)
B001XJEKGC|3.0|This collaboration from the past should have been left in the past. This music is not what one has become accustomed to from Clapton. Both are talented musicians in their own right, but in my opinion Winwood's influence on this recording has been too pervasive. Maybe I just don't care too much for Steve Winwood's music. At any rate, had I known that I wasn't in for the trademark Clapton sound, I would not have bought this disk.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is a great game for anyone who loves board games. The only drawback is that it is a little hard to pick up at first so I would not recommend it as a gift for anyone under the age of 13. That said this is a good family game that involves working together towards victory instead of smothering your opponents. It also features many concepts involving probability, supply and demand and other business related concepts.
B002VECMAE|1.0|The ONLY redeeming quality of this movie?  George Clooney. And that was just to look at him. No plot, and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not worth viewing, much less renting or buying!
B002WUWHRA|4.0|This book is great.  The characters are different from what I'm used to but extremely interesting and the story line was exceptional.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What was Fox thinking when they canceled this brilliant show?  As a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff, Angel, I naturally gravitate to any new series that Joss Whedon is involved in.  In comparison to the aforementioned shows, as well as his latest network series, Dollhouse, Firefly had the strongest first season by far.  Given that Joss is excellent at building stories and the universes that they are set in slowly (it's what makes him so suited for writing TV series), I can only imagine how amazing Firefly could have become 2, 3, or 6 seasons into the future.      As a science fiction/western, the show's very premise is unusual.  Yet, it works extremely well.  This isn't a fanciful, romanticized future with shiny, perfect spaceships and characters that face problems that viewers could scarcely imagine dealing with.  No; Firefly is as down to earth and believable as science fiction can get.  Only two assumptions are necessary in order to suspend disbelief in \\"The 'Verse\\":  1) that humans will deplete the Earth's resources in the future (it's already happened in Firefly, and 2) that space travel becomes possible, and a suitable \\"new\\" solar system be found.  These are the only \\"futuristic\\" aspects of Firefly, and other than that life goes on for people just as it has for all of human history.  They fight in bloody wars, oppressive governments spring up, and the biggest worry that the common folk have is getting enough money to put food on their plates.  The Alliance is a classical Empire that has overextended its reach; it is unable to effectively govern the outer planets, and thus they are neglected.  These planets are literally on the frontier, which is where the \\"western\\" aspect of the show comes into play.  Overall, a very rich world.    Of course the real strength of the show, as is usual for everything that Joss Whedon writes, is the dialogue and the characters.  Fans of his other shows will recognize the witty lines and liberal amount of humor interjected even into storylines that deal with very serious issues.  Walking that balance between drama and humor can be difficult, but Firefly definitely delivers.  Furthermore, every single character on Serenity (the name of the Firefly-class ship that they travel in) is likable and believable.  In one of the extras Joss Whedon mentioned that at it's core, the show is about 9 different people looking into the blackness of space and all seeing different things.  And there is quite the diversity of characters; from the uneducated mercenary, and resident tough guy Jayne, to the \\"proper,\\" top-of-his-class doctor who lost everything saving his sister (a child prodigy driven to insanity through government medical experiments which turned her into an empath/mind reader, as well as a near-perfect fighter).      While not all of the 15 episodes in this set are equally strong, there aren't any really \\"bad\\" episodes (though there are several really good ones, with my favorite probably being episode 8: Jaynestown).  This is an incredible feat for any show to accomplish, and makes you wonder even harder how this show got canceled.      While its cancellation was most unfortunate, it's a testament to the show's strengths that it was able to be wrapped up with a major motion picture, Serenity.  How often does that happen?  A show gets canceled halfway through its first season and then it gets made into a movie!
B0001I55OC|4.0|The movie is based on the novel \\"Timeline\\" by Michael Crichton.<br /><br />Turns out that someone at ITC is making too many accurate guesses about where to find things in an archaeological dig. Professor E.A. Johnston (Billy Connolly) gets a little suspicious. Two days after professor Johnson leaves to investigate, his glasses lens if found in a box from the France of 1357; the professor is missing.<br /><br />As you guessed, it is a rescue in time movie. There are twists and turns. Can history be changed? And who are the good guys? Who is the one-eared man that is buried with Lady Claire (Anna Friel)?<br /><br />The costumes were well done. The dialog was fair. The music that got loud at times never overwhelmed the dialog.<br /><br />The movie was released in 2004 but the comments in the movie say 1971.<br /><br />Even if it is formula, you will be entranced until the very end.
1591843162|5.0|My hope is that this book will inspire and educate you as it has me.    I won't attempt to do Godin's concepts justice by summarizing them here.  But know this.  The world needs your unique talents and your voice now more than ever.  You're hard-wired to resist this \\"risky\\" contribution to society but you have the choice to overcome this resistance.  To deliver on your own greatness.  To dream big.  Draw your own map.  Whether you're self-employed or an employee, this book will change your perspective.  If you have kids or work with kids, it's a must-read.    Stand up to embrace your role as a \\"Linchpin\\" and join the ranks of those changing the world in their own special way.    Don't take my word for it, do a Twitter Search for #Linchpin or \\"Seth Godin\\" and you'll be absolutely blown away by the advance reviewers.    Oh, and order 2, because if you're like me, you're going to want to share this with as many people as possible!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|It is finally here. Amazon just released the uncensored \\"The Fame Monster\\" in mp3 format today. The music is still amazing, I just wish that we were given the choice right from the beginning of buying the explicit or clean version.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Received in used good condition -- bought for my son, but I like it too.
1591843162|4.0|I have noticed a lot of people are writing very long reviews. That's fine, but unnecessary. This book is about choice. Do you want to make a difference or do you want to follow. Most jobs require followers - follow the rules, the dress code, the map, and AT BEST you'll retire with an uneventful career. Or do you want to make a difference and become a linchpin or indispensable? Are you interested in changing your work into a rewarding and enjoyable passion.     Do you want to lead? Do you want to make a difference? Do you want your job to become your passion? Do you want to take the road less travelled? If yes, then read this book. You'll learn about \\"fear\\" and how it works. You'll learn to how to use this \\"fear\\" to grow. You'll learn it's fine to fail. You'll learn it's good to stick your neck out and stand out.    Not interested in standing out? Are you happy with following others? Don't read this book! It will scare you.    In the end, make a difference at work not because you should, but because it's in you. Drive your passion, don't just drive to work.    Why only four stars? Because I believe perfection sucks. I always want to strive to do better. I don't want Seth to get soft and stop writing books.
1591843162|5.0|This is a book about becoming indispensable.  It's also a book about art, gifts and overcoming resistance.<br /><br />This is a book you'll want to give to your boss, your employees, and your kid's teacher at school.  It will change the way you view the world.
0634049011|5.0|I am a player of over 12 years now and finally realized that it was time I get serious about this instrument. Up to this point, I was able to sit with a program and learn songs at half speed and \\"knew\\" my scales but whenever I sat down with a jam track it just sounded like noodling. I could play some fairly complicated tracks but when asked to produce something myself all that came out was some scales and, at best, some quotes from other songs. I wanted to break this barrier and having studied music years before had a strong feeling my lack of theory was the disconnect.    You can learn scale shapes but without theory they sound lame. You can learn chords but need some theory to give them direction. This book forces you to learn the fretboard (something I never bothered with beyond the 6th and 5th string), learn the CAGED method (I taught myself the three note per string shapes), Pentatonic and Major scale shapes in CAGED, focusing not on shapes but the notes contained and where within those shapes, intervals, arpeggios and from that point on more heavy duty stuff.    This book isn't a learn licks book, instead it really teaches you your instrument. It sounds cliche, but this book has really opened up the guitar as well as made the scales much more applicable and understandable. Forcing you to use the arpeggios allows you to find notes of the progression within the scale and transform your solo from noodling to solid harmony.    While this book isn't the magic bullet that will solve all of your problems most people here have, correctly, identified that this is the critical step from intermediate into advanced player. If you spend the time with this book and literally think about it during your free time to conceptualize and internalize the information, it breaks down most of the barriers in your playing. After this book, many things will make more sense and suddenly lick books, your favorite songs and other additional teachings will mean much more to you. For this reason, I am happy to have read and practiced the teachings of this book and recommend it highly.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is an amazing collection of clips from his rehearsals for the tour.  The extras are great.  The sound quality is amazing and it is a visual feast.  If you loved Michael you will want this.  It is wonderful to see the man in action and to show the world what a kind, funny and loving person he was.  I only wish there were more clips.  Unfortunately - for us all - This IS it... and it leaves you wanting more.  Just as wonderful at home as it was in the theater.  Kudos to those responsible for sharing it with us.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|After seeing \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\", I was hooked on the movie and it's soundtrack. Leone's direction and Mariconne's score are a perfect artistic blend. The CD is splendid and includes four compositions that were not included in the movie.

0765309408|5.0|I'm doing a two review in one od this book because both me and my wife read it.<br /><br />Her review is fairly simple.<br /> She dislikes science fiction. She's maybe read a few books of it and usually will not finish the story. That being said she really enjoyed this book despite the fact she dislikes SF.<br /><br />My own review is a bit different.<br /> I'm an occasional science fiction reader. I do have to agree with some of the negative reviews but I really liked it anyway.I'm familiar with Joe Haldeman's work and I have been a fan of his for many years. I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to more from the author. I would have liked to have seen a bit more done on the social aspects of going from a 75 year old man's body into that of a 20 year old. I will admit that as an older recently disabled man I found myself daydreaming a lot about what I would do if I were given the same chance. Me, I would feel indebted to the people who gave me that chance and would probably approach it with a what the heck I was doing to die anyway attitude.<br /><br /> The book was a very pleasant distraction to me. Instead of sitting around thinking about what I used to be able to do I found myself thinking about what I would do if I had this opportunity. I'm not sure that a younger person might actually enjoy this book. I remember well what I was like when I was younger and felt that anything bad that happened to me physically could be easily recovered from. Note to young folks; Some things that happen to you when you are younger really do come back to haunt you when you are older and it happens faster than you think it will.<br /><br /> Young or old this book is still a good read in in my humble opinion.
1591843162|5.0|I'm a firm believer in the fact that we have choices we make daily to move forward to stay stagnant. I've also heard, \\"if you're not growing, you're dying.\\"<br />Seth Godin does not tell you how to be a leader. Only you can tell yourself what needs to be done. He does tell you to help change people. Change them with your art. Art you produce doing what you do best. Do you engage/entertain a room of customers as you pour drinks from behind the bar? That's an art. Do you solve customer service issues without breaking a sweat? That's an art. Do you bring joy to others by working in a medium that can be readily shared over the internet? That's an art.<br />Not everyone creates art the same way. We are all wired differently. But we all have a choice to make. Become indispensable or be a cog. Cogs are common. Human Resources orders cogs daily to fill the needs of many positions that other cogs have left as they go become cogs elsewhere. Or they become linchpins, with a choice to be more than they were hired for.<br />We have a couple of obstacles to this endeavor. Our education system is designed to spit out cogs who mindlessly blend in, don't rock the boat and fill in the blanks painfully, via rote. This was born out of the factory era that needed people who passed standardized test (being standard) and who did as they were told. The next obstacle is society. You are socialized to fit in, dress like others dress, drink what others drink and aspire to be the person your friends tell you that you should be.<br />Boring!<br />I will admit it's not easy to be \\"On\\" all the time. You're feeling like you are in the zone, then suddenly and wrench gets thrown in the works and our old friend \\"lizard brain\\" kicks in and we lock-up and fall back to our old ways, old scripts, old reasons, and old excuses.<br />We have seen linchpins in action. We've been nearby or firsthand when customer service beyond what we expected is given. We have gotten chills from seeing someone present art from a medium we enjoy or has caught us off-guard with a medium we don't normally enjoy, but they are gifted. Changed. That's what linchpins seek to do. Change people for the better.<br />Personal interactions, group settings, art galleries, street corner, sidewalk, and more I'm sure I'm missing. All of these are mediums for you or others to do art that changes others. Look others in the eye when talking (stop texting for 5 min), smile at another person and possibly say \\"good morning\\", it won't hurt you, compliment a coworker on a project, pour your heart into something and give it away without recompense.<br />\\"The only purpose to starting is to finish\\" says Seth. Ship. Finish. Deliver. Publish. Serve. Stop thrashing about at the end. Thrash early. Get it out of your system.<br />Leave anxiety at the door. Worry about what you have no control over gives control to the future and takes it away from you and your team. You can't change others minds, nor read them and influence them. It just gives you a migraine and robs you of much needed sleep. You need the rest for the presentation you've prepared that will either change them or not. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that's great too. Feedback is a wonderful tool we are given to work with.<br />Bonus Content: A linchpin doesn't use a resume. Use a presentation. Use a Video. Not something that will be scanned and feed to an algorithm.<br />Now go read more, become the artist you were born to be and change others for the better.

B000Z27HLS|1.0|i very much enjoyed this film. the actors were great, the production well done. i've purchased many austin film adaptations, but on principle, i won't purchase this because the dvd released in the states is cut by 7 minutes (or more?), as compared to the british dvd release. who knows what we've missed because some idiot at PBS has some power to abuse and thinks they know better. (the new film adaptations are generally too short as it is to do justice to the novels, except maybe the new sense and sensibility which seemed well done in this respect.) but i find this so infuriating. i hate this practice. thus, no purchase. hopefully some other executive at PBS will do their job and correct this stupid error.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have seen the 3D X-Pand version in Hollywood, the Real3D version and the IMAX. Awesome effects and great film overall. Story was a little predictable, but the amazing effects more than made up for any weakness in story. I also liked THE DONNER PARTY starring Crispin Glover as well! Check it out when you can!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Those expecting another CW album shouldn't be disappointed with this one. As usual, this CD offers the same vocal styling one comes to expect from these fine ladies. Only \\"complaint\\" is that some of these songs don't sound the same as they do in the broadcast version. Also, some of the instrumentals (specifically the Isle of Hope track) don't match what most saw in their performance. Not a huge thing but something I did notice when listening to some of these tracks.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|My daughter is almost 3 years old and has seen just about every other Disney cartoon movie out there.  She LOVES them!  The music engages her, the stories are daring, romantic, educating...  We went to go see The Princess and The Frog in theaters when it came out and she simply loved it!  We were both dancing to the music, laughing at the \\"silly froggy\\", and worried when the shadows were chasing them.  The emotion and story-line was so realistic that I was near tears several times during the movie, and dancing in my seat at other times.  The shadow scene was probably a little frightening for my daughter, but she knows that it is only a movie and was only worried that someone might get hurt.  I can't wait for this to come to BluRay - We'll be pre-ordering our copy for sure!!
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I haven't been blown away by a newer band in a long, long time, and the ones that I have put a lot of faith in have, in most cases, either delved into idiosyntric styles or disappointed.<br /><br />Personally, I love the Springsteen-ian Rennaisance of the last 10 years, as many younger acts have come forward who are unafraid to claim him as a primary influence on their work.  For quite a bit of the 1990's, you would mention Bruce and would recieve Courtney Cox type responses, which was unfair and a little disrespectful of the man's contributions to popular music.  On the other hand, this resurgence of popularity has, at times, tended to bring forth bands and artists who claim him as an influence, but sometimes it seemed as though they were namechecking.  After a while, I started to be weary of the \\"New Springsteen\\" labeled acts, much like the \\"New Dylan\\" backlash of the 1970s.<br /><br />Well, this album left me pretty speechless.  Wow.  Obviously, they are heavily influence by \\"River Era\\" Springsteen, which is probably the best period of his career for a new band to be influenced by because of it's loose vibe and effortless feel.  These guys really nail it here and then some, as a number of tracks echo \\"Jackson Cage\\" with a \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" lyrical bent.<br /><br />Like others, I won't get into a song by song breakdown as my attention span is limited, and this is an album that should be listened to from start to finish.  All I can say is the title track is one of the most exciting songs I've heard in some time to come from a newer act and \\"Old White Lincoln\\" is not far behind it.
B0000AYL17|5.0|I own this in vinyl and it sounds so rich and full that I did not believe it could get any better - WRONG. The vinyl is sooo much better than the regular CD releases (I own the box set) that I struggled with the possibility that I would be wasting money buying the SACD version. The 2.0 layer (I have not played the 5.1 layer as I do NOT like music in surround) has got to be the best sounding SACD in my collection - even blowing by my Dark Side Of The Moon, Eat A Peach, and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road SACD's.So much detail,warmth and spaciousness that it left me spellbound. As for one person commenting on the mix - I find it faithful to the original vinyl version. was he commenting on the 5.1 mix - all of those are different - oh well - I HATE that this format is dying. Now, what to do with my vinyl LP .....
0545128285|4.0|What might the young magical children in Harry Potter's world read before bed?  Probably a selection from Beedle the Bard, teller of ancient fairy tales for the wizarding set.    These stories are funny, as is the commentary by Dumbledore as he explains some of the history and possible meaning behind the stories.  It was nice to get to dip into the Harry Potter universe a little bit, now that the series has ended.    I would have liked to have read more; this book was short enough to be something of a tease.  It seemed like it was just written as a lark, so its brevity was a bit disappointing.
0470477237|1.0|I can't believe the high ratings this book is getting from reviewers.

1591843162|4.0|I had such a hard time reading the first part of the book I put it down for over a week before forcing myself to read the rest. Unless you are a fan-boy/girl, skip the first 48 pages.      In the rest of the book, he provides gems and gives you enough room to think. If you are ideaphoric, intent on crafting your world and have a couple of hours, this is a good book to get you off your butt.    About those first 48 pages . . . he sets up why things are so bad that we need linchpins. But that undermines the very concept. That makes linchpins firefighters, not artists.     If you own/operate a small company, the first 48 pages will remind you of every employee who showed tremendous promise, then failed to (fill in the blank). The employees who stopped leading, mid-battle, leaving you with neither a success nor a failure, just a fizzle. All that energy expended and no profit nor scars for stories. Meh. As the employer, it's draining. Seth spends the first 48 pages fomenting these almost-rans. Painful to read.    Those first 48 pages came across as black and white - you are either an abused employee or large faceless corporation perpetrating the abuse. If that IS your world, read those pages. If not, you won't miss much by skipping them. So get to the good stuff.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Saw it several times at the cinema and even before I'd finished watching this at home for the first time, I was already looking forward to watching it again. I can't believe how great this movie is.
1591843162|5.0|The title of the book is Linchpin: Are you indispensible? The core message of the book is this: In order to thrive in the new economy you must become a Linchpin, that part of your organization that is utterly invaluable - the part that holds the entire enterprise together.<br />The problem is, there is no one set of instructions for this.<br /><br />  * There is no guidebook.<br />  * There is no map.<br />  * There is no checklist.<br /><br />Godin does share some stories about people that have done amazing things, and they share a few qualities that anyone can nurture and develop. Of, course, these qualities will vary from person to person and according to your field of endeavor.<br /><br />A short list of the basics:<br /><br />  * Impatience with things \\"as they are\\"<br />  * Discernment, the ability to really see what is happening<br />  * Motivation to create something special<br />  * The ability to make a genuine connection<br />  * A greater desire to give than to receive<br /><br />I believe that most people would agree that these are simply \\"good qualities\\" for anybody to have. But as the old saying goes, \\"Anybody could have, everybody should have, nobody did.\\"<br /><br />That is the heart of the matter. We all need to take a good, hard look at what we do, our work not our jobs, and make a conscious decision to become indispensable. Read the book. Think about your work and your fear.<br /><br />Then do something about it. I know that I will. Stay tuned.
0345441184|1.0|I will not go into a lengthy critique of why and how this book gets one star...this was more than adequately provided by other critiques.  Let me just say that it was truly a pitiful depiction of the Arthurian myth and a shameful presentation of women, and it is my intention to burn it with the rising sun at Beltaine as an affirmation and celebration of life and of the Sacred Feminine.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Here is an intelligent sci-fi movie which will lead you to ask questions about certain areas of morality and existence. It includes a couple of main plot twists which occupy the majority of the movie. The appeal of this movie isn't the special effects or cinematography like many sci-fi movies (although both are perfectly adequate), but the characterization and emotional turmoil of the main character, Sam Bell.    For the past 3 years Sam has been alone at a station on the moon where they supply a significant portion of the Earth's clean energy. It's a worthy cause, although you eventually question the goodness of the company running the operation. Sam's only companionship is Gerty, a computer which helps him run the station. Does Gerty have Sam's interests and well-being in mind or not? While Gerty is reminiscent of HAL from \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", don't think for a moment this movie is just a rehash of it.    Sam's only contact with Earth comes from exchanging videos because the live connection is down. Through these, Sam keeps in touch with the company and with his wife and young daughter. Living alone and away from his family has clearly been taking a toll on Sam's mental and physical condition. He admits to talking to himself and tries to find things to occupy himself, but he doesn't seem to dislike or fault the job itself. Thankfully, he is scheduled to be replaced in a couple weeks. However, everything changes after he gets into an accident, crashing his lunar rover into one of the devices helping drive the energy development. Soon after waking up in sick bay, he is driven to return to the crash site, against the wishes of the company as enforced by Gerty. Everything Sam knows changes after he revisits the crash site.    Sam Rockwell gives a great performance as Sam, one of the best of 2009 despite not getting any awards recognition. Kevin Spacey is a good fit for the voice of Gerty, and the smiley faces used to convey the computer's moods are sometimes comical. This movie excels most because of the writing and directing of Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son). I hope to see more from Jones in the future.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|Our story takes place in a world where almost all people live their lives through robots.  These surrogates are completely controllable through sensory controls.  And the humans never have to leave their homes to live a full, rich life.  After all, if your surrogate dies, you just need to buy a new one.<br /><br />Canter (James Francis Gintv) is a college student taking a break and visiting Boston.  Outside a club, he and his new pickup are stunned by an electric gadget.  Since crime of all kinds has been virtually eliminated, this is shocking.<br /><br />Enter FBI agents Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell).  As they begin tracking down the killer, they discover that the hosts of these two surrogates have been killed as well.  Plus, Canter was the son of Dr. Canter (James Cromwell), the inventor of surrogates.  Could one of the cells of human hold outs be behind this horrid crime?<br /><br />As a mystery, this story was rather good.  There were some obvious plot elements, but a few twists caught me off guard as well.  The final twists were a little rushed, and I had to sort through who did what to whom and why after the movie was over.  In thinking about it afterward, I realized there was a plot hole, and I was left wondering why the villain didn't go about his plan in some other way.<br /><br />Visually, the movie was great.  The surrogates looked porcelain and just a tad too perfect, while the humans looked run down.  This played into the theme and helped differentiate the humans from the surrogates.  The movie wasn't loaded with special effects, but the ones we had were great.<br /><br />The problem with the script is that is emphasized the story over everything else.  The characters were mostly flat, and the few attempts at development were little more than cliches.  Heck, some of the background information given to us was just dropped along the way.  As a result, I felt the theme, which could have been great, was underdeveloped.  No, I don't need to be beaten over the head with it, but a little more on the characters would have made it very powerful.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story, and am glad I saw it.  But I do wish the characters had been stronger to truly pull me in.little more on the characters would have made it very powerful.    I enjoyed the story, and am glad I saw it.

B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|Obviously to enjoy a sci-fi film you must be willing to suspend belief so you can be drawn into some alternate or futuristic environment. That said it does help if you don't totally insult the viewers intelligience along the way, especially if you want the film to be taken seriously. And \\"Surrogates\\" wants to be taken seriously. So much so that I found myself laughing throughout.    The premise of \\"Surrogates\\" is this. The world has become a dangerous place so a greedy corporation has created surrogates to walk the earth while their real human counterparts stay safely inside hooked up to machines controlling the surrogates actions. So the surrogates work, shop, club....do everything humans once used to do. Of course the surrogates are more beautiful versions of their human counterparts, except for Bruce Willis who obviously has no sense of style since he picked the worst hairdo ever. But anyway who wouldn't rather stay cooped up at home hooked up to some machine while your robotic better half does everything else? Well not everyone obviously as inner-city \\"reservations\\" have been created for those who condemn surrogates. Instead of the clean and beautiful surrogate world that surrounds them you have dirty, filthy violent slums filled with ugly people. Ghastly!    Yep I'm still laughing, but not in a good way. Not only does this film take itself way too seriously, it's as bland and formulaic as can be. The writing is just dreadful. The plot predictable. The action forgettable. In fact my only lasting memory of this film will be the bad hair of Bruce Willis' surrogate.

I give it four stars because it wouldn't be fair to rate it lower because of sentimental reasons.

B000Q7ZND6|3.0|Based on the HELLBLAZER comics, John Constantine (played like a robot by Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter that can see demons and angels. His responsibility is to keep them in line if they go beyond what is allowed in tipping the balance between good and evil. The film revolves around detective Angela Dodson (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) and her twin that commits suicide. She seeks the help of Constantine to determine what external forces may have played a role in her death. As they unravel the mystery they learn that her sister's death was only to draw Angela to play a part in a diabolical scheme. The concept and story are great. The supporting roles are filled by great actors like Shia LeBeouf, Tilda Swinton and check out who plays Lucifer! Keanu just kills it. He was great in the Matrix when asked to play like a robot because that's about all he is good at, lately. In Constantine, it just doesn't work. Viggo Mortensen or Guy Pearce would have made this a 4 star movie, but although the story and effects are good...Keanu brings it down a notch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and sound. All special features from DVD are here. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!
B002QEXN2K|5.0|John Mayer is simply a great artist.  He always manages to deliver an album with memorable songs.  I admit when I first picked up Battle Studies and played it, I was expecting something very much along the lines of Continuum.  But after I started to listen, I found I really liked the music even though it is a departure from what he's previously released. Now after 4 days of owning the album, I find myself singing his tunes at work or in my car.....another keeper.
0545123267|5.0|The first time Grace saw those yellow eyes they belonged to a wolf, a wolf who saved her. The first time Grace was bitten she had thought she would die. Later when Grace saw those yellow eyes they belonged to a boy, a boy who she saved. Later when she was bitten she thought the wolf would die.<br /><br />For years Grace watched the wolves that lived in the woods surrounding her home, for years the wolves watched her. She thought about them all the time, they were her wolves. Every winter the wolves would be there, a constant companion to the snow. In the summer they were gone. She never thought more about that.<br /><br />For a while Grace and Sam were living like they had all the time in the world, like a future was possible for them, like the end wasn't coming. For a while they were the happiest they had ever been, but their time together was shadowed, by men and wolves and the constant threat of the cold. It had taken six years for them to finally reach each other, and now they were only a snow fall away from losing each other for ever.<br /><br />Shiver is a love story told with simple elegance that is heartbreaking, tender and terrifying. The relationship between Grace and Sam is honest and thoughtful, pitched against the dangers of their separate worlds that are about to collide.<br /><br />A story of werewolves as you have never read before, with no full moons and no silver bullets; just the bite of a wolf and the call of winter. A highly recommended read for teens, fantasy readers and romantics; and anyone who loves a good story.
B00330UFQS|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums I've heard in quite some time.  Normally when I purchase an entire album I find I really like some songs, feel ambivilant about a few, and don't care for one or two.  This is one of those albums where I like pretty much every song.      I just finished listening to the entire album and I have to say I'm hooked.  If you like \\"Need You Now\\", you'll love the album.  \\"If I Knew Then\\" and \\"When You Got a Good Thing\\" are great ballads, sweet without being overly sappy.  There are a few upbeat songs and a couple definitely remind you it's a country-genre album.  Aside from those, the album is full of the type of music that can easily transition to mainstream radio.      I liked the first album, love the second.  Beautiful music, excellent harmonies, and wonderful lyrics.  Exactly what music is all about.
1591843162|5.0|I bought Linchpin through pre-order as soon as it was available. Why? Because I trust Seth, and I knew it was going to be good.<br /><br />But wait. Not only is it good, it's also highly relevant, super practical, and deeply meaningful at the same time. (Oh -- and because it's by Seth Godin, it's fun too.)<br /><br />As he says in the beginning, this is a more personal Godin work than his previous twelve books, all of which have been bestsellers. Just as \\"we're all artists even if we don't know how to draw,\\" Seth tells us that we're all geniuses. The problem is not how to become a genius, but how to unlearn the indoctrination of conforming to a low standard and thinking like everyone else.<br /><br />My three favorite quotes from the book:<br /><br />1. \\"Teamwork\\" is the word that bosses use when they actually mean \\"Do what I say.\\"<br /><br />2. We get a certain amount of brain cycles to spend every day. Spending even one on a situation out of our control has a significant opportunity cost.<br /><br />3. Never let the lizard send an email.<br /><br />You are a genius! And whether you're a painter, a plumber, or something else, Linchpin will help you share your great work with the world. As Seth likes to say, we need you. Like I did, you should click the \\"Add to Shopping Cart\\" button and buy this book.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|The seller communicated to say the product was on the way.  It was delivered very promptly.  In fact I ordered, I think, 5 items.

Thanks to the seller and Amazon.com.

B00133KDM8|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but wanted to add one here because this album deserves the support. I love this album! I was pleasantly surprised by how well-produced this CD is, the excellent musicians and how many great songs there are.  I was a big Nightwish fan up until the new vocalist and album which lost me. But unlike some reviewers I do not miss the faster, heavy songs that this album only has a couple of. The symphonic passages, chorus backgrounds and beautiful melodies are all here. The album has a really nice flow to it, and almost every song is really good... and there are alot of songs! I also have to say that Tarja's voice is better than ever, and sings with such feeling.     I will continue to buy Tarja's music based on this album. Great work!

THE BLACK ICE is a great mystery and once again, Bosch is struggling with the accusations of the past.  The death of police officer Cal Moore pulls Harry into the chase for an answer.  Bosch is such a great detective and we get to follow clue by clue.  Thank you , Michael Connelly for this detective.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED in this genre.  Bring on the third book.

I can't say anymore or I will spoil the good read!

1591843162|5.0|Once again Seth Godin is on the mark! With Linchpin he challenges us all to tap into our inner genius (yes we all have one) and be remarkable, be indispensable, be more then a cog in the machine.     It's the lizard brain that causes our resistance and if we can learn the steps to overcome that we can learn to be more, do more, create more and fulfill the dreams we always had for ourselves but never thought we had the ability to achieve.  We all have that inner spark but we've had it tamped down by years of training by school and work and life lessons of following the rules and doing only what's necessary. We need to reach beyond - to go the extra mile and that can be scary, but it's not impossible for anyone. That's right anyone!    My favorite quote, the one that illustrates how one man takes the lizard brain, that part of us that questions, doubts and stunts us and had it firmly in check is this:    \\"The merest attempt at estimating, the slightest unconscious recording is shrugged off as an absurd association with some never-to-be-realized dream...as an exercise in futility...I manage to whisper my first thought (whisper, so the demons won't hear): \\"I know it's impossible. But I know I'll do it.\\" At that instant, the towers become \\"my towers.\\" Once on the street, a new thought: Impossible, yes, so let's get to work.\\" - From Man on a Wire - Philippe Petite's conquest of the World Trade Center    Petite is a true Linchpin!  You can be too, let Godin show you how!
0307387178|5.0|I had enjoyed Jon Krakuer's book [[ASIN:0385494785 Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster]].  Thinking that Into the Wild would be of the same high quality, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I had made a wise choice.  Krakuer's work tends to stick with you long after you have finished the book.  I had originally purchased the book back in 1997.  My son borrowed it for a while and then it landed at my mother's house where she finished reading it this year.  Somehow, it made it back home to my bookcase so I thought I would write a short review (or opinion) before placing it back in its rightful place among the nic-nacs, pictures and family of books.<br /><br />The writing is first rate as the author takes us on a journey he made trying to understand the mindset of this intense young misguided man.  I have personally known a few young men (and women) that fit into this stubborn idealism.  While their thoughts and dreams are noble, they are never quite prepared for that heavy dose of reality that life sometimes rains down on our heads.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I had an extreme sadness for the family that he had left back home.  As a parent to five children, I can only imagine the anguish that filled each day of their lives.  While some may admire McCandless's courage, I can only read this from the aforementioned perch of parenthood. Therefore, I come away with a different conclusion than the author.  I am not saying he is wrong.  Just different opinion.<br /><br />Well written.  Properly paced with just the right amount of tangents. Highly recommended for those who enjoy well-versed non-fiction.<br /><br />I hope you find this opinion helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch<br />Author of [[ASIN:1897326882 Wingtips with Spurs]]
0385504225|3.0|THE LOST SYMBOL gets 4 stars for the story and rich use of Masonic symbols, but only 3 stars for the actual writing. This should result in a total of 3.5 stars, but Amazon does not allow 1/2 star ratings. So I decided to round down and apply a 3-star rating. Much has been said about Dan Brown's poor writing technique in the previous two Langdon stories, but in this outing Brown really lowers the bar (he is, without a doubt, the poster child for \\"tell, don't show\\"). I'm sure the effect is quite jarring for someone working through page after page of the written word. Fortunately, Brown's verbose tendency to over-explain how a character, for example, delivers information through their eyes is not as bludgeoning in the audio version (even if you go with the unabridged audio). All that aside, the Masonic plot combined with details about America and her Founding Fathers is entertaining and, to a certain point, almost inspiring. If readers complete THE LOST SYMBOL and have a desire to learn more about Washington, Franklin, etc. and the city they built to serve the nation they founded, then I believe Dan Brown can be credited with a great service.
1591843162|5.0|Our mythical Common Sense has a habit of telling us that everyone would or at least should agree on certain ideas, practices, etc.  As often as this is proclaimed, the notion is wrong.<br /><br />For instance, it can be suggested that we are all indispensable in our work lives.  Otherwise, we can naively ask, why were we hired in the first place?  Of course, in our eyes who can live without us?  But we are not indispensable.  It seems people are incurably and exceptionally skilled at making themselves dispensable.  (For full disclosure: I have been very adept in my life at making myself dispensable, in more ways than I would dare share with you today.) With that admission, I am now ready to declare that Seth Godin's book, Linchpin, captured me for a sleepless night reading experience.<br /><br />Ok, I am a fan of Seth Godin.  No, he is not a rock star, nor a member of the mindless' Celebrity Hall of Fame. He is simply a very insightful person, who expresses his thoughts freely--nothing more and nothing less.  But insights don't grow freely on trees.  Insights develop from life experiences and with an investment of time to see life, in ways, which cannot be bought nor inherited.<br /><br />In Linchpin a careful and methodical reader can find thoughts worth rereading over the course of years.  As a text it will not become a classic for the easy-living types. But it will become a guide for those who know they must continually learn and relearn how to see the world, especially within and outside their respective worlds.  Beyond that readers are enticed to solicit perspectives on how to think very clearly about the future.  Consequently, it is a book, which dares readers to engage friends, bosses, partners and others, to consult their feelings on what they want out of life's choices?<br /><br />It simply asks if people want to become, remain and die as dispensable \\"cogs of machines?\\"  Is that really important to want to know?  Yes!<br /><br />Finally, I do not care to spoil your exploration of the book.  You must read it to form your own opinions.  Yet, for the curious among you, who live in a challenging rut-filled fog, while navigating your lives and careers, please start the book at page 101.  Pick it up and read a few pages and then perform one of the toughest human tasks in our 21st Century way of living:  THINK!<br /><br />Think as a human being and not as a machine.You must read it to form your own opinions.

1591843162|5.0|Another great book from Seth Godin. Seth delivers another winner in his series of books aimed at describing something previously uncategorized or studied. In Linchpin, Seth describes the type of person in an organization or community that is indispensable for their ability to change the status quo and make meaning as he puts it \\"at the edge of the box\\" where change is possible. Seth lays out the view of the Linchpin as an artist who doesn't just do work, but creates art, be it in the delivering of a meal in a restaurant or game changing ideas in the board room. Definitely a motivator and worth the read. I'd also recommend [[ASIN:1591841666 The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)]] for similar themes and relevance.

B002PN3J9E|5.0|I have read 3 books that mention or discuss the Anders Erickson study that concludes that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become excellent. This book is the best.  It tells what is in your hands as a coach and parent and what needs to come from the student.  As the other reviewer said this book is a life changer and it very important to us as parents, coaches, teachers and encouragers of friends.  I found it to be a very fast read and fascinating. I first read this book from the library.  I plan to get and read and reread and listen to and relisten to both the book and the CD and encourage my wife to go thru them and with the kids and may give it to some of their coaches.  This book is a blockbuster in my mind and will change many things for those who read it and put the principles to work purposefully and understandingly [most people put these principles to work they just dont do it purposefully or fully understaningly].

B00330UFQS|5.0|The first time I heard Lady Antebellum was only a few weeks ago, and I am totally hooked. When I first heard \\"Need You Now\\" I had to download it. I then downloaded the  first album and I'm here to tell you that the \\"Need You Know\\" album is just as good as the debut album.    The first song I listened to was \\"American Honey\\" and it gave me goosebumps. This song really takes advantage of Hilary Scott's unique sound. Right then and there I knew that buying this whole album was worth it.    I've clicked through most of the other songs, but haven't fully enjoyed each song to comment on them, but I'm anxious to listen to this album all day - and then update this review later.    I guess you could say that this album is one of those that you just have to listen to, to fully comprehend it. Good music can  be so hard to describe in a way that someone else can understand. And if you're reading this on the album release date, take advantage of the 1-day sale!    UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:  The last track on the album \\"Ready to Love Again\\" has the familiar Lady Antebellum sound from the first album, but the song is just a repeated set of notes and chords that often befalls bands that release multiple albums. I really enjoy this track.    I'm sure most listeners of Lady Antebellum have already heard the title track \\"Need You Now\\" and I think it serves as a great bridge between their first album and the second. This song, and album feels a bit more refined (albeit with a few tracks that feel a bit too commercially-produced for Lady Antebellum). You get a feeling that this band loves to write great music. I certainly feel that way.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|There is a proverb that best describes this Seth's book: \\"Trust in yourself and in your horse\\". This is the same as when Jeff Jarvis said that is time of mass niches and not of mass of workers in factories. ICT opens up new jobs and new opportunities for niche. Once the ground was enough for many peasant niche. Today, the ICT platform suitable for many Web 2.0 niche. Our faith in ourselves is our niche.<br />Why I gave a 4? Because of this, as Seth's writing has a way of marketing: to repeat and repeat and repeat a single thought in the whole book again and again and again and again only with other words and sentences structures.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|In my opinion, there are 2 types of scary movies that are commonly produced: Bloody slasher movies and creepy movies.  This movie definitely falls into the 'creepy' category.  Rather than explicitly showing you or explaining everything about what's going on, this movie relies on suspense and imagination, hinting at what's happening and leaving the rest up to your imagination.  In my opinion, that technique is far more effective in providing a creepy experience than a bloody slasher movie.  As another reviewer (James Morris) has said, movies that let you use your own imagination can often be far more scary than movies that explicitly show everything, because when you use your imagination, your mind draws on your worst fears.  This is the type of movie that may leave you nervous/scared for a while after you've finished watching it.    I particularly like the use of audio in this movie.  The use of audio is particularly effective during the creepy scenes.    I often see this movie compared to [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], but I think the feel of this movie is more along the lines of [[ASIN:B00005JNNT White Noise]].
0385504225|3.0|This is pretty standard Dan Brown fare. The book is well written in terms of style, sequence and content-arrangement, and Brown's background in formal academic writing comes through clearly. If you have read thrillers from the likes of Clive Cussler, James Rollins, Tom Clancy et al, you'll notice the superior writing style and character definition; no cheesy contemporary jokes or steely eyed, larger than life heroes or other macho BS to make you groan. The downside seems to be that the book seems unnecessarily inflated with a lot of pointless chapters that add no value (perhaps to make it easier for the inevitable screenplay?).    'The Lost Symbol' starts off reasonably well and carries the plot well - initially. A third of the way in however, you start to guess the identity of the villain but dismiss it as being too far-fetched. But, like many of Brown's earlier books, the ending does seem far-fetched, and a bit lame after all the initial build up.     Also, Brown seems to be smitten by the Freemasons; after about 200 pages of non-stop vindication of everything the Masons may or may not have done that was perceived as evil (I wasn't aware that they were such a controversial bunch!), I was getting a little tired of hearing how the Masons were all-knowing and seemed to have answers to all of life's questions!     Brown also seems to be under the impression that his readers are looking for existential answers and for the true meaning of God in his books. Sadly this reader was just looking for a good thriller, nothing more.

1591843162|5.0|The premise of the book is to help us discover the answer to the question, \\"where does success come from?\\" Not to be left out, the question we never seem to care about, but is always there, \\"where does average come from?\\" is answered to help give us a frame of reference. Don't be shocked if you recognize the answer.    Right from the start, Seth's assertion is that the choice to be a Linchpin is our choice. It's not that we can't be remarkable, it's that we choose not to be. And it's not that we came to this choice lightly, it's that we have had that choice drummed into us through years of school and work, because that was what works for us. Be good at your job, do what you're told, and everything will be okey-dokey (my word). Because that is no longer true (check your 201k), we may need to reevaluate our choice.    What's great about this book:  This isn't your typical business or marketing book (not that any of his books are typical). In this case, it's about focusing on your own value within the organization, and how you have the choice to shape that value.   Their are interesting real-world examples, like a company responding to Twitter complaints and finally having a face, and the riff about needing more cowbell.    Limiting Factors:  If you're happy (or satisfied) in your current rut, this book may anger you, or at least make you think you should do more when you don't want to.  This could be another \\"have to put it down to make notes\\" book.    Great Quotes:  \\"`Not My Job' - Three words [that] can kill an entire organization\\"  \\"All I wanted to do in this book was sell you on being the artist you already are\\"   \\"You don't need more genius. You need less resistance.\\"    Recommendations:  This book is an excellent eye-opener, and if you live on a planet with a bad economy, this book is a must read. Of course, if your the one dude out there who can't be laid off, outsourced, or reorganized, just get it for the entertainment value.  [..]
1591843162|5.0|Seth's most noble endeavor so far.  This man really wants to help change our world, and our thinking, for our own betterment.  I love the book and what it says, but then I'm already converted.  I already operate my life with the principles he lays out in Linchpin.  However, I don't think I'm who the book is meant for...it's meant for the unconverted. However, I'm afraid we're in the classic \\"You can lead a horse to water...\\" scenario.  The possibilities for people and their futures are out there, and Linchpin as a guide will likely prove indispensable to those who are eager to drink.  But will the people who so desperately need to drink, and drink deep from this book actually do it?  On their own, or even with a little encouragement?  I'm sad to say that I don't think so.  I think it's either in you, or it's not, and save for the few on the cusp, this book -- as noble, right and proper as it is -- is trying to push a boulder up a hill.  I laud and respect the hell out of Seth for this.  And I don't care that I think it's a bit of a futile journey, as ultimately I do believe this will help save the few that WANT to be saved.  The rest will continue to eat bad food, drink megasize sodas, drink too much cheap beer, party on the weekends with their jetskiing/dunebuggying/motocrossing/motorcycling friends, do what the TV tells, them, overspend on image brands, and remain uninspired in their jobs.  I don't think they want to be saved.  Or perhaps they're just too afraid.  But that's not going to stop me from buying ten copies of Linchpin and trying.  After all, like Seth, we HAVE to try.  I am willing to fail, but I'm not willing not to try.
0545123267|4.0|I thought the book was great.  The plot was well thought out and made you sit on the edge of your seat towards the last 1/4 of the book.  The plot is told from both POVs which makes it REALLY interesting at times.  I usually don't read these sort of books that are told by characters way younger than me, but the plot seemed pretty different so I picked it up.  Some parts of the book break your heart, throw the book in a fire, jump and scream in joy, or show the book to everyone you know to read.   The only reason it's not 5 stars for me is because the writing wasn't very complex.  It was a very simple read and I finished it in about a day and a half.  So if you're looking for a book that's exciting, romantic, and a quick read then I strongly suggest this for you.
B00110K62U|3.0|First off, I was happy to receive this item so quickly. It took less than a week to get it. The only real complaint I have is that it isn't the actual movie. This is Les Mis set on a stage with a row of microphones at the very front that the actors come up and sing into. I didn't understand this I guess. I thought that I was buying either the movie or a real stage production of the show. I LOVE Les Mis and  it is a good quality but not what I was expecting at all.
1591843162|4.0|There are two chapters in Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?, marketing genius Seth Godin's book, that you should go out and read immediately--even if you have to do it standing up in the bookstore.<br /><br />The first is a stunning tour de force on Resistance, the bane of all artists and people who would create things that change the world.<br /><br />Resistance is the voice that tells you to hit the snooze button instead of getting up to work on your vocal technique before you go to your Stupid Day Job. It's the evil spirit that lures you to the TV and computer, whispering understanding nothings about how you're so tired, you deserve a night off, watching reality TV or aimlessly surfing the Internet. It's what makes you choose consuming stuff over making stuff, and it is relentless in its pursuit of you as unproductive, timid, obedient sloth.<br /><br />The second must-read chapter is the shortest in the book but the one I feel may be even more important to you in your scary, brave, wonderful life as an artist: \\"There Is No Map.\\"<br /><br />As in, no one can tell you how you will succeed in your artist's career. Not me, not Seth, not your teacher. Not any of the wonderful sources of advice you turn to for guidance, for illumination, on which is the best option out of a vexing array of options, and certainly not any of the evil ones. The best anyone who has succeeded can do is to explain what worked for them, but guess what? It will not work for you. Some of it may, but not all of it. Never all of it. Because not only is each of us a special snowflake, but the time in which we fall from the sky to the ground is different, as are wind conditions, temperature and myriad other factors.<br /><br />There is much goodness on fear, art and the necessity of putting aside the former to create the latter throughout the book. Working artists will be familiar with much of it, but can always use a good reminder (remember those two chapters I mentioned up top?).<br /><br />The greater group of beneficiaries of this book (in number, that is) will be those brave free-thinkers currently ensconced in sleepy organizations across the corporate world.

1591843162|5.0|If you have ever wanted to meet Seth Godin and ask him to spend a few hours with you and be your personal coach, then get this book.   In 'Linchpin,' in the conversational style of his blog and TED videos, Mr. Godin encourages readers to embrace their particular talents, be generous with them, and get moving, either in their current jobs or in better, more soul-satisfying livelihoods. In the midst of our soulsapping cost-slashing dog-eat-dog economy, there is a warm little place where people are willing to pay more to get more, and it is getting bigger all the time. The people who are poised to take advantage of this are willing to put more of their heart, or their art, into their work and willing to be generous at all times, even if it is not in their job description. These are the people he calls Linchpins - and you already know many of them. They are the ones who are willing to go out on a limb, to serve others, who go the extra mile, who put their heart into their work, and make a difference. While there are a lot of these people leading and serving at our schools, places of worship, and community organizations, there should be more of them at the workplace, and at all levels, not just upper management. Linchpins are poised to succeed on the job, or in work of their own making. If you aren't in a work environment where the extra oomph you can put into your work isn't rewarded or rewarding - then find a new work environment.  Mr. Godin explains the traits of a linchpin, tells you how to ignore your critics and get out of your own way, and encourages you to make something happen. He can't give you specifics - the journey is the important part, and only you can know what yours is. However, he is adamant that the world needs you to bring your special gifts to the table. An inspiring book.
B002UJIY70|3.0|After reviewing for 8 years, it seems few films incite me to say much anymore, even those I really like.  Though I ultimately enjoyed A Perfect Getaway, I guess it's one of those rarities that manages to bring out the worst in me.  But, I'll try to keep my criticism brief.<br /><br />Someone needs to teach the screenwriter that lying to your audience for two thirds of the film and then changing your story does not constitute a plot-twist.  It's just plain lazy writing that disparages the audiences willing suspension of disbelief.  The films direction moves what is ultimately a very trite canard with intrigue, lots of eye-candy, and gory intensity; and it commendably tries to make up for the unfounded absurdity of the plot.  The casting is also absolutely perfect for a story reliant on such blatant misdirection.  And the writing isn't all bad.  There's some fun banter; it just doesn't quite make up for the abuse of trust that befalls the stories plot.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, the presentation is exceptionally crisp and dynamic with a somewhat exaggerated color palete typical of the post production sensibilities of many modern films.  And I didn't detect any distracting ailments of compression.  The inclusion of the theatrical cut seems a little pointless, but it's good to see Universal making the effort.  There wasn't much point to the discs only physical extra, the unscripted original ending, as it's basically the same ending as in both versions of the film, minus the epilogue.<br /><br />One last word of warning: for any Blu-ray owners with players slower than the PS3 (ie. all older players and many newer ones, including most, if not all, Panasonic players), due to Universal's exploitive use of BD Live for self-promotive advertising, this is a VERY slow loading disc.
0446567337|4.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel that I've read (although I've seen all of the movies based on his books) and I found it quite good with a few minor annoyances.  I found Savannah to be way too goody-two-shoes for my liking and found her obnoxious at times.  I understand the point being that she had strong moral values, but sometimes I wanted to roll my eyes at whatever came out of her mouth.<br /><br />I feel that the arguments they had were petty and overly dramatic and for the most part both of their reactions to their conflicts made them look like real jerks, to put it mildly.  Much of the end of the book was pretty easy to guess what would happen next (*SPOILER* I predicted who her husband was and that John would sell the coins to help them).<br /><br />Aside from those things, overall I really enjoyed the book.  It was quick, easy reading and a heartwarming story.  I might be in the minority but I am glad that the ending wasn't a typical fairy tale ending (at least not for John).  There's plenty of that in most other stories so the change is welcome, and it was written so that nothing was left desired...all plot lines were closed beautifully.<br /><br />I have to say that I am mildly disappointed they've decided to cast a blonde actress for the film adaption (Savannah was brunette in the book) since I'm on team brunette!  I just hope the movie lives up to the book in every other way.
0385504225|1.0|On the one hand, you are tempted to think that this \\"novel\\" is really a thinly-veiled screenplay: in reading it, one can imagine the stars who are intended to be cast: Hanks, of course, probably Morgan Freeman as the Capitol Architect, etc.      On the other hand, this book is so numbingly boring that it is difficult to see how ANY director---even one much more talented than Opie---could turn this vehicle into something that anyone could possibly sit through for two hours.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Seriously, this movie contains one of the most scathing critiques of consumerism ever to be seen in a movie--and it's a kid's film!      The ending is a bit optimistic for my taste (frankly, I can't imagine the humans depicted in the film could survive for a day on post-apocalyptic Earth), but, as I said, it's a kids film.      I have seen this movies dozens of times, at the request of my four year-old son, and it wears surprisingly well through repeat viewings.  I notice something new every time I see it.  Also, the lack of dialogue gives me ample opportunity to discuss the movie and it's themes with my son.  Highly recommended.
1591843162|5.0|It's not about the Answers.  Many books have their opinions of the answers about career, finding your purpose, self-marketing strategies, etc., etc, etc. And, some of them are very good. You get the forms, the formulas, and the tactics. But this book is about the Questions you ask yourself.  As Winston Churchill said, \\"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.\\"  Seth brings us the right questions to ask ourselves when you are looking to launch our working life, in the midst of a career change, frustrated or elated by the last promotion that you got or didn't get. More importantly, a question to ask every moment you are acting from who you are, not just what you do. They are questions that allow the most difficult thing in the world - to change your definition of yourself.    The book is not all atta-boy/gal or feel good.  While Seth Godin builds the picture of the industrial model, it was difficult for me to reconcile my pride in this country's success in building companies.  While it is ok to recognize that the workers on my father's Henry Ford assembly line were little more than high-performing robots (and in many cases have been replaced by one,) it took some patience to listen until I found that the assembly line works can too be indispensable.  Cold hard facts, not sugar-coating economic realities, must be told before you can create the possibility of approaching the issue another way.    This is a book that gives you the opportunity to ask Big Questions. They can be the koans or mantras to hold in your mind as you approach your job and your life.  Most of all, this book might really matter. It might just make a small change in the way you live your life.

B002DKF47O|5.0|I first saw the group in a local rock magazine who carried one of the artwork found in the album booklet as their centerspread. seeing them i though 'boy another black metal band'. i was so wrong. unfortunately not many metal albums are available in india and when i found that this album was available as a special edition for india only i decided more out of curiosity to buy it rather than for the music.<br /><br />man was i blown away or what. right from the first track to the last, it just kept me glued to their music, every bit of musical detail from their simple guitar riffs and drum beats to the the more complex compositions, i just couldnt afford to miss any. i could classify them as 'blackened tech death metal', if such exists. the lyrical inspirations and the songs all have the typical black metal influences but the buck doesnt stop there. it shows a band that has deep knowledge on the dark and an amazing lyrical prowess. and their song compositions are absolutely brilliant. dark, heavy, epic.<br /><br />from the bands that i have heard i could say they are like a satyricon, cryptopsy and mastodon mix in their blackness, technical level and song compositions (in that order). i couldnt put down the album and the host of goodies i got along with the special ed only added to the enthralling experience.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|I am very, very disappointed with this movie. The way people talk, it was like this movie was going to change everything about movies. I guess in some ways it did, and in others it failed miserably.    Let me say I've been a big fan of James Cameron until his last few movies. I grew up in the 80's, and he did change film making in the 1980's. From Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2. Those movies influenced many people and movies. Sadly the last three films True Lies, Titanic and Avatar have failed or maybe succeeded. I guess it depends on your point of view. What is more important to you a good story and great acting or amazing visuals/action that will blow you away, because that will blow you away. If you are looking for the latter than this is the movie for your.    I don't know what's wrong with Cameron, maybe it's the writers he has but I believe he wrote the story for all his movies. The early ones from Terminator to Terminator 2 all had interesting stories and characters and were able to blend it together with great visuals. So I don't know what's wrong with him, except maybe he's lost his touch.    Oh yes the review for the movie.    First of the good: Simply the visuals/action, it was absolutely amazing. The world and life he created is stunning. Do I think he will change film making with what he's done with this heck yes. The world comes alive and you feel it. Sadly that's the only thing alive in this movie and leaves me thinking what could have been.    Now for the bad:    Story: It's absolutely terrible. It's essentially what we(The Europeans) did to the native Americans of North and South America. This story has been done many times over and much, much better. Also the anti-American/imperialism is rampant through this movie. I can understand if Cameron wanted to make some kind of statement, he just should have done a better job of it.    Characters: Thanks to the left-wing story, the characters are cardboard cut outs and uninteresting. Fromthe company man who only cares about the making money and nothing else. The evil colonel who thinks the indigenous population are nothing but savages and hold no value. To the stereotypical Indians(The Na'vi). I mean some on it is down right laughable. The only characters that interested me were Trudy(Michelle Rodriguez) and Grace(Sigourney Weaver), but they were stuck to the back ground.    So overall if you enjoy nothing but great action/visuals/special effects this movie is for you, but if you also enjoy a good story and interesting characters this movie isn't for you and will leave you disappointed.    It left me wondering what could have been. What if this movie had a decent story interesting characters and good directing. Than I truly believe this movie would have been one for the ages and people would be talking about decades from now.

B00000HZH7|4.0|i had heard so much about this album. every top 10 lists that i had researched on metal invariably had this album. while most of the reviews on the album was a 4 star the biggest gripe was the sound quality or the lack of it. so when i saw one at the local store (i thought i would never see one on retail shelves) i was in two minds whether to buy it or not. but i decided to anyway.<br /><br />the edition i got was a deluxe edition with re-mastered soundtracks. the packing was so brilliant that if i unfolded the entire case, it turned out to be an inverted cross (like what you see on their cover). and there were bonus material in the form of added tracks, images etc. the re-mastering of the tracks have been done well i guess, it sounded great.<br /><br />while i am not going to comment much on the music since it has been so well documented before but if you purchase let it be this edition. it makes owing the classic all the more enjoyable.

B002ZG997C|5.0|Let me first say I am by no means religious. In fact I would define my self as agnostic. I believe there is a higher power, I just don't believe in organized religion. I don't believe you need a church or a book to believe in a god or a higher power. I think all you need is faith, and that comes from within. Now I have no ill will toward religion as a whole. It can be used for great good. Giving people without hope, hope. Giving people the will to live and helping people do great things for the benefit of humanity. It can also used for great evil as all religions have done throughout the centuries, and I think that is ultimately the message I think the film conveys.    The Book of Eli is a religious movie that hides behind a post apocalyptic, western theme. Which follows Eli(Denzel Washington) as he wanders the wasteland heading west carrying the last remaining bible looking for the right person to give it to. On his journey west he comes to a town run by Carnegie(Gary Oldman) who so happens to be looking for a copy of the bible, so he can use it for his own means. Which puts the two at odds with each other, and with the add of Solara(Mila Kunis) the two go on the run. The climax and the twist near the end you will never see coming.    The acting  was brilliant. Washington and Oldman as usual do outstanding jobs. The supporting cast did a great job from Mila Kunis(who I thought was great.) to Ray Stevenson(Punisher: War Zone), Jennifer Beals(Lie To Me), and Malcolm McDowell(Heros and Fall Out 3).    The visuals were superbly done giving life to the pos apocalyptic world. You can imagine that's what the world would look like after a nuclear war, though they never say what caused the world to come to be except a war.    The directing by the The Hughes Brothers was well done. They haven't directed many movies. The only other one of their movies I've seen is From Hell which I personally loved. So from the two movies I've seen of theirs they are really good directors  who should get more work.    Overall this is the best film I've seen since Zombieland, and unlike the other recent movies I've seen The Book of Eli blends story with a message, acting, action, directing, and visuals perfectly. Out of all the movies out there right now this is by far the best, and I highly recommend it, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I recently brought this video because between happy weight, cruise weight, holiday weight etc I needed something that will get me in shape and affective. I am extremely busy, haven't worked out in a long while and with my schedule it is very hard to go running in the early morning and I get home by dark to run in the evening. I def. do not want to waste money at the gym right now due to my schedule and commitment, so when reading the reviews about the 30 Day Dhred I figure I will give it a try.     After my first try at the video I was very surprise. I use to run track a long while ago but still can handle some workout to a certain extent. There are 3 levels to this video and all are 20 min long. I thought I would make it through the 1st level easy... man was I wrong. I was so impress how the 20 min workout Jillian did completely worked all areas of my body WELL. I know how to workout and know when I get a good workout. This video is a challenge and gives an excellent workout in your own home. Its great for crazy schedules, bad weather etc. If you push as hard as you can to make it completely through you will feel like you came from the gym (probably a better workout then you give yourself at the gym consistently). Its a challenge but be consist and you will see results. VERY IMPRESSED. Going on my 3rd week and my body has already changed and I am still trying to complete level 1 without stopping.
B00275EGWY|5.0|The Hurt Locker is an artistic thriller about a trio of bomb defusers in war-torn Iraq. I use the term \\"artistic\\" because, rather than have a conventional 1-2-3 plot and a jingoistic, war-is-hell undertone, this film brilliantly combines moments of incredible suspense with scene after scene of rare restraint and perception. The film ostensibly is about what the men encounter during their last 35 days or so of their rotation, but goes deeper towards showing the cumulative effect of war on the once normal psyche, in its terrifying as well as intoxicating aspects. Upon first viewing the film I was waiting for the hook, the story, to get going, and was let down after one didn't show itself. As the film progresses, however, you realize that that wasn't its intention, but rather to show the situation in the Middle East with a calmly observant eye. From that tableau we become attuned to the thoughts and drives of the characters in a way not often experienced in a film, to the point where their silences tell you everything you need to know. Not to say that this is a quiet film, for the great majority of it are masterful scenes of direction, acting, and editing that create suspenseful scenes of conflict that are as exciting as anything you're likely to see in a film. This isn't standard war fare, but reaches deeper and gets in your head and stays there. One of the best films of the year, The Hurt Locker is worth many repeated viewings.

1591843162|5.0|As one of the linchpins at a custom software consulting company, this book resonated with me deeply.  Reading this book 6 years ago would have accelerated some of my more reluctant decisions to step forward and act like a leader.  I'm having a hard time figuring out whether I should hand this book to my business partner or our most senior employee next. Instead, I'll probably just buy the book for everyone in the company. It's an inspiring read for anyone who aspires to make an impact.
1591843162|5.0|This book brings together many thoughts we have about business, life, people, purpose, mission, execution and evolution. The why, what and how of it all...<br /><br />Seth pulled it all together and wrapped it up in words...  We appreciate you Seth!
1591843162|5.0|If you have read his other best sellers, you will be sure to enjoy this quick, well organized summary on what is wrong in the work environment, how we got here, and what we can do to change it. As always, Seth leaves it up to the reader to make the choice.
1591843162|5.0|Full disclosure: I got an advance copy of Linchpin for donating Acumen Fund.<br /><br />Linchpin was a treat to read.  It's not only what is said, but how it is said and brought together.  The book is focused on you and making you the best person possible so that you can find fulfillment in work and in life and contribute your best gifts to society.  Seth Godin is passionate about this and even going into the psychology of the fear that holds you back from your potential - he calls it the resistance.<br /><br />Linchpin starts by explaining the current situation - being good enough or even above average is no longer good enough in a world when companies can have the best from anywhere.  If you aren't convinced the book gives plenty of evidence.  But instead of whining Godin lays out a better path, focusing on your opportunity to become an artist.<br /><br />A good part of the book explains what an artist is, what it takes, how you develop those skills, and why it so important that you do - for yourself and for the good of society.  Godin talks about emotional labor - giving of yourself, connecting with another person - not for a return but as a gift.  This is the essence of an artist - and it benefits the receiver and the giver.  This isn't to say you don't get paid (in fact you will get paid more because your work will be better) - only that you value what you do too.<br /><br />Importantly, Linchpin points out that there is no map, no set path - that is the whole point.  A linchpin creates values, sees connections, and brings people together fully leveraging their expert knowledge in an area or areas.  You have to develop the talent, the right attitude, and keep on learning.  Linchpin has a great quote from Ralph Emerson's Self-Reliance which fits perfectly.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Was introduced to Joe Bonamassa's music about five years ago. Have been hooked ever since. He is arguably the greatest guitar player of the current generation of (under 40) guitar players. He explores variations of guitar playing and should be mentioned in the same breath as Eric Johnson as well as Eric Clapton for creativity. Going to see him this March in Fort Worth at Bass Hall. Can't wait to hear the acoustic version \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" and then the hard bass rhythm of Ballad of John Henry. This DVD of his concert at Royal Albert Hall should be in your collection.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Zev Toledano has provided a detailed and accurate information about this series of documentary from the BBC, which aired in the UK BBC HD Channel. I am lucky enough to record and have just finish watching the first episode tonight. You have to give credit to the quality of this production and I fully appreciate the effort the BBC crew went through during the 3 years shooting for this production. Life  revels some of the world's first filmed footages and is filled with thrills and surprises. I have always preferred BBC productions over Discovery or National Geographic mainly due to the coherence of the program without annoying commercial inserts and time wasting recaps, original scores and music and master editing skills that is easy to follow and understand, and there is also Sir David Attenborough, whose narrative skill is the perfect match for the science and nature genre. I cannot wait for its Blu-Ray release and put this into my personal BBC collection.

1401323820|1.0|This review pertains to the audiobook.My husband and I love the show and he read and loved the book. [He would give the book 5 stars ]Since I prefer to listen to audiobooks I looked really forward to this one.The reader is however HORRIBLE. His voice is monotone and can put you to sleep. I could not follow what he was saying. I stopped listening after the first disc.He is the WORST reader I ever heard.
0618918248|5.0|I would say this book gels together all the random thoughts I had about how religion is truly a threat to the future of humankind.  Being brought up catholic, I went through a journey of questioning and re-examining my childhood indoctrination and belief system.  Prof. Dawkins' book has given a lot of legitimacy to non-belief and encourages fence sitters to \\"come out of the closet\\", and be proud of rejecting superstition, and be finally free from mind-control.  I don't recall who actually said this (my apologies to the author), but the following statement is quite true (albeit satirical):  What is the difference between a cult and a religion?  Answer: A religion has more members and real estate!  :)
1591843162|5.0|As a longtime student of Sociology and Culture, I was thrilled to find out that while Godin does address the reader personally, the linchpin theory is really more about how we view our role in our tribes, or culture.  As one who has forever been trying to fit my somewhat oddball and gangly self into a pre-defined role, I am even more thrilled, ecstatic even, to learn, that that is now, finally, a good thing!<br /><br />Linchpin explains, and then encourages readers to re-define how we view work.  We are more creative than most of us give ourselves credit for.  This is a good thing, because, according to Godin, that is what society is screaming for!  He challenges us to break the mold in our working lives and learn to express ourselves  and approach our work creatively:  how that is in itself our gift to the world.  Managers and bosses for the most part, I think, may at first scoff at his ideas, but collectively, if we all begin to show the goodness we have to give individually, creatively, perhaps the shining moment we tend to dream about may come to fruition... on a regular basis! Not only that, but society as a whole as well as individual bosses will benefit, including those who hold the thumb of control on the current work ethic we have all been trained to follow.  It simply is not enough anymore to be \\"normal'.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book for anyone, no matter what role or rung on the company ladder you currently inhabit.  The whole picture is changing, and ladders will soon be the way of the past.  Start building your own steps and see where the company goes with you as their linchpin!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|A rather interesting proposition mixing up racism and superstition with the added element of some outer-space alien refugees. The main character was a bit annoying at the beginning, but turns out to be the hero in the end. Some shaky handicam moments (which I generally dislike), but did not detract from the brilliance of the movie.
1591843162|5.0|If you continue to think the same way about your job, you are on the road to extinction.  Anyone who has been downsized or restructured out of a position is well aware of this.  Mr. Godin creates a compelling argument that a paradigm shift is required to successfully navigate your career.  Entitlements are no more.  You control your destiny and in order to succeed you need to \\"Create Art\\" in everything that you do for yourself and your employer.  It is a motivating and satisfying book to read - I highly recommend it.  Don't settle for being a cog!
B001GCUO4S|3.0|Probably the weakest of the series, but watchable.  The kills weren't as creative as its predecessors.  Time to retire this series!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I love it! The Godfather Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD is incredible.  It looks and sounds much better than the old Godfather DVD Collection which was released in 2001 a.  The colors on on the new Godfather Giftset DVD are more lighter and brighter and the sounds are remastered so the DVD would sound more better than the previous godfather DVD collection. The Godfather Coppola Restoration has five discs which disc four has the original special features from the previous Godfather DVD collection.  Disc 5 has new special features like the Godfather World which they talk the phenomenal godfather movies had impacted on our culture for many years on other filmmakers.I have to say that they really did a good job on making these godfather movies look and sound much better. I highly recommend that you should add this on your DVD collection and compared to your old Godfather DVD collection.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Somewhat akin to Joshua, this movie started out somewhat slow but built up momentum towards the second half of the movie.  It's worth watching some of the deleted scenes and the alternate ending.  Not something you would want to watch if you're considering adopting a child!

0393327655|5.0|This very readable exposé is written in a witty, wry, matter-of-fact, satirical, and sardonic fashion that Sam Harris can only execute.  Did I miss any adjectives?  A must-read for all on the current state of affairs on how religions have pushed us back into the Dark Ages.  And don't forget his follow-up to this book, Letter To A Christian Nation which addresses all the hate mail that he received after his book was released.

1591843162|5.0|Linchpin has me thinking about my work, indispensable colleagues and how to be truly valuable to my cause in entirely new ways. It is the most motivating book I've read in a long while. And, in a nice bonus, it includes a picture of my colleague Charles Ball at Network for Good in the inside cover, where there is a hall of fame of linchpins.<br /><br />As Seth Godin is gifted at doing, he puts his finger on some vital truths that we all may have sensed at certain moments but that haven't been able to grap on a conscious level, articulate fully or act upon. If you are someone in a hurry to do good in this world, read this book because it will encourage you to pursue that goal in a way that makes a far bigger difference for you, your organization and the world. It will help you break out of the email inbox, the fear of failure and the spinning of wheels and galvanize you to pursue your genius instincts. In short, it's a good kick in the butt and shot of bravery for the start of the new year.<br /><br />Here are some key ideas from the book:<br /><br />1. The people of greatest value in this economy and to your organization are linchpins. A linchpin is a person who walks into chaos, creates order and invents, connects, creates and makes things happen. People who work automatically, by rote and define what is and is not their job are disposable.<br /><br />2. The \\"makes things happen\\" part of being a linchpin is critical. It's not enough to be an artiste. Or a genius. You actually have to produce and deliver. The difference between a successful artist and a failed one is what happens after the idea is hatched. The difference is the race to completion. Don't just be an idea person. Be an implement-the-idea-fast person. As Seth says (and I love this):<br /><br />Wait! Are you saying that I have to be someone who dreams up new ideas AND makes them real? Someone who finds new ways to interact, new pathways to deliver emotion, new ways to connect? Someone who acts like a human, not a cog? Yes.<br /><br />3. Do all of this in a generous way. Don't be a linchpin with an eye toward getting but rather with a mindset of giving. Approach your work as if you were giving the gift of yourself each day. Approach your customers (or donors!) with gratitude in your heart rather than dollars signs in your eyes.<br /><br />Number three is so important to our sector. Seth says there are three ways to think about gifts:<br /><br />1) Give me a gift!<br />2) Here's a gift. Now you owe me, big time.<br />3) Here's a gift, I love you.<br /><br />Stick to #3. It's good for your career, it's good for your organization and it's good for the greater good.<br /><br />Thank you, Seth, for reminding us of how important it is - especially for those of us working for good causes - to approach our work with vigor, rigor and generosity!s in a generous way.

B002DW92T8|4.0|Although the meat of this book is in the first half, I still think its worth checking out.  Some of the comments from Pink's last book was a lack of specific evidence.  I think he does done a good job at articulating evidence in this book.  You can argue that Pink may not have included the right evidence or that perhaps what Pink is explaining is not completely new but the book helped me think critically about what motivation means.  His TED speech goes into Autonomy and overall he is a great speaker.  I know he may be for the most part highlighting things some people already know but his style of writing is interesting.     This is a good book for those that enjoy someone who helps them think differently.  The book is not a how-to for motivation or a book that sets out to define motivation in all its parts by a majority of experts.  Rather, its a high level of some great work in social psychology and how that work can be used in today's businesses.
B0011NVCSO|4.0|This is a great album to listen to in the fall time with (depending on where you live) all the changing colors and falling leaves.  The singers voice is very interesting in my opinion and the album as a whole really grows on you.  When I first heard it, I thought it was okay but every time I listen to it I like it more and more.    My one complaint is that it is a VERY short album.  My friend burned me this album along with the \\"Blood Bank\\" B-side an extra amazing B-side that is not-titled and I have no idea where it came from.  So I combine all the song together on my ipod to create, what I think, is a more complete album.    Is this the greatest album of all time?  By no means, no.  However, there is a lot of passion in it and it is a very unique piece of music.  Let me put it this way, if I were only allowed to own 100 albums, this would for sure be in the list.
1591843162|5.0|If you're wondering why you haven't completed that project you were all jacked up to do, or why you haven't received that promotion at work (or getting the heck out of there like you promised you would), or why you seem to always be getting these 'great ideas' and doing nothing about them; then read this book. I've read many of Seth's books and subscribe to his blog so I've admittedly joined the Tribe. This book does not fit neatly into a slot between Cows and Sundae or Tip and Tribes. It's different. The tone and the message are much more personal and insistent. Whatever you do, get your eyeballs on pages 101-149. Don't resist.
1591843162|5.0|Seth uses the lizard brain as a linchpin concept in LINCHPIN. Think of your lizard brain as resistance, Godin says. You have to mindfully push through the resistance. Thus, pretend everything you are writing is a draft. Ship (or publish or present) whatever you've set as your end goal EVEN IF it's not perfect. He writes page after page to articulate this idea, prodding us to give up all our excuses. He's spot on at enumerating the excuses. Like many other folks, I use so many of them: the idea isn't good enough, I'll wait until tomorrow, I'll check what's happening on Twitter, etc.<br /><br />But here's what stopped me cold on page 131:<br /><br />He writes: \\"I stopped writing this book a dozen times. Each time, the force that got me to pick it up again was the resistance. I realized that my lizard brain was afraid of this book, which is the best reason I can think of to write it.\\"<br /><br />Now there's an admission I haven't heard before from Seth Godin. Writing a book is very very hard. He has pumped out so many he makes it look effortless. Somehow that admission gives me huge courage. Kudos, Seth, for pushing through, finding your most authentic voice and writing an uncannily provocative and inspiring book. This one's a game changer.
B001MW0J2O|2.0|I couldn't agree more with the average reviewer's reasons for why they love (or hate) Merriweather Post Pavilion. It pushes the boundaries of what qualifies as music today. Love (or hate) this album, you are challenged by it. Sonically well crafted, the album is kind of like an abstract painting of music. Sure, the artists probably loaded every last second and every single sound with meaning and purpose, and you, the listener may or may not be able to identify it. Like that same abstract painting, you'll probably know very quickly (i.e. with one listen) whether or not you love it or hate it.    Your potential reactions to Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion:    1. \\"OMG - best album of 2009!\\"  2. \\"Random trash....terrible!\\"  3. \\"I don't get it....but I'll keep listening and trying!\\"  4. \\"I don't get it....and I'm not willing to put the effort into trying.\\"    My personal reaction? I think it's crap, and barely qualifies as music, much less good music. There's a couple good songs, such as \\"Bluish\\", but nothing to make me care.     While I, as another reviewer suggested, can't name 500 albums better than this from 2009, I can name a few, and I'll even try to stick in \\"Indie-land\\", since that will obviously be the only people reading this review, and any non-indie album I name will instantly destroy any indie cred I may have.    In no particular order....    Cymbals Eat Guitars - Why There Are Mountains  The Antlers - Hospice  Passion Pit - Manners  The Pains of Being Pure at Heart - The Pains of Being Pure at Heart  Atlas Sound - Logos  Japandroids - Post-Nothing  St. Vincent - Actor (saw her in concert, so I get the whole \\"weird artist\\" thing)  Yeah Yeah Yeahs - It's Blitz!  Great Northern - Remind Me Where the Light Is  Fever Ray - Fever Ray (So I get ambient sounds and unusual singing)  Phoenix - Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (my personal favorite)  Bat For Lashes - Two Suns (also great)  Grizzly Bear - Veckatimest (Rewards you with further listening, unlike this album)  Dirty Projectors - Bitte Orca  Modest Mouse - No One's First and Your Next  Yacht - See Mystery Lights  Sunset Rubdown - Dragonslayer  Beirut - March of the Zapotec    There - hope I stayed \\"Indie\\" enough for you, and gave you a list of a lot better music to listen to before you come to Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion. Enjoy!    And if you love this album, don't get mad.....lots of people hate some of the art I love, too.
1591843162|5.0|I believe Seth Godin is fighting a good fight with Linchpin.    He offers up direction and encouragement for a society where work has become a process for producing inexpensive commodities...where imagination and authenticity have been subsumed by policy and bureaucracy...where art goes to die.    Seth has helped me don the mantle of artist with pride, even confidence. My work is my palette and I've stopped coloring in the lines. The effects were almost immediate...and very rewarding.    Seth's analysis of the 'gift' as a social construct is fascinating. The value of a gift, it's rise and fall (and rise, again) was the most profound and encouraging part of Linchpin, for me. It helped me re-align my work efforts and, suddenly, the network I had been building began to gain momentum. I had to make it a gift, first.    This is Seth's best book, to date. I highly recommend it as a gift to yourself. When you become a Linchpin you'll become a gift to your entire tribe.
0143038583|5.0|In The Omnivore's Dilemma, Michael Pollan explores the current landscape of procuring food in America by actively tracing four meals, through intermediary energy forms, to the ultimate source of their energy, the sun.  He explicates all processes and their consequences with regards to creating meals from McDonald's, Whole Foods (big industrial organic), a self-sustained farm, and one that he obtained every component of himself (hunting and gathering).        His active investigative journalism as well as his open mind and willingness to learn leads him to experience firsthand the food creation process by participating in all methods of creating food (that is, those that he is allowed to participate in) and to read everything on the subject from the biology of corn reproduction to the philosophy of eating animals, allowing him to understand food as well as possible.  His travels lead him to farms across the country, where he watches the farm processes and participates in them (including driving a tractor as well as killing and eviscerating chickens), CAFO's, and to learn how to hunt wild pig and develop a sixth sense for seeing and gathering mushrooms.  He engages in deep discussions with experts in all aspects of food to understand their perspective and shed a different light on food as we see it - that is, food without the hidden negative consequences. This active participation and discussion straight from the source as well as thorough research leads him to draw well-reasoned conclusions from his experiences. He demystifies the supermarket and articulates the hidden consequences of our food choices.      Pollan conveys his findings and opinions fluidly and his experiences candidly.  He imparts the reader with a greater wisdom and confidence in making food choices (although it is disenchanting that the system in place does not necessarily even allow you to make the choices you want to...), but he is not preachy. I found Pollan's writing to be clear, interesting, and sincere. I highly recommend this book.
1591843162|5.0|Others have their own reasons for praising this book. Here are five of mine. First, this is by far Godin's most personal book in which he reveals more of his emotions and \\"soul\\" (for lack of a better term) than he has in any of his previous books. Also, from the beginning, he establishes a direct and personal rapport with his reader. I felt that he had written this book specifically for me. Although he and I have never met, I felt as if he were speaking to me and discussing ideas with me as if we were engaged in a face-to-face conversation.<br /><br />Moreover, unlike in most of his previous books, Godin does not climb up into a pulpit and launch a tirade, engaging his audience with a confrontational tone and Old Testament vehemence. He obviously cares deeply about the thoughts and feelings he shares but is at all times respectful of his reader. He repeatedly explains that everyone has several choices and urges his reader to make those only choices that are in her or his long-term best interest.<br /><br />In addition, meanwhile, Godin creates a multi-dimensional context, a frame-of-reference, in which to anchor his insights and recommendations throughout the narrative. He skillfully uses what I describe as a bi-polar strategy: passively but alertly observing what is happening (and not happening) in order to recognize and understand the ever-changing realities of the world that we share and then actively challenging whatever demeans and diminishes anyone's dignity. Finally, Godin utilizes the manifesto genre as a means by which to celebrate humanity at its best, not as an ideal beyond human fulfillment but as an attainable destination if  (HUGE \\"if\\") vision, faith, courage, integrity, and commitment are sufficient to the formidable challenges that await each pilgrim.<br /><br />Near the downtown area here in Dallas, we have a Farmers Market at which some merchants offer complimentary slices of fresh fruit as samples. In that spirit, I now provide three brief excerpts from Godin's book.<br /><br />On becoming indispensable to customers: \\"Here's the win (actually, there are two).<br /><br />\\"If you want customers to flock to you, it's tempting to race to the bottom of the price chart. There's not a lot of room for profit there, though...In a world that relentlessly races to the bottom, you lose if you also race to the bottom. The only way to win is to race to the top. When your organization becomes more human, more remarkable, faster on its feet, and more likely to connect directly with customers, it becomes indispensable....<br /><br />\\"Second, the people that work for you, the ones you freed to be artists [i.e. creators of unique, compelling, and substantial value], will rise to a level you can't even imagine. When people realize that they are not a cog in a machine, an easily replaceable commodity, they take the challenge and grow. They produce more than you pay them to, because you are paying them with something worth more than money....<br /><br />\\"As a result of these priceless gifts, expect that the linchpins on your staff won't abuse their power. In fact, they'll work harder, stay longer, and produce more than you pay them to. Because everyone is a person, and people crave connection and respect.\\" (Pages 35-36)<br /><br />On r&eacute;sum&eacute;s: \\"If you don't have a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, what do you have? How about three extraordinary letters of recommendation from people the employer knows or respects? Or a sophisticated project an employer can see or touch? Or a reputation that precedes you? Or a blog that is so compelling and insightful that they have no choice but to follow up? Some say, `Well, that's fine, but I don't have those.' Yeah, that's my point. If you don't have these things, what leads you to believe that you are remarkable, amazing, or just plain spectacular? It sounds to me like if you don't have more than a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you've been brainwashed into compliance. Great jobs, world-class jobs, jobs people kill for - those jobs don't get filled by people e-mailing in r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.\\"  (Page 73)<br /><br />On the power of being genuine and transparent: \\"Virtually all of us make our living engaging directly with other people. When the interactions are genuine and transparent, they usually work. When they are artificial or manipulative, they fail.<br /><br />\\"The linchin is coming from a posture of generosity; she's there to give a gift [no-strings support of your efforts to succeed]. If that's your intent, the words almost don't matter. What we'll perceive are your wishes, not the script.<br /><br />\\"This is why telemarketing has such a ridiculously low conversion rate. Why corporate blogs are so lame. Why frontline workers in the service business have such stress. We can sense it when you read the script because we're so good at finding the honest signals.\\" (Page 214)<br /><br />For various reasons previously indicated, I hold this book in very high regard and conclude my review of it with one more observation: The person whom Godin characterizes as \\"indispensable\\" is defined by what is indispensable to that person. It could well be, for example, a sincere desire to be of service to others. Or it could well be a sincere desire to offer unconditional \\"gifts\\" of trust, faith, respect, and candor. Those whom Godin characterizes as \\"artists\\" possess the vision, faith, courage, integrity, and commitment needed to create -- in collaboration with others -- a \\"post-commercial world that feeds us, enriches us, and gives us the stability we've been seeking for so long.\\" That said, it would be a serious mistake to underestimate or ignore the importance of self-interests. Those who create the world to which Godin refers also feed and enrich themselves as well as those whom they serve and with whom they share a community of faith. Only then can they obtain for themselves as well as others the stability they have been seeking for so long. That should be our vision and Godin challenges us to fulfill it.On the power of being genuine and transparent: \\"Virtually all of us make our living engaging directly with other people.

B002ZIAC26|5.0|For many it was only a matter of time until Beach House delivered big time and sought world domination. For this punter alternatively (with the exception of a couple of songs such as \\"Apple Orchard\\" on their debut and \\"Holy Dances\\" and \\"Gila\\" on their second LP \\"Devotion\\") a sense of deep indifference has been the predominant feeling about this band. Indeed if truth be told they seemed like a bunch of Mazzy Star sound-alike's with \\"Fade into you\\" the overused template. What a mad fool I have been, \\"Teen Dream\\" is an outright stunner and propels them into the major leagues.<br /><br />The anticipation around this album across American music blogs has been huge largely as a consequence of widespread leaks of the album. The result is that it is already being hyped up as this year's Animal Collective equivalent e.g. an album released in the first month of the New Year which will dominate 2010's musical landscape. In the first place a comparison between \\"Teen Dream\\" and \\"Merriweather\\" makes little sense since they are chalk and cheese in terms of musical styles. But more than this they are unhelpful since they burden \\"Teen Dream\\" with a comparison which it does not need and a weight of expectation that this fragile beauty should not be required to carry. After all it is the quality of the music that counts.<br /><br />Beach House is a duo from Baltimore comprising Victoria Legrand (yes she is related to the French composer Michel) and Alex Scally. \\"Teen dream\\" is on the Bella Union label and Sub pop in the US and recorded in a church in upstate New York and you can tell. This is an album of real grace and power. The songs are characterised by an ethereal dreamy pop sensibility and Legrand's voice has echoes of Nico, Marianne Faithful, Patti Smith and of course Hope Sandoval. It gives a slightly hard, sultry and sometimes raspy edge to Beach House's sweet melodies and Scally's wonderful backing instrumentation.<br /><br />The album starts brilliantly with the sublime \\"Zebra\\" which sets the tone for the rest of the album with its slow guitar lines that build and burn into a classic pop anthem. It is gorgeous stuff as is \\"Silver Soul\\" which follows it. And then there is \\"Norway\\" the single which has been readily available for months. In this reviewers humble opinion it is one of the greatest pop songs of this century thus far. Legrand's vocal is as smokey as a fine Cuban cigar and contrasts with the breathless backing vocals. This mix is combined with a weird and slightly distorted electronic backing but which works in spades. It is bloody perfect and if you don't get the album at least download this. The slow processional pop of \\"Walk in the Park\\" which follows \\"Norway\\" is remarkably its equal and provides no let up. These first four songs are by far the strongest opening quartet to an album which I have heard in many years.<br /><br />\\"Used to be\\" has shades of the wonderful innocence found on Mercury Rev's \\"Deserters Songs\\" album and for some reason \\"Lover of Mine\\" reminds me of \\"Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence\\" with a slight Japanese feel. \\"10 mile stereo\\" is easily the best vocal performance by Legrand on the whole album. The only qualms I have come in the shape of \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Take care\\" which are the tracks at the moment that I can't get too worked up about. \\"Take Care\\" has one of those constant repeat vocals that go on beyond the point of irritation.<br /><br />Small caveats for what is a towering performance. \\"Teen Dream\\" is a lush and magisterial album that you would be fool not to let it into your life.

B00082IJ08|5.0|I am a huge fan of music, any and all kinds. When I stumbled upon the Gorillaz self-titled debut album, I thought I'd check it out due to liking the single Clint Eastwood. I was quite taken with the different various styles they incorporated on the album and have been listening to them ever since. I recently bought Demon Days and I can say, that it's better than their other album. The music features various U.S. rappers and different choirs and even a spoken word story told by actor Dennis Hopper in one of the songs. The style in this album is not for everyone though. If you were a fan of their first release, I'd strongly recommend this. Note: Lyrics are not included in album sleeve booklet.
B00000612Q|5.0|I recently \\"rediscovered\\" this album. Overlooked or forgotten (which is worse?). Many may be familiar with 'You Wear It Well' or 'Twisting the Night Away' The cover of Hendrix's 'Angel\\" is just fantastic but the real gem of the collection is 'Italian Girls'. This is vintage Rod much in the same style of Every picture..  If you like Mandolin Wind,Man of Constant Sorrow,Gasoline Alley..this style of Rod then by all means check this out. That twangy, bluesy feel pervades this album (Ron Wood contributes much). How 'Italian Girls\\" or 'Angel' are not selected for his best of collections is inexplicable. As so often is the case the \\"best ofs\\" include top 40 drivel while ignoring the good stuff. Discover this for yourself.
1591843162|5.0|Thanks to Seth Godin and his marvelous new book, striving to be indispensible is out of the closet and the value and worth of linchpins sits front and center.  And rightfully so.  Those who are linchpins will be inspired.  Seth takes care of those naysayers by explaining the intrinsic resistance and potential sabotage of the lizard brain in a full chapter.<br /><br />This book explains that we all have the potential to be a linchpin.  And even if you decline the invitation, you should know how and why these people exist and you should recruit and reward them immediately.  This book connected with me the same way Daniel Pink's A Whole New Mind did.<br /><br />Well organized, easy to understand simple words bring out the most profound ideas.  Seth Godin is a genius and this book is a gift.  Thank you!

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I've been waiting for trhis CD for a few months. I have not been disappointed. Being a new fan of Lady Antebellum after their performance at the Amercian Music Awards, I quickly fell in love with them.     Keeping this in mind, I want everyone to know that I had already loved another song by them before i heard \\"Need You Now\\". I just didn't know it was them! How glad I am that I figured it out!    This CD has the same great sound I have come to expect from Lady Antebellum. The harmonies blend beautifully, and the tracks are both fun and sultry. Gotta love how they have such an eclectic mix on here. I can't wait to find out what the next single is going to be. I am sure it will hit number 1 fast!     If you liked their debut CD, this one will not disappoint. Enjoy it!
1591843162|4.0|How to be Indispensable: More Cowbell!<br /><br />Thoughts on Seth Godin's new book Linchpin - Are you indispensable?<br /><br />You are a genius. That start to Seth Godin's new book got my attention. If this guy knows how smart I am, then I definitely want to listen to him.<br /><br />Godin proposes that we must become indispensable in our jobs. The days are gone when we could show up to the factory (or cubicle), follow the instructions and then be guaranteed a regular paycheck. The market has always favored the cheaper alternative and it is easier to find those alternatives. Journalists, car factory workers, chicken slaughterhouse cutters and engineers have all learned that there is someone willing to do their job for less. The solution to this downward spiral is to become an artist - someone that invests their emotional energy into their job to deliver something that is uniquely different. Like a linchpin that connects two rail cars, indispensable employees can't be removed and discarded.<br /><br />Godin explains that indispensable artists are a combination of dignity, generosity and humanity. This is a person who can walk into a chaotic situation and create order. They also connect people and naturally give gifts. Just like the famous Saturday Night Live skit that features the cowbell player of the Blue Oyster Cult, artists invest completely into their art - always willing to give more cowbell.<br /><br />SNL: More Cowbell video - [...]<br /><br />The author spends much of the book convincing the reader that things are truly bleak for the average order taker. He convinced me of this fact in 10 pages, so I wanted to quickly skip to the part where told me how to solve it. People have critisized Godin in the past that his books present all problem and no solution. His unapologetic response - \\"There is no map.\\" Art is intrinsically new and applies to that situation. He can't map out the solution, only give you the motivation to put in your passion to solve the problem.<br /><br />The art of shipping is the concept that grabbed me the most in Linchpin. The only purpose of starting is to finish according to Godin. Shipping is the practice of regularly finishing the project (art) you are working on. It doesn't do any good to come up with great ideas and then not put them out there. Also, it doesn't do any good to continuously refine them and never actually ship them. I can really appreciate this discipline after working in several startups. You are always in the dark about what the customer really wants until you put something out there for them to evaluate. So many marketing meetings arguing about feature sets, messaging, pricing, bugs, packaging without any real knowledge of what the market wants. Once it is out there the customer tells you what they like and don't like. Then you can refine and ship again.<br /><br />Godin's book is inspiring. I lept off my chair when I finished the book eager to share what I'd just learned with the world. Although the book doesn't give the reader a map to the treasure, it confirms your faith that exerting the extra emotional labor, delivering unique creativity, and investing in developing your domain knowledge will pay off.<br /><br />Disclosure: I got a free preview copy of Linchpin that is scheduled to be released on January 26. Godin put together an innovative pre-release marketing program with the hopes that people will share their feelings about his book with their friends. I don't make any money from it.grabbed me the most in Linchpin. The only purpose of starting is to finish according to Godin.

1591843162|5.0|Seth's book was like one long \\"Aha\\" moment. Everything just clicked for me as I was reading it. The really strange thing was that as I started reading something that made me squirm (the whole \\"art\\" thing threw me for a loop) he explained how resistance and the \\"lizard brain\\" are holding me back.   I am recommending this book to most of my friends that are frustrated with their \\"jobs\\".
B002T9H2LA|3.0|The split here seems to be about Tarantino and about gore. To be frank, the story is perfectly simplistic and utter fiction; the gore is just unnecessary. Perhaps that's ok for some viewers--clearly it is. The dialogue is largely sharp, though, and the movie is worth watching for Christoph Waltz's performance as SS Col. Landa.
1591843162|5.0|This book really opens your eyes. We've been taught to go through life underestimating ourselves, doubting, fearing, and fitting in as a result. Seth has this way of making you reevaluate the norm and dig deeper. Linchpin will change the way you see yourself, raise your children and the way you live your life.
B00005JKGO|3.0|La Dolce Vita (The Daily Vitamin) has some truly unforgettable cinematography. I was immediately struck by the opening scene of the film where we have the unforgettable sight of a woman with hairy armpits waving at a flying Jesus. I will never get that image out of my head. Then there was the unforgettable fountain scene where Sylvia went wading, and despite the fact that the water was barely knee deep, she wore some kind of floatation vest that was stretching out the top of her dress in an unforgettable way. There was also another unforgettable scene, but I can't remember what it was.     Fellini treats us to what seems like a couple dozen nights on the town with the overindulged rich and famous crowd. Yawn. Wild horses couldn't drag me to any of these parties of the comatose, so I found most of the film to be tedious and boring. Of course, that is one of the points Freddy is trying to make. Point well taken, but it felt like being bludgeoned about the head and shoulders for 3 hours. I did learn that the papparazi have always asked the dumbest questions, it's not a recent development.     At one point in the film, Fellini takes on organized religion and improper pruning techniques in an unflattering manner. It seems that two little kids found a grilled cheese sandwich with the image of the Madonna burned into it and they buried it, and a magic beanstock grew up in this holy spot. Well, all the self serving religious folk gathered around hoping for a miracle while the kids had fun making sport of them. It started to rain, so the holy people ripped the sacred beanstock to shreds with the hope that they could sell the leaves and stems on Ebay to raise money for a new church on this sacred ground. I think there was a deleted scene where they slaughtered the goose that laid golden eggs too. Good times.    At the merciful conclusion of this epic, we see Marcello's character stagger down to the beach to smell the giant dead ray, which isn't a good idea if you've been drinking all night, so he staggers off to the side upwind and sees Nico making gestures to him from across the water. He can't hear her due to the pounding surf. She seems to be offering him salvation from his meaningless life, but since he's hungover and sucks at charades, he gives her a dismissive wave and leaves to find some aspirin. Nico seems happy though. I think she got into typing school.    I watched this film 3 times and listened to the \\"expert\\" pedestrian commentary to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and I came to the conclusion that some films affect people differently, and this one didn't strike a chord with me the way it did with some others. There is nothing wrong with that, since beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I've heard the Texas Chainsaw Massacre called a masterpiece, so I rewatched that and saw it as a low budget crapfest that was rendered virtually unwatchable by the last half hour of screaming, but I would be flamed without mercy by the fanboys if I gave it less than 5 stars. I would recommend watching this film as a piece of cinematic history, and if you enjoy it, great, but if not, there should be no shame in that either. Different strokes for different folks. I just didn't see it as a \\"Masterpiece\\" and found it neither that entertaining nor profound.

B0030GJ50C|5.0|First of all when i heard about District 9 storyline. I was \\"OFF\\" to it because i never liked Aliens types of movies except the Alien vs Predator. However my cousin came out to my house he brought this movie with him. Well i started watching it and next thing i know i was all in to it. This was the greatest movie of 2009. I have watched this movie 5 times and would love to watch it again if someone play it. I cant wait for the next episode of this movie. The ending part was sad and very touching. District 9 is a must watch movie.
0440242401|1.0|Well, that's a part of my life I can never get back. I picked this book up out of pure desperation at LAX as the only other choices were horrible harlequin romances and cheesy looking spy thrillers. I'd heard of the Shopaholic series, although never read any (not my thing), so that was reason enough for me to buy it.     Ugh. The writing in this book is juvenile, and looks like a first draft. I swear that the author was under some contractual obligation to churn out stuff for her publishing house, because this is one horrid piece of B-side mess that was likely written on a commuter train. I don't mind light 'chick-lit', but this barely had enough to keep me to the end. The characters were roughly sketched, the main character annoying, and there was no depth to anything - none of the people, the relationships, the drama. I don't know if the author is resting on the laurels of past 'accomplishments' and didn't bother to even try, anymore. The premise is fun, but I've read other much better-executed amnesiac books. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I'm embarrassed for my gender that so many women like this drivel. The equivalent of eating a bowl of marshmallow fluff.
1591843162|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I received an advance copy of Linchpin from Seth Godin after making a gift to Acumen Fund, which promotes entrepreneurship as a way of fighting global poverty.  So far, I've read Linchpin twice, and I can tell from the my underlining in multiple colors and the many stars I've made in the margins that I'll be returning to it frequently.<br /><br />I've read and recommended several other Seth Godin books -- [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]] and [[ASIN:1591841747 Meatball Sundae: Is Your Marketing out of Sync?]]  -- and I'm a regular reader of his blog.  However, reading Linchpin was more of a punch-in-the-gut wakeup call than the head-nodding experience I normally get from Seth.  Linchpin calls us to use our creativity, genius, emotional labor, gift-giving behavior, and our ability to connect with others to do Linchpin art for ourselves and the organizations we serve.  Of course there is a resistance: our \\"lizard brain\\" or amygdala, which promotes anxiety about deviating from the employee-manual ruled, meeting-contrained, balanced scorecard-driven modes of behavior that define a typical modern and average organization.  However, Linchpin provides strategies for fighting the resistance to create and ship our art.<br /><br />Seth makes a convincing case that managed-to-be-predictable, unexceptional, and scalable organizations will face faster, cheaper competition and will decline.  Those businesses which recruit, recognize, and promote Linchpins will be the remarkable organizations defining success in the coming years.<br /><br />I help organizations build Word of Mouth, especially using the Web.  It's always been easy to talk to clients about the Web visibility, social media, and search engine optimization aspects of Web Word of Mouth, but it's been difficult to convey how a business can become remarkable enough cause customers to talk about it.  Our business culture is wedded to a performance standard defined by customer satisfaction surveys -- not remarkable performance measures like Net Promoter.  How many times do we see advertisements telling us that a business will exceed our (customer satisfaction) expectations? In Linchpin, Seth Godin clearly defines what it takes to create a remarkable business.  The book provides no roadmap, no \\"Ten Easy Steps,\\" but it defines the goal and motivates us to get started.ys -- not remarkable performance measures like Net Promoter.

Linchpin is about becoming (or being) this type of person to your world--wherever you may find yourself.    In my network, I have \\"guaranteed\\" this book---promised them their money back if they did not think it was amazing.  That is how strong I feel about this book, and how it can help to move people forward and toward a more wonderful life.  The beauty is that the book takes one through the joy, the science and the results that are inherent in making the most of one's self.      Read this book, share it with others, and work to make your world a more dynamic and happy place.  You will surely find yourself making a similar guarantee to your own network.  It is that powerful of a book.  Oh, it is also easy and fun to read.

It is a favorite with some in my family so I have been force fed it on a number of occasions. Not for me!  Give me the Keira Knightley version anyday.The Camera work is brilliant and the soundtrack , original I might add, is beautiful! Sounds like Chopin.  Oh, and the actresses are all WAY too OLD!  They all appear to be in their thirties where the girls in the Keira Knightly version appear to be just that, GIRLS!  Silly behavior from a Kitty who IS 14 years old is infinately more palatable that the same behavior from a 30 year old! And I really got tired of the matronly looking Lizzie pursing her lips.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I already owned this cd from way back in 1985 when I originally bought it. Unfortunately with today's very revealing cd players it sounded very harsh. So I decided to buy the remastered version not knowing how much of a difference it would make. What a tremendous difference. The original was really not well recorded, but this has really brought the sound quality of this 25 year old analog recording to today's digital standards. The only fly in the ointment was the jewel case which broke the first time I opened it which always seems to happen these days with all the new cd's I purchase. The hinges on the cd cover are so cheap that they break the first time you open it. No big deal really. As far as the content goes, I will defer to others to comment on that, other than to say that I consider this to be a pop masterpiece.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I found every character, down to the smaller ones perfectly cast.  I felt a real affection between all the family members.  Donald Sutherland was superb. Keira Knightly showed a dignity without pursing her lips up the the the other Lizzie did.  I never cared for the Colin Firth version, cute as he is in it, because they all seemed so prissy and their concerns trivial.  These actors brought the story to life for me.  And the way the camera moved from room to room,  showing the households small activities from the servant singing as she goes up the stairs to the parents in their bed to the girls giggling in their rooms. They employed the same ploy at the ball focausing not only on the leading characters but on small accurances of incidental characters. Brilliant! And the piano work and soundtrack! Magnificent!  I've heard some comlain it is too \\"Wuthering Heights\\" but that is one of my favorites so ...  Hooray!

B00004XPPE|5.0|Could nuclear war happen on accident. This was always a fear of John F. Kennedy after he read Barbara Tuckman's[[ASIN:0345476093 The Guns of August]]. He obsessed about this after his ill-fated 1961 Vienna Summit with Nikita Khrucshev, and it almost hapened during the Cuban Missle Crisis in October of 1962.<br /><br />Kennedy was smart enough to avert this, but that standoff made the possibility real for Americans. I have said this in other reviews, but if you are my age, born in 1969, you caught the tail and far less dangerous end of the cold war.<br /><br />But from the end of World War II until the end of the Missle Crisis, the unthinkable was quite thinkable, every day. I collect Time Magazines from the 1950s and 1960s, and you could sent away for a backyard bomb shelter as we now do for books, CDs and computer eqiptment.<br /><br />If you think of those first few months after 9/11, during the anthrax attacks, this is probably the closest people of my era have ever gotten to how palpable this fear was.<br /><br />Fail-Safe from 1964 shows just how easy accidental incineration could have been. Two American pilots misread radio messages and start flying into Western Russia to unload the bomb. It takes awhile for the people in the military to understand what is going on. The pilots are called back , eventually, even by President Henry Fonda. But it is too late. There are a series of orders and checks that go horribly wrong--the steps meant to avoid error wind up causing the worst error of all.<br /><br />This is war by massive systematic error and blind obeidance to systematic proceadure. The pilots are following orders, but orders of a regimine that does not reveal its flaws until it actually is activated.<br /><br />Fail-Safe is no scinence fiction horror show. Directed by the great Sidney Lumet--if I could do reviews like he did films, I would be trouncing Harriet right now, but she has nothing to worry about --it shows the doves, moderates, hawks (Walter Matthau) and crazies (Fritz Weaver) all trying to influence Fonda, in his calm and centered playing of the president.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|'The Lives of Others' is an interesting recent German film set in the old Communist DDR, depicting a relationship between watcher and watched.<br /><br />The watched is Georg Dreyman, a playwright known for his ideological plays, and the only living East German playwright who is read in the West (the film being set in 1984). His plays express the possibility that people are capable of change - much to the contempt of the Minister for Culture, who doesn't believe they are. The corrupt Minister, who has designs on Dreyman's actress girlfriend, orders the Stasi (state security) to investigate him.<br /><br />Enter the watcher: Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler leads a lonely, fairly meaningless existence, mirroring the feeling of East Berlin itself (as portrayed in the film). But Wiesler also has an idealist streak, in contrast to his more Machiavellian colleagues. This idealism doens't quite mesh with the corrupt system - and perhaps he has sensed this subconsciously for some time. The things he overhears when listening in on Dreyman finally convince him that the system is not what it claims to be, nor what he originally thought it was.<br /><br />'The Lives of Others' is certainly worth watching for the evocative historical atmosphere it creates. Worth noting, too, is the ending, set two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Dreyman attends a new version of one of his old plays in Berlin, and comes face to face with his old enemy the Culture Minister. The latter expresses his contempt for the new Germany, saying it gives people \\"nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against\\". There is a phenomenon in Germany called 'Ostalgie' (nostaglia for the old East), and this may be the most eloquent critique of the new Germany - that an old Commie finds it so insipid as to be \\"not even worth rebelling against!\\"<br /><br />But one thing the film DOESN'T show is how many ex-Stasi rats are still loose in the corridors of Berlin. The German Financial Time claims that around 17,000 ex-Stasi members are now civil servants. And that means the ex-Minister is wrong - the current German regime IS worth rebelling against.ervants. And that means the ex-Minister is wrong - the current German regime IS worth rebelling against.

I had knew I would like this movie but after wathcing it, on blu ray especially, I was just in awe.  Tarantino is a film genius and this is him at his best.  Pitt is outstanding and Waltz plays a villian with exceptional talent.  The laughs are plenty, the violence is very extreme, as expected in a Tarantino, and the storyline is suprisingly touching in some places.  Who doesn't love the idea of sticking it to the Nazi's? Giving them a taste of their own medicine?  The whole thing, the acting, the storyline, are just genius from beginning to end. Defenitely worth watching again and again.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Pandorum is a pretty good movie. If you think that event horizon mixed with descent is a decent combo..then this movie is for you. Forget all the naysayers on here and just make up your own mind.
1423113497|5.0|I never liked Harry Potter. I know, I know, everyone is always shocked when I say that.  So, when my husband picked up these books, I figured I would never read them.  He was totally entrhalled with them and so I decided, what the heck. Boy am I glad I tried them out!  These books have a great storyline without being too long winded, the characters are likeable, you become invested right from begininng!  I was also never interested in mythology, but these books have changed that and given my husband and I hours of great conversation as he was always very into the subject!  Excellent writing and great for kids and adults alike!

B001676320|2.0|I had high hopes for this after reading so many positive reviews, but I'm sorry to say it's a pretty big disappointment. This is basically a PBS pledge-week style performance. With little exception, the performances are uninspired. If you have good memories associated with these groups, I suggest you hang on to them and skip this disc. It's not fun to have your cherished memories butchered by struggling performers.    It's telling that no person involved in the audio production would take credit on either the liner or on IMDB. That's something to look out for on future purchases, because after all it's about the music, and when the music professionals don't want to receive credit something's not right. Thankfully the video producer and director let us know who they were, so we have some idea who was responsible for the bad lighting, washed out video and amateur camera work.     If you're a big fan of Lawrence Welk PBS pledge drives then go for it! Otherwise, take a pass.    For a performance that's shot beautifully and sounds fantastic, I recommend checking out [[ASIN:B000BTFZK0 Weekend On The Rocks [live CD & DVD]]]
B000002Q88|5.0|After watching the outstanding bluray 'There's Know Place Like Home' from one of my favorite bands, and hearing Ghosts/Rainmaker from this CD I felt compelled to dust this one off and give it a listen.  Why this CD was not better received at the time of its release is a mystery - it is truly a great great recording.  Walsh's voice, the lyrics, Morse's guitar and the energy and mood captured on every song is truly special.  I'm hoping all fans of quality intelligent powerful rock from the heartland will give this one a chance and rediscover this classic.
B0006J28L4|5.0|I have seen this movie on countless occasions.  I have found myself having to replace it after purchasing it several times because I never get it back upon loaning it out.  This is a masterful work of art that takes you through the history of Malcolm Little to Malcolm X to Malik El Hajj Shabazz.  I consider this movie a must see for all Americans before leaving this world.  I rate this movie on the same list of importance as visiting Washington D.C. and New York City. If you think being an American is more than just a birth right you will definitely appreciate this movie.  The movie is quite long and kinda of drags in some areas, but if you gain some background on Malcolm before viewing the movie you'll understand.  This is a very entertaining, but complex movie on a very complex man.  Two thumbs up!!!
1591843162|5.0|One of the more surprising parts of reading Seth Godin's new book \\"Linchpin\\" is that you have to wait until page 22 before there's a reference to Marx and Engels. That's because, for the first 20 pages, this new book reads like \\"Das Kapital\\" for the digital age.    Seth Godin's \\"Linchpin\\" is a culmination of his previous books, all of which point to a shift in the way we work and create products, but none of them put all the pieces together as powerfully as \\"Linchpin.\\" Our world, our economic reality, is going through massive transformation leaving those of us working (or not) to suffer the consequences. \\"Linchpin\\" seeks to rally individuals to rise up and meet that challenge on our own, rather than waiting for someone to tell us what to do.    Simply put, \\"Linchpin\\" is to people as \\"Purple Cow\\" was to products.    You can read the complete review here: '[...]
B001AVCFJM|4.0|Like I wrote in the title, I gave this item 4 stars because, in my opinion, the plotline is very similar to the one in \\"Star Trek - Nemesis\\". Romulan Antagonist, controlling a vessel with superior firepower, etc. I know a lot of trekkies out there who would have wanted an antagonist to be a bit more colorful and with more depth to his character than the one played by Eric Bana. Enough about cons, let's move to the pros!  Star Trek was given a new light in this movie. The main protagonists from TOS are all here, but yet, somehow it all seems fresh, as if it's 1966 again and we're getting to know the crew of the Earth's flagship in a very profound and original way. I used to think of the Enterprise crew as a group of professionals assigned to the ship by a comission which picked the best people for the job and that was it. But the writers of the screenplay question that, because Gene Rodenberry (the creator of the Star Trek franchise) never never really explained how did the crew of NCC-1701 come together. So I find this part of the movie very interesting, and helpful, I might add.  About the special effects - awesome! Keep'em comin'.  Special effects in this movie remind me of those from Battlestar Galactica, but I think its just me. Btw, love the new going-into-warp-blast sound. I think it's LOGICAL.  Acting - hm, the cast, in my opinion, is a solid one, and I wanna use this chance to defend Chris Pine (Kirk) who was attacked by some critics that didn't like HIS acting. I think that mr. Pine, given the great responsability of trying to fit Shatner's shoes, did a great job. He created a new James Tiberius Kirk, bold and stubborn as the old one, but in his own way. Don't forget that the New Kirk grew up WITHOUT a father figure. I think it counts. I give Qiunto also 5 stars for Spock.  Conclusion: PEOPLE, MAKE THIS DVD A PART OF YOUR COLLECTION AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B001GWK2MC|3.0|Great jumping toy.  However, the four blue areas deflated within a month - still can't find a hole.  Wish it would have lasted longer.
1591843162|5.0|How do you describe a book you read in two days and underlined and marked it up as if I was taking an exam? Why would I be willing to reread particular parts of the book, including the chapter over resistance?    The one example that came to mind over and over was that of a Pez dispenser. Seth Godin writes a poignant book with every new chapter and subtitle. He cuts hard to the bone marrow, but leaves you remaining with a sense of awe and fascination with his style of writing. The Pez dispenser is similar to this book, you are fascinated by the one liners that seem to be filled on every page, so you continue to flip each page waiting for the next pez or one liner to wet your mouth for more so you can smash your lizard brain (gotta read the book to understand the lizard brain). However, this book deserves more than a Pez dispenser, because Pez dispensers are not unique, they have no sense of value, and more importantly they do not offer emotional investment or return. Pez dispenser are a veneer of art. You were made to authentic art . I know I am not an artist either. Art according to Seth changes people, therefore I am an artist. You are an artist, not a Pez dispenser.    Many will read this book, few will understand. We crawl to our caves either at home or work and rarely reach out to make the emotional connection with those closest to us. An emotional connection requires energy and effort beyond showing up, but we face resistance daily and allow the resistance and our lizard brain to take control.    Who is this book for? Everyone. You deserve more than what is given to you, but you must realize people are asking you to take a risk; to go beyond the sale, go beyond the meeting, go beyond the church walls, go beyond the 1 hour therapy session, this requires emotional labor. Take a risk and connect with someone and give them emotional labor.
1400032717|3.0|Since there have been hundreds of reviews already, I won't bother recapping the plot here.    The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is certainly an original work, and while Haddon does a convincing job of channeling the voice of an autistic 15 year-old, I eventually found that voice fairly monotonous.  Over time, I think the book, with its visual diagrams, will be seen as more clever than great.  The ending seems a bit pat, but still adequate.  The book, at just over 200 pages, ended just before its quirks became tiresome.    I'm not sure if what I liked about this book was more style or gimmick; future entries by Haddon will answer that question I suppose.    If there's an audio version, you should probably avoid it--the narrative voice in this work is extremely flat, and the diagrams are key to making that narrative voice convincing.    On the whole, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is a good book, but I think it's probably far more clever than it is great.  Worth a read, but perhaps not the spectacular praise.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|As a Mariza devotee it was an obligation for me to buy this album. Concha Buika sings on Mariza's \\"Terra\\" album. The producer of \\"Terra\\", Javier Limon, plays beautiful guitar here. And, Chucho Valdes played piano for Mariza. I was not disappointed. Concha's raspy voice required a little adjustment for my ears. Her voice lacks the obvious beauty heard in Mariza or Toni Childs. Concha proves it's not what you have, but how you use it that matters. This album has a rich textured feel that rewards repeated listening. I love it.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|When I was in the movie theatre it was difficult for me because it hurt to know that I was not going to be able to see Michael perform again except for this last film.I am glad that there were cameras there though because I had always wanted to watch and see how he did put his shows together.I am one of the lucky gals the generation of girls that got to see the Jackson Five from 1969 on the Diana Ross special and watch them on every tv show that they would have been on if yet once a year in the 70's.Yes I screamed at the tv like everyone else when he danced.I got to see The Jackson Five in 1974,The Jacksons in 1981 and Michael during the Bad tour in 1987 all at Madison Square Garden in New York.Each and everytime he came to New York it was a thrill in the air.There was just no one like him and there never will be.For me it was just the norm to see him on tv or in concert and just love every bit of what he did.So what who cares about the negative crap those things don't matter now.It's all about the achievements he made and his heart for those he loved family,friends and fans.My daughter who is 13 now loves the memorabilia I've got all the albums I've lost the old pictures I collected as a teenager but his magic of entertainment drawing from the old dancers like Fred Astaire,Gene Kelly,James Brown,Jackie Wilson all culminate Michael Jackson.I will miss you Michael and I am thankful to have been a fan to see the magic.Rest in peace.To anyone who reads this review and gets this dvd I hope you enjoy this as part of your collectors item I know I am.
1591843162|5.0|I own lots of books by Seth and I am a fan of this book as well. I thought I'd get my one negative observation out of the way up front. I think the book could have been 20% shorter (an arbitrary %-age on my part). I think Seth overdoes the examples everywhere in the book.    Linchpin documents Seth's point of view on how to thrive, not just survive, in the world as it is, not as we want it to be.    Seth implores all of us to  lean in, stand out, be an artist, make a difference, do the work, create a map, stand up, become indispensable, take a risk, ignore your lizard brain's impulse to make you do nothing or run the other way, take charge of your life because the alternative is to be a \\"cog in a big machine\\" and be replaced by someone else who can do \\"it\\" faster and for less money.    Seth references Thornton May who points out that  your future is not secure if you assume you can count on attendance based compensation. Jobs that you can just show up for are not safe. Seth says that if everyone or anyone can do your job then you can be replaced. Scarcity equals value. For Seth, we must all become artists - where art is defined as a personal gift that changes the recipient.    An artist is a customer service rep who continually handles irate customers so well that they become raving supporters. An artist is the Con Ed crew member who has the talent for calming scared customers when there is a gas leak, making him more valuable than all the other crew members, including the crew chief.    Read the book. Seth cogently answers all the arguments. \\"I can't afford to rock the boat.\\" \\"I have no special talent.\\" \\"I'm too old.\\" None of them stand up.    As Seth says near the end of the book, don't be seduced by the \\"future quo\\". Your world is going to change. Companies do go out of business. Companies do lay people off. Create your own map to a life  in which you become indispensable.
1591843162|5.0|If you have a career or a business and your goal is to develop indispensability in terms of the people that work for you and/or the value that you add to a firm, reading this book will be a building block in achieving just that.    This new economy have created a lot of losers with outsourcing and offshoring and the permanent hunt for new creative talent from unskilled jobs to high end white collar jobs.   Seth Godin will coach you on how to make your business, your people and YOU \\"Inc\\" ...  Indispensable ...  Enjoy Reading and Applying these principles in you everyday endeavors.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is great movie.  You can't get any better than Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  I have watched it several times, and it keeps me laughing time after time.
1591843162|3.0|I love reading Seth's blog, and I was really excited to get my copy of Linchpin.  I was highlighting things left and right in the beginning but somewhere towards the middle I got a little bored.  It was a bit of a challenge to get to the end.  I felt like what he was saying rang true for me, but maybe since I'm younger I feel like my generation already knows what he's saying... but then again, I'm already more motivated than a lot of my friends from my graduating class.    This is a great book, don't get me wrong I just feel like it could have been edited down maybe a little bit more.  Sorry Seth!    I know this is a book he's been working on for years and I feel like I'm stabbing him in the heart a bit, but like he says in his book - we need to gift our art and not let the lizard brain focus on the rejection.    Thanks Seth.
0810982862|3.0|I like it, but its actually a very thin book. I thought that there would be more to it. It showed some drawings, a lot of snapshots of the movie. I think James Cameron didn't want to show too much. overall, its good just as an overview of the movie.
1591843162|5.0|This book is a LINCHPIN. Seth Godin explains a linchpin, \\"The linchpin is an individual who can walk into chaos and create order, someone who can invent, connect, create, and make things happen.\\" The thoughts and truth in this book pin together the way things used to be and the ways of the future. We are moving into a new era of life and this book is a catalyst of how to not just survive in this new era, but how to lead and inspire and thrive.  A must read. I have already used so many principles from this book. My copy is all marked up. I wish I could memorize this stuff! Thanks Seth Godin for something fresh and outstanding.  The year has just begun and without question this will be my favorite book this year.  Sensational!<br />Trent Renner
B002XZ62HK|4.0|Celtic Woman does not fail to deliver, but I'm not as pleased with this CD as I was with their first album and especially, A New Journey.  It's a beautiful album, but it's not my favorite.  For one, I am a little disappointed in the missing tracks: Lynn's Carolina Rua and Mairead's new solo, The Mason's Apron for instance.  These songs were beautifully done and it came as a shock to me when I realized that they weren't listed.  On top of that, there wasn't exactly much variety to the CD.  Most of the songs were very slow with the exception of Nil Sen La and maybe You'll be in my Heart.  On top of that, I wasn't thrilled with the number of pop songs in the album--Celtic Woman, in my humble opinion, sounds best when they sing traditonal or at least culturally inspired songs.    HOWEVER, this CD is a must-buy for Celtic Woman fans.  Despite a few disappointments, I must mention that some of the songs featured on this album (in my opinion) are some of the best they've done.  Songs that come to mind when I say this include Isle of Hope and Tears, Nil Sen La, My Lagan Love, Non C'è Piú, their new version of The Call (Mairead's intro is fantastic!!)and the hauntingly beautiful air, The Last Rose Fantasia.  Add these songs with some old (or possibly new??) material, and I'm willing to bet that their new tour starting in February will be absolutely wonderful.  Can't wait to see them again!
1591843162|5.0|I read Purple Cow but I got that for for free so I gave it the weight of, well, something that I got for free. I missed The Dip and it's too late to turn back. With Tribes I started to understand and his perspective was clearer to me and attractive but I soon enough was overwhelmed by the voices more pressing than mine in The Tribe.<br />In Linchpin, I found a character study of stunning accuracy and thoroughness. This book breaks down every barrier we've built between ourselves and our greatness. It's done in a very kind and gentle way but it's firm in point and purpose.<br />From my own experience reading this book (twice now) it has left my resistance no quarter (and that's why I hate* Seth Godin).<br />I have decided (finally) to accept that Seth knows what he's talking about. The book's premise is well supported and explained in an easy to understand way and really leaves no room for dispute as he systematically goes through every excuse we throw at ourselves for keeping us mired in mediocrity.<br />I'm sure that once I break through and act on what I've learned in Linchpin, and use the clear process of playing nice with my resistance, I will no longer hate Seth Godin. After all, a year from now when I have started to see the benefits of shipping (read the book, you'll see) I will owe no small part of that success to Seth and Linchpin.<br />This is my first review of any book (and I read a lot). I cannot express how really, very cool it would be if a whole bunch of people bought this book, read it and then demonstrated their genius. Do yourself, your loved ones and the rest of us a favor and buy this book and read it (at least twice).<br /><br />*Okay, I mean \\"hate\\" in the \\"hostility deriving from fear\\" sort of way. I probably could have gone easier on him but I really wanted you to read this review and I'm guessing that if I titled the review \\"You should read this book\\" or \\"Seth Godin I'm Mad at You\\" you wouldn't be reading this right now (which you're may be thinking \\"that's not a bad thing\\") but really, get the book and prepare for the hate.d thing\\") but really, get the book and prepare for the hate.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The entire Firefly series on only 3 blueray discs plus extras.  If you love firefly this is definitely the way to go.
1591843162|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to improve their relationship with their job, career and/or life's work.  It is a thoughtful navigation tool that connects with you on a very personal level about what you DO and HOW YOU DO IT.    I've received two valuable gifts this month.  One is the thoughtful PBS series, [[ASIN:B002Y7ZELW This Emotional Life]].  The other is Seth Godin's [[ASIN:1591843162 Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?]].  Both have greatly increased my emotional intelligence and reinforced the fundamental necessity of truly connecting with others.      Seth's book made me damn uncomfortable...\\"is this a self-help book or a business book?\\", \\"I can't give away all my magic, everyone will use my ideas.\\"  It feels safer to have a professional persona, separate from ourselves.  However, if you withhold - you aren't really sharing your art...something that just happens to make you indispensable. (Particularly at this time in our world when old-style approaches to working don't benefit you or the rest of society nearly as much.)    Buy the book.  I think you'll want to read it a few times.

0553573411|2.0|Book 1 of Farseer was full, complete, and plot driven. With each book beyond (and I've read all the Fitz books through the second series) there's more feminized men, irritating plot twists, pages beyond count of sopratic whining, and anticlimactic endings than anyone need bother with. The world is creative and the characters have some complexity but Fitz and his snivelling for pages and pages about old pieces of story are murderous. I found myself skimming frequently and honestly if I hadn't bought so many at once I'd have stopped at this book midway through. Hobb has talent but needs editing and some direction to keep her plot moving. Personally I hate protagonists that are stupid and/or whiners and Fitz becomes both. Enjoy the warm fuzzy from her first book and imagine it stands alone. Nothing more to see here... move along.

B001ARYYPY|5.0|Steven Soderbergh made an impressive directorial debut in 1989 with Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Six unremarkable films followed: Kafka, King of the Hill, Underneath, Gray's Anatomy, Out of Sight and The Limey. Then, in 2000 he directed two hits: Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Traffic won a number of international awards and Julia Roberts won an Oscar for Best Actress as the brash tough-talking Erin Brockovich.<br />The award was well deserved. This was probably Julia Roberts' best performance, although her later appearances in two Mike Nichols films: Closer in 2004 and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007, come close. Julia became America's Sweetheart in 1990 in Garry Marshall's Pretty Woman. Now she is approaching Merle Streep territory as she matures and continues to work for our best directors. Her Erin Brockovich compares favorably with Streep's Karen Silkwood in the 1983 Nichols movie Silkwood.<br />Meanwhile, Soderbergh seems to have been on hiatus recently with three rat pack films and other lesser offerings. His 2008 epic Che, just coming out on DVD and blu-ray may redeem him. Stay tuned in.
B001P22HK8|5.0|This book was the perfect fun read - action packed, real-world tech that sounds entirely plausible - truly eye-opening possibilities the verge on cyberpunk and Gibson but even closer to today.  You will be thoroughly entertained - and left thinking.  Can't believe this is a first novel.  Great stuff and highly recommended.
B00330UFQS|5.0|I purchase this as an MP3 download--which works superbly on my apple computer and imports into itunes.    I love the songs.  I had only known the title song but have listened to the album 3 times today--It is really good and I'm glad I got it.   It does seem to be a mix between country and rock--not sure how you classify that exactly--except that it will please a wide variety of people.
1591843162|5.0|I've read several of Seth's books before, but this one is different.  The others were more analytical and detached, somehow.  This one is passionate and powerful.  He really hits it out of the park. I think he changed my life (and I told him so).<br /><br />A few things that really struck me:<br /><br />1) It's OK to fail.  Failing is fine.  Anxiety is failure in advance.  If you try something and it doesn't work, pick yourself up and move on to the next thing.<br /><br />2) Fight the lizard - the lizard is that terrible awful fear that something will go wrong - the fear that makes you hide in the dark, shivering when you're scared<br /><br />3) Draw your own map. Towards the end of the book, he says a remarkable thing; that one of his favorite reviews of Tribes was a negative review right here on Amazon.  The reviewer complained that Tribes had no how-to map, no specific set of instructions.  First of all not many people would cite a negative review as their favorite!  Secondly, he uses the comment as a way to teach something - that you need your own map.  Any map someone draws for you wouldn't reflect your own genius or your own passion.<br /><br />4) Artists (linchpins) ship! \\"Thrash\\" (work out all the kinks, the ideas, the direction, the features of a project) at the beginning - then commit to a date and get it done.<br /><br />I've been inspired to start several new projects (and build a \\"thrashing force field\\").

B000683VI4|4.0|This movie has been one of my favorites for a while. I don't know why I didn't write a review for it earlier, so I guess now I'm writing one. This movie is beautiful and poignant. The story opens with an elderly couple in a care facility, with the man reading a love story to a woman, later the viewer learns that the book he's holding is not a fiction book but rather a diary of sorts. Then the movie flashes back in time to the story of the two young lovers Noah and Allie. I really liked this movie, it was a poignant portrayal of first love that endured and became the last love too. However this movie remains like a one hit wonder for me, since I tried watching other movies based on this writer's stories, and I didn't like any. Noah and Allie were so devoted to each other, especially Noah, and their romance was moving and memorable.
1591843162|5.0|Let me admit upfront - as a raving fan and long-time follower of Seth's work, I may be biased when I suggest that you run - don't walk - and buy this book. NOW, and then read it - the sooner the better.     Seth is a visionary - a master of his art - he is as indispensable a leader and change maker as he is a living and breathing example of a what it means to be a linchpin in action!    Linchpin is Seth's gift to, and for, us as individuals - an amalgamation of his best ideas and life experience we can use to realize our full potential - it is as much a wake up call as it is a call to action - and has renewed my spirit and reignited my passion.     As he quickly points out, the world has changed and we are facing a full-fledged revolution. The time has come to draw a line in the sand and make a life-changing decision - to stand out and choose to travel along the road less traveled, beside and amongst your fellow linchpins, or not. The choice is yours.    Seth urges us to be brilliant - to use our unique gifts to add value and make a contribution - to make a difference and create a powerful vision to propel our lives forward. He challenges us to face our fears - to embrace our genius and engage the artist within.     And, while there is no clear cut map to direct our journey, Seth probes and questions us - teaching us through examples how to navigate through life's uncharted waters without a map - to blissfully and effectively learn how to plot our own course, create a flexible plan and put it to work!     Sprinkled with oodles essential information and pearls of wisdom, Seth reminds us of the importance of being resilient - to see the truth and reflect it - to notice the resistance, the lizard brain and our patterns of behavior - to be discerning and unattached to outcomes, able to abandon our world view and see things as they really are, and when necessary to challenge the status quo.    Yes, living life as a Linchpin may not always be the fastest and easiest pathto take, but for me, it is the only road worth taking.    Robin Daas
B001992NUQ|5.0|This is an excellent Blu-ray title and excellent movie in general. I got the special edition DVD when it came out and I honestly thought I was going to have to buy another copy before I heard this was finally coming out on Blu-ray. Many times when an older (only 1999) movie comes out on BD you can't really get much benefit from the higher resolution but they did a great job with this one. On the many closeups you can see minute lines and even beads of sweat that were unnoticeable in the DVD release. It really adds another layer of depth to the characters and makes you appreciate David Fincher for his attention to detail.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This movie answers the following questions:    What if it isn't a six-foot, space-combat-based, coin-operated arcade game?    What if the storyline is real, and the game is actually an alien spaceship training simulacrum?    This movie revolves around teenager Alex Rogan, and what happens after he finally nails the high score.    I remember liking this movie when I was a kid, and it's now in my Blu-Ray collection.    Enjoy!

1591843162|4.0|As I was making my way through Linchpin, magic started happening.  After years of creating beautiful music in his basement studio, my husband emerged from below, started sharing his compositions on Facebook, and will be uploading the compositions to his blog.  I helped inspire him by sharing the marvelous project by artist Matt Kish, who is creating One Drawing for Every Page of Moby-Dick.  I also persuaded one of my consulting clients to resume blogging about his passion - pastrami.  I connected with an influential food critic on Twitter who is looking forward to sampling and reviewing a client's products.     I discovered a wonderful post on [...] on kitchen re-purposing tricks.  I am setting goals, getting things done, and making things happen.    I find all of Seth's books inspiring, but Linchpin has been the most successful at getting me moving and seeing that my quirky talents have value.     AND - examples always help make a point.  Linchpin contains some great stories about remarkable people doing remarkable things, and would benefit from even more.  But I suspect groups will form (if they haven't already), and fans will take it to that level.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Best Buy's exclusive version of the Blu-ray advertizes a bonus digital copy but it's ONLY for PSP.  Do not buy this version thinking you can play it on your iPod or computer.  This is a strategic move on Sony's part.  Best Buy does still sell the basic bluray version but it's cheaper on amazon.
1591843162|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2I7I2XCZHFPTQ]]Let's just say I had a little anticipation for this book. (And a little problem actually getting to it.)<br /><br />I'm sure you won't have the same experience. (Unless you try to film it yourself.)<br /><br />Definitely worth the wait.  I recommend the store model.
B00005QFE5|5.0|A simple story.  The story in everyone's heart.  The camera tells the story far more than the words and music although both are excellent.      A rural life few can understand in modern life in the city.  I was a farmboy.  I can feel the life in this movie.      It is the best movie I've ever seen.  It is like a book showing how to use a camera, words, music, and scenes.      I wish it will be released in blu-ray with many extra features.
0061703257|3.0|Dennis Lehane did a profound job sculpting out a world which really reminded me of Escape from Alcrataz with its prison-on-a-remote-island setting decorated by a frenzy of crazed events.  The main character is very well covered while the peripheral players in the story are pretty much left to bake in the backdrop.  The storyline itself is very fast moving and keeps you in suspense and turning the pages.  I loved this piece of work until the final 50 pages.  The ending disappointed me and I was sad to see such potential for a beautiful story flushed away.  Either the editor's deadlines to get it in the bookstore forced him to pull the plug abruptly or the author was drugged like the main character himself.  I am very curious to see how Scorcese will play out the ending.  With Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo on board to play the roles I hope they do not use the same poor hallucinated ending as this has story really has the star power, ingredients, settings (with it's mystical 60's Boston setting) and award-winning director to be another epic hit for the ages!
B00330UFQS|4.0|My only real disappointment with this collection -- besides having to wait what seemed like an eternity for it -- is that I really wish it included a few more songs.  With just 11 songs in the album, despite the quality of the tunes, or perhaps because of that quality, the end of the album comes up far too quickly and I'm left wanting more.  I suppose it's better that Lady A. took the go out on a high note type approach rather than filling the album with a few more tracks just to do so, but the other side of that problem is that two of the tracks have gotten enough air play on radio that buyers may feel they've only really gotten 9 new tracks here.<br /><br />Hopefully the next Lady Antebellum album won't be too far off in the future, meanwhile I'll be enjoying American Honey, Need You Now and the other strong tracks from this album.<br /><br />Fans please note that I've not rated this with 5 stars partly because I try to reserve that rating for things that are so impressive they are indisputably at the top of the scale.  Given the chance, there'd be a half star there between the 4 and 5 mark that I'd most certainly use for this album.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|this is one of the most powerful films you can watch if you want to truly grasp what we're feeling ourselves and our families. It will (should) change the way you shop and the way you perceive what goes into your body. The book is even more detailed and a great reference tool to use before your next grocery outing. Watch this film!
B001CTDH76|4.0|The characters are unlike any show and bring a lot to The Mentalist. Certain episode were on the boring side, but all in all it was enjoyable. I'm ready for season 2.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|It's amazing how fast Lady Antebellum has taken over the world of country music, and 2009 was certainly an unbelievable year for them.  'Need You Now' is a rock solid sophomore album, which is sure to send them not only higher up among the country superstars -- but propel them into the pop music world as well.<br /><br />Their platinum debut album zipped up the country charts, and Lady A ended up bringing home awards for song of the year (\\"I Run To You\\") and group of the year, at the '09 CMA awards.  Their great songwriting continues onto 'Need You Now', in which they've had a hand in writing 8 out of the 11 songs here.  The title track spent 5 weeks at #1 on country radio -- and is now making its way onto the pop airwaves.  This CD is full of beautiful harmony, brilliant lyrics, and lovely piano laden songs.<br /><br />\\"Hello World\\" is definitely the standout song to me....It's just stunning.  The song starts off softly with acoustic piano for a while, and then rises into a beautiful anthem about the simple things in life -- what life is all about.  Great lyrics, production, and vocals...\\"Hello World\\" almost has a 'Coldplay' feel to it towards the end.  \\"Perfect Day\\" and \\"American Honey\\" are nice summer type songs, in which Hilary sings lead vocals.  Both singles are laid back tunes, which sound similar to classic Dixie Chick hits from long ago.  \\"If I Knew Then\\" is a gorgeous ballad about missing an opportunity at love, by not taking a chance...something that many of us can relate to.<br /><br />It seems very apparent that Lady A will continue on their road to becoming one of the most successful acts in pop-country music -- this CD is filled with some huge hit singles.  It's a very strong album top-to-bottom, and I highly recommend it!  ~9/10~
1591843162|5.0|Invest in Linchpin. Read it cover to cover and don't loan it out. Keep it and refer to it everyday. If someone wants to loan it to you, don't take it. Buy your own copy. You'll thank me later. Trust me, I'm an artist!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is sent to us from God.  Her voice is perfection and glorious.  She has proved in this collection that she can take any type of song and mold it into her own.  Wild Horses is especially beautiful.  I only hope that Mick Jagger took a minute to listen to one of my favorites and somewhere Gram Parsons is grinning.  She is absolute bliss and I pray that this is not her last gift to this world.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson and of course got the dvd.  It was good to see him in action behind the scenes and to see how respectful as a leader in the rehearsals.  The only thing I wish for is that one day they would and had hoped with this dvd that his 3-D short films are released as 3-D.  When I went to the movie threatre to watch it I was like, \\"Man that would have been so cool in 3-D!\\"  This dvd give you a rare glimpse of Michael and how involved he was with his concerts.
B00275EGX8|4.0|First off, all the people spouting off about how unrealistic this movie was, STOP. Stop watching movies expecting realism, they are for entertainment. The Hurt Locker was just that, even if not realistic.
0385504225|1.0|I normally do not critize an author, but the Lost Symbol by Dan Brown is just too much.  I got the impression that he was expressing criticism of the intelligence of his readers.  The book is long, redundant, exceedingly verbose and at times filled with pointless code breaking.  There is the issue of Eight Franklin Square.  One would think that a prominent members of the CIA's management would KNOW that there is no such address simply by programming it into their GPS in the Black SUV or by googling it.  Also anyone who has lived in D.C. for a long period of time gets to know that some building have numeric names that are not numerical in number.  WOW, but the CIA didn't know?       Then the CIA leader sends two principle people, Langdon and Katherine, off to a potential crime location with only ONE agent for protection.  Now let me see TWO principle suspects and ONE agent.  Is DB's CIA under a budget crunch?      Then you have Professor Langdon, sealed in a plexiglass box that is filling up with water, giving the secret to a \\"MADMAN\\" who had, let's see:  Cut off the hand of Langdon's dear friend; Stabbed a screw driver into the neck of a CIA agent (I did wonder where the MADMAN got the screw driver from).  Also the MADMAN killed a security guard, tied up Kathrine, the female that Langdon was travelling with, and oh yes and hit Langdon in the head with something that knocked him to the floor.  With all that death and distruction around Langdon, don't you think that a highly educated college professor would have come to a logical conclusion?  \\"IF I GIVE THIS LUNITIC THE ANSWER HE IS GOING TO KILL ME ANYWAY.\\"  Also, the college professor may ask \\"Hey crazy man wearing only a loin cloth, who keeps lying to me; \\"We have the hand, but where is the rest of my friend, that you promised that you would return if I broke the code?\\"         Also, there is one other thing that seemmed a little disturbing about this book:  Where are the D.C. police?  That Patterson fellow seems to hold the D.C. police in high reguard.  And here's a news flash for you goverment fans, The CIA does not have a charter that allows it to operate openly in the U.S. without the FBI being involved.  Hey, there's another prominent D.C. agency that was never mentioned; the FBI, this was a kidnapping case.  Oh well the book is FICTION.  And like all Dan Brown books, he takes valid agency and turn it into a bundle of hogwash.      I must admit that this book Lost Symbol is a \\"Page Turner\\", there were pages that I skipped out of sear boredom.  And like other reviewers, I was reminded of other Dan Brown books that seem to have a similar plot and the same characters.  Albino man or Tattooman, all have the same increadible physical power, spider like reactions, expanded wisdom and knowledge, and of course they have all disfigured themselves because they are insane.      If there is an abridged version of this book, I would highly recommend it.  But the full over five hundred pages version is burdonsome reading and at times just irritating.    Thanks for you attention
1591843162|5.0|Tribes was an amazing breakthrough book, but Linchpin is better. It's more important, more critical. Read it. Read it again. So much is changing, and the ones who do well are the ones who get this and use the message in this book.    Why are you here? If you're not indispensable - maybe you're not necessary and will be soon replaced by someone or something cheaper. Below are some excerpts from my blog about this: [...]    This book is potent stuff. Read it only if you want to be challenged and changed.    The idea of the book is that the linchpin, the little metal pin that holds the wheels on vehicles and machinery that holds the whole machine together, is a perfect metaphor of what we all need to do and become now. We do it by being artists and by giving.    This book is an impassioned plea for people not just to get up and lead, but to break out of the factory industrial capitalist model and stop following orders and being cogs in the machine. It calls for us to throw away the formulas that are embedded in our psyche's as \\"the resistance\\" to our own genius, and do the emotional labor needed to do our art - whatever that is - but also where ever we are, or need to be. I loved it how he said that for 90% of the cases, that probably means leaning into the job you have right now. And not waiting for permission from your boss to do great work.    In one chapter, Seth gives completely conflicting directions about what might be needed, and that's the point. One of the final chapters is \\"There Is No Map\\". True explorers make new maps for the people coming after them, even if it means they might fall off the edge of the world. That's also what an artist does - not necessarily with canvas and paintbrush. But maybe with Wordpress and a laptop, or with a contact list and a cell phone. What is your art?    It's hopeless to convey the message of the book in a few paragraphs. Get it. Read it. More than once. Read the books it points to.    Thank you Seth Godin! You're truly indispensable.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|This is one of the most original films that I have ever seen.  It turns so many notions of normal hollywood filmmaking on their head that I think it is great satire based on realism.  Not only do we start off knowing that the principal character that is doomed by his character flaws, but its great beauty/prize - Marisa Berenson in her prime - comes across as dull and plain as a doornail.  THere is not a single redeeming character, and even its climax - the duel with his step son - is a comedy of errors.  Perhaps the funniest moment in the film is a death by heart attack.<br /><br />The result is a marvelously lush tour of the underbelly of the late 18C British aristocracy in the context of the wider society, with strict attention to period realism.  Virtually all emotion, as witnessed by the viewer, is vapid, self-seeking, deluded, and in the end pathetic.  When action abruptly occurs, and there are plenty of vivid bursts of it, it comes too late to do much good.<br /><br />The theme, I believe, is decadence, a doomed order just prior to the French and Industrial Revolutions.  Disillusioned at every turn, Redmond Barry is stripped of his dignity and humanity by a trick and then enlistment in the military, reasserts himself as an interloper into the aristocracy, and imposes his cruelty and cynicism on everyone.  His only redeeming features are a few relationships, which invariably are doomed or abandoned, except for his tough mother.  It is truly bleak.<br /><br />Though completely unsympathetic, the actors are wonderful.  O'Neal is brilliant as a guileful fool.  Berenson, a pampered weakling full of romantic illusion, has nothing whatsoever interesting about her.<br /><br />As it did 35 years ago, this film utterly rivetted me.  As many reviewers have noted, the print is regrettably mediocre.  But this is a classic.  REcommended.

1591843162|4.0|Seth's newest book is simply the next step in his journey of discovering truth that can set us free(He's leading his Tribe and blazing the most exciting trail ever). Free to think and respond the way we where always meant to.  I have only read a small section of the book so far (the part about the opportunity to live/think like an Artist-someone who gives so much more then JUST THEIR TIME and a little energy).  Seth helps us get past our selfish way of thinking and is leading us to a life that is a whole lot more fun - not to mention successful- which is simply a by product of something... almost holy.  Thank God for truth without religion as its God.

He cracks the rules open and expands our possibilities. I always find his observations fresh and insightful and this book is no exception.     It's easy to do what my friend calls \\"bible dipping\\" in this book. Let a page fall open and receive the message and inspiration you needed today.
B000UBMWG4|1.0|1* is rating this as an Item  recieved not the quality or content of the Movie!<br />This was bought as a gift for my husband who is a big fan of the film so should have been the perfect gift.  The main issue was the double copy of the work print as many others have said in review but as we are UK resident replacing the disk is taking time though Warners in the UK say they are sorting this out for him.  There where also issue with poor packing of the item resulting in a broken case but obviously thats an issue to be sorted out with Amazon.  He has yet to see the final cut but has watched all the alternate versions and no doubt when he gets a copy of the final cut he will be on cloud 9, as so many say the blu ray Final cut is stunning. Till then he says he will \\"dream of electric sheep\\" and hopes no one finds him out !
1591843162|5.0|As a career and life coach I see highly competent people struggling with the volatility in the workplace.  Like sea gulls at the docks, many have come to expect that there will be a company to supply their every need.  But in Linchpin, Seth clearly dismantles the idea of security coming from a company.  Rather, it must come from the individual.  Is that terrifying to thousands of talented people - absolutely.  But it should also be encouraging as Seth goes on to show how to take ones skills and become \\"indispensable.\\"<br /><br />The idea of money for time is a relatively recent one.  Seth peels back our country's history to show that being guaranteed pay for time is an artificial business model that cannot hold up.  We've seen the demise of organizations like the auto manufacturers that tried to make that model work.  Ultimately a company can only compensate for results.<br /><br />Those who accept this responsibility (and opportunity) will love Linchpin.  Those who long for the good old days of picking up a paycheck each Friday, having a 401k, medical benefits and a company car, will be devastated to learn the truth about the new workplace.
044654146X|5.0|In the past few decades, the tiny nation of Israel (7.05 million population) has become a powerhouse of technical innovation. Just sixty years old, surrounded by sworn enemies, harassed around the globe by left-wingers, Israel itself is largely bereft of natural resources. It depends on the entrepreneurial will and skills of its people and their talents in engineering, technology and other professions.<br /><br /> Authors Senor and Singer attempt to tell the story of Israel's current thriving economy in a direct manner, but to get there they must first tell of the nation's roots in socialism, explain how the military threats and economic boycotts arrayed against the nation have, paradoxically, strengthened the country. Then there is the story of immigrants: Israel is largely a nation of immigrants ranging from illiterate Ethiopians to sophisticated Soviet &eacute;migr&eacute;s with advanced degrees.<br /><br /> The authors handle the explanation of the history well, interweaving it with the story of the present. Especially important is the confluence of the technology explosion, the trend toward globalization, Israel's own educational and military establishments and the influx of Soviet Jews.<br /><br /> Intel was the first major tech company to establish itself in Israel. Its success and the technology revolution set off a wave of entrepreneurial activity in Israel, aided by the influx of venture capital.<br /><br /> Overall, the story is absolutely fascinating. From 1980 through 2000, Israel registered 7,652 patents. Surrounding nations who are either avowed enemies or exist in cease fire status don't fare nearly as well. During the same period Saudi Arabia registered 181 patents; Egypt, 77; Kuwait, 52; UAE, 32; Syria, 20 and Jordan, 15. While Israel has one of the most highly educated populations in the world, the surrounding nations have some of the highest illiteracy rates on the globe. None of this augurs well for a peace that would allow Israel to devote less of its budget and energy to military defense.<br /><br /> Finally, the authors address the specter of a nuclear armed Iran. Personally I think the authors take too sanguine a view of the threat posed by Iran and the Obama administration's increasingly hostile attitude.<br /><br /> The authors are definitely high on Israel's prospects and sometimes the book sounds like a sophisticated Chamber of Commerce brochure. But they don't try to conceal their enthusiasm. The book is well researched with comprehensive footnotes and bibliography.<br /><br /> On the whole, the book is inspiring. Israel, despite many obstacles (many of them of its own making) has prospered on the cutting edge of technology and globalization. It is a living demonstration of the value of education, free trade and capitalism. If only more people would set aside their hatreds, the world would be a far better place.<br /><br />Jerryse.

1591843162|5.0|Seth is many thing but one of his most outstanding attributes is that ... Seth does unto himself before he asks others to do likewise. A doer, not a talker. A prover, not a postulator.

Seth shows the way to create meaning for yourself, regardless of the field.

B0027YUK98|2.0|Nothing subtle here at all, everything is maximized and overdone, from some extremely hushed playing which disturbs with its overly personal tone, to loud and frenzied playing. There is as a result no room for the music to breathe, or for the listener to let the music in, one is so confronted by the players. Moreover, Faust uses very little vibrato, and because the violin is miked far too closely, this is not a pleasant sound.

First, you experience Liz's agony as she is shattered by a torturous divorce and failed love affair. Then comes Italy, a totally fascinating, sensuous place with the most delicious food in the world.  Liz starts to relax and heal. Second, in India, you observe her quest for spirituality. Last, she goes to Indonesia also known as Bali to find balance and reunite with an old medicine man she met earlier.     Simply put, this novel is all about Liz and her feelings and experiences interspersed with some philosophy and history. Anyone who has experienced great pain in their life and hungers for spirituality will enjoy this book. It will give you hope that you can make a better life for yourself. Do you really need to go to Italy, India, or Indonesia to accomplish all those things? Probably not, but it would be a fascinating experience.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Great movie with special effects galore.  Was disappointed in the swearing (although minimal) especially taking God's name in vain.  Otherwise, with TV Guardian, it's a great movie!
0385737947|4.0|When Thomas wakes up alone in what seems to be a lift of some sort. He doesn't remember anything about who he is or how he got there. When he's pulled to the surface he's surrounded and not so warmly welcomed by a group of boys. The boys tell Thomas that he's in what they call the Glade, a large expanse of land surrounded by high stone walls. The boys are very secretive about everything his first day there and all he can think about is finding more answers to his many questions. The next day when a girl arrives in the lift everyone is shocked because a girl has never been sent up, and people have never been sent up two days in a row. The girl is also clutching in her hand a startling message for the Gladers. Thomas is shocked to feel like he knows this girl somehow.<br /><br />Locked away in his mind are the secrets to the glade and the people inside it, and Thomas knows that he must figure out who he is and what those secrets are before it's too late.<br /><br />It took me a couple chapters to really get into The Maze Runner, but with the help from some other bloggers I stuck with it. Good thing too because this story is pretty amazing, and it ended up on my list of top reads of 2009. The confusion Thomas feels is very real, he doesn't know where he came from, if he has a family, or if there is even a world outside of the Glade. This confusion and lack of knowledge is found in everyone he speaks to in the Glade. That is until Theresa arrives and makes Thomas realize there is more going on than a maze that seems unsolvable. Thomas and Theresa feel and have a special connection, and they know that they must have known each other before entering the Glade.<br /><br />While Thomas tries to figure out the way out of the maze, they encounter horrible monsters called Grievers. Talk about scary. I can't imagine being trapped in a maze with these nasty creatures. I was on edge anytime a Griever came into the picture, and anytime someone had to venture out into the maze. These kids are smart though, and most of them are willing to do whatever it takes to get out of the Glade and back to their lives (whatever those may be) OUTSIDE the maze. Others aren't so sure, some have been stung by the Grievers and seen glimpses into the outside world, and they don't seem to think leaving the Glade is such a good idea.<br /><br />This novel has a slow start, but it all builds up to an exciting adventure. I loved this book! The ending totally hooked me and I can't wait to see what Dashner has in store for us in Book 2!, and most of them are willing to do whatever it takes to get out of the Glade and back to their lives (whatever those may be) OUTSIDE the maze. Others aren't so sure, some have been stung by the Grievers and seen glimpses into the outside world, and they don't seem to think leaving the Glade is such a good idea.    This novel has a slow start, but it all builds up to an exciting adventure. I loved this book! The ending totally hooked me and I can't wait to see what Dashner has in store for us in Book 2!
0452287022|3.0|This book was neither here nor there.<br /><br />A young woman named Griet arrives at Vermeer's house to be a new servant.  She had some tragedy in her family and so ended up a maid.  As she gets to be part of the family, Vermeer allows her to help him, due to her artistic eye.  Eventually she poses for the famous \\"girl with a pearl earring\\" painting, which ends up being her undoing.<br /><br />The story seems like an episode of the old British drama \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" set in Holland with a coming of age story neatly tucked in it as well. The plot is somewhat interesting with one well developed character (Griet) and none others I cared about.<br /><br />However, the descriptions of 17th Century Holland, the class system and mercantile society were excellent, which by itself was worth finishing the book. The descriptions of how the paintings were painted were amusing as well and since I had the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" with 9 full color paintings I could flip back and forth, reading the descriptions and seeing what they pertained to.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin's new book expands on what may be his central idea: that generosity is not just an admirable and nice thing, but that it is an essential aspect of creativity and making meaning in life.    In this \\"4-Hour Workweek\\" world, it is moving to have Godin write about how generosity brings us closer, and of how real artists are always generous, and of how we all have the potential to create art with our work, whether we teach or write or serve coffee.    This is Godin's manifesto, his \\"What Now?\\" guide to a time in which the factory (in the broadest sense of the term) has failed us. The only rationale choice, he argues, is to become a linchpin: \\"an individual who can walk into chaos and create order, someone who can invent, connect, create, and make things happen.\\"    There's no map here, no guide to living the linchpin life. But Godin builds a powerful case for why we must think of our lives and careers differently than we have in the past, for why our primitive \\"lizard brain\\" will try to keep us from considering this new way of being, and (critically) of how inhabiting our genius is more than anything a conscious choice to overcome the brainwashing that has taught us to stand in line, raise our hands, and ask permission.    This is the Seth Godin book most difficult to summarize. And there's no doubt in my mind that it's his most important and radical book. Don't buy it for your college-age kid if you want her to work for one of the big accounting firms.    No, on second thought: please do. That world is dying and offers only the illusion of security. What we need to do now is become indispensable. This is a good place to start.
0439023483|5.0|This is the first book since the Da Vinci Code that I've been unable to put down. I am usually a strict bed-time fiction reader. But this book had me hooked all day yesterday. And since this is categorized (at least by my library) as \\"young adult\\" I feel obliged to point out that I'm a middle-aged man. Young adult? I LOVED this book and am anxious for the sequels.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|Very good album.  There are about four stand-out songs and the rest are catchy and by no means dull.  There is not a lot that is incredibly originally done here, but for some reason when put together the sound that comes out is new and refreshing.  I also found that the CD grew on me the more I listened to it.  A fine addition to a CD collection.
B002W1HBN4|4.0|The past several years have been very hard for Whitney Houston. But, she proved that she still is a driven voice to be heard loud and clear. With her comeback album I Look To You going platinum last month, and topping the Billboard charts in 6 countries worldwide, and debuting at #1 here, the world has deeply been reminded how powerful her songs have remained after all this time. For Whitney, it is also a time to celebrate not just being honored as the BET Honors Entertainer Of The Year for 2010, but for a icon whom is celebrating her 25th Anniversary. This year marks the 25th Anniversary since \\"The Voice\\" made her landmark first album, that the world fell in love with heart and soul. Now, Whitney's debut album has been re-issued and the voice still shines brightly as ever.<br /><br />The 2010 re-release of Whitney Houston: The Deluxe Anniversary Edition, celebrates Whitney's 25th Anniversary, and the makings of how Whitney made her way all the way to the top. All of the songs from the original album have been remastered brilliantly from start to finish, and include a few new surprises here as well. The collection includes all of the classic songs that were just great including the chart-toppers How Will I Know, You Give Good Love, Saving All My Love For You, her signature song The Greatest Love Of All, All At Once, and Hold Me with the recently departed Teddy Pendergrass. There are a few new additions as well, including a few dance mixes that are fair, but a surprising Acapella version of How Will I Know, which sounds amazing. Just the simplicity of that signature song, by the tone of Whitney's voice is one of the few remixes that is worth the effort.<br /><br />The DVD also works well, as Whitney and the producer whom discovered her, Clive Davis brings out their takes on the beginning when Whitney sang backup for her mother, all the way to her debut on the Merv Griffin show back in 1983 singing Home. There are also a few performances here too that are surprising, including her performance of the song from Dreamgirls, I Am Changing, to all of the 4 music videos that helped in the lanuch of the album.<br /><br />All in all, if you've never owned Whitney Houston's very first album, or if you've been a hard core fan of Whitney for years, this is definitely a must buy for your music collection. Whitney Houston: The Deluxe Anniversary Edition is a really great re-release that works well from start to finish, and a defining reason why Whitney has been giving us good love, and great songs after all these years in the spotlight. I absolutely recommend this album.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />DVD Extras: A-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+erformance of the song from Dreamgirls, I Am Changing, to all of the 4 music videos that helped in the lanuch of the album.

1591843162|5.0|Seriously.  Read it ... think about yourself, what you're doing, what you could be doing ... then make some moves.   If this book doesn't challenge you - read it again and this time be a little more honest with yourself.  Some folks may read this book so that they can help someone else.  But it won't be helpful if they don't make themselves indispensable first.  Linchpin is personal.
0307593525|5.0|Christmas gift for the wife and she seems to love it.  So far I have gotten a couple of french influenced soups and a Coq Au Vin outta the deal.  Get one for your wife soon.<br /><br />Wish I had more to add but I haven't even opened it, just tasted the results.
1591843162|5.0|I've met Seth Godin only once in person. I attended one of his personal jam sessions (my term, not his) in New York. He changes you.<br /><br />Not everyone gets that opportunity. However, I think Linchpin comes the closest to having your own personal jam session with Seth Godin.<br /><br />Having read many of Mr. Godin's books, I can tell you this is clearly the most personal to date. He talks very specifically about the changes that are occurring all around the \\"average\\" person. And he gives the gift of personally coaching us out of mediocrity and into indispensability--a critical skill in today's economy.<br /><br />Written in Seth Godin's signature manifesto style you will not only finish motivated, but also understanding the path to pursue.<br /><br />This book is a gift. You should get it. You should give it.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin truly has a gift to help you see things from an entirely new perspective you never before considered - or conveniently ignored.  Linchpin is a timely book that should be on the MUST READ LIST for every person who wants to successfully ride the wave of change that is occurring in our economy and workplaces.  This book contains the things you need to think about now - things that will help you best position yourself, your business, and/or your career so that no matter what changes come along, you can adapt to always be valuable and indispensable.<br /><br />Seth recently wrote a post on his blog entitled \\"It's Not The Rats You Need To Worry About\\" where he said, \\"If you want to know if a ship is going to sink, watch what the richest passengers do...If your ship is sinking, get out now. By the time the rats start packing, it's way too late.\\" ([...])<br /><br />Linchpin can be a lifeboat for you - teaching you what you need to know to understand how to turn difficulty into opportunities - IF you read it.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin doesn't follow the crowd.  He doesn't even lead the crowd.<br /><br />He creates a NEW crowd.<br /><br />In Linchpin, Seth shows how to add value by creating forward motion for ourselves and our organizations.<br /><br />His sage advice?  Don't wait for instructions. Figure it out.  Make it happen.<br /><br />My advice?  Buy a copy for yourself and everyone you know.  Read it and reap.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|This album is the first I've heard of Beach House and what a first impression they've made. I've completely fallen for this bittersweet little gem. Aptly named Teen Dream, this album runs the gamut of emotions but always seems filtered through a sense a dreamy sadness and dare I say, nostalgia. Victoria Legrand's voice is incredibly soulful and she clearly means every word she sings and Alex Scally's multi-instrumental talents, especially with guitar, help provide the background that allows her to flourish.<br /><br />Don't get the wrong idea, this album isn't all moody ambiance, there is plenty of meat here to keep you tuned in. One of my personal favorites is Silver Soul, which sounds exactly like having a crush feels (at least in my experience) and Norway is quickly becoming a music critic favorite for it's quick tempo, almost cheerful \\"Ah, Ah Ah\\" s, and wavering organ long notes(it sounds a little like it's being played under water).<br /><br />This is a great winter album you must own.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Turning a story with a sports theme into a good movie is often a challenge.  Too often, the viewer is left with clich&eacute;s.  This is not the case with \\"Invictus\\".  Clint Eastwood as director and producer has crafted a wonderful and moving tale.  It deserves a wide audience.<br /><br />The sport of Rugby Union is little known in America but the use of big name stars such as Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon playing the South African captain Francois Pienaar works well.  They were both truly convincing.  Damon in particular seemed to master the Afrikaans accent.<br /><br />\\"Invictus\\" is touching.  I frequently found myself almost moved to tears.  The story of how Mandela was able to look beyond simple revenge and move forward in the spirit of reconciliation was uplifting.  If only other nations could follow this example.  Mandela had much to be bitter about but proved that he was a bigger man.  In this way, he further condemned apartheid to the dustbin of history where it belongs.<br /><br />Many people will know the story of the 1995 World Cup.  South Africa as the host nation rose from the ranks of relative easy beats to become champions.  However, in Clint Eastwood's hands we are provided with more than a simple tale of underdog victory.  This is a very tired story.  Instead, Eastwood homes in on both the bigger picture and the touching interplay between Mandela and Pienaar.  Eastwood is getting better with age.  When most men are in retirement at his age, he continues to dazzle.  He is an inspiration himself.<br /><br />Go see this film.  Your effort will be rewarded.

B0015AARJI|4.0|The standard controller is great, if a bit pricey.  It responds pretty well and has that familiar PS feel to it.  However, I wish there was a way to charge the controller without the PS3 (maybe there is, but I don't know if it works with other USB chargers.)  There is no batter check on the controller itself either, which would have been helpful.
0316044938|5.0|This WAS my favorite book about 2 years ago.  I really feel like the movie is taking away the feeling the book left me with.   Either way I suggest you ignore the movie hype and trailers/ or the entire movie if, God Forbid you watched it.   Read this book and shut out any picture of the movie your brain has. This book is great! I cried once or twice while reading this book on the train to work.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|It says something for the enduring qualities of Jane Austen's romantic comedy \\"Emma\\" that it gets redone every few years for television or the movies.  The latest (2009) BBC production reproduces, more or less faithfully, Jane Austen's novel at a length of four hours, framed by excellent production values and superb period sets, costumes, and carriages.<br /><br />As the story has it, the rich, handsome and clever Emma Woodhouse imagines herself to be the able matchmaker of the village of Highbury, a role she takes on against the advice of her older and wiser friend Mr. Knightley.  The energetic Emma succeeds mostly in entangling the lives of several people, including her own.  The show offers some excellent comedy wrapped around what is a coming of age journey for Emma.<br /><br />Romola Garai is an expressive Emma.  Michael Gambon is a very good Mr. Woodhouse, capturing the many quikrs of Jane Austen's original.  Johnny Lee Miller ends up being fairly good Mr. Knightley, even if he looks a little young for the 16 year age difference with Emma, with whom he eventually works up some good chemistry.  The supporting cast is quite good.  Blake Ritson is spot-on as the pretentious Reverend Elton, while Rupert Evans is equally good as Frank Churchill.<br /><br />This version of \\"Emma\\" is highly recommended as good entertainment to fans of Jane Austen and of PBS' Masterpiece Theater.
0307454541|5.0|This book was great. It was a mystery novel that delivered. The end was not obvious. It unraveled perfectly. I love this book. The first couple of chapters were difficult to get through but I am so glad I kept reading!
B001B1T7BU|5.0|Fashion designer Anita and computer-game writer Roger meet, fall in love and marry along with their dalmatians Perdita and Pongo. But the proud dogs' puppies are kidnapped by Anita's boss Cruella De Vil, who is stealing young dalmatians to make the coat she has set her heart on. Enlisting the help of the British animal kingdom, Pongo and Perdita set out to find and rescue all ninety-nine pups from their fearsome captors, Jasper and Horace. \\"101 Dalmatians\\" is perfectly good clean children entertainment. It's has a fun feeling and atmosphere and some great characters. Glenn Close is perfectly cast as &uuml;ber-villain Cruella De Vil and portrays a highly memorable character. She truly is the highlight of the movie and steals the show. If you liked the cartoon as a kid, you'll love this version as well. Sit down with your family and enjoy this movie.

078324228X|4.0|Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, an African-American man who rose above his troubled youth to become a top contender for the middle-weight boxing title. However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed. Denzel Washington is so convincing as Rubin Carter that one forgets that he is, indeed, an actor playing a role. From the beginning to the end, Denzel is perfect. Anyone who enjoys superb acting and a story with a rewarding, emotional ending should not miss this movie.
B00164KYV4|3.0|One of the longest predictable \\"chick flicks\\" I have ever seen, 'He's Just Not That Into You' is pretty easy to watch because of a great cast. Even though you know where it's going, the ride is entertaining. It's not nearly as cleaver as it thinks it is, but it doesn't feel as long as its two hour running length either. I'm sure this will appeal to women more than men(duh!), but with a cast that includes Scarlet Johansson, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck,Jennifer Connelly and many more, this film is hard to dislike.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Swackhammer, owner of the amusement park planet Moron Mountain is desperate get new attractions and he decides that the Looney Tune characters would be perfect. He sends his diminutive underlings to get them to him, whether Bugs Bunny & Co. want to go or not. Well armed for their size, Bugs Bunny is forced to trick them into agreeing to a competition to determine their freedom. Taking advantage of their puny and stubby legged foes, the gang selects basketball for the surest chance of winning. However, the Nerdlucks turn the tables and steal the talents of leading professional basketball stars to become massive basketball bruisers known as the Monstars. In desperation, Bugs Bunny calls on the aid of Micheal Jordan, the Babe Ruth of Basketball, to help them have a chance at winning their freedom. Space Jam is a very enjoyable movie featuring probably the most popular cartoon characters ever. Space Jam has all the humor of the classic shorts that made us love Bugs, Daffy and all the rest. This is a must for children and adults.
B00164GDD2|3.0|Well i have to hand it to all of you who already added reviews citing poor visual quality w/ this blu ray transfer. It's true and it dropped my rating of this movie from a 4 to a 3, although it will always be a classic that brings me back to the golden age of action/adventure movies, the 80's.<br />Realistically speaking, i do understand that the analog video media of 1984 did have quality shortcomings as compared to the digital media of today, that goes without saying. But regardless of this movie being in the 16.9 1080p blu-ray format or not, the \\"graininess\\" of the picture was in fact way too noticable for me. Not on all but on many occassions, especially in some of my favorite action parts (battle with Gozer and Stay Puft M-man, the crossing proton beams end-scene) as well as comedy highlights like Weaver's body floating off the bed and Venkman's showdown in the mayor's office with \\"this man has no dick\\" Peck.<br />I did notice the colors of the film to be somewhat more vivid than the DVD version, but the sound whether you run thru 5.1 or 7.1 surround is standard, nothing really \\"jumping out\\" or impressive in the soundtrack. Ray Parker Jr's famous hit title song actually sounds kind of \\"mono\\" like while its playing on the main menu screen, and this is with full 5.1 Dolby or 5 Channel Stereo setting on my system.<br />Extras on the disk are OK but nothing too special. All in all, I do recommend this movie in this format if you're hell bent on upgrading your entire DVD collection or you're the type who \\"has to have\\" blu-ray regardless of quality. Keep in mind, the DVD version of this movie also has the graininess and sound imperfections i mentioned earlier. But if visual defects are the least of your worries, then save yourself at least 15 bucks and get the DVD. You'll pat yourself on the back later!
630514415X|4.0|Jake Shuttlesworth is in prison serving time for killing his wife in a violent family feud. He is released on parole, but with one condition - he must persuade his son, genius basketball player Jesus to sign with the governor's alma mater university, Big State. And Jake only has a week to do it. Spike Lee's He Got Game is a beautifully shot and well-executed exploration of the role that the sport of basketball plays in the relationship between a father and his estranged son. The definitive sense of Spike's style that was quite apparent throughout this movie. Denzel, as usual, excellently handles his role as the intense father, and is utterly believable in both his emotion-laden and his violent, angry scenes. This movie is a important accomplishment and should be seen.
1591843162|5.0|Those of us who have followed Seth Godin have found fulfillment and enlightenment in what we do. Seth's new book is remarkable. It opens our minds - helps us to understand the Achilles heel of work and life.     It should be classified as business, philosophy, self-help and a must read for those open to creating a better business and life environment.  Just imagine if Linchpin was required reading for every 9th grader. Just imagine how it will change each of their lives and create a better future.     Meanwhile those wanting fulfillment in what they do will understand Seth's concern that \\"Most feel the fear and react to it.\\"  Embrace his mantra of \\"Just acknowledge it and then proceed.\\" Seth wants us to \\"lean into the fear\\". He says, don't respond and don't react, lean hard and make a difference by initiating. Great things happen when we conquer fear to create art and when we believe in the power of interaction.     I was fortunate to receive an advance copy and have read Linchpin through once and the adrenaline is high - I'm rereading to internalize. As the book says, \\"Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient.\\"  Thanks Seth for your art. Your gift of insight will spread as we all learn the power of art, interaction, gifting and the importance of \\"shipping,\\"
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Arnie Cunningham is a typical high school nerd who is picked on, overruled by his parents, and has very few friends. Until he meets Christine, a run-down 1958 Plymouth Fury and buys her. Arnie learns that Christine has a thing for him and devotes his time to restoring her to mint condition. But overtime, Arnie begins to change and becomes disconnected with reality and his friends. Arnie's girlfriend Leigh and best friend Dennis find out that Christine's previous owner cared about nothing else when he bought her and find out that Arnie is becoming just like him. The only way they can bring Arnie back to reality is to destroy Christine, but Arnie and Christine are ready to destroy them first and any one else who gets in their way. Christine is a classic horror movie that delivers on the good scares. I still have a hard time watching it. This is one of the rare horror movie that is  very enjoyable. I highly recommend that you see this movie if you get the chance, it's a classic.

B000V4UFZK|5.0|While living an an average family house in a pleasant neighborhood, the youngest daughter of the Freeling family, Carol Anne, seems to be connecting with the supernatural through a dead channel on the television. It is not for long when the mysterious beings enter the house's walls. At first seeming like harmless ghosts, they play tricks and amuse the family, but they take a nasty turn they horrify the family to death with angry trees and murderous dolls, and finally abduct Carol Anne into her bedroom closet, which seems like the entrance to the other side.<br /><br />Poltergeist is quite the genuine horror thriller. It pulls you inside its devious mind like the little girl being sucked into the white noise of the television portal. The characters are believable and the suspence hits you stone cold, like a boxer's right jab in your face. Poltergeist is certainly one of the most influential supernatural movies of its generation.  Poltergeist will shake your norms and rattle your soul.
B000002L42|5.0|It's really interesting that after years of being absent from the music scene and stage performance,in both cases largely due to musical perfectionism that Steely Dan's comeback would come in the form of a live album. In the end we learn that for a band so oriented towards the studio even the liner notes of this CD ponder how songs like \\"Babylin Sisters\\" will sound live. Being the first song in this performance the answer is...it sounds really really good. Not all that different from the studio version only minus a layer of studio gloss and a crisper sound overall. Perhaps due to it being their personel favorite album or just it's commercial neglect Becker & Fagan devote a lot of this album to live versions of songs from their 1976 [[ASIN:B00003002D The Royal Scam]]. And I can't say I blame them. They couldn't have had their late 70's breakthroughs without that album and even with the more traditionally jazzy,less electric treatments of \\"Green Earings\\",\\"Kid Charlemagne\\" and \\"Sign In Stranger\\" are all powered up not only by somewhat extended lenghs but adventurous instrumental solos and the fact the pair still have their own unique musical and vocal flavors intact. That's another important part of this album;Steely Dan had all their favorite session musicians along for the ride so somehow they were able to make these live renditions sound both fresh and original and not xerox the studio versions. Both \\"Reelin' In The Years\\" and \\"Bodhisttva\\" benfit greatly from cutting back on the rockier originals and presenting them in their more jazz-funk style of their later period. \\"Josie\\",\\"Peg\\" and \\"Aja\\",all more dramatic on the original [[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]] are much more relaxed and less kinetic than their studio counterparts.The drum solo on \\"Aja\\" in particular is slowed right to a crawl,same as the tempo of all the songs and again that slowlness brings out more funk than rock fusion and here,as it did on their late 70's,early 80's music really went along with their general musical and personel style very well. They even throw in a version of Walter Becker's \\"Book Of Liars\\" from his [[ASIN:B000002L2L 11 Tracks of Whack]] as a little surprise I suppose. One thing the instrumentation on this album really makes clear is Steely Dan were a funk band in their heart of hearts. Not as if we didn't know that already. Not only that but they manage even here on stage they had their own distinct approch to it.with their general musical and personel style very well. They even throw in a version of Walter Becker's \\"Book Of Liars\\" from his [[ASIN:B000002L2L 11 Tracks of Whack]] as a little surprise I suppose. One thing the instrumentation on this album really makes clear is Steely Dan were a funk band in their heart of hearts. Not as if we didn't know that already. Not only that but they manage even here on stage they had their own distinct approch to it.
1591843162|4.0|To post this makes me a bit conflicted.  First, it might promote sameness (in posting my art since lots of others might do it) and secondly, it is distracting me from my goals of shipping my art.  However, I'll review and prmote Seth's gift to everyone. (huh? read the book to understand)    Mr. Godin underscores the eternal conflict between our hearts (and the things we know are right, the things we know we have to do) and the notion of sameness, conformity, and lowest cost delivery; which he says is a recent phenomena in world history. Yet, sameness has been promoted for as long as there have been slaves (ala some of the 7 wonders in the world.)    Linchpin inspires those who need inspiration. Who might benefit the most?  The many folks who went through the dot com crisis and are feeling as though they have been marginalized.  Who should read it but won't?  The very people he identifies as having fallen into the trap of sameness and the ones who benefit by their exertions.    (This would have gotten five stars but it is unattributed (no references.) This might fulfill Mr. Godin's notion of shipping; however, it doesn't satisfy those who wish to dive deeper into the individual notions he promotes.)
B000001FT0|5.0|From [[ASIN:B000001FSY Arc of a Diver]] on Steve Winwood was assured that the 80's was going to be his decade as a solo performer. Throughout this album he manages to maintain a style that was artistic,distinctive,vibrant and meaningful. Pop and rock were not exactly in a hugely innovative state at this particular point and the textural,somewhat orchestral soulfulness and funkiness achieved on this and the the previous album were....not unlike that of another multi-instrumental singer/songwriter named Steve who,in his case achieved had his artisitc pinnacle in the previous decade. This album isn't in fact all that different from the previous album except that it's less abstract in nature and the arrangements and songwriting is fuller. Comparing it to the career that other Steve W this was to it's predecessor what [[ASIN:B00004S36A Talking Book]] had been to [[ASIN:B00004S367 Music of My Mind]]. \\"Valerie\\" would become a hit in a revised and more obviously 80's style remix several years after this but here in it's mildly rawer original version it has it's own spicy groove. The difference between the versions has a lot to do with production. Rhythmic and melodic ideas from jazz-pop,R&B,rock and funk weave there way through this music with little ends in between. The more traditional R&B oriented sounds are heard more obviously in the heavily gospel inflected slow tunes such as the organ led \\"While There's A Candle Burning\\",\\"It was Happening\\" and the wonderful closer \\"There's A River\\";it's a pity that song wasn't better known in it's day. \\"Big Girls Walk Away\\",\\"And I Go\\" and \\"Still In The Game\\" all have this vital new wave rock n soul sound that was as individual,if far less slick than anything Hall & Oates were putting out at this time. \\"Help Me Angel\\" with it's multi tracked clavinets is one of the catchiest and most rhythmically funk oriented tunes on the album with a killer groove and hook that won't quit. A lot of people seem to like this song and I'm really glad to see that. The title track is more obviously contemporary but no less funky in a brooding,reflective night time kind of way and the picturesqe lyrical landscape. Again the presense of multi layered keyboards/synthesizers provide a strong and solid move by means of musical texture. As a person just beginning to create his own music playing all the instruments himself I have to say that it's variations on this type of sound that really produce a vibrant atmosphere where creativity and communication with listeners both intermingal into something that is able to reach a lot of people with different places from where they view music.and I'm really glad to see that.

1595141715|4.0|The Book Thirteen Reasons Why, by Jay Asher, is all about Hannah Baker's suicide. Throughout the book Clay Jensen, a boy in Hannah's graduating class, is listening to the tapes trying to discover what he had to do with her death. The problem is that the suspense is killing Clay. How would you handle finding out that you had something to do with a classmate's suicide?           My favorite part of the book is the ending, but I don't want to ruin the story. I don't think I could find anything I didn't like about the book. Everything that happened, like the parties or the small mistakes causing huge, negative effects, were all so similar- if not exactly the same- as things happening in high school lives today. Overall the book was entertaining and really made an Impact on me. We don't realize how much a simple \\"hello\\" or \\"how are you?\\" can change people's decisions.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|Like Seth Godin's blog, he constantly delivers value to the reader with this book.  While I continue to struggle with what he calls the \\"resistance\\", Seth's book works especially well because he is the main example of someone that has been able to overcome the resistance and make himself indispensable.  I will re-read this book, take notes and hope to put in practice the concepts he explains.    I received this book pre-publication through a blog post by Seth.  In return for donating to a great organization, The Acumen Fund, Seth sent out copies of Linchpin.  His unique way of distributing books to interested parties ahead of publication raised $108,000 in two days, got the book into several thousand motivated readers and helped make untold new connections through the Acumen Fund.    This is the kind of gift-giving that Seth promotes in the book.  The old adage that what you give comes back to you tenfold applies here.  Of course, the gift is not given with the expectation of getting something back -- that would, by definition, not be a gift.    Bottom line - if you want to excel in the world today, you need to become a linchpin.  This book helps to set your course.
1591843162|5.0|We are in the middle of a revolution. Jobs have gone offshore and they are not coming back. 401K's have been cut by half. Unemployment is the highest it's been in decades. Fear is everywhere. The middle class is under tremendous pressure.<br /><br />Godin sees the pain clearly, but he also sees a once in a lifetime opportunity in the situation to create value and become indispensable by taking the intellectual initiative.<br /><br />You begin by making a decision to overcome the fear and anxiety associated with leading and connecting. Then you train yourself to become what Godin calls a \\"linchpin,\\" someone who adds unique value.<br /><br />Godin has identified 7 abilities of a linchpin:<br />1. Providing unique interface between members of an organization<br />2. Delivering unique creativity<br />3. Managing a situation of great complexity<br />4. Leading customers<br />5. Inspiring staff<br />6. Deep domain knowledge<br />7. Possessing a unique talent<br /><br />Godin shows what each of these abilities looks like in the real world, and tells how people have trained themselves to develop them.<br /><br />Linchpin is Godin's most ambitious book and his best. Two small sections are worth the entire price of the book: On page 101 Godin explains \\"Resistance\\" and on page 146 he tells how he gets projects done.<br /><br />Get this book. You deserve it!

1591843162|5.0|Growing up I learned a great deal about how things worked in the physical world from working outdoors with my father. Most days we would have at least a few hours to work on our property using a bright orange Kubota tractor. My job was linchpin keeper. If you change a part in the machine, you have to make sure you replace the linchpins or the whole thing will eventually fall apart. Seth Godin's latest book is entitled Linchpin. A linchpin is indispensable and this title instantly made sense to me.<br /><br />Linchpin is his 12th book. This one impacted me almost as much as his ninth book The Dip. In his most recent book, Tribes, he encouraged us to lead. In Linchpin he goes further, pleading with the reader to be the indispensable member of a tribe.<br /><br />In our society linchpins are those individuals that hold things together. Yes, organizations might succeed or thrive for a while without them, but eventually as pressure is applied and structures are tested, things will fall apart. Mr. Godin clearly illustrates that we are in a critical time of history. The age of cogs and factories worked for a while, but everything has changed. A new breed of worker and leader are now required. We need linchpins to solve our problems, keep us connected, and inspire us with art. People who are linchpins are creative, good at connecting with others, and able to see solutions like no one else. They truly are indispensable.<br /><br />As Seth Godin explains this concept to his readers, he turns their minds upside down in order to convince them that they are in some way capable of being one. It can be a bit disconcerting that he refrains from handing us a roadmap, since we are a society reared on self help books. Instead, he explains how we got here, criticizing the public education system for creating cogs to fill factories and consumers to buy what they produce. He quotes Woodrow Wilson in his argument that we get exactly what we focus on. In the end we wind-up with drones that do what they are told.<br /><br />There is no shortage of pundits today that criticize the flaws of our education system, but few will offer a solution. He challenges teachers to inspire student to think instead of follow rulebooks and ace tests. He even goes as far as telling us to give ourselves a D for the rut we have fallen into.<br /><br />In his chapter titled The Resistance he leaves the reader very unsettled and challenged to no longer be ruled by anxieties and everything that holds us into complacency. Throughout the book I could not help but reflect on the story told in the movie Apollo 13. Three linchpins stand out, each one indispensable to the mission. Astronaut Ken Mattingly puts away his frustration from being pulled from the mission to spend hours in the simulator to solve a problem and bring his friends home. Nasa Engineer and master innovator John Aaron works endlessly with Mattingly. In the film Gene Kranz played by Ed Harris makes the ultimate call for his linchpins to do what they do best, \\"Let's work the problem people. Let's not make things worse by guessing.\\" We love stories like this because we don't really grow up hoping to be conveyor belt operators or stuck in cubicles doing meaningless work. We dream of changing our world.<br /><br />Linchpin could be Mr. Godin's greatest work so far. He treats the subject with history and sociology as well as a compelling mix of fact, story and philosophy. Using examples that will both shock and inspire, Linchpin leaves you feeling like you have no choice but to reassess your current situation and make the changes he so eloquently urges us toward.There is no shortage of pundits today that criticize the flaws of our education system, but few will offer a solution.

B002QW7ALM|5.0|There are very few sci-fi movies that manage to be both suprising and creepy; the first two Alien movies probably succeeded the most successfully. However, this interesting piece of work just might rival those movies. I don't want to go into too much detail, but this movie has a very good plot that twists and turns. It's full of atmosphere that truly makes one feel a sense of dread. There is also a huge mystery which is satisfyingly solved at the end. It's probably the best sci-fi movie I have seen years because of it's originality and ideas. (Yes, even better than Avatar.) If you like sci-fi, you will like this.

0307269981|1.0|I thought this book was a disaster; I plowed my way through the half of it and was bored out of my mind. The writing is so tedious and full of irrelevant details that at some point one stops caring to find out \\"whodunit\\". The author has just stopped short of describing how many times the heroes go on the toilet ; everything else (including long shopping lists and the explanations of whether the payment at the grocery store was done by cash or a credit card) is there. I was surprised to learn that the author was an editor; this book would certainly benefit from major editorial cuts, I would say by about 50%. There is no dynamism in the plot despite rivers of blood, violence and multiple murders; the whole thing is dragging along as a half-dead slug. The characters are quite flat and do not sound true;  even though the heroine is supposed to have a very unusual and unique personality, her character and her originality are those of a Martian - utterly unbelievable. I consider time spent on this book a complete waste. This is one of those cases where saving a tree would definitely have been a greater contribution to the humankind.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Beach House have been working quietly and steadily since their 2006 debut, amassing fans, styles, and sounds along the way. Teen Dream is the most fully realized album by Beach House to date, filled to the brim with their signature lush melodies and dreamy ambiance. This album pushes into decidedly shoegazey territory, bringing to mind the masterful works of the Cocteau Twins. But Beach House are no style thieves, and Teen Dream sounds like a unique work, heavily inspired by history's great dream pop acts without being a copycat. The songs are lilting and beautiful, and easily the most compelling compositions to date for the band. Songs like \\"Zebra\\" and \\"Silver Soul\\" are powerhouses, pushing the band into new and daring territory without sacrificing a thing that has made them so successful within their sphere. This is a must-have album for dream pop fans. Expect plenty of critical praise.

1591843162|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading Linchpin early as one of the people who donated to Acumen Fund in order to get an advance copy. I think the first thing that stuck me about Linchpin is that I felt more of a personal connection to Seth when I was reading the book. He wrote in the Introduction - This time it is personal and he meant it. He truly wants people to find and live a life of purpose that allows them to become indispensable. The first half of the book deals with some history about how and why the world of work has evolved from a management and labor team to a third team that includes Linchpins. It also explains what it is to be a Linchpin and how to become why. And, especially why you would want to be one.    Then on page 101 and about half-way through, Seth introduces us to THE RESISTANCE that is shaped and guided by our lizard brain that wants us to run from anything that feels like a risk.     The chapter on The Resistance alone is worth the price of the book.    You'll hear about the powerful culture of gifts and a definition of art that you might not have heard before. It is an incredibly important concept and one to read closely. Leading and connecting are also discussed as are the seven abilities of a Linchpin.    I believe that this is a very important book and the best that Seth Godin has ever written.
0812973992|5.0|One city. One tightrope walker. A million lives affected, including this one.<br /><br />Colum McCann's masterful mosaic, \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is a collection of interwoven stories that seemingly are disconnected, but often many, unforced, beautiful connections. An Irishman seeking out his brother the priest, a group of Bronx hookers, an uptown woman mourning her son, a man daring to span two tall buildings, all play significant parts in this story, a story of many, many surprises. Writing from a multi-character perspective, McCann manages to inhabit even the most minor character, expanding it rapidly and creating an immense world of their own, sometimes within a few pages.<br /><br />As I delved into this book (which isn't necessarily quick nor easy), the complexity of the story, as well as McCann's writing style, appealed. Somehow channeling his Walt Whitman side, McCann's listing and quick descriptions bring to life New York in the 70's, as well as the rich, inner interiors of the characters. It's that rich.<br /><br />Upon finishing the last page, I so wanted to return to the first, which is a rare feeling for me. But I realized, in my haste to read this book, that I unintentionally ignored some characters, writing them off as minor, but in the end, are major, which, in itself, brings the idea of why do we diminish some characters and raise the profile of others? At any rate, I so want to revisit this book. It's hard, complex, real, and heartbreaking, all at once.

0061245097|4.0|One Foot in the Grave brings us Part II of Cat & Bones. It packs a hard punch and leaves you craving more. I LOVELOVED this book. Great read- I would recommend it to ANY paranormal fan. I also absolutely love the covers of every book in this series! This is the second installment of the Night Huntress Series. Now, for the goods:<br /><br />The flow of this book and its plot is so smooth- the dialogue is witty and made me giggle. Frost packed this baby full of action and yummy love scenes. (Caution: These scenes are HOT! haha) There is one love scene that was very unique and EXTRA spicy- haven't read a love scene quite like this before. Yay for new ideas!! I love Jeaniene Frost.<br /><br />Something else that struck me as peculiar- Frost began this story FOUR YEARS after the ending to \\"Halfway to the Grave.\\" That is also pretty unique in itself. I can't decide if I like that we lost 4 years of Cat & Bones being delicious or not. Either way- I love 'fresh' ideas, and I don't read many paranormal romance novels that do this. During this 4 year time lapse, Cat has spent all her time as a federal agent, training her own speciailized team of vampire killers. Is anyone else glad they didn't have to read about Cat training a bunch of men? The guys on Cat's team are great and hilarious- a wonderful addition. I hope they're a big part of the series. Now. Bones. Bones. Bones. I love anything and everything about this gorgeous man. Hopefully Cat persuades me more in the third installment that she is better for Bones than I am ;o)<br /><br />Now...Training and maintaining a special ops group is not all Cat has done in the past 4 years. She has spent her personal time pining and trying to adjust to a life without Bones. She has failed- she still constantly has him at the back of her mind. Finally, she is trying to conquer her feelings for Bones when she begins dating Noah- a vet. While attending her best friend's quickie wedding, she runs into one of the biggest surprises ever. An unexpected guest. She reunites with her old buddy when things heat up almost immediately. (MMMMmmm...) Not to bring the mood down (hehe), but there are then several sudden attempts on Cat's life at this point... And she is forced to trust her boss, her friends, her crew and even Bones once again. Is trust as easy as it sounds? She seems to think so- However those that surround her don't. During the search for the person (or thing?) that put $$$ on Cat's head, facts begin to pile up about her heritage that she hadn't known. Uh oh.<br /><br />The only thing that I missed in this book was that Cat seemed more innocent and naive in the first book. But, that just means we have had some awesome character development and Cat is growing up and seeing the world for what it is. I don't think there were quite as many funny one liners in this book, but the book still made me laugh here and there. Like I said about the first in this series- I will never trade this book in for another- it is a keeper on my bookshelf. I can't wait to read more!!he reunites with her old buddy when things heat up almost immediately. (MMMMmmm...)

0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan surpassed my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed joining Percy Jackson on his first adventure. I love the Harry Potter series, so this was one of the recommendations on Amazon. I'm glad I took the chance and read it because this book is so much fun. Half-God. Half-Boy. That alone leads to a brilliant plot. The characters are extremely quirky and likable, you will find yourself relating to each of them and wanting to know more.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is 12 years old and realizes his life is about to get complicated when his math teacher literally turns into a creature from hell. Is Percy insane for slaughtering his math teacher with a pen? Why doesn't anyone else remember her?<br /><br />There were many times when humor smacked me in my face- I like being surprised with humor and this book had lots of that. Yep, I giggled with the characters AND I got to fight demons. Talk about a book taking you places! We get to watch Percy figure out who he is and what he is capable of. You will find yourself enthralled with the imagery of the sea, demigod camp and creatures.<br /><br />In short, Percy finds out he is a demigod. He has to live at a camp so that the monsters can't endanger him and those around him. We find out the god who fathered him and what he must do to keep a war at bay between the greater gods. We even get to tag along with Percy as he fulfills his first dangerous quest.<br /><br />This book is aimed at children from the ages of 8 - 12. That didn't hold me back! I read this book in a day because I couldn't put it down. It was action packed from page one. If you're into YA and you can do without romance- read this book. I can't wait until I have time to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />I have one complaint- it was relatively predictable. I'm guessing this is only because I'm 23 reading a book that was written for a younger demographic. The predictability didn't take away from the novel, I loved it all. Who doesn't like being one step ahead of our hero and heroine?and heroine?
B00001R3GS|4.0|Item info: Vinyl 180g.  Audiophile Quality.  Faithfully Restored.  Limited Edition.  Unfortunately there are no special items included with the release.<br /><br />My 20c in the Vinyl vs CD Debate:  They are two different formats that have advanteges and disadvantages over each other.  I am not a fanatic that believes the only way to appreciate music is to only listen to vinyl.  I read a great post - If we wanted to really appreciate early Louis Armstrong recordings does that mean that to appreaciate them is to listen to old 78s? The reason why a lot of people use the word \\"warmth\\" when they refer to the sound the vinyl gives off is that CD is clearer than vinyl, and doesn't hide all the neuances of the recording like vinyl.  Anyway, lets get to the review.<br /><br />This is a classic period album not just from the REM Cannon, but a classic album from the 80's.  I have just started collecting vinyl albums and this is a great place to start from.  The album comes in heavy (compared to normal vinyl) 180g which produces a wonderful feeling when listening to it.  The album has three classic tracks from the alternative scene of the 80's: \\"Finest Worksong\\", \\"The One I Love\\", and \\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It And I Feel Fine.\\"  If you are debating over which REM Album on Vinyl to start a collection you can not go wrong with \\"DOCUMENT.\\"  To me, unlike their previous albums before \\"DOCUMENT\\" this album still sounds fresh and not out of date.  Maybe the remastering has something to do with it.<br /><br />Norbie<br /><br />ps. sorry about all my bad grammar.
0316044938|3.0|I have had The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold on my book shelf for a very long time. As you know, the book was made into a movie which was released today. (I have posted the trailer below.) So- why not? Lets get this thing read and review it! I had heard so many great things about this book, so I set myself up expecting something fabulous.<br /><br />The plot is simple. Girl is murdered. Girl goes to heaven. Girl watches (and narrates the book) as her friends and family deal with her sudden death. Girl helps to try and bring said murderer to justice. The story isn't a pretty one, it is intense and will make you sad. You will feel a sense of relief when you see the family finally move on. This book hit a little close to home for me, for reasons I won't talk about here. The writer very accurately and passionately writes her characters.<br /><br />That being said a lot of the characters were two dimensional, but I did come away from the book being able to connect to some of them. There were some parts of this book that were underdeveloped- like she should have expanded on a few parts... Ruth, for instance. A \\"maybe\\" lesbian that knew almost everything Susie did through her dreams. I really wish I would have known how Ruth felt after the ending. I can't give away the ending- although I'm dying to.<br /><br />The ending seemed silly to me. Gross, even. I didn't like what happened between Susie, Ruth and Ray at the conclusion of the book. I'm all for a happy ending... but... not that kind.<br /><br />This book wasn't bad by any means, it is worth one read. Just skip chapters... 3... to..hm... page 165. The first chapter grabs on to you and doesn't let you go- it put me in a frenzy wanting to find out how the family copes with the loss of Susie, how the bad guy is brought to justice. Then it turns around, it slows down... no, it comes to a total halt. Maybe there were too many flashbacks, too much of how Susie felt? I can't pinpoint this exactly.<br /><br />Wow, I am really jumping around with this review, aren't I? Almost finished. The only reasons I am giving this three stars instead of two is that Sebold did a beautiful job at showing how the dynamics of the family changed after Susie's death and how the entire community reacted to the gruesome tragedy.  Also, there is one part (other than the actual murder) where I was on PINS and NEEDLES for Susie's sister. Gosh, and her father- wonderful character. I could envision him so well.'t I?

Continuing in the jazz- and R&B-influenced vein of JOHN BARLEYCORN MUST DIE and THE LOW SPARK OF HIGH-HEELED BOYS, the songs are even longer here (none less than six minutes), but due to the presence of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, things never get self-indulgent or pretentious.

It acts like a novel (chapters, different settings, many characters, complicated plot lines that converge for the final unraveling--this also is not a necessity),<br />2. It \\"reads\\" like a novel (actual chapter divisions and much dialogue--neither is required),<br />3. It has a central conflict (ridding the world of Nazis, concluding with a mighty clever resolution),<br />4. It falls into its own literary genre (the re-imagination of a world event into a fantasia of Pulp Fiction proportions), sooooooo, what is it? Crime fantasy? Fantasia of evil? Revenge documentary spliced with actual footage? Historical fiction---no---make that historical fantasy? See what I mean?<br />5. It is long at two hours and 40 minutes (not all novels are long)<br /><br />OK, granted, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" IS a movie about actual events, but ones re-imagined, re-considered, re-invented and put back together as something new. It becomes novel in that its very first scene is  bathed in quiet undertones of civilized dialog, loaded with the machine-gun staccato of impending violence. The viewer asks how? when? Then comes the blasting of visual imagery, and an escape that becomes a pivot of more violence. What is new under the sun? According to the Prophet, nothing. The theme Tarantino considers is this: What is evil? Who has it? Who does it? What are the results?<br /><br />In some ways Tarantino's script is a Picasso masterpiece: that taking apart of history, then distorting it into something new: deconstruction reconstructed. Call it Taranting. Tarantino likes to \\"tarant.\\" Take something out of modern life: hits by hitmen, violence for violence's sake, mass genocide. Then take that whatever and make it into something new. It's this step that makes Tarantino so prominent and admired in film-making. Pulp Fiction becomes a philosophizing about the nature of life. Reservoir Dog becomes a caricature of man's violent nature, and Inglourious Basterds becomes a poison-dripped commentary on genocide, violence for violence's sake, a reversal of all things decent into all things evil and vile, switching making no difference especially in the character of the German SS officer.<br /><br />These reasons (cited above) are why Brad Pitt is so good in his role. He plays it with gusto, with exaggeration, with sanity swathed in insanity, with evil run amok. Pitt plays his role with exactly the right nasty machismo and vulgarity and lasciviousness required by Tarantino's taranting. He should win an Academy Award nomination (at least) for this bold acting job. Many viewers miss this point and call him a caricature, his role as silliness. I suggest: Think again. Would Tarantino allow Pitt to diss his taranting?<br /><br />As for the conclusion: It was good to see the good guys win. Wait a minute. Did they?and admired in film-making.

B001EN71DG|3.0|Without going into all the reasons, I'll just say first of all that I'm one of those people that prefers the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars Trilogy films.  They are simply more cohesive to me, and of course truer to history.  I see these as historical artifacts just as with any film, and I (almost) always prefer to see any film as it was originally released.<br /><br />With that said, the treatment of the theatrical versions here is...lacking, to say the least.  I knew what I was buying, and truth be told was largely replacing (or at least backing up) bootleg versions that I purchased a few years ago, since my particular copies had trouble running properly on some players.  The visual and sound quality of this release is actually about the same as those bootlegs (being that they come from the same 1993 laserdisc masters) with a major difference: the bootlegs were actually anamorphic!  The way they are now, they won't quite format correctly on a widescreen TV (or computer screen), and lose some potential resolution as well regardless of the TV or screen.  That said, these are still pretty serviceable versions, but the quality is lacking compared to many DVDs of similarly aged films.  The high-quality restoration the \\"Special Edition\\" versions received isn't the only thing that makes the theatrical masters look a little bad.<br /><br />Also lacking in this set is the extras.  None of the extensive documentaries, theatrical trailers, and other goodies from the initial Special Edition-only set are present here; only the commentary tracks from that set still survive, along with the new and fairly dubious extra of a demo for a Lego Star Wars video game (ironically, my bootleg versions also contain a number of extras, again making them seem superior).  The commentaries are pretty interesting, if a little dry, and seem to have been recorded with each person talking separately and then edited together, as they never make conversation or play off of each other.  There are some cool factoids to learn though, and they are certainly worth a listen.<br /><br />Ultimately, considering the price and the presence of both versions of each film, this is a pretty decent set, just not a great one.  By all rights the theatrical versions should receive at least an anamorphic transfer (not a difficult or costly thing to do by any means) and at least some minimal cleanup compared to 1993 standards, and the removal of extras (now no longer available on any DVD set still being manufactured) is just baffling.  Hopefully, in the Blu-Ray age we'll finally get a release that shows the original versions the respect they deserve and reintegrates all the extras from before.  Just don't make us buy any movies with Jar Jar in them to get the originals, and I think I'll be pretty happy.l factoids to learn though, and they are certainly worth a listen.

B002R2L008|5.0|This is Norah Jones. You know, the young lady who won 8 Grammies for her first album? She's back. This time, she goes with a bit edgier sound; more guitar than piano; more blues than jazz. And it is simply outstanding. And whats bad, is this is probably her weakest album yet.     It has become a standard for her albums to be able to listen straight through without pausing or skipping a track. This one is no exception. There are no stand out fantastic songs on here though, like her first three or the limited release with the Peter Malick Group. Just good, solid music.     The live cd is a treat, well worth the extra cost to import. I highly recommend importing the Deluxe edition just for her cover of \\"Cry, Cry, Cry\\".
1600240682|4.0|Alice Sebold, is the author of The Lovely Bones a book about an average 14-year-old girl, desperately falling for her first love. Before 1980 Alice grew up normally, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where life was good. Sadly, 1980 wasn't so great. While walking to her dorm, during her first semester at Syracuse University Alice was brutally raped.  The rapist who she later recognized was put in jail, and given the longest sentence possible. Seeing how being raped can traumatize you, Sebold got the inspiration for The Lovely Bones. Because of this inspiration she wrote a memoir for a college class, that she later turned into a fiction book.   Every character in this book plays an extreme role. Seeing how everyone is connected to this horrid murder. At the beginning you meet Susie Salmon, who is the main character. And dies in the first chapter. While the murder is taking place her dad Jack, mom Abigail, and her siblings are looking for her, because she never came home from school. George Harvey \\"Mr. Harvey\\" is known very early as the murderer, but there is no proof. Len Fenerman is the detective working on the case.  Sadly, after a few months he fails at discovering the murderer, and gives up looking.  The conflict is plainly obvious. Susie is dead. And they cannot find the murderer, or the body. In the first chapter she is brutally killed, by a neighbor who tricks her into being alone with him. Since Susie was a daddy's girl, he can't get over her death. Desperately spending every waking moment trying to catch the criminal. Because of this, his wife leaves him and he had no idea where she went. Seeking some closure in the case was all he wanted.   Zeroing in on the murderer would definitely be the major climax in this story. Susie's sister, who knows it was Mr. Harvey, goes on an epic \\"run\\" to consume the proof needed. Proof is mandatory. Since Mr. Harvey lives alone, he knows someone is in his house, and because of this, the story gets crazy. After Mr. Harvey is asuspect to Jack, he makes excuses to go over that, to try to figure this guy out. Luckily they were neighbors.   Opinions are usually biased in some way, shape or form. Before reading this book, I would suggest reading a few reviews, because mine is just from a 15 year old gir. When reading this book, I was in shock on how greatly Sebold wrote. Sitting and reading this book for 3 hours at a time was a daily activity I was doing, which is very odd for me. It changed my ways. Greatly recommended, to anyone who like mysteries, murder books, or just a good story line. It's an amazing book. Hard to put into words.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebellum's latest CD is full of great music all performed wonderfully by this very special trio of artists. Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood--what a fine group of singer/songwriters! The set of songs flows along well and they never sounded better, either! Indeed, this music leaves nothing to be desired--this is all THAT good. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork as well.<br /><br />\\"Need You Now\\" is a passionate ballad with a beautiful musical arrangement and Hillary Scott's singing in particular is sublime. Her voice is like a finely tuned instrument able to convey all the subtle nuances of every line she sings. \\"Our Kind Of Love\\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Lady Antebellum does this one up right! \\"Our Kind Of Love\\" also features great guitar work and the music fits in perfectly with the lyrics. \\"American Honey\\" has quite a melody; and the poignant \\"Hello World\\" gets the royal treatment from Lady A! I really like that piano arrangement on \\"Hello World,\\" too.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Day\\" is wonderful with that country/softer rock/pop flavor; this is a terrific song that only Lady Antebellum could release! They really show off their skills on \\"Perfect Day.\\" \\"Love This Pain\\" is somewhat boisterous while still being open about real, true emotions; they harmonize and play this to perfection--and beyond! I love it. \\"When You Got A Good Thing\\" is equally well done; and the drums along with the rest of the musical arrangement work wonders for this ballad.<br /><br />\\"Stars Tonight\\" has a fine beat that mixes country with a side dish of rock that enhances this number and makes it a very memorable number on this album. \\"If I Knew Then\\" has a brilliant piano arrangement; it's beautifully written and performed with true sensitivity. \\"Something `Bout A Woman\\" is yet another awesome country tune by Lady Antebellum; and it has a great beat. Those guitars sound so good! The CD also ends strong with Lady Antebellum performing \\"Ready To Love Again.\\" It leaves me wanting more!<br /><br />Lady Antebellum has clearly produced a sophomore album that stuns me with its natural beauty; this is one group I won't be forgetting anytime soon! Their music is so beautiful. I highly recommend this for their fans; and people who enjoy country music mixed with touches of pop and rock will not be disappointed.ve Again.\\" It leaves me wanting more!

B00005JXY3|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid Part II\\" is a big exception to the rule regarding mediocre sequels to outstanding original movies.  Returning actors Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita are allowed to go even deeper into their respective characters, and the result is a very rich screenplay which gives as much or more weight to Mr. Morita's Miyagi as it does to Mr. Macchio's Daniel Larusso.<br /><br />The film focuses on a trip to Okinawa for Daniel and Miyagi which serves as a pilgrimmage for Miyagi to visit his dying father, mentioned briefly but memorably in the first movie.  Additionally, Miyagi rekindles an old romance which had been ended by a covetous blood feud also involving Miyagi's best childhood friend that was his original reason for leaving his native country.  Daniel, in turn, falls in love with the older woman's beautiful young niece Kumiko, played by Tamlyn Tomita(currently seen on NBC TV's \\"Heroes\\" in a recurring role as Hiro Nakamura's mother).  In so doing, he incurs the wrath of a vengeful young martial arts expert named Chozen, who covets Kumiko for himself.<br /><br />Also featuring beautiful outdoor scenery, a great soundtrack and a tense script which realistically depicts long-simmering hatreds as well as many variations of respect and love, \\"The Karate Kid Part II\\" is a brilliant sequel and movie that should officially be accorded the classic status it deserves.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|In my opinion Enterprise is the best and most engaging of all the Star Trek series but season three is it's masterpiece.  To fully appreciate season three the first two seasons should be watched first in it's natural order. Most fascinating was watching Capt. Archer (Scott Bakula) evolve from the naive explorer to hard core warrior who willstop at nothing to achieve his mission however just as he is on the brink of losing his soul he retreats as the series comes to a finish. The cast is brilliant but Bakula's performance really stands out.  It is truly sad that this series was cancelled as I totally enjoy the tying of lose ends between all Star Trek franchises and learning the origins of previous series episodes. Much Star Trek canon is validated in this series. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B000VBJEEG|1.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Except for the critical knee-jerk reaction to label anything Pixar produces as brilliant, I will never understand the rationale for calling this movie anything other than a disgusting, boring waste of time.<br /><br />While on the whole Pixar does create brilliant animated work(the \\"Toy Story\\" films and the more recent \\"Up\\" numbering among those), this film was a colossal bomb which they hid behind admittedly impressive animated views of Paris and an appeal to snobbery under the guise of satirizing French cuisine.  Additionally, the audience is treated to several views of thousands of digitized rats swarming together.  It was massive, foolish hubris to think that it was possible to marry rats with cooking, and make it work.  Human nature itself rebels against the notion.<br /><br />Appearing vocally are Patton Oswalt and Jeaneane Garafalo, amongst others.  I suppose they are here to collect the inevitable large check, and say they've been in a Pixar movie.  It's just a shame that they could not have picked a better one.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was crushed by how bad Star Trek Nemesis was.I did not know how the Star Trek people could ever recover from that gasbag of a movie.\\"Prepare for impact \\"was right.  The new movie with new concepts releases the franchise from all of the old baggage.All of the old concepts begin again as,without spoiling,the timeline has changed.Everything begins anew.Forget what you know about Vulcan or Khan or Genesis.It's all new.And yet the old remains in the mind of the very old.  The million dollar bonus should go to the Casting Director,who put though and knowledge into each character,casted as a young person.  It is creepy until you get used to it.  For you non Trek fans remember this.If you know nothing about anything Star Trek it does not matter.This is one rocking popcorn chewing movie.For the many.  One line in the movie \\"Star Trek:Insurrection\\" always says it best.When accosted by protocol and appointments and diplomatic engagements,Picard turns to his crewmates and asks,\\"Does anybody remember when we were explorers?\\"    This movie explores.Enjoy it as I did.And...it's logical.

The only thing that changed was some of the characters, plot location, and a different symbol mystery. Otherwise it was very predictable.

Though the other tracks on the album, including the b-sides, are a bit dated to say the least, this edition is worth it just to have all those various mixes of the singles, some of which are available for the first time ever on CD.

B00308TGGS|5.0|The movie is good. But if you are paying extra to get the \\"map\\". Don't. This is just a promotional piece. It does not have the details of the The Noble Collection map.  It is very small and you are supposed to be able to fold it to match up different parts.  This \\"map\\" does not do that. Much of the Marauder's map is left off.

I have all three discs, and they work just damn fine in everything I've put them in. I suppose if you have a jones for disc art then that's a negative, but really---If the disc isn't in the player, then it should be in the case, so who cares what the disc looks like? Unless you keep everything in folders, in which case I can't help ya. The sale price on these alone is enough to justify buying them.
B001CZVVUU|3.0|Netrebko is scary!  Anyone who can act that well and sing too!  She is truly amazing. This is not to discount Villazon who is wonderful in his own right.  I give Netrebko and Villazon 5 stars, the opera 2.  Everytime I see Massenet's version I'm reminded of how I hate this.  The story makes no sense, certainly not in the 1950's.  The music is incredibly boring.  Only one memorable aria in the whole opera.  No wonder Puccini felt he could improve upon it 9 years later.  The opera still makes little sense in Puccini's version, i.e., the couple dying in the deserts of Louisiana, but at the least Puccini gives us some decent music along the way.  Worth buying, owning for the love scene in act II, pretty much a snoozer in acts III, IV and V.

1402720602|5.0|This is an appropriately big book.  Appropriate in that the author addresses each section in the detail that it needs.  Whether you want to become a luthier or just want to study the art, this book is an absolute MUST HAVE.  The author is excellent at conveying the details of the work in a thorough but very readable way.  I imagine that there are so few books on this craft, since their are few people with both the skills of crafting guitars and the skills of writing how it is done.  This author has both, in abundance.  It also has plenty of pictures and diagrams that are useful, not only as aids to comprehension, but as guides to you will need to use in your own endeavors.  A truly excellent book.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I love what Disney Pixar has given us for the new \\"cartoons\\". The animation is absolutely incredible, the story is fun and as is the characters. Sully and Mike the animated Laurel & Hardy. Love to see a sequel with Boo grown up, not as an adult but as a young teen.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|I consider myself a very tolerant person, but Marked should not be tolerated or endured by anyone. The author has created a character that puts down different groups of people including Christians and kids at school that fit into certain groups. The language is filthy. The oral sex scene is unnecessary and vulgar. The main character's first experience at Vampire Finishing School is walking up on a girl giving a guy oral sex in the hallway! The fantasy writing is so bad, it is painful to read. In the first chapter when the Tracker shows up and gives the main character, Zoey, a Harry Potter mark on the forehead, the Tracker's words are so stupid and ridiculous. Zoey's \\"teen language\\" is so overdone. No teenager actually talks like that-so much for the help from the author's daughter on shaping the language. Seriously, the authors should be ashamed of themselves. I can't believe this book got published. This proves that anyone can get anything published. This book made me want to vomit! I have never done an online review before, but I felt compelled to warn people about this poorly written Harry Potter/ Twilight wanna-be. For the first time in my life, I actually ripped a book to shreds.

B00005JPUN|2.0|All the succeeding versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers have been weaker than the ones which came before, but they've all had interesting additions to the basic story of the pods taking over people.<br /><br />The original (1956 with Kevin McCarthy) was the best because it was a low-budget film noir that didn't take itself too seriously. The Philip Kaufman remake in 1978 set in San Francisco anticipated the AIDS/STD crisis that was just around the corner. Abel Ferrara's version Body Snatchers (1993), set on an Army post, gave us a look at what happens when a society is increasingly militarized without wide scale involvement in the military by civilians for a temporary term of service, the way Americans experienced World War II.<br /><br />The Invasion starring Nicole Kidman is the least interesting yet, but even it has a couple of intriguing ideas. I get the feeling it was intended to say some halfway serious things about the United States and its place in the world before a glamorous movie star got involved.<br /><br />Pills have replaced pods in this version of the story.<br /><br />Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman) prescribes a change in medication when a woman in an abusive marriage reports that her husband has become much calmer, except for strangling the dog when it growled at him.<br /><br />Later one of the newly infected asks Bennell if she can give him a pill to prevent a Darfur, or a New Orleans.<br /><br />Before the alien infection arrives on Earth, Bennell is caught between her ex-husband and her platonic boyfriend. We see both men before and after they're infected. Unlike previous versions of the story, people aren't killed and replaced by duplicates grown from pods, they are just transformed by an infection into a joint human-alien entity.<br /><br />These monsters aren't the emotionless pods of previous invasions. One old man, after he's transformed, comes back to his wife and begs her to join him. His desire for the woman he's loved for decades seems real.<br /><br />Bennell's ex-husband is a jerk before and after he's infected, and her boyfriend is the same calm rational man he was before. This invasion of the body snatchers doesn't really result in losing your identity. The peace that breaks out all over the world is almost as ludicrous as in the 1952 B movie with Peter Graves, [[ASIN:B000G28GHG Red Planet Mars]], when God speaks from Mars.<br /><br />I think the people who conceived this film wanted us to consider that maybe we should allow the infection to change us.<br /><br />There's one moment at the climax, when it looks like Bennell and her son (who's immune to the infection) can't escape, when she considers surrendering. But they won't allow her immune son to survive and risk the new order. So she blasts away.<br /><br />It's no surprise that salvation comes from Fort Detrick, where the scientists have been working on a drug (of course!) to reverse the infection.<br /><br />The world goes back to normal, but the movie doesn't tell us that the scientists at Fort Detrick have kept a sample of the alien substance and are working on a way to turn it into a weapon. If that's the sequel to this movie, it may be the most honest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers yet.fore and after he's infected, and her boyfriend is the same calm rational man he was before.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is witty and well written with interesting characters who have are not just funny but have depth and humanity. The better you know them the more interesting they become.  The acting and ensemble are great. Episodes stand alone, but the plot is well developed and watching from the beginning introduces the inside jokes and references that re-appear as the show progresses. Highly recommended for older teens and up.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|When I bought World Painted Blood a couple days before it was officially released at my local record store, I was so excited for new Slayer, particularly after what I felt was a strong Christ Illusion record. Upon purchase, I put the disc in my cd player and I was rewarded with one of the best albums to come out in 2009. It's fast, violent, and everything I love about Slayer.     In terms of songwriting, I feel that this album is a step above Crist Illusion, while continuing to sound like the slayer of the 80's and early 90's. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of both Diabolus in Musica and GHUA, but if you like your metal faster and more traditional then this is the record for you. Both Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King contributed to the writing of this one.    A lot has been said about the production on this album and while it's not as good as say the production on Megadeth's new record (Endgame), it's also not as bad as something like Metallica's newest (Death Magnetic).    Overall if you're looking for some new metal that's fast and hateful pick up World Painted Blood without hesitation!
B002BFBAWO|3.0|Adventureland' is a coming-of-age story set in suburban Pittsburgh circa 1987. Loosely based on recollections of writer-director Greg Mottola (who's well known for directing the entertaining adolescent comedy, 'Superbad'), it is more drama than comedy. Mottola jettisons the raunchiness we've come to expect from the typical teenage fare that pops up in the cinema today for a more intellectual and informed dissection of adolescent (or shall we say post-adolescent) vagaries.<br /><br />The setting of Adventureland is a run down amusement park run by a goofy thirtyish couple who'll do anything to make a buck (people trying to win a prize by knocking a hat off a mannequin with a softball are unable to do so since the hats are glued to the mannequins' heads). The proprietors also save money by hiring high school and college students at minimum wage as they're unable to find a job anywhere else due to the faltering economy (Reagnomics doesn't appear to be working very well at that time). One of these young people is the film's protagonist, James Brennan, well played by Jesse Eisenberg. James was about to take a trip to Europe for the summer before going off to graduate school but after his father receives a demotion at work, his parents force him to find a job instead.<br /><br />Mottola does an excellent job of depicting the atmosphere at the ramshackle park. From the outset, James is advised by his co-workers to attempt to obtain a job as a ride operator as opposed to working the game booths (there is a clear cut hierarchy, and working the 'rides' is much more preferable to the booths where the workers are often forced to deal with unsavory characters who often cheat while attempting to win a prize). James also has to endure the constant blaring of 'Rock Me Amadeus', the Falco hit from the 80s, over the park's loudspeakers.<br /><br />What keeps Adventureland from becoming just another sitcom is the excellent interplay between the two witty friends, James and his sidekick, Joel, smartly played by the talented Martin Starr. Both these young men are bonded by their reliance on their intellect to compensate for their lack of success with the opposite sex. There are a good number of welcome literary allusions in Adventureland including discussions of such prominent authors as Dickens and Gogol.<br /><br />Adventureland's other characters, however, are not as strong as its two principals. For starters, Kristen Stewart's 'Em' is not convincing as the troubled recent graduate who's going out with an 'older man'. The film's scenarist attempts to explain her confusion due to the influence of a petulant stepmother who comes across as an unsympathetic stereotype. Em has few moments where she seems to like herself at all. Ryan Reynold's 'Mike Connell' could have been an interesting character as the amusement park's mechanic and married man Em is having an affair with, but he has little on screen time and comes across as being a little too sympathetic for someone who is cheating on his wife (it would have been nice if he had a bit more of an 'edge' as well as more of detailed back story).<br /><br />Other characters also are underdeveloped--the sexy \\"Lisa P.\\" gets short shrift after her main claim to fame is gossiping about Mike and Em's affair, betraying the confidence she established with James. Joel's potential girlfriend is another petulant one-dimensional character who rejects him after she experiences pressure from her strict Catholic family. I did like Hader and Wiig as the amusement park owners who provide the film with its main comic relief.<br /><br />What I couldn't buy at all was the idea that Em would be attracted to James (along with Lisa P. who is portrayed as being able to get any guy she wants). James is simply too immature and a 'nice guy' for a woman like Em (who has just had an affair with the super-attractive, 'bad boy' mechanic) to be attracted to. So it's a real stretch when James comes to New York and Em is basically waiting for him with open arms. The old axiom 'nice guys finish last' holds true for all potential male suitors but Adventureland opts for the sentimental ending which rejects the reality of contemporary courtship patterns.<br /><br />For all its deficiencies, Adventureland still manages to entertain, with its witty dialogue and top notch performance by Jesse Eisenberg who strikes the right notes as the beleaguered post-adolescent taking his first steps toward prescient adulthood.guys finish last' holds true for all potential male suitors but Adventureland opts for the sentimental ending which rejects the reality of contemporary courtship patterns.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I have been a fan of Lady Antebellum since I saw them on GAC and listened to their first album. I saw a lot of potential in the three members of the country/pop/rock group: Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood. Their efforts have brought a solid fan base that continues to grow. \\"Need You Now\\" solidifies my adoration for the musical trio.    The first track here is also Lady A's first single: `Need You Now.' One of their slower songs, it's a great opener for the CD. One of my favorites however is `Perfect Day,' which has Scott at the lead vocal position. She sings about how a Cajun man playing a country tune would sound like, which is followed by the irresistible instrumental hook of the song.    Nevertheless, each song on Lady Antebellum's sophomore album is amazing. Some CDs may have filler tracks, but I think none can be found here. In my humble opinion, this trio is a positive sign of what country music is evolving into. Certainly, there are still artists who could be considered \\"pure\\" country if there is such a term, but bands like Lady Antebellum make it easier to draw in non-country fans to country music itself.    Therefore, I recommend \\"Need You Now\\" to those who simply enjoy well-written and fun music. I am sure you won't be disappointed by this impressive effort.
0307341569|3.0|Not a bad novel, it kept me interested throughout as her dark story about woman that survived her family's massacre trying to find the true killer has a good pace to it.  I found the main character not exactly lovable, but genuinely \\"real\\".  Usually these stories finds someone that survives something terrible as these happy, strong people that have surmounted the odds.  Not in this one... as in real life, her character has witnessed something horrible as a child and is permanently damaged from it.      It would have gotten 4 stars except for the ending... it simply was not believable that such a bizarre culmination of coincidences could happen.

B003196ZO2|5.0|Watching this video will show you so many more sides of Michael than some people may have never known existed. From the visibly healthy 50-year-old singer, dancer, caring human being and overall genius, this movie is nothing short of phenomenal.<br /><br />While viewing the rehearsal, you'll see that even at that age, he was still a fantastic dancer and a genuine singer. No studio sound-effects needed to enhance his naturally beautiful voice which, with the obvious exception of his prepubescent years, sound amazingly like the recorded versions we're accustomed to having heard. Even when the band wasn't quite in-sync with what he tried to accomplish, he never once raised his voice, instead, he presented his point of view clearly and gently.<br /><br />There are no curse words throughout the video and can be viewed by all age groups. Throughout, he sends messages of love for mankind and for the future of the earth.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for everyone that's ever been a fan of Michael's music.
1591843162|5.0|Seth's latest book hit a chord with me- not only about how to make sure you can create value and become an indispensable part of your working life- but also on the work process.  Being a Linchpin is like being a Trust Agent (book by Chris Brogan and Julien Smith) in that it requires you to look beyond the job at hand and invest yourself personally in your work- and in the end, this makes all the difference in any project, work or personal.<br /><br />Being involved with many projects on a consulting basis, I sometimes find myself as the person who is urging the group to examine the upsides and downsides before acting- not to be a wet blanket, but to get all of the downsides out of the way, so we can proceed uninhibited towards the \\"ship\\" date.  Reading the sections on Linchpin discussing \\"thrashing\\" made me feel better about this.  I really think being a Linchpin involves more than cheerleading positive attitudes, but instead involves being honest, open, and about speaking out, even when that may not be the easy thing to do, assuming you have the best interests of the whole group firmly in hand.<br /><br />Linchpin is a great book about how to achieve long term success by doing what you do best and harnessing your creativity.  I wish there was some other language available other than \\"artist\\" to use, since that sometimes has a connotation around \\"temperamental\\"- and what Seth is really asking us all to do is to invest our authentic selves in everything we do.  It's a high calling, but perhaps the most important call to action you can get this year.
B002UZXJA6|1.0|I think the first reviews were much too kind.  No doubt, the girls are great as usual, and this is the best lineup yet.  That is why I have to give this CD the rating I have.  The best song of the entire concert is Pie Jesu.  You won't hear it on this CD.  Unfortunately, this was probably intentional to get you to buy the DVD as well.  Poor, poor tactics.  Hopefully it will be available for download as an individual track. RF
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Tropic Thunder was by far, one of my most FAV. movies ever! Granted there are some disgusting parts, but the movie is an on the floor, hysterical, tears running down your face kind of movie. It has a lot of big names, but each character brings something to the table, including Tom Cruise as Les Grossman. I have never laughed so hard in my whole life! This movie is not only funny, but it is super-action packed! However, I would NOT recommend this movie for kids under 17 as the content is pretty strong in the movie. However, I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
1933308087|5.0|Wow, I just found out about this book and ordered a copy right away.  After it arrived today, these are my thoughts.  First off, I am a huge fan of Jinny Beyer's work.  I have almost all of her other books and have been very influenced by her teaching books.  I learned to love and enjoy hand piecing because of Jinny and really appreciate her quilt designs with influences from India. For this book, I absolutely loved the very huge section on quilt grids!  Huge amounts of information to empower you to create your own block designs. That is hugely exciting to me, rather than feel stuck with something in a pattern that is same old, same old.  I get bored easily because quilting can feel very repetitive and monotonous but with the huge variety of quilt blocks, each one is a new adventure.  That section of the book is like a treasure chest to me. Ok, now here is some information on the book that you should be aware of.  The \\"finished\\" quilt blocks are probably made using computer software and digital copies of Jinny's fabric (I don't think each and everyone of these were actually made) - still a huge amount of work!  Second, while the book does have 5000 or so blocks (I didn't count but can easily imagine there are after flipping through the book), there might be 25 variations on a single block. Finally, there are no measurements or instructions for piecing the blocks, that is up to you to figure out. An unbelievable work of quilt scholarship, \\"The\\" authoritative reference on probably every quilt block known to man, and the fun of reading passages written by Jinny throughout the book.  If you don't feel you need this much information, Jinny is a very generous quilter and has provided many quilt block designs and patterns available on her website for free.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Herbert von Karajan conducted Bruckner throughout his long career. Many versions of the later symphonies are available; I even have an amazing 1944 Eighth (minus the first movement) with the Prussian State Orchestra with the last movement in glorious stereo!(Koch label)<br /><br />This is Karajan's only taping of the complete cycle and it is generally wonderful. This conductor had the gift of maintaining an iron grip on Bruckner's tempi and unerringly building up Bruckner's arching climaxes. Of the nine, it is No 5 and 8 that are the most magisterial. Numbers 4, 7 and 9 are not far behind. These 5 works are well recorded with warm, clear and slightly resonant sound. The first 3 symphonies and No. 6 have dryish sound but are also well played and interpreted.<br /><br />At the asking price these estimable performances are well worth acquiring. It is worth noting that for a moderately greater outlay you can get the same renditions as part of the massive Karajan symphony edition. That is what I would do.
B0026P3G12|5.0|\\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is a beautiful blend of musical genres. I was filled to overflowing with emotion when listening to Amazing Grace; and the finale of Silent Night was absolutely exhilarating...loved it all.
B001DCQIAU|5.0|How times change. Many dedicated music collectors of long standing would have acquired a host of the performances featured in this massive set at premium cost. Now it reappears at a fraction of the initial price; so cheap that any existing duplications can be distributed as gifts and you will still be ahead.<br /><br />The undoubted gem of the set is the Bruckner cycle; particularly numbers 4,5,7,8 and 9. The balance are also good versions but suffer from dry sound. The Beethoven is reliable but is bettered by the 1963 set. The Tchaikovsky cycle is renowned and the Mendelssohn (apart from a drily recorded 2) is estimable. The Schumann and Brahms are well worth a listen. The Haydn and Mozart are generally bloated and unstylish but never unsatisfactory. The Haydn Paris symphonies are surprizingly an exception and are very enjoyable.<br /><br />The sound on the various issues is obviously varied. The Mozart and Haydn are overblown but tolerable. None will qualify as demonstration discs but most will pass muster. Buying this set is a handy and cheap way of assembling a generally handsome and large batch of well played symphony performances. How nice to be a music lover just beginning to build a collection.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I've played Borderlands on the PS3 and the Xbox 360 and the edge goes to the 360 because of the controller.<br /><br />While playing Uncharted I didn't think the controller felt bad. The reason was they assigned \\"fire\\" to the R1 button. When I hold the PS3 controller my fingers naturally rest on that button. With Borderlands they want you to use L2 and R2 constantly. It's not a very comfortable position and the matter was made worst by the triggers. Your fingers had no resistance.<br /><br />So these are essential, in my opinion, for any game which requires the use of the L2 and R2 buttons. I really hope Sony redesigns their controller next gen. But seeing as I have a choice, I'll just stick to the 360 for multi-platform games.
B000YDE46Y|5.0|Didn't buy it from good old Amazon this time, but at a local department store. I've had these for 3 1/2 weeks, and so far, so very, very good. Yes, expect that it runs at least a half size larger than normal. GREAT BOOT! Super comfortable, lightweight, well stitched and very ergonomic, broken in and wearable right out of the box, and they really are waterproof! Major storms here in CA over the last 3 weeks, and just slogged on through. The waterproof part was important to me, as I fish, hike, and generally require something that is bulletproof enough to take a pretty good thrashing, but that looks good enough to wear out to dinner, etc, when I'm done...and these are good lookin' boots. My experience is that waterproof sometimes only means weather-resistant, but so far these are true to the description. Will update if that changes. Anyway, 5 stars so far.

B002T9H2LK|5.0|Seven months ago, upon my first viewing of the trailer for Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated WWII film, \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" a small coat of goosebumps covers my arms and neck. The words flash across the screen: \\"You haven't seen war ... until you've seen it through the eyes ... of Quentin Tarantino.\\" And after viewing Basterds, never have any truer taglines been used for a movie's publicity. To say that Tarantino has his own style of filmmaking is one of the most obvious understatements to even a novice filmgoer.<br /><br />Tarantino's magnus opus (to this day), [[ASIN:B000Q7Q2WM Kill Bill - Vol. 1 & 2 (2 Pack)]], is the greatest testament to his style, blending spaghetti western, Shaw Bros. Kung Fu films, 1970's revenge pics, grindhouse B-movie and Japanimation. It's the quintessential Quentin film, showcasing his cinephile hodge-podge style that has driven most viewers to the love-him-or-hate-him mantle that has recently emblazoned into audience and critics' minds alike. No matter how violent, profane, or sometimes cartoonish Tarantino's characters may seem, you still have to admit that he creates some damn cool characters with dialogue that only he could conjure, and puts them in run-of-the-mill plots that shift with breakneck speed into SNAFU situations. Now, he's taken his unique style to early 1940's Nazi-occupied France. But first, a brief interlude.<br /><br />Growing up, I was never a big fan of war movies. Upon the first reading of this, my wife's jaw will most likely drop of shock and awe as she knows of my strange draw to the dark war and crime thriller genres that I often watch. But I promise you - and her - it's true. Don't get me wrong, I watched war films, but I was never drawn to watch them. I just watched them to watch them. During my pre-adolescent years, I vaguely remember brief glimpses of John Wayne and Gary Cooper war films that inundated my uncle's TV when I would sleep over my cousins' house. My dad - himself a fan of films - while he loves a good action movie, he never can bring himself to sit down and watch a war movie. He doesn't mind movies like [[ASIN:B000W8OM5Y Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000ELL1S0 The Patriot (Extended Cut)]], or \\"300,\\" but after serving in Vietnam, a Navy photographer surveying the madness of war from a helicopter as bullets whizzed past him (similar to Joe Galloway from [[ASIN:B000068TPN We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)]]), any movies depicting battles from WWII to the present, he won't even attempt to view. I watched classics such as \\"Johnny Got His Gun,\\" \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Tora Tora Tora,\\" \\"Born on the Fourth of July,\\" and now-personal favorites \\"1941,\\" [[ASIN:B000HWZ4CA Sergeant York (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], \\"The Longest Day,\\" [[ASIN:B000EOTURQ The Dirty Dozen (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], \\"Glory,\\" and \\"Memphis Belle\\" (I watched them just to watch them), but it truly wasn't until Steven Spielberg's 1998 masterpiece [[ASIN:B0001NBLVI Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] that I purposely watched war movies. Of course, some aren't as reflective and poignant as Spielberg's. But there have been excellent films of this genre to follow in its footsteps and have filled my DVD collection: \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" and the HBO miniseries [[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]].<br /><br />Now, \\"Basterds\\" has joined the ranks of these great war films. Yes, it has Tarantino's quirky trademark stamp, but it's also one of the most serious, and, at times, non-Tarantino, films he's created. Sure, there's the occasional interludes of Samuel L. Jackson narration, the Ennio Morricone-riddled score, a brief comic book-style character profile and the fantastic opening sequence between SS Colonel Hans Landa (the superb Christoph Waltz) and a French Jewish sympathizer that is somewhat reminiscent of the famous Dennis Hopper-Christopher Walken scene in [[ASIN:B00006FDCF True Romance - Director's Cut (Two-DiscSpecial Edition)]] (just one of my favorite cinema scenes ever). Nonetheless, this film also has a majority of subtitles, a mostly foreign, unknown-in-America cast, and probably is the least violent, more talkative films Tarantino's ever done.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't first mention the most stand-out element: Christoph Waltz. He was awarded the Best Actor Award at Cannes, and Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and SAG, and, after viewing the film, it's easy to see why. Waltz can transition from laid-back ease one moment to child-like zaniness to nail-biting, cold ruthlessness all in one brilliant quick natural stroke. Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a southern hillbilly who gloriously terrorizes any Nazis who cross his path, leads the Special Ops team known fearfully to the Germans as the Basterds. They - including a brawny director Eli Roth as the \\"Bear Jew,\\" Donny Donowitz, who beats Nazis to death with a baseball bat inscribed with the names of Jews who his neighbors worry about back in the U.S. (a fact only known by reading the [[ASIN:0316070351 screenplay]] since the scene was cut from the film) - tear a bloody path across France, littering it with dead, scalped Nazi soldiers in their wake. And while the movie's title refers to this small band of bastards, don't expect Pitt and his crew to headline and have dominated screen time. The central characters to this film are Hans Landa and the Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent - think of a French Sarah Polley). Although Shosanna has made a life for herself managing a small cinema, her wish to avenge her family's death comes into fruition when she catches the eye of the Nazi's \\"Sergeant York,\\" Private Zoller (Daniel Bruhl).<br /><br />Apart from Pitt and a few of the Basterds, each of the cast is rather unknown in America since Tarantino wanted to use real German and French actors to play their counterparts (fun little fact: Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for Hans Landa, but Tarantino wanted a German actor to play the part). The acting is solid on all counts. Pitt delivers a small but important role similar to his Mickey O'Neil in Snatch. Roth, Diane Kruger, and Michael Fassbender give good, quirky performances, but the best performances go to Laurent and Waltz. They perfectly capture the seriousness and the sometimes-zaniness of the plot without seeming hokey.<br /><br />While Inglourious Basterds certainly had room for improvement, it marked far better than certain other action flicks this summer (uh-hum, *G.I. Joe*). I did wish that some of the \\"basterds\\" backgrounds were slightly more explored as well as what became of their fates (it's probably just an assumption to the audience that they were K.I.A. during their mission). However, with a rewrite of history, quick, outrageous bursts of violence, a majority of subtitles and a cast of serious, A-list actors (most of them foreign), Tarantino nearly perfectly balances the line between cheesy B-movie action flick and serious epic WWII film, placing it in the same class as one of my favorites: \\"The Dirty Dozen.\\" This one stands in file behind \\"(500) Days of Summer,\\" \\"Up,\\" and \\"Away We Go\\" as my best of the summer.just one of my favorite cinema scenes ever).

B002KYHZLQ|2.0|It is with great disappointment -- but conversely, great personal relief -- to report that I was unable to finish Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson. Given the glowing reviews and endorsements, I expected this to be a great book. What I found instead was a turgid, impenetrable mess. That's fine if your name is Thomas Pynchon and there's a compelling artistic reason for your book to be challenging. As a fan of V and Crying of Lot 49, I can say that I enjoy a good literary challenge. But Erikson tries to pass off bad writing as genre-expanding and boundary-pushing -- when in fact it is simply bad.<br /><br />There are three elements that make a good fantasy novel: 1) compelling characters, 2) a great story and 3) a believable and fully realized world, be it our own or one of the author's imagination. Without these three elements working in concert together, a fantasy novel is a failure. This is why there are so few authors in the genre who reach classic status with a wide range of fans -- George R.R. Martin, Robert Jordan, J.R.R. Tolkien, Robin Hobb, even Terry Brooks.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is the first novel in what I can only imagine is a long and tedious series by Steven Erikson, a former archeologist turned dungeon master turned fantasy writer. Erikson is concerned with creating a world that features a deep and complex history, which is perhaps the book's only positive attribute. Created with a friend as the basis for a GURPS campaign, a lot of thought was put into the design of the world, but it's not enough to make a good book.<br /><br />Erikson's characters are flat, lack personality and serve as pawns in the Byzantine plot. There is no protagonist, but unlike say George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books where any single character is interesting enough to be considered a protagonist, this is not the case here. Their feelings and motivations are largely a mystery to the audience. And the naming convention is inconsistent -- some have silly names like Tattersail and Whiskeyjack, while others have long and complicated fantasy names. There are a lot of them, none of them ever properly introduced of fleshed out.<br /><br />In regards to story, there is none that can be easily articulated. There is a girl who is possessed by a god who is BAD NEWS, but her motivations are unclear, a young captain who conscripted by a major Imperial political figure to hunt her down, a squad of disgraced veteran soldiers, a female mage, thieves and assassins, a giant talking crow, a one-armed general, a power mad high mage, gods, ascendants, demons and slew of other fantasy creatures. However, I cannot describe what they're doing exactly.<br /><br />Imagine, if you will, a human being in the far-flung future. This person stumbles on an ancient novel describing the Vietnam War -- a novel written in 1967 that assumes the reader already knows the politics involved. But this future reader has never heard of the United States of America, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. He or she might be able to work out that President Johnson was the leader of a nation called the United States, that the U.S. army fights for him, but is unfamiliar with the concepts of democracy or communism, and because the book assumes the reader already knows it, is incapable of grasping the ideological struggle at the heart of the conflict.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is just like that -- there are battles galore, but it doesn't bother to explain the complicated politics and social systems that are the genesis of the conflict. Erikson either assumes you already know, or that you can work it out on your own. Of course, with great works of speculative fiction, a reader can work it all out if given the right hints by the author (see China Mieville, Jeff Vandermeer, Frank Herbert, etc.). This is not the case here.<br /><br />Finally, my first red flag on Steven Erikson was the condescending and self-involved interviews with him scattered around online.He seemed wrapped up in himself and his own greatness -- a problem many writers suffer from, I will admit -- but I got the sense that he was dismissive of readers who don't \\"get\\" his books, almost as if it's a character flaw on their part. I decided to give Gardens of the Moon a chance anyway -- and I believe I gave it a very fair chance. My Kindle says I've finished 50% of it. But there are other books to read and so many hours left in a person's life. I decided not to waste any more time on it.a problem many writers suffer from, I will admit -- but I got the sense that he was dismissive of readers who don't \\"get\\" his books, almost as if it's a character flaw on their part.

B0018S6YO4|4.0|Upon picking up \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" the third album by the excruciatingly beautiful 19-year-old Barbados dancehall reggae singer Rihanna (born: Robyn Rihanna Fenty), I slightly cringed at the album's title, thinking she had gone the route of most pop diva starlets (i.e., Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, etc.) by thinking that growing older means one has to flaunt and exploit sex and sexuality in order to showcase how much older she's become. When's it gonna sink in, ladies? Growing older and more mature does not mean you have to talk dirty and dress in skimpier outfits. Luckily, although there are a few songs on this album that have many sexual innuendo, upon listening to the title track, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" the last track on the album, I'm relieved to hear that the title doesn't mean what most audiences would think it to mean. And that's the exact theme that Rihanna uses throughout \\"Good Girl Gone Bad.\\" Not only is this green-eyed Bajan one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen (she should be People Magazine's top most beautiful person), but she's also shown with each album release that she's growing not only in age but artistically as well.<br /><br />Anyone who's listened to contemporary pop/rock/R&B radio knows Rihanna from her earlier hit singles \\"Pon De Replay,\\" \\"S.O.S.,\\" \\"Unfaithful,\\" and \\"Break it Off.\\" Her first album, 2005's Music of the Sun was chock full of summer dance anthems, headlined by the reggae dance tune (in the tradition of Sean Paul or Daddy Yankee, both of whom I despise) \\"Pon De Replay\\" (which I surprisingly enjoyed) that would most likely be played in any teenage girl's radio with her convertible top down and on the way to either the mall or the beach. 2006's \\"A Girl Like Me\\" wowed many critics who passed off Rihanna as merely another pop teen sensation. The album blended the summer dance jams that most of her fans enjoy with ballads such as \\"Unfaithful,\\" penned by Ne-Yo.<br /><br />The first song and also the first single, \\"Umbrella,\\" features Def Jam president and rapper extraordinaire Jay-Z in an intro that only lasts a little over thirty seconds, thusly not really deserving his \\"featuring\\" title in the credits (but he still gets this title because he's the president of the company and/or he's a big name in the music business). Supposedly, Mary J. Blige turned down the chance to record this song, and, after hearing Rihanna's version, I'm sure she's kicking herself for that. After Jay-Z's intro, drum beats bring on Rihanna's voice, which doesn't go as far as it could go in this song. But that's a good thing. I have the feeling that if she had tried to project her voice as high and as loud as she could, the song would've come off as some Mariah Carey-wannabe knockoff. This song is her best single to date and it's one of the best pop songs on the radio right now! Unfortunately, we're brought next to a song that starts to touch into that overtly sexual territory that I was talking about earlier. \\"Push Up On Me\\" is exactly how it sounds: a song littered with 80's beats and sexual suggestive lyrics that are a mere excuse to make a dance song so that girls can grind into guys' groins. The one good thing about this song is it automatically transitions into the - one I'm guessing will be - the next club hit, \\"Don't Stop the Music.\\" With its techno beats and a sample of Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" \\"Don't Stop the Music,\\" reminds me of the club beats I used to dance to back in the day. And I can already picture many remixes of this song on those Ultra Dance compilation albums (maybe volume 10?). Its infectious beats make me want to just move and dance; a good, catchy song.<br /><br />Track four is \\"Breakin' Dishes,\\" which I wasn't too impressed with (although it is catchy). Starting with gratuitous unifying girl-shouting chorus, the song just seems like some girl singing about her bravado in wanting to try and show how tough she is by saying she's not going home until the police show up and that she's gonna fight a man. Plus, the lyrics don't make much sense. I enjoyed the following track, \\"Shut Up and Drive,\\" so much more. The song begins with a sample of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" guitar riffs before going into synthesizer beats and notes. The song has enough driving-and-sex metaphor to make even the most hardcore nasty rapper blush! But Rihanna sings it in her usual come-hither voice, automatically making a dance hit. The next track is a duet with her \\"Unfaithful\\" writer Ne-Yo, called \\"Hate That I Love You.\\" It's a song starting off with acoustic soul guitar where each of the singers are addressing each other about the playfully annoying ways that they get on each other's nerves but recognize that that's exactly why they care so much for each other. The song is decent in a laid-back R&B acoustic soul way, but singers like Ne-Yo start to get all my nerves. I mean, take my generation's new jack soul R&B singers, who sound just like Ne-Yo: Tevin Campbell, Brian McKnight, R. Kelly, and Babyface. Look where those guys are now, Ne-Yo. 'Cause you'll soon be joining their ranks in obscurity.<br /><br />\\"Say It\\" is a mediocre song about a young woman's pleading to the man she loves to open up to her by talking more about his feelings and thoughts. The music stands out with an oriental-sounding influence (which is Mad Cobra's \\"Flex\\"), and with the multiple vocals (all supplied by Rihanna), sounding like En Vogue or Destiny's Child. The lyrics are so idealistic (almost to the point of naïve) that it's easy to recognize that Rihanna didn't write these lyrics; they were written by older men who have this conception of how young women her age feel. It should be noted that unlike her first two albums, Rihanna didn't do any songwriting on this album. \\"Sell Me Candy\\" again peeks into that naïve, sexual innuendo territory with Rihanna trying to convince this man she likes to drop his current girlfriend and hook up with her by singing sexually suggestive lyrics with candy references. Luckily, this song only runs a little over two-and-a-half minutes, and it goes into the extremely catchy \\"Lemme Get That.\\" This song returns Rihanna to her dancehall reggae roots and it's a welcomed reception with the perfectly positioned use of horns. The lyrics speak of a woman who's using her sexuality to get the material possessions she wants. Ironically, near the end of the song, she sings \\"I'm not a gold digger.\\" Well, actually, if you are using your body and sexuality to get material things and/or money, then you are. The song is catchy and good to dance to, but, sadly, I can see most young women embracing this song and \\"Sell Me Candy\\" as their anthems, blaring them in their cars as they sing along to the lyrics at the top of their voices.<br /><br />From the dance-crazed oblivion of \\"Lemme Get That\\" to the next song, \\"Rehab,\\" written by Justin Timberlake (who also supplies a few barely-noticeable background vocals), the album makes a sharp turn into more serious, profound subject matter. This song is about a girl realizing how wrong she was to devote her life and love to the guy she's dumping. She loved this man so much he was like a drug to her and the song is her getting over him, hence the title. This song is a slightly slower song and this is the song most women should be embracing. There are too many women today (particularly, young women) who date or go out with the biggest jerks who deep down are selfish and only want them for their own purposes. And the fact that this song both identifies that, but also delivers up proof that these women aren't alone and that they can get over these guys, is why this song is so much more important.<br /><br />Next is \\"Question Existing,\\" featuring a slow, sweeping beat and Rihanna's voice slightly digitally altered as if she's speaking in some dream. I admire her honesty and insight into her personal life and feelings. Even though she didn't receive anysongwriting credit, I'm sure the singer gave some input to the writers for this song; especially with lines like: \\"I'm just like you/Do the mistakes I make make me a fool/Or a human with flaws/Admit that I'm lost/Round of applause/Take the abuse/Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose\\" and \\"Dear diary, it's Robyn/Entertaining is something I do for a living/It's not who I am/I like to think that I'm normal/I laugh/I get mad/I hurt/I think guys suck sometimes/I don't know who to trust/I don't know who wants to date me for who I am/Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am.\\" Again, this isn't so much a song as it's a journal entry, with Rihanna unabashedly speaking her thoughts and feelings, and, in the process, showing other young women that they're not alone in their insecurities and doubts. After \\"Question,\\" we come to the title track \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" which isn't about Rihanna transforming her image. No. It's an acoustic guitar-filled warning for all boys/guys/men out there that they should start being more respectful and gentlemen-like to girls/women. 'Cause if they don't, as Rihanna warns, \\"once a good girl goes bad, we gone forever.\\" In her own way, she's saying that not all girls are the superficial, gold-digging sluts that most likely once hurt them. I like this song and even though it's not the strongest song on the album (that goes to \\"Umbrella\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\"), it's still enjoyable and a suitable finish.<br /><br />If I had to rate this album from one to five stars, I'd give it a three-and-a-half. Rihanna is growing with each album release as each one showcases her ever-growing maturity; I can't wait to see what she's releasing in the next two to five years `cause I think her music will not only master the dance club genre but delve deep into the ballad territory. Even the unlikeable or questionable songs are catchy. Just like any teenager, she's got more to learn, but, unlike most teens, she knows it. And as long as she keeps out of the craziness of \\"celebrity\\" (i.e. marrying young to some deadbeat dancer, shaving her head, getting addicted to drugs/alcohol, partying all the time, making a sex tape only to have it leaked on the Internet, etc.), she'll do great with her voice and the songs that come her way. Unfortunately for her, she did get involved in the Chris Brown drama, but she's come out of it a strong, graceful young woman and it hasn't hurt her career in the least. It seems like she's putting music out there that best personifies what she's currently going through in her life. As a musician and music lover, what more could you ask for? While \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is not for everyone, it still doesn't keep it from being some catchy music and great to dance to.estive lyrics with candy references.

B001LMRCP2|3.0|well, the music was great (listened from youtube) but the fact that i purchased this and amazon would not let me download it because of the fact i have to use their useless music downloader that caused me to not be able to download the music i have bought.I would demand a refund, but i do not feel like spending my time to get back $6.00...    so the music was 4.5 stars    and amazon's music downloader was 0 stars...
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I have loved Lady A since I first saw them on CMT. They have such a talent for creating wonderful music. They sing, write & work hard at what they do and it shows. I was anxious to get this with all the airplay of \\"Need You Now\\" and it didn't disappoint. Such emotion & wonderful harmonies! Amazon made it even better by offering it for $3.99!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was marvelous.  I got to the point that I could not put it down.  My thanks for a well written book.
B0029O0BKO|5.0|Excellent! Excellent from beginning to end! This movie was good the first time I saw it, and now on blu-ray, it's even better. Everything from the HAWK on Hawk's rig to the cheesy 80's music on the radio, everything seems better on blu-ray. I bought this for $14 but would've paid $20.....buy buy buy!!!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Well, after 16 years of existence you have to expect things to change in a band's life.  Gone are the days where four young men are broke and trying to get to get their message out in a diluted talent pool such as the one found in L.A.  Those circumstances were replaced with a group that, despite legal obstacles and the eventually dumbing-down of the art culture around them (MTV played music when these guys came out; they don't do that much anymore), still remained culturally relevant and platinum-selling artists.  Sure the album isn't nearly as angry or perhaps violent as their earlier releases but it still packs a punch and is definitely worth listening too.    Unlike their other full-length studio albums, this album listens less like a collective story (or concept album, if you will) and instead listens like a collection of short stories assembled in an anthology that is 10,000 Days.  Many of the songs still retain the dynamics that Tool is known for (especially the Wings for Marie/10,000 Days tracks) and combines them with elements of influence from their touring partners of recent past (This is most evident on the Meshuggah-influenced \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" as well as the Fantomas influenced \\"Rosetta Stoned\\").  With the band having explored with sonic textures in the past, the group explores their stories with skits (like in \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman)\\") and with the indigenous-American sounding Lipan Conjuring (which is probably better explained by the fact that vocalist Maynard James Keenan takes residence in northern Arizona.)  The elements that have drawn people to Tool in the past are still here; which has allowed them to retain their fanbase while continually developing new fans thanks to their work.    I hate to take pot-shots at the album, but I guess the reason why I don't hold it in a higher regard like their other releases is that there's times where it starts to feel like it's either trying to appeal to the casual listener (\\"The Pot\\", from a lyricalstandpoint, isn't necessarily their deepest song) or that the songs feel less like a Tool song and more like something Keenan's trying to do on his own (this especially holds true with \\"Right In Two.\\"  Even though I couldn't agree more with the lyrics, it still sounds like a leftover track from [[ASIN:B000641ZIQ eMOTIVe]] that was converted into a Tool song.)    Be that as it may, the Wings For Marie/10,000 Days tracks are particularly moving and are a very fitting homage to Keenan's late mother.  From start to finish the album doesn't disappoint and has remained constant in my rotation despite my immense love for [[ASIN:B00005B36H Lateralus]].  I recommend it for fans of progressive rock/metal and fans of avant-garde music.  I'd recommend it to Tool fans but they probably own this album already.
B002TZS5GU|5.0|I found the movie \\"Carriers\\" to be both exciting and entertaining.  As far as I am concerned, it was money well spent.  I had the dvd in my possession in less than a week after placing my order, thank you amazon.com.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This movie is a disney classic and one of my favorites.  I love the villainous Maleficent.  The sound quality is stellar and the picture quality is amazing.      If you own the Special Edition version of this that was released a few years back, it's not quite amazing enough to upgrade to this.    However, if you do not own digital non VHS verison of this movie, this is the copy you should purchase!    The one downside is that I wish it came with a digital copy like all the Disney-PIXAR blu-rays seem to be doing lately.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|Arrived quickly.  What else can I say?  It's a new Harry Potter Plu-Ray.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Although the special effects in this movie are not state of the art, it is one of the classic sci fi hits which also spawned a short run tv series. If you are looking for something a little different, the this movie would be it.
0740785508|5.0|James Gurney is the Artist who brought us 'Dinotopia' and many glimpses of the ancient world in the pages of National Geographic.  For the artists among us he has written a how to with illustrations on how he clothed his models and set up the scenes.    He gives some great advice on where to find costumes, how to look at scenery to create your backgrounds.  I found it interesting that painting what doesn't exist means not only creating scenes of fantasy and futuristic landscapes but also scenes that used to exist such as an Etruscan Funeral or a Cretaceous water hole.    The art in the book is the best part.  There is of course scenes from dinotopia some of which have sketches and storyboards included. There are many of his regular Dinosaur paintings which are very detailed and lifelike.    I like his historical scenes done for National Geographic.  He puts the viewer right in the middle of Etruscan Funeral proceeedings or on the deck of the U.S.S. Cumberland as she is shot to pieces and sinking at the hands of the C.S.S. Virginia.    This book will appeal to art lovers and artists alike and is great to just sit and quietly browse.  I see something new in the Artwork every time I enjoy it.
031606792X|5.0|Overall I thought this book was a good ending to a good series.  I've enjoyed reading these books and was really excited to find out the ending to this exciting series. However, there were some questionable things in this book that I felt would not be appropriate for children under the age of at least sixteen. This is also one of those books that I think young adults and women of all ages would enjoy. It's definitely a chick flick type book, but is also something that married men perhaps could enjoy.  In this final book, we find out what happens between Bella and Edward, and whether or not he decides if he wants to compromise Bella's soul. Along with this event, we also find out what happens between the vampires and the werewolves, and the events that transpire between them. All in all, I thought this was a really good read and would definitely recommend this book to any fan of twilight. If you haven't read the first three books in this series then you'd be pretty lost. So I recommend reading the first three and finishing up with this exciting final chapter.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|Saw bits and pieces of this on YouTube and fell in love. If you have the patience for subtitles, you're going to like it. If you speak French, you're going to love it. Have since purchased songs by all four of the male leads. All fabulous singers.

B002MU4NL8|5.0|Blu-ray really is worth the money. There's just no other way to say it.    Galaxy Quest: I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it in the theatre and still love it today. Not only is it a great spoof of Sci-fi movies and TV shows in general, it is also a really great story! The ensemble cast is perfectly cast, the plot is actually believable (once one buys into the science fiction part) and the direction is right on target.  We own this movie on video cassette and on DVD and now on Blu-ray.     Top notch entertainment! I might just go watch it again right now!
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Love the show, just wish the language wasn't so bad (especially with all the unnecessary \\"G.D.s\\"......overall a great storyline, though!
0879309210|5.0|I purchased this to learn how to do my own setups and maintenance on my guitar.  This book has allowed me to do that and then some.  I'd highly recommend that anyone that is tired of paying for maintenance and repairs on their guitars pick this book up and start learning to do it yourself.  It'll save you money and you won't have to leave your guitars with a guitar tech for days at a time.
0571238343|5.0|I don´t know what to say that haven´t been said about how good this book is, but I`d like to warn that isn´t for someone who knows nothing about principles of animation. Even when starts from the beggining, it goes fast to a more advanced training. I´ve been studing animation for one year and this has been an excelent complement to go in depth, improve and starting the next level of the matter, where the very basics are part of you and you concentrate on reach natural acting.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a lovely book that takes two lives and runs parallel stories that intersect at various points.  Our main character, Julia, is an American woman in her mid-forties who has married and settled in France.  She has lived half her life there at the point that the story opens.  Her marriage is a bit strained, but it seems fundamentally OK.<br /><br />  What changes everything is that she is given an assignment for her writing job:  Write about the 60th anniversary of the Paris roundup of the Jews in 1942.  What she discovers, and how it impacts her own family is the basic story.<br /><br />  As it happens, the apartment her husband's family has lived in since July, 1942, was available to them because a Jewish family was arrested.  As a counterpoint to Julia's story (her research, plus her growing problems with a very self-centered husband), there are alternate chapters that take us through the story of Sarah, the 12 year old member of the Jewish family that was arrested in 1942.  It is heartbreaking.  The key of the title is a key that is used to lock and hide one member of the family in the apartment (they thought they would be right back).<br /><br />  What a tragedy.  This is a very, very sad book.  Like all good books, however, there are many life affirming moments, and the author is clever with her pacing and characterization so it never becomes just impossible to read.<br /><br />  I recommend this book without reservation!
1591843162|4.0|ADD VALUE! - The clearest message of Linchpin!    Don't expect your job description to remain the same, don't even expect it to remain clear.    It's been written in many ways and many places that the old economy of working 8 to 5 for the same company for 25 years is over. At the very least it is exceptionally rare and will become more and more rare as we forge ahead into the new age of capitalism.    As always Seth has an excellent way of getting the point across and has tapped many other notable people on the subject.  In this case the subject being your way of making a living is your way of living, as an employee, as a boss, as a member of society and as a person.     Linchpin is slightly heavy on the frosting and needs more cake, but sweet stuff none the less. For those of us that want to be indispensable and really contribute ourselves as our work this is indeed sweet stuff. I personally think the point could have been made in few pages, but Mr. Godin makes sure you've got the point.    The bonuses that he has added to the book are pretty cool too.  So far I've gone through the \\"Change This\\" manifesto and the \\"Brainstorming video\\"  and I got some great stuff out of them as well.

I don't have much interest in the Edge or Jack White for that matter but they both are interesting characters with a story to tell. For me it was all about J Page at 65 still with the magic and the charm that helped make Zep a monster band amongst mortals.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|This was the first book I bought for my Kindle.  Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of \\"secret to success\\" as one fitting formula for the general masses.  But this book was different.  Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times.  It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help.  Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family.  I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had.  It was all there.  The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.  This is one book that I want in my library, as a keeper - as opposed to ones that I wish I could give back.
B002WIDRM6|2.0|Another group firmly entrenched in the corporate country craze sweeping o'er the airwaves. It's hard to keep track of all these groups because they look and sound so much alike. It's just that some may, or may not be, slightly more genuine and real than others. These songs sound like the same songs we've been fed many times before, just re-hashed and re-cashed. Download the couple MP3s you like and skip the rest.
0670034711|2.0|This is my first review and the embarrassing part is, I didn't even get past page 20.  My sister accidentally left the book at my place after she visited, and as the mother of 3 with so little free time, I just couldn't bear to fill it with this kind of literature.  I could just feel where it was going when, in the same paragraph, discussions about her \\"gorgeous\\" lover are intertwined with something this woman wanted to portray as spirituality, especially she talks about her own enlightened hindsight.  I felt SO relieved when I read these reviews that confirmed my hunches.
1400063515|5.0|Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan is about how people, including academics, are unable to properly gauge uncertainty thus setting themselves up for disaster, or Black Swan events.     Black swan events are like one-time events or very infrequent unpredictable events that disrupt the mediocrity of human life.  Examples of Black Swan events are the collapse of LTCM, The Crash of '87, and maybe the housing collapse.  Black Swans plague human history; however for many reasons people, including academics, are blind to them.  This book tries to make the reader aware of Black Swans and give reasons why people are blind to them.  This book also contends why mainstream academics have it wrong when gauging uncertainty.    One of the problems I had was that this book wasn't very cohesive.  The book goes from one subject to subject not in a streamline manner.  I had to jot down notes to keep track on what was written.  I would have given a 4-star for this, but the idea of Black Swan events was compelling enough for a good rating.    This book is an easier read than Fooled by Randomness.  It was slow reading though because it is pretty deep.  It was a good book.    Here are the highlights and my takeaway:  - Guassian bell curves are for most applications worthless, but people use the curves to gauge uncertainty.   - This book goes against conventional wisdom  - Despite the occurrences of Black Swans, people fool themselves into thinking that Black Swans were predictable and hence unimpressive events.   Even worse, people set themselves up for a Black Swan event instead of trying to avoid the possibility of a Black Swan.  - Black Swans live in scalable environments, instead of non-scalable environments.  People live as if in a non-scalable world when the modern world is more like a scalable world.    This book provides lots of reasons why people are blind to Black Swans.  Blacks Swans are tough to predict to begin with, but the problem is compounded when people are blind to Black Swans.  This book tries to make the reader aware of the existence of Black Swan events.    I read Thomas Sowell's Intellectuals and Society and I think there is a bit of crossover between both books.  Taleb's book is not political; however Taleb's description of the Platonifiers is similar to Sowell's description of Intellectuals.  Both Sowell and Taleb mention the idea of knowledge being spread across the populace.  Sowell mentions that knowledge is too vast to be contained by the few.  Taleb mentions that even people like the Platonifiers lack the knowledge to predict future given the numerous and unknown variables.    If you're a trailblazer who is puzzled why you cannot seem to get people to go along with you, this book is for you.  Also, I would recommend this book to those who liked Taleb's Fooled by Randomness and to those who are fans of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  This book is a whole lot easier to read than his other book, Fooled by Randomness.  This book is pretty deep so expect slow reading.
B00345A81O|5.0|I have had the privilege of seeing Bowie many times, and I caught the Reality Tour in Austin. It was so beautiful. I memorized as much of it as I possibly could. It looked to me like he knew this could be the last tour. He gave it all. I hope this isn't the last we'll hear from such a singular talent. But if it is, boy, he sure could write a song and put on some kinda show. One of a kind. I'm one of the millions whose life he changed. This album is well worth the investment for the version of \\"Loving the Alien\\" alone.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Waking up can sometimes be a nightmare. And that nightmare can be amplified when you have no idea what is going on around you. As viewers we know the world has gone down hill and the population has slowly skyrocketed, leading to warring over limitations of the Earth's remaining fossil fuels. In the year 2174 a ship is lauched, reaching to the stars to solve a few problems. Passengers - 60,000. Destination - You find that out later in the movie. People you find yourself trying to really figure out - 2. And the amount of horrors creeping around this monstrosity of a ship - a bunch.<br /><br />Pandorum takes the idea of being inside of something confined and pushes it to another level, allowing terrible things to happen both in the minds and to the bodies of - everyone. We see our first person wake up and wonder what is going on, and find that he has overslept by about 8 years. He awakens another person to see if they know anything, and the two of them seem like Batman and a lazier Batman (I can't ever remember Batman just hanging back and saying \\"go here,\\" but I'm not calling anyone Robin). They want to find a way onto the flight deck, to the eyes of the sky, and finally to that wonderful thing called \\"an explanation.\\" The problem is that there are horrors along the way and that there are terrible people blocking they path and, really, you have no idea what the world is capable of when you've been asleep that long.<br /><br />Personally, I liked the story, the nice little ending, the count that was remaining when the credits rolled (although I kept wondering what would happen now and what would happen if any of those - things - decided to do the same thing everyone else was doing), and the way the truth was unveiled. It was all tragically terrible and it was all hideously mean and, in the end, it could have been seen if one wanted to see it. Does that mean the movie was bad? No way. When that first - whatever - opted to come out and play, I kept thinking how badly things could be. I had heard this being compared to Alien, but this was no alien to me. It played a different game, a hidden sport, and didn't have an LV-426 to hide itself inside. There is a secret, sure, and the plot is explained if a person stares at it hard enough. But most movies seem like that these days.<br /><br />Should you see it? I liked it but that might not mean you will. There are oddities and there are twists, but this is not an illusion that makes you paw at your remote to get another fix from it. I still liked it alot, though, and I liked the way the running story kept you entertained. There were new add-ons, sure, and I thought our main man (whom I really like as an actor) was a bit more trusting than I. Then again, I didn't spend any time tied to the ceiling, being looked at like BBQ (or did I - hmmmm).<br />You really should give the movie a chance if the genre appeals to you. It might have something inside the ship that makes you think \\"no voyages in the future for me, no matter what.\\"had heard this being compared to Alien, but this was no alien to me.

B001GWK2MC|2.0|After less than one week of use one of the seams split.  My grandchildren do not even approach the weight limits and the jump-o-lene was set up on carpeting so there was no reason for this to happen.  The only explanation is poor workmanship.  I feel anyone who has had a similar experience should have their money refunded.  I was very disappointed!!!!!
B001974DG0|5.0|I have read many D. Koontz novels and thus far, I must say, this is his best and my favorite. It is very involved and well thought out. I am sincerely pleased to have read it. It puts a smile on my face everytime I think about Einstein, Travis, and Nora Cornell.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I find myself telling people about this workout all the time. It's the most intense one I've ever done, and the best part is that each one is packed into 20 minutes. It's great on busy days. There are also two levels within each of the three workouts, so I can choose the intensity I want that day. The combo of cardio, strength, and weights is awesome, and I can see and feel a difference in my body right away. Highly, highly recommend it.

B002KVSJ64|2.0|There's some Ok stuff on here, but overall this album doesn't hold up as well as PHOBIA.  The title track is the best, IMO.  The songs just seem to be lacking direction and focus.  I love this guy's voice, but the music is just OK at best.  If you're dying to hear some more Breaking Benjamin, maybe someday we'll see/hear some more demos and b-sides get spewed toward the public...
0812973992|3.0|This book was for my boyfriend for christmas, who is an avid reader. His opinion of the book was that with all the different story lines it was a little confusing, and it took until over half of the book for him to get that into it and be interested in finishing it. I will read it soon and maybe give my opinion at a later date...
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake is a band that I have recently found out about. I heard about them from a friend, and this CD is the first one of theirs that I bought/listened to. It's fantastic! There are many different elements in their music (country, hip-hop, jazz, rockabilly, etc) and it makes them a very unique band. They are now my favorite band, I own all of their CDs, and I would recommend this music to anybody - mainly because it appeals to so many different palates. :)
B001KEGRCA|5.0|This is Imax at its finest with the highest possible video quality available as there's a vast difference to me when a film is shot in HD compared to a standard definition DVD that has been upgraded/transferred to the Blu-ray format as this type of film really shows what Blu-ray is all about which is far above regular definition videos.  If you love Western scenery like I do and love to see it in the highest quality, then this is for you with the conservation message being a plus.
1439138311|2.0|Like one of the previous reviews, I kept waiting for something dramatic...anything dramatic...to happen.  The main character did what she wanted to do, or occasionally what she didn't want to do...BUT it ALWAYS turned out okay...not exactly like real life. the whole storyline is completely unrealistic...She needs a job and a room in America...the priest arranges it for her.  She goes to her FIRST Friday night dance...she meets the boy she will eventually marry.  She starts night school classes (paid for by the store she was working in???)...immediately rises to head of the class and passes with the highest of grades.  A death occurs in in Ireland...the store gives her more than a month off to return home.  She is reacquainted with a man from home and he falls desperately in love with her.  I mean...come on...this book does not give a very realistic picture of what an immigrant's life was like.  and the scene of Miss Fortini watching her change bathing suits? The author introduces it and then completely drops it.  Why?  probably because he thought it would give the book some spice, like the \\"first time\\" scene between her and Tony. Dull book.
B002NHBNWW|4.0|I wasn't too convinced that this series was going to make it after I saw the pilot. I told myself I would give it a chance and low and behold it turned into a pretty decent series so far. I surprised myself that I actually like that the series doesn't follow the book exactly. I read this series back when it first came out and remembered loving it. So that's my opinion anyway.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|If they do make a sequel keep JJ Abrams in charge.The writing was great the cast selection the music and the special effects were out of this world.I am an aspiring author and I hope to one day write a sci-fi story just as good as Star Trek,I join the many fans in saying thanks for giving us a great movie.
B001P9KR94|3.0|It was a feel good movie at the end.The beginning was complicated to follow as it was spoken in Hindi with small subtitles on the bottom.Not being a fast reader and not knowing Hindi was a minus for me.If I had just watched the movie I would have figured out the plot on my own.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This boxset is a bijoux for anyone who is a Beatles and/or music fan. Absolutely love the packaging and every cd is a mini replica of the LP, with its own little mini sleeve. A pleasure to take them out and play them. As for the music , most albums sound better or just as good in mono as they do in stereo, except Sgt Pepper which is an absolute MUST in mono. I have both boxsets and I think they are the definite Beatles collection and a wonderful journey through the history of modern music. If you have to choose a boxset, go with this wonderful mono box and then complement with individual cds of Abbey Road, Let It Be.
B002U6CJCE|4.0|I was actually really surprised to hear that this was a good movie so i figured that i would check it out. Was never really a fan of the original ones. This is actually a pretty good action movie, definitly worth checking out if you're a fan of violent movies. The acting all around is solid. My only complaint is the lack of budget/simple setting of the film. The action tho is what makes this movie and there are some really good scenes. If you like violent action films with good realistic fighting choreography definitly check this one out.
0793518326|4.0|This book is a terrific achievement.  But the small print and hardcover binding make it tough for musicians to use as a practical resource.  At the least, the book should be published with a durable soft cover and sturdy spiral binding so it can be laid flat on a piano or music stand.

0307473465|5.0|When 15-year-old Michael Berg discovers an older woman willing to become his lover, he thinks he's the student. Yet, intimacy with Hanna comes with one condition--he's got to read to her first.     Michael never thought much about this odd form of foreplay until years later when Hanna's on trial as a Nazi war criminal. Michael, who is now a law student, watches as the other guards do their best to shift their blame onto Hanna. But, she couldn't be to blame, he realizes Hanna couldn't read nor write.      Yet, Hanna takes the fall for the other defendants. She's sentenced to life. Their roles reverse and Michael is now the teacher. In the time before talking books, he records chapters and sends them to her.      \\"The Reader\\" appears a short, quick read, but the content within is thought-provoking and intense.  The author's language literally transports you to postwar Germany.      My one regret is this book is not bound as a classic should be. \\"The Reader\\" will not stand up to more than a couple of readings, at least in this particular iteration.     Rebecca Kyle, January 2010

1577314808|5.0|I had an open mind about it and I had been prepped so to speak from reading Shakti Gawain, Wayne Dyer and the Tao Te Ching (interpreted by Dyer) among other authors including Dale Carnegie.  Because I was \\"prepped,\\" I was in the right place in my life to understand Tolle. Even so, it took me quite a number of pages until I started to get it. It is not organized like most books, so it took patience. But once you \\"get it\\", well, once I \\"got it\\" it changed my perspective and changed my life. It then helped me to discover many things about my life and that year 2009, even though it was financially horrible, become the best year of my life.
B002L5810I|5.0|If you're looking at buying this you are probably already a Michael Jackson fan, so my information just relates to the actual disc.    First off, this dvd I ordered isn't really the new 2009 usa format.  It's actually a region 3 disc that will play on American DVD players.      As for the seller, this is shipped from all the way in The Phillipines so you will be waiting a little while to get it.  It was ordered on Dec 28 and I believe Amazon estimated Jan 17 but I got in on Jan 13, which was just fine.   Just a heads up.    For the product itself, it is terrific.  I have watched the movie Moonwalker so many times in the past and having it on dvd is something I've looked forward to for a while.  This dvd is high quality as I have watched it on many TVs/players and it has always looked good.  I think it looks best on my PS3/Blu Ray through the HDMI.  When you load up the dvd it goes straight to the menu.  It doesn't have any extras besides the theatrical trailer (which looks good too)  and it has those interactive still frame menus that change every 4-5 seconds (mostly smooth criminal pictures).    I recommend buying this if you want this movie.  I have not been disappointed.
B001H122N4|5.0|This is footage of a great concert perfprmed by David Gilmour. The recording is awesome and the filming is very complete. I highly recomend this DVD/CD to any Pink Floyd or David Gilmour fans. It is well worth the money.
1416572287|5.0|This book reminds me of Steven Hawking's books.  Physics very well explained, with very few equations.  Does an excellent job of getting complex concepts across.  And this book does it in an amusing way -- a series of tongue-in-cheek conversations in which the author explains quatum physics (quantum mechanics) to his dog.  As the author states, in some ways, dogs are better suited than humans to understand quantum mechanics, because they don't come equipped with certain assumptions which people do.  Assumptions which may be valid on a macroscale, but not valid on the tiny scale of atomic particles.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the topic.  It is suitable for people with a wide range of knowledge about physics.  Different people will get different things out of it, despending on their current level of understanding of quantum physics and physics in general.  Quantum physics is not a simple subject and the book requires thought and attention when read.  It is also an entertaining read.  Highly recommended.  I've already given a copy as a gift and will be giving more.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|\\"It Might Get Loud\\" ;      I liked the movie it was good, considering Jimmy was in it and hasn't done much work in recent years, and it was affordable. Seems anything remotely related to Jimmy is usually very expensive in recent years and unattainable for average folk. It was good to see a product that was affordable.     The content was ok, the movie was too short and not enough technical information. This movie was geared towards guitar players, and yet most of the information provided was common sense knowledge...there wasn't any guitar technique revelations, so you could only watch it a couple times.   I would have liked too see more explination of these artist key signature techniques.   One would think, if you put 3 legends in a room together, that they would create a mind blowing sound, but that wasn't there either.     It was good to see these 3 folks in a relaxed setting, along with their personal commentary. Showed their human side.     I'd like to see them at a holiday family meal...do they eat like us?      When are we going to get the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" reality show ?
B002UZXJA6|4.0|In this lovely new recording, Celtic Woman offers a mix of contemporary covers and traditional folk tunes.  Though the group has somewhat mainstreamed its Celtic roots, the satin voices soar as effortlessly as ever; and the lilting fiddles are a delight, as always.  Album standouts include the stirring bagpipes and harmonies of \\"Amazing Grace,\\" the gently weeping fiddle of \\"The Lost Rose Fantasia,\\" the carefree but driving tempo of \\"Nil Se'n La\\" (though \\"full throttle\\" seems an anachronistic phrase that pulls me out of the song every time I hear it), and the poignant vocal solo of \\"Fields of Gold.\\"<br /><br />\\"When You Believe\\" is, for me, the weak link in this offering.  The vocal is technically flawless yet doesn't fully connect emotionally (all but flatlines in the bridge), especially when compared to the passion of Whitney and Mariah's original version.  Also, I'd have liked a bit more energy from the CD overall; \\"Nil Se'n La\\" and the instrumental \\"The Coast of Galicia\\" stand out as the only really lively tracks.  Overall, though, there's plenty here to love.  This beautiful, accessible CD is sure to create many new fans of a unique and talented group of vocalists and musicians.
0810983915|5.0|Dairy of a Wimpy Kid introduces Greg Hefley as a middle school nothing. He is actually extremely smart and funny even though he is the fifty-second most popular kid in the school. Sometimes he tries to get popular with the girls but his friend Mark, who is the 150th, by the way, breaks his hand and captures all the attention from the girls.    Greg is the kind of indoor kid who is usually playing video games, making projects or pranks. Sometimes he makes comic books. But the problem is that his little brother gets everything he wants and his too-cool big brother never gets in trouble.  So he is just left in the middle.  When a wrestling unit comes up, how is he not going to get twisted into a pretzel for the next month and a half? To top it off they have to wear what looks like 1800's style bathing suits!    My favorite part is when he makes a comic called Creighton the Cretin.  It is about a kid who thought really weird thoughts like he needed a new butt because his old one had a crack in it. It should be in the real world!     I recommend this book to people who like funny, sarcastic humor or for people who feel left out. This book could give you a lot of ideas, they are like collectable toys!  So what about the rest of you? Well stop eating crackers on the couch, simple! You could maybe try Wimpy Kid's ideas!  You can make your own haunted house!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|The Show is a masterpiece. Simple as that. The more you watch it, the more you get out of it. Possibly the most intelligent show I have ever seen. This show isn't just funny and smart, but enlightening. I think most people will come out richer after watching Daria, and that applies to school kids and middle aged adults equally. Daria isn't just a TV show, it's art. It will stand the test of time and is already an important cultural work.

B002UD56I6|5.0|I sat down last night and watched this montage of Michael Jackson. I was glued to the tv.All I could think was what a talented man this was and what a waste that he is dead. He should be entertaining people for many more years.   This film did show that he was in shape, dancing with people half his age and most certainly keeping up with them if not surpassing them.    Not much more to say than it was good, gave insight into his creative genuis and made us realize how much he will be missed.
B000089A06|3.0|I guess this is a prequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" or is it a sequel? No matter. It's nowhere near as scary as the original, but it does have some tension sufficient to hold your interest. Ed Norton, somewhat light in his loafers, plays Jodi Foster in this, while Hannibal Lechter is, as usual, Anthony Hopkins. The main villain is no Hannibal Lechter, but he has his moments. You've seen the ending several times before. Trust me. Watch if you are a Lambs fan. Just don't expect any great miracles.
1594488843|5.0|Dan has a natural gift of teaching, I wish I had him as a teacher growing up. This book did not disappoint. Dan nailed the major points from this book in his TED talk, but I would still recommend that you read the book. Looking forward to more of his good work to come.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I can hardly believe that it has been about 5-6 years when the Irish classical/pop group Celtic Woman first came out. I have been a huge fan of the women since their self-titled album came out, thanks to PBS. Over time the group has lost two (Orla and Maev) and gained two new members in the form of Alex and Lynn. Songs from the Heart is the new Celtic Woman which features the two new members. I just bought the album today and I have been listening to it a lot. I love it. Alex and Lynn fit in perfectly with Lisa, Chloe, and Mairead. The song selection isn't exactly in the order that is seen on the PBS concert/DVD. I believe the DVD features a couple of songs not included on the album (which is often the case). What really impressed me was Chloe's voice. Her vocals have really improved in over the years. I can hear the change on the ballad \\"When You Believe\\" (one of my personal favorite tracks on the album), taken from the animated film \\"The Prince of Egypt\\". Chloe has certainly evolved from a teenage girl to a young woman. I don't know if it was really necessary to cover Sting's \\"Fields of Gold\\" since it has been covered by quite a few artists but it is still a lovely cover by the women. Other favorites includes \\"Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears\\" and \\"O,America\\". Overall Songs from the Heart is another gem from Celtic Woman. I definitely recommend it for fans of the classical/pop genre.
1594202249|1.0|The beginning strikes me as labored writing (oftentimes difficult to understand and licentious in conventional grammatical construction and meter) serving as a pretense for the authors' desire to visit the genre.  I am an avid fiction reader.  The volumes I have read , sadly, occupy a large footprint  on the planet.  Every once in a while, though, a fiction work  will serve as a catalyst to  flip my switch;   making me realize all fiction is made up.  Once my switch is flipped,  I cant justify reading fiction and then switch to non-fiction, for a while, in pursuit of \\"useful\\" information.  This novel has directly caused the feeling that fiction is useless; and the feeling has crept up upon me on little cat feet.  My extremities are tingling with the feeling that Socrates had  after drinking a  cup of hemlock. I am 120 pages in now.  Other reviewers say TP is an acquired taste.   After enduring songs, bad acid trips and a caricature of a plot; I unequivocally state INHERENT VICE tastes sour.  I hold little hope of redemption and soldier on to the finish line with as much relish  as I have when I must use a plunger on a feces- impacted toilet bowl.  The problem here is that form has trumped substance.  The whole novel is one long inside joke.  The plot is nonsensical and lacks urgency and direction.  The characters are flat at best and absurd Rowan & Martin pop-up cameos at worst.  The whole experience feels as if seen through a glass, darkly.  For  the finest example of the genre today readers are urged to spend their hard earned coin on Steven M. Thomas CRIMINAL KARMA.  Steven M. Thomas is a poet and philosopher expounding on SoCal.  He has something worthwhile to say and he knows how to say it.  Steven M. Thomas is the finest talent laboring in this space.  I am 200 pages in and have 160 pages to go.  Reading this book feels like a sentence in a frozen Soviet gulag.  It is hard time.  In conclusion, it's not me it's YOU.  This book is unreadable.  It is the worst book I  have read since  Randy Wayne White HUNTERS MOON.  Over the last 50 pages I glimpsed a penumbra of good writing;  on the whole though, I re-iterate that any literary merit is obscured by a psychedelic kalaidescope  of hazy plot lines, characters and sentence structure.  AVOID.
B001LPWGE6|2.0|I just received my Bourne Trilogy Blu-ray boxed set from Amazon - it too exactly 2 weeks to reach Singapore by surface mail which isn't too bad. I should have looked closer at the invoice upon checking out the item as it is currently going for $65.99 so it works out to $21.99 per title. However, if you buy all three Bourne movies separately on Blu-ray, Amazon will make you a deal for $47.97. What's the point in buying the boxed set?
0312360258|2.0|While the take on vampires in the 'House of Night' novels has a newish twist, that doesn't make up for the fact that 'Marked' and indeed all of the books in the series to date are being staked by their own vapidity.  What small iota of plot & freshness they contain is all but smothered with whiny, angsty teenage sulking and self-absorption.    Now I'm sure most of the target audience for these books 'oh so totally identify with Zoey's problems'.  For the rest of us, they are painful to endure.      On a seperate note, I'm no prude when it comes to dark fantasy...I read and enjoy Kelley Armstrong, Carrie Vaughn and Patricia Briggs novels (and LKH's early stuff, back they had plots) but for a series whose main draw are the 13-17 crowd, do they really need to tout underage drinking, drug use and oral sex in high school hallways (and that's just in the first couple of chapters of 'Marked')?  Zoey and her gang are great role models for the youngters to imitate.....bring on the boy harems!      I find it funny that over the years some of Judy Blume's books have been 'edited' for content and yet we've got these young adult novels being published that make her works look like Mother Goose nursery rhymes.     If Zoey & company had been at least 18 when the series began (and if she actually had a spine), I'd have had no objections to content and probably would have rated the series at 3 stars (my rating of 2 comes from the bringing in of the pagan and Native American mythology into the stories...interesting touch).  Just my opinion.....FrFUBAR
B00005JSGK|5.0|It is always wonderful seeing John Wayne is a less than serious role.  This is not slapstick comedy nor satire, but there are elements of humor, both in Wayne's character and in Red Button's character.  It is good the see the \\"second banana\\" 'get the girl' also.  The story takes place in Africa and the action takes place around gathering animals for various zoos.  And then there are the baby elephants, but I won't give it away.
1592802974|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  It's always motivating during a down trading period.  Although some reviewers claim it is outdated, I think they fail to realize some of the tried and proven tenets of trading.  I believe that all traders should have this on their bookshelf - both novice traders for inspiration, and veteran traders for motivation.      Note that in the above paragraph, I say \\"traders\\" and not \\"investors.\\"  Investors may not find this book as fascinating unless they are actively involved with their portfolios beyond \\"passive investing.\\"

Chills.  -The world lost someone very special.  -I wonder if he really and truly knew how he effected millions of people around the world with his humanity, music, dance and unmatched showmanship.  -Pleasantly surprised that he sounds so great.  -I'm struck by his professionalism, perfectionism, artistry, creativity, kindness...  -His dancers obviously adore him.  -Wow, what a show it would've been. *smile  -Michael Jackson, The Musical. Just a thought.  -His legs are really skinny. haha  -What a musical genius. Amazing.  -The backup singer rapping on the \\"Black or White\\" number is terrible. haha  -You really get a sense of who Michael is through these rehearsals - work ethic, professionalism, how he deals with and interacts with the people who work for him and so on.  -Genius, indeed.  -Still love that \\"Billie Jean\\" bassline. haha  -eee hee hee...ch'mon. :-)  -Yeah, MJ, the musical might be cool.  -I wonder what it was like to be Michael Jackson.   -He broke out some dance moves I hadn't seen him do before. Cool.   -I enjoy it when he freestyles on occasion.  -He says, \\"God Bless You\\" a lot.   -Wow, lot of people involved in this production. Look at that circle.   -Still surprised at how good he sounds.  -I miss him. *Tear  -Money well spent. Glad I got my copy of \\"This Is It\\" on the day it came out.   -It's a finger-snapping, toe-tapping experience. Love it.   -I'd recommend it to everybody. Even to the haters.  -I've heard every song on this disc at least a thousand times. I'd say I'm a fan. haha  -Don't think I've enjoyed watching someone working at his job so much in my life.   -The extras are nice - especially the \\"Memories of Michael\\". *Tears  -Mr. Ortega's story about his visit to Neverland - the elephant passing by the window - gave me a chuckle.  -I never believed the ugly rumors about MJ and never will.  -I will cherish this disc forever.  -\\"All for love, L-O-V-E\\". *Tears  -R.I.P MJ
0316044938|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet but this book is outstanding. I didn't want to put it down. The writing, the imagery, the story line... GREAT! I know the movie could  not be as good. Can't wait to read it again. Even my 13 year old daughter is reading it. Must have!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This is the best book into movie ever. This is the best movie ever. If you are like me and are constantly searching for that great divine spirit to show through in a person then let Christopher \\"alex\\" McCandless be your guide. Here is a true story about an individual who doesnt live by society, who doesnt need material posesions, a true poet with a passion for nature and life. Unfortunately he died, but in his short life he lived more than most of us. Critics who made fun of his death need to be careful what they say for they don't know how their end will come. Not that any one will notice. Alex is alive in every tree, rock and river,he is also in every virtuous nature loving soul whose read Krakauers book or seen his movie.
0007240198|5.0|this is a brilliant book. it should be required reading in schools.  great insights into how to reduce the risk of being duped by psuedo-science
1400034779|5.0|First off, I do NoT read detective novels, but someone had this on their desk and I picked it up to look through, it just had a nice look to it. Then I purchased it to read for myself,now I am ordering all the rest of the series. It is the kind of book I love, smart, funny, touching, all without trying too hard.The writer is writing a story he loves to tell, and it shows.If you want someone to cheer for, to follow, to fall in love with, read this series,and you will never regret it
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I didn't have a clue what was going to happen in this movie and that is how I like it! Granted, the film-makers borrowed from other films and stories but it is done with such fine acting, writing and direction that the thought didn't occur to me till after the film was over. Yet, I still loved it. If you want to see how someone who cares about telling a story on film and can engage your interest, check this out. If you hate science fiction or like to have everything spelled out to you along the way in the film so you don't have to think then this film may not be for you. The budget is rather modest but they do the best job you could ask of any film-makers. Not a masterpiece but a movie worthy of your time. Even if you dislike it, you will have something to think about.
B000056HE9|5.0|My husband and I love this movie.  We look forward to seeing it at least once a year during the Christmas season.  Unfortunately, if we can find it shown on TV, it is interrupted by commercials, and sometimes complete scenes are cut out.  This degrades the movie and makes is less enjoyable to watch.  So recently I purchased the DVD through Amazon.com.  The quality of the film is great.  The only problem, which was minor, was that sometimes we had to turn up the volume to hear it better.  Cary Grant is so charming as the Angel, and Loretta Young is so sweet, beautiful and naive, what Angel wouldn't fall in love with her!  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys reminiscing about the good old days and appreciates good character and goodwill toward men.  It's an oldie but a goodie!  I had difficulty finding this DVD at the stores, so I purchased it on Amazon.com and was glad I did.  The price was right, and I received it quickly.
B001LF347E|4.0|It's like I've said before for another review: this show is in the vein of the family-friendly fantasy shows which are meant to entertain and not educate.  If you like fantasy and liked Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena Warrior Princess, and the BBC Robin Hood series, chances are you'll like Merlin.      If you read reviews saying this show isn't historically accurate or doesn't comply with Arthurian legend, take those with a grain of salt.  This show isn't meant to be a scholarly work or documentary of Arthurian legend - it's a fun interpretation of Camelot meant to entertain and it's very well done and thoroughly entertaining IMO.  I'm not saying it's perfect.  The first few episodes tend to rely on the \\"villain of the week\\" plots that Smallville used to do (makes sense since creator Johnny Capps admitted that Smallville was this show's initial inspiration).  However, the first season finds its footing fairly quickly and eventually moves away from the Smallville formula and into laying the groundwork for telling its own story arcs.  The episodes and storylines become richer as the show hints at the classic Camelot stories that will eventually come to be - Mordred, Lancelot, Excalibur, and of course Morgan le Fay but she's called Morgana here.  There are a few weaknesses (the often-cheesy CGI monsters) but there's a great deal of humor and wonderful acting from a cast mostly made up of unknowns (save for UK acting veterans Anthony Head and Richard Wilson).  The sets, music, costumes and overall production are well done and none of it is ever boring (though some episodes are better than others).      But best of all is the wonderfully hilarious but often sweet relationship between the characters of Arthur (Bradley James) and Merlin (Colin Morgan).  Both characters are really fun to watch in a older bullying brother/geeky kid brother kind of vibe.  Bradley James and Colin Morgan have absolutely great chemistry together and really make the characters extremely likable and you just can't help but root for them (well, root for Merlin anyway...Arthur takes a bit longer as you'll see once you watch the pilot).  I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't watched yet, but watch for an absolutely classic scene in one of the episodes where Arthur tries to, er, get Merlin to eat something he doesn't want to eat and hilarity ensues.      Speaking of comedy, I'm reviewing this before getting the dvds (obviously since they're not out till April) so I don't know if the US version dvds will have the episode commentary extras that the UK dvds had.  I really hope so but we may be disappointed on that front, which would stink being that the four main young cast commented on \\"The Moment of Truth\\" and it is so, so funny!  Bradley James was particularly hilarious:     Colin:  I had to sit so close to that fire, my lips got burnt.  Bradley:  That's why we had to draw on Colin's eyebrows later.  (HAHAHAHA!)    Bottom line: really a very fun show and worth watching.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|It was so enjoyable seeing the original Miracle on 34th Street on such a high quality DVD.  Every Christmas I look forward to seeing this film, and it is difficult to find this version shown on TV.  The more recent versions of this film do not come close to the charm and cast that is found in the original film.  Did you know that this was Thelma Ritter's first movie?  She was middle aged when she acted in this movie.  She went on to act in a number of movies after this.  It just goes to show you that it is never too late to do something you really want to do.  Now that I have purchased the DVD, I can watch it any time I want to, even when it isn't during Christmas season.  I recommend buying this DVD from Amazon.com.  The price was great, the quality of the DVD is terrific and the shipping was speedy.  This is a timeless story that has lasted for years and will continue to last for many generations, and the original version is the best!
B002RVZV9U|1.0|I'll make this short and sweet.   I followed the hype on-line for a year until the film was finally release and made its way to a theater 60 miles away. I made the drive and was incredibly underwhelmed by what I saw and heard.     I didn't care for the pacing or organization of the film... slow and disjointed. The selection of The Edge and Jack White must have been purely convenience motivated as there is a long list of more interesting electric guitarists whose inclusion would have made much more sense. The only shared performance was \\"The Weight\\" and I might add, they couldn't even get the chords right. Utterly embarrassing.    I've seen the process of how a bad film gets made in spite of the best intentions of those involved. My only guess is that this film went down that same road.     If it weren't for the scene of Jimmy Page in his music room listening to Link Wray's 1958 innovative bombshell \\"The Rumble\\", I couldn't even give this film 1 star.    Save your money.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|This one of my favorite CD's.  I love the up tempo violin segments in a number of the songs.
0385504225|2.0|Was hoping for more. For some reason - maybe to increase page count - Brown felt it necessary to go into excruciating detail about the history of everything. In doing so, he lost the momentum of the story and totally bored me. The action scenes were good but far and inbetween... if only he could have cut out about 100 pages, it may have been a good read.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|The Brit version has Amanda singing \\"Downtown,\\" which is extremely amusing.  It's cut out in this version - on the net its \\"copyright issue,\\" but I have read other U.S. versions have the song.  Amazon should be a bit sharper.  The whole thing is amusing of course, but if you ever saw the uncut original...
B000OT6V00|4.0|Hellboy is such a nontraditional anti-genre movie, and because of that it plays like a breath of fresh air.  Guillermo is such a unique director, and admire all of his films because he does not play into the hollywood style of action films.  Hellboy 1 is the beggining of a pontentially successful franchise, and while this film has its flaws, the crew improved on those exponentially in the sequel \\"The Golden Army\\".<br /><br />Hellboy on its Directors Cut Blu-ray release is very welcome to my collection.  The disc is jam-packed with special features, which I love, and thankfully a few of those features go into the comic lore and history.  I think every comic book movie should take time and explore the roots within the comics in a commentary or interview segment.  Del Toro feels he has an obligation to give the fans a lot of special features to view, and I admire that greatly.<br /><br />Now I wont give away the film's plot.  I will say though that it is a many great things.  It is a great Sci-Fi movie.  It's a great Fantasy movie.  I'ts an awesome action/comedy film.  And lastly it is a lot of what you have never seen before.  Colors, lighting, style all have a unique appearance in Hellboy.  Hellboy is fun to watch and listen to everytime.  It's lower budget affected some aspects of the film, but Guillermo really knew how to manage the film with that low budget.  He made a monster movie with more heart than some heart-driven films.  Hellboy breaks the comic-book-movie stereotype and shows theres a lot more great films to come out that will be adapted from graphic novels.
B001UV4XUG|2.0|I was expecting something special given the great critic reviews and user reviews.  I found the female lead character  unlikeable and unsympathetic.  Movie should be rated R, definitely not for children - a number of unnecessarily vulgar scenes are included.
B0017CW5J4|3.0|It's OK.  Not as good as I had hoped. I have seen other videos of Blueman, and they where better.  It was of other live concerts.  Not enough pounding, to much talking, and some real bad singing.
B002UD56I6|5.0|THIS IS IT was awesome!  Def. recommend the blu-ray!  This would have been one helluva concert to see; I would have paid thousands to see it in London!  It would have been amazing!!  I can't believe that all the movie was just taken from a few rehearsals - everything is so well done, every dancer and musician on stage with Michael is truly at the top of their game.
0810982862|4.0|This art book offers a unique look at the art behind James Cameron's masterpiece. Many of the pages are dominated by breath-taking art from the movie as well as designs and even some of Cameron's original sketches. On the downside it is a bit on the thin side, but is a must buy for any fan of the movie or anyone looking for a nice coffee-table book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series blows me away.  It is both inspiring and gut wrenching.  I suppose if there is anything that I could complain it would be the too frequent use of JC (taking the Lord's name in vain).  It makes me wence every time I hear it.  Other than that I love it and plan to watch it many times over.
0470450266|5.0|It's always interesting to see the work flows of other artists and in this book and companion DVD Scott Spencer has allowed us a peek inside his  brain and see what he does to create compelling character sculptures.  The book is more about art than tech, and it can aid even the most experienced user.  I highly recommend this book for all artists using Zbrush.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series blew me away when I saw in on TV.  The series does an outstanding covering the diverse environments and wildlife on our planet.  The photography and narration all come together beautifully.  I purchased this second copy as a gift for my brother when he mentioned how much he enjoyed seeing it as a rental.  Definitely worth having around.  Not only stunning to watch, but educational.
B001608QVS|5.0|have only watched first dvd,but blu-ray is an improvement over previous versions,i highly recommend for clint fans
1416594884|5.0|Surgical use of language.  LeCarre makes characters visual to the reader.  Expect the unexpected.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|I am a huge Alicia Keys fan; I have all of her CDs. There are 5 out of 14 songs that actually sound decent.   Love is Blind  That's How Strong Love Is  Un-thinkable  Like the Sea  Empire state of mind (Part II)  The album is filled with ballads; ballads that sound very familiar.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this CD ; I do not see how anyone could give this album four stars.  I like Alicia Keys as an artist, but I need more originality. Some of the music sounds like it came from and old Prince album and from more recent releases from Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce. The album is very \\"poppy\\", commercial, lacks soulful tunes, and flat. I loved Unplugged, Songs in A Minor, and The Diary of Alicia Keys; the Element of Freedom simply does not measure up to her previous CDs. It is an album that will definitely have to grow on you.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|This book was definatly a page turner! I definalty felt remorse for the family and for Susie. I felt like I knew the characters and a little like I had lost a memeber of my own family. They were well developed and genuine in my opinion.<br /><br />I love that Susie was not bitter or mad or cynical about what happened to her. For what happened to her was a horrible tragedy that unfortunately many people face every day. We can all only hope to be so lucky as to have a heaven as nice as the one Susie was granted. She watched her family and friends with love and care hoping all the while that they forget her so they can move on and heal, but struggling with the fact that she also wanted to be remembered. She never had to worry because her father never gave up on finding her body or the killer.<br /><br />I did have a few areas of the book that made me feel like something was missing from the story. I did not like that they never caught the killer. I felt that part of the story was unfinished, but that is just because that is what I expected the story to do. It really has more to do with me than it does with the story. I also hate that the killer disposed of her body in such a way that Susie could never be found. Once again, has to do with me.<br /><br />All in all it was a very good story, well written, and a good plot. If only all stories with such a terrible tragedy could end so happily. This is a book I am sure I will be picking up again to re-read for fun.
0307386171|2.0|It seems McEwan had a great idea for a story -- young newlyweds on the night of their honeymoon, and an awkward attempt at consummating the marriage -- but developed writers block partway through penning the novel, and never fully materialized the rest of the book. Instead, he tried to develop the characters by providing inane, pointless back stories -- which added nothing to the overall story arc (or lack thereof), leaving the reader to not care about these emotionally vapid, two-dimensional characters.    If you are determined to read this one, spend an hour and a half reading it at your local library.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I personally think that this was Riordan's best out of the rest.  Everything came together in the end and it was a bitter sweet moment when I finished.  I already read the whole series over three times and I'm working on a fourth. I sure hope Rick comes out with some more books like these. Possibly an extention off of these books: the same concept but different characters. This was the best book I'v ever read. In fact, this is the best series that I have ever read. Great job Rick!
B000CC1U0U|5.0|Man!! this strokes records is harsh, rough, heavier than their last two albums!! i liked what they have done with this their 3rd long player... the strokes just don't stop surprising me of the great music a bunch of guys can make!<br />And i have no doubt they can still create much more great rock 'n roll, but hope they can get something out soon, it's been 4 years and we have had any news from them!!! where are you guys?? creating a new spectacular album?? i really hope so.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is the most beatiful movie ever, it is inpiring, magnificent, I can not control my self i veen wahtched at list 20 times. loveit, loveit, loveit.
B001PBBTIK|5.0|It's a great album the Kings of Leon have made with their ONLY BY THE NIGHT, a bit commercial comparing it to their las 3 records (as an old fan of KOL, this is an attempt from them to become more popular, i think, beginning with their new look with trim hair and more preppy clothes hahaha) but is indeed a great album, very melodic, worked with coherence through beginning to end, very rock n roll indeed!!!    But for you fans that like to collect your favourite bands limited editions, beware: THIS CD DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL UK ONLY ARTWORK (THE GUYS FACES MIXED IN GREY BACKGROUND) AS IT STATES ON THE DESCRIPTION MADE BY SUPPLIER, it comes with the U.S. and rest of the world artwork (the peacocks fighting?!? i haven't figure out what they are exactly) just as the pictures shows above.     I bought this one with the confidence it had the UK artwork as it says, and when it arrived i was kinda dissapointed for this issue.    But anyways, just having that in mind, is a good purchase anyway, the DVD performance in a London Studio T4 without audience, just the KOL playing these 5 songs in a dark studio stage, was worth the purchase :)
B002EA4IO8|1.0|A terrible book. It is Poorly written and impossible to believe. It also perpetuates many Holocaust myths. It seems to be written by a young adult, not for them.  Starting with the unbelievable. We are expected to believe a nine year old that grew up in Nazi Germany does not know who Hitler is and can't pronounce Furher. Also he has never heard of Jews and does not even know what to call himself when he finds out about Jews. And this is not just any boy, this is the son of the Commandant of Auswitch, (but of course they never call it that it like many things is given a cute name because Bruno, the innocent, can't pronounce it) who has a Nazi tutor that foucuses on history. But even Bruno's teen sister can't answer the question, \\"If they are Jews what are we?\\" Really? In an SS house with a teacher that only teaches history \\"German\\" or \\"Aryan\\" never came up? Even at nine Bruno does not recognize the people on the other side of the fence are being mistreated. Yeah, yeah, we get it is for kids, it is symbolic, blh, blah. That is no excuse for the lack of historical accuracy and phony characters.  The myths it perpetuates are worse. It is one thing to be an obvious, predictable, contrived story, but spreading common misconceptions about history is worse. Here is a list of some things.  1. That the Holocaust was some type of big secret. Boyne references Hitler's Willing Executioners in the interview in the paperback version, but it appears he missed that part of the book. Bruno recalls in great detail his old neighborhood in Berlin but some people must have surely disappeared. He should have seen a Star of David before getting to Auswitch and probably a Star Armband too. German kids did Math problems about removing unwanted people from society, etc. Germany knew, all of Germany knew. It was a convenient Cold War myth, and it makes people sleep better, but the jews were not killed in secret by a few fanatics.  2. Bruno's father says he has to take the assignment to the death camp or be hurt or punished. Hogwash. Many Germans refused to participate and some were promoted for their strong moral standing. There is not a single documented case of anyone being killed for refusing to hurt Jews.  3. The book spreads the misandry that war and violence are purely male. All of the women in the book are shocked and against the Holocaust, but shuffle sadly, out of the way as the bad evil men do their work. Even Eva Braun is portrayed in a positive way. Poor Eva such a victim! Some of the most brutal camp guards were the SS women, but in the book the children are lead by male soldiers. In the real camps women were in charge of the gassing of children.    Avoid this book. There are much better things to read to find out about. Or teach young people about the Holocaust. Young people can read Eva Brewster's Progeny of Light. Much better, and true.
B0000DBJA7|5.0|If you like the strokes, you like the strokes!.... this is a very great album, my brain doesn't get any word to describe right now, but i can say is worth it. For some people it might be not so catchy, at first listening, as it is a little bit more experimental than their first album, but be patient, the more you listen to it, the more you get the melody and the experimental sound that resembles a little bit of 80's synth beats together with great rock n roll....is an obligatory vinyl record a collector got to have!
B000053VJI|1.0|After I ordered this product I received the correct case but the CD inside is AYA CON DIOS NIGHT OWLS! I am very disappointed and have been trying to contact Toll House for this but no one has responded to me let alone send me the correct cd!!!!!!!
B001GJ2ZCA|4.0|I really liked the first 3 records of Kings of Leon, they are very...UNIQUE: unique in the way they don't sound like any other band or any other music style or anything that has been released, i mean, their style is unique. That's what i love of KOL, but with this their 4th record, i gotta put aside my pasion over them and be honest: Only by the night is a more elaborate album, in the way it is kind of commercial!!! but not because of this, is a bad album, on the contrary: is a very good album, great melodics, great guitar rifs and drum beats, and of course: that characteristic sound of caleb's voice....just awsome man!!! for a KOL FAN is a record you cannot miss.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|Very enjoyable and entertaining!  Lots of fun - some language issues for the younger set (not horrible, but use your discretion).
B00330UFQS|5.0|Most albums have a few tracks you really like and the rest don't make it to your iPod. All the tracks on this album are making it to mine.
1591843162|5.0|Linchpin... The NEW Work Model - May Cause Anxiety.<br /><br />I received an early-release copy of the book from Seth. Each time I would pick it up to read... I could not put it down, but I had to so that I could let the message \\"sink in\\" each time.<br /><br />Caution: This book may scare you when you read it! It forces a self evaluation that is extremely difficult to face - but it is necessary.  Seth's book will turn upside down all the thoughts you have about \\"the system\\" (e.g. work/career, college, the economy). It will urge you to make hard life changing decisions about your work, your children's future, and re-consider your \\"self\\". And most importantly your life.<br /><br />Seth has unearthed a fundamental truth about work. Seth's basis is that today's current work organization/approach is that of a factory - with interchangeable workers.  Bottom line - if you do your job as you're told... then you are easy to replace. What's the alternative? Become \\"indispensable\\" instead. How to do that? Do your work as art -- because it makes you happier, not just to please your boss.<br /><br />Love the hand-drawn diagrams. Simple yet effective in illustrating the concepts.<br /><br />Read this book. You will be glad you did.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Thank you to all the folks responsible for making this wonderful backstage look at entertainment genius.  So many exceptional artists excel under the direction of the ultimate maestro, how lucky are we to be blessed with a front row seat. priceless!!  R.I.P. MJ
B002W1HBN4|5.0|This Anniversary edition is simply amazing!  The songs sounds new and fresh, reminding us of Whitney's uncomparable vocals.  She has always brought feeling into songs that very few singers have been able to do, especially  the current pop and R&B singers.  All the songs have been remastered on this double disc edition, even the orchestration of The Greatest Love Of All has been changed from the originally released version.  Yet it sounds just as powerful and gorgeous!    As for the extras, her exquisite performance of I AM CHANGING from DREAMGIRLS, showcases her young and powerful talent.  Her first performance of HOME on the Merv Griffin show is also on this disc, however it was pre-released on her greatest hits dvd in 2000.  Finally, a live performance of YOU GIVE GOOD LOVE which is a vocal masterpiece.    Favorite track:    GREATEST LOVE OF ALL (Live at Radio City Music Hall, 1990)  - (I love this song live, her interpretation of the song, her delivery and her voice are perfection)    I RECOMMEND THIS FOR any music lover, young singer, Whitney fan, and anyone who really wants to know what singing is and what Whitney has contributed to the music industry and it's culture all over the world.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have not had a chance to view these highly acclaimed videos.  So, barring problems with the discs themselves, you can assume they are great.  All I can say at this point is that they arrived ahead of scheduled and the packaging was very adaquate.
B002M5ZCEU|5.0|Today, I would agree with almost everything said in the first public review on the album page by J. Baker:  [[ASIN:B002M5ZCEU I Look To You]] or copy and paste [...]    Interestingly, I would have agreed completely on September 1st, 2009, especially concerning his feelings about Worth It and For the Lovers. However, I believe that reviewers should be careful to note that their review is an early one. For this matter, all critics, both in the media and public should take note. An album is often like a new drink: At first it takes on a flavor of unfamiliarity, uniqueness and qualities unlike any other. When most people first drink coffee or whisky, including myself, it often takes years to develop a palat for them. The same should be said about newly created music from artists, especially ones that have aged.     For the first year or so that I heard Whitney's My Love Is Your Love album, I skipped 75% of the new genre she took on and went straight for the ballads. While Until You Come Back is probably now my favorite Whitney song ever, with each video released, performance of and remix made for the title track, Heartbreak Hotel, In My Business, Get It Back and If I Told You That, I grew a greater appreciation for them. Thunderpuss's remix, or transformation if you will, of It's Not Right but It's Okay remains a cultural thumbprint in 90s history.    Similarly, I Look To You should be seen as an acquired taste. I would compare it to my love for coffee (I'm slowly getting there with the whisky) and of the MLIYL album. It's just months after the release of ILTY, and already I have grown a greater appreciation for Worth It and For the Lovers. The former took longer, possibly because of the large number of new mid-tempo grooves released to the public with the album. However, like cream in coffee, it rises... it just needs stirring.      Larry Jackson, Co-Executive Album Producer, confirmed on his Twitter at the beginning of the month that it will be the next and third single. On the assumption Arista would release a mid-tempo after the first being a ballad and the second for the clubs, this may be disappointing to those who would prefer Call You Tonight or Like I Never Left to be next. Or even a mid-tempo dance groove like Nothing But Love, as is rumored to be the next single in Europe. But give Worth It a good second (or 20th) listen with fresh ears and you may just find yourself reaching for your lover's hand in the car. Now if she'd add some high chest voice notes to the climax like she did for the album version of LINL, we could have a real radio hit.    Otherwise, I won't rehash what J. Baker said. Except to put it in other words. I Look To You ushers in Whitney's second act. As I sit here I can't find words to describe Act I. Diane Sawyer probably said it best in 2002: ethereal. Don't expect a repeat of it and you'll free yourself to enjoy a great album. Anything Beyoncé, Mariah, or Christina comes up short of Whitney's Act II.    And let's hear some \\"second listen\\" reviews in the months and years to come from critics quick to put their stamp on the album last year.    PS to Arista:   Where's our duet with Celine? Both talents are International Treasures; we should feel almost entitled to a marriage of them in one song on one stage.
B0000AC8LL|4.0|Good Movie about the Attack on Pearl Harbor. This and \\"world Trade Center' or \\"Flight 93\\" should be required viewing for the numbskulls that do not understand that America is under attack from Radical Islam. No amount of \\"kissing up\\" to the Arab world is going to make them forget their intent to destroy America and Americans.
B001FB4W16|4.0|I had read all the books, but since I don't have HBO, hadn't seen the series. I watched it all in 2 evenings and loved it. Not strictly faithful to the books, but great if you allow for some artistic changes. Anna Paquin is perfect as Sookie and the men are sexy. Shows much of the humor seen in the books. I may have to get HBO for this year and have already pre-ordered the 2nd season.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I gave as a gift. The holder had a scratch on it. The dvd was in excellent shape. The kids enjoy the movie daily, from what I hear.
6305358613|5.0|I have seen quite a few interpretations of the life and times of \\"Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen.\\"  Biographical Period Films are one (1) of my favorite genres.<br /><br />This production is an excellent version for both historical facts and background and for the minimally fictionalized, glorified character named Elizabeth.  The production is inspired with individuals drifting in and out of the darkness, both real and imagined.  The casting of all the Actors was perfection.  The set and costume designwork were masterpieces.  Direction was strong, but not overly obvious.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained and very impressed.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|J.J. Abrahms did the impossible and took a set of characters that have been etched into fans minds for decades and brought them back to life with a young cast. This movie is well paced, fun and exciting. It looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray. In fact I think in this transfer they may have reduced the lens flare that was a little annoying when I saw it in theaters. It's definitely a movie I will watch over and over again.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|just an amzing book i could not put it down for hous cant wait 4 scorch trials
B002SJIO5E|5.0|It is said that there are no original stories it's just in how you tell the story. And with District 9 you are getting a simple sci-fi story told in an original and engrossing way. At first the documentary footage is handheld video, home video footage and you wonder if you have to see it in Blu-Ray. But once you are with the main camera that follows the story, you are seeing a fantastically detailed image with great surround sound. I have yet to get into the special features but for the movie alone it is well worth owning.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|First of all, I'm not reviewing the quality of the DVD, I'm reviewing the movie. Hands down, one of the best productions I have ever seen of any genre. The story is excellent (thank you Miss Austen), and the acting, directing, music, and overall production is outstanding. I watch this at least three times a year ( and as a result have memorized a lot of the dialog). I love everything about this movie and highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys quality entertainment.
B001AACEP8|2.0|Former Christian artist Katy Hudson teams with big-name producers/writers to release an album so unoriginal and pandering it dulls the mind. She's so tough, she's such a rebel...she's anything you want her to be. Desmond Child and the usual pop-trash suspects involved in this beauty.
031606792X|5.0|The BEST book out of the Twilight saga, don't think about this BUY IT. Came in great condition and came fast. I love it!
B001QERPDO|5.0|A good mix of various types of pop and alternative sounds.  Every track is solid.  I am looking forward to their next release.
0307593525|5.0|wonderful set of books .. with recipes that are easy to follow and suggestions that are noteworthy... i would highly recommend these and if you do not own ANY other cookbooks.................these are the ones !..
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I love Lost, the cast, and of course Juliet and Kate.  I would add that I love Sun too, but Jin might hit me.  Seriously, \\"Lost\\" has accomplished the rare feat of completing its fifth season with the magic intact.  We are still baffled by the true nature of the Island, and the plot twists and turns continue to fascinate and delight.<br /><br />One of the things I like about Season Five is the development of the Sawyer character.  He is a truly multidimensional personality whom I did not like at all in Season One but who now is perhaps my favorite male character in the series.<br /><br />One thing I was not crazy about in Season Five is the use of time travel, which is overused in science fiction and which makes its appearance here.  I will give the series credit, however; this is one of the more innovative uses of this device.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I am waiting for Season Six to see how this all wraps up.  Great fun!  RJB.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is a great set loaded with special features. I mean LOADED. Warner Bros did a great job  putting this together. I'm very satisfied with my purchase from Amazon. I got it so cheap I may buy  the set again on Blu ray. That's how happy I am. :)
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Just got a new blu ray for Christmas and bought this as part of our Christmas tradition of watching It's a wonderful life . They did a wonderful job in getting all improving the quality and making this movie special on HDTV. Thank you
B000QB36LS|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. Any girl or boy feeling sad or depressed can appreciate and relate to Plath's writing.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|The product itself just what we expected. Ordered this close to Christmas and it was late. Amazon customer service was amazing. I contacted them for help and no questions asked, they shipped again, overnight. Although it wasn't here when we hoped and could have been due more to the Christmas volume, they still responded immediately. You really cant beat this customer service anywhere.
0061703257|4.0|This book grabs you and you keep reading to see what happens next...A page turner. The book is very discriptive; you can see the plot unfolding before your eyes.<br />Very suspensful.The story takes place in the 50's, it's actually a mystery story, a thriller.<br />The ending was unexpected; even though you might suspect that it had to be one or the other characters that had to be lying. You won't know til the end. I won't tell ! You'll have to read it !<br />Some of the other reviewers didn't like the ending, but it \\"makes\\" the story.<br />They made this book into a movie--I'd like to see it.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|This is a great film that transfers to blu-ray excellently. The film itself is a wonderfully paced deconstruction of the Western genre. Eastwood as always simmers when he's on screen along with his frequent co-conspirator Morgan Freeman. Eastwood's character William Munny could easily have been an unpleasant and unlikeable character due to his shady past, but when pitched against Gene Hackman's excellent sherrif he shines as a beacon of morality.  The last twenty minutes of the film are absolutely excellent as Clint faces down the bad guys and allows the viewer to know exactly what kind of man they're rooting for.  A modern day masterpiece.
B000002UAO|1.0|Shipper sent the CD through mail and it was shatttered into pieces by the time I got it.  Not impressed with the service.
1568987846|3.0|This book has a beautiful message and the pictures are lovely.  It would've been nicer, though, if it was a hardback book-- it would be a much better gift-giving book.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is, in its essence, the GameCube controller.  The only differences are that it has a much longer cord than the original one (10 ft, or 3m, about the length of the PS2's, maybe longer), and it has been specially colored white for use with the Wii.  I never owned a GameCube, but as soon as I started playing Wii the first GameCube game I purchased was The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition.  Naturally, I needed a GCN controller to play, so I ventured to my local GameStop and bought a used black one.  I thought it was great, but the short cord really made me use it less--especially since I eventually purchased the WaveBird.<br /><br />I decided to give this one a try, and for my first test played Brawl.  It was simply fantastic.  The actual product is a Japanese import straight from Nintendo, and the box and instructions are all in Japanese (save for the obligatory English titles).  That's not much of a bad thing since all you really have to do is plug and play, and everything on the controller is in English.<br />I sold the black one to help fund this, and it was well worth the extra money, if just for the longer cord.  I can sit far back from the TV as I do with the WaveBird, but now with one longed-for feature: rumble (or vibration).  I was hesitant in purchasing this because other reviews didn't mention rumble, but I guess I should've known since this is Nintendo's original GCN controller, redesigned for the Wii by making it with a longer cord and in white.  The white color really adds some dash and goes well with a white Wii.  Though I personally wish Nintendo would come out with a WaveBird 2 with rumble (or just the regular controller, but wireless), this is pretty much the next best thing.<br /><br />Yes, this controller really makes that much difference for Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii.
B000A0GP18|5.0|The movie came in the mail 3 days after I ordered it and it was in great condition.
0316017922|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  The subject matter is close to my heart - as it is for most people...  What does it take to succeed?  I like seeing science and math explain different subjects; in this case, the author does a great job of using math to explain the factors related to success and failure.  It's gratifying to see that a large portion of success is due to hours of practice.      Certainly, genetics and talent are important components of success, but the book gives examples of how thousands of hours of practice are often required to truly succeed.  Or that birth-month is important - especially for early success for children - that develops into later success.  Interesting.      There is good reason that this book is a \\"classic.\\"
B0028RXXFC|1.0|I am disappointed in pucture quality. I enjoyed Rome when it was on HBO. My plan was to test my new blu-ray player for the first time with Blu-Ray discs. Possibly this is a problem with my Blu-Ray player. They do send a disclaimer with delivery that the seller takes no responsibilty for buyers Blu-Ray player software upgrades. This should be explained before purchase .
0143038419|1.0|I love travel books. I love travel books that paint vivid stories of history and politics and culture.  I love stories about people and their adventures in life.  This is what I hoped for when I started reading this book.      What I don't dig is page after page of narcissim.  Oh, I've always been the favorite in the family! Oh, I smiled at a pretty girl in the elevator lobby before I realized it was my own reflection! (UNBELIEVABLE - that one) Oh, I thought Italian men didn't find me as attractive as when I was abroad at 19 and I had to beat them away with sticks, but phew, it was just a change in the culture so that it isn't considered polite any more -- I'm still pretty at the OLD age of 30! Oh, I ate anything I wanted to eat in Italy, but for some reason my body forave me and I still look great!    I feel totally bad for this person's ex-husband who she sometimes passive agressively, and sometimes aggressively, bashes. I skipped ahead to a later chapter to see if she develops some redeeming value, but I didn't find any hope.  I admit I didn't finish it.  I admit I didn't make it out of Italy.  Maybe she undergoes some unbelievably profound change by the end of the book, but yuck!  There are certain times when you just don't care anymore.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I am very critical when it comes to quality, with that said I cannot give this product enough stars. Yes it is from Korea but it will play in your DVD player. Yes the words on the back are written in korean but do you really care? no.<br /><br />My biggest fear was that the video would be sped up as the PAL versions of the past, this video is perfectly transferred to DVD and does not look like VHS.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is not perfect, so all of you \\"gotta have HDTV-it changed my life-I will never go back...\\" people can zip it, it is what it is.<br /><br />The only flaw that there could be is the korean writing but if that keeps you from buying it you have other issues.<br />The audio is good and the picture looked great. People, you must realize that not everything is perfect and there was actually a time before HD and 5.1 etc... seriously, check wikipedia.<br /><br />If you remember this from back in the day (10/29/1988, it was a saturday I believe) and remember how cool it was back then you need to buy it.<br /><br />They may eventually get around to a major US release but you never know since there are a lot of legalities and everyone wants to dip into the michael money pot, so until then this is the best.<br /><br />Lets hope we see the making of thriller, ghosts and captain EO soon :)<br /><br />Cheers
0312330537|3.0|Very uneven. Writing  is hyperbolic and fractured, with a cloying  flowery prose--less is more would be a good rule for any further   books.    Metaphors on steroids--many misused words.  He gets a lot of mileage   of of Kant's Categorical Imperative--treating it as an exotic delicate flower of truth  given to him by his moralistic bereft father-figure.    A very contrived ending--all is tied together in implausible fashion; and strongly disappoints:     And makes the defects  even more palpable--like a thunderstorm of acid poured on my mellifluous soul.    It is like a poor man's Alexander Theroux.    That said--the stories are captivating--and the rawness and  riven storytelling can not be denied.  It takes you into the darkest interiors  of the human soul, condition and culture: as well as the  triumphs, loves and beauty  that can be also be seen--sometimes in the very same place.       In spite of the defects the book nearly transcends them for me and probably does for  most--who are enthralled to riveting stories--that look at an underbelly few would  never see or even know that exists.    I have to strongly recommend it--because the stories are fascinating and raw as raw can be:  a prison where the lice is so bad--you have to roll up your shirt small fold by small fold  to kill them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's 'I Dreamed A Dream' is incredible! My eyes filled with tears the first time I listened to this CD. She is able to sing original artists' songs with so much passion and love. I also enjoyed her comments after the lyrics. She is an inspiration and is beautiful inside and out.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Our girls are 13 & 14 and were introduced to Catan at a friends house - they loved it so we bought it for the family for Christmas.  It's a great game, especially for teenagers - playing this game they can develop logical thinking, strategy skills as well as bargaining & trading skills.  Plus it gets them away from the TV & computer and we sit down as a family.  A game doesn't have to take this long but we occasionally we play for 4 hours at a time (with the Cities & Knights expansion) because for us playing isn't about winning, it's about hanging out and spending time with each other - we have fun!
B002ASVYWS|5.0|Incredible prog/nu rock.  Melodies, heaviness, great musicians.  Interesting songs with a wide range of dynamics. Intricate time signatures and great hooks.  A future classic album
B001FB4VZS|1.0|series is goood but cd#2 came with damaga bad experience and will never purchase from that seller ever again called piece of mind media
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|As the title says, this is pretty much awesome on BluRay. I couldn't believe my eyes. It's like watching an entirely different movie on BluRay. This shipped fast also.
0060899220|5.0|Highly recommend this book to fans and non fans alike.  If you're familiar with his endeavors on the Travel Channel, its completely in the same style: brash, colorful language, the Anthony Bourdain we all love and know. His struggle to get to get where he is today is quite comical, tragic, and in a way inspirational.  Great read and guaranteed laughs all the way through.
1591843162|4.0|I think this is a great book for anyone looking to further their career.  I think this book will make you re-evaluate how you approach work in a positive way.  Are you a cog or a linchpin?
0385504225|4.0|Much of this book is about the Freemasons and how our country was planned and built by our founding fathers who were mostly Freemasons. A secret order with secret meetings held behind closed doors. The entire book takes place within a twelve hour time period in Washington D.C.  In this book Robert Langdon was again helped by a woman, a scientist, this time named Katherine. He is not an expert in everything and Katherine is allowed to bring her expertise into the relationship. They do become close as they respect each others' fields. Robert is at times a bumbling human like the rest of us. He has claustrophobia after falling down a well as a child. He isn't a super hero as betrayed in the movies made of Dan Brown's other books.  Yes, there are several chases and many long explanations of symbols, ancient history and rituals. That's what makes this story. It is the search for 'the hidden word'.  As Robert and Katherine try desperately to save her brother's life by solving mysterious, puzzle clues they are watched closely by the CIA. Their journey takes them through Washington's streets and into the bowels and heights of her most famous buildings and monuments. These insights in to places, we the public, will never see nor have probably  heard of, is exciting and mind-blowing to say the least.  The  Church is again involved along with a blind reverend. The many dimensions of the church are explored once more. Many books of the Bible, by chapter and verse, are spoken about and mulled over as they look for hidden meanings.  There are many reviews and opinions about this book.   I personally like the way Dan Brown writes. The twists and turns in this book kept me guessing and off balance, eager to turn to the next page.  I bought the large  print copy because I plan to re-read this book many times as my eyes age along with the rest of me. I can't imagine the amount of research that went into this book. As a writer myself, I would love the chance to sit down and pick the brain of Dan Brown.   This book is definitely a keeper!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Great set of videos, especially the fact that the combined TOS and TOS-R versions are all on the DVDs

B002MBAJ4M|4.0|By A Thread (2009) An Honest **** stars.  11 tracks (67:42)<br /><br />Well, I don't know what everybody is hung up on regarding this new Gov't Mule album.  I think it's great.  And, if you are a true fan of this band, you should like it too.  I guess I'm just not as \\"critical\\" of Warren & Co. as some people are.  I don't claim to be a long-time fan.  I discovered the Mule back in 2005 just by a chance hearing of the track The Deepest End on internet radio one night.  I looked up the band and soon purchased The Deep End Vol. 1.  That's all it took.  Then I worked my way backwards and forwards thru their catalog of music.<br /><br />Now I know everybody including myself loves The Deep End.  But, just like all good bands and musicians, it is time to keep moving forward and let their \\"sound\\" evolve.  If you don't, then you just become stagnant or formulative.  This is Gov't Mule, not Nickelback or AC/DC!  Warren and Company will always have a blues base, but they should be able to stretch out a little and change things up every once in a while without the \\"fans\\" immediately ridiculing them.  Nothing but straight ahead blues rock and searing guitar solos can get repetitive and eventually boring.<br /><br />When I gave By A Thread its first spin I did not think that much of it.  Nothing reached out and grabbed me, but practically no album has ever touched me on the first go round.  I've now listened to it a few times at home and in the car driving to work.  Gets better every time.  I like all kinds of music, from Blues Rock to Progressive Metal, and I am a fan of Mr Warren Haynes.  I like his guitar playin' (who doesn't?!) and I like his deep soulful voice.  I recently got to listen to his one and (I think) only solo album from back in the mid 90's - Tales of Ordinary Madness.  Although many people are also critical of that piece of work, due to it NOT being very similar to what he later accomplished with Gov't Mule, I enjoyed it very much.  Maybe I just have a much more open mind when it comes to music.  I'm also not so much of a \\"music snob\\" that I can't simply enjoy straight up hard rock.<br /><br />OK, back to By A Thread.  There are a lot of different \\"styles\\" of music on this album.  I especially like that there are more Keyboards on this album than we ever got in the past.  Many of the songs change tempo mid-way thru and go off in a seemingly different direction (very cool).<br /><br />Song Notes:<br /><br />Broke Down on the Brazos: **** A Rockin' Opener. A little more pop-rock than the straight up blues that we're used to, but that's OK.  Song features guest musician Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top fame.<br /><br />Steppin' Lightly: (7:10) **** another mid-tempo rocker.  Nice guitar solo.<br /><br />Railroad Boy: ***** this song has the lyrics and theme of an old-time traditional blues song, but played with a modern feel and arrangement.  One of the best songs here.<br /><br />Monday Mourning Meltdown : **** ½ (8:08) slower paced song with kind of an \\"experimental\\" sound due to some spacey keyboards that create an interesting atmosphere.  Is it a war protest song?  It does have some vague references to the Patriot Act and soldiers blood on the battlefield.<br /><br />Gordon James: *** sorry, nothing special here. Just a basic song.<br /><br />Any Open Door: **** fast paced rocker with some big , fat, guitar tone coming right at you in the first few bars and not letting up until the song ends.<br /><br />Frozen Fear: *** ½  I would almost describe this as a quick-paced ballad.  Basically a nice pop-rock song.<br /><br />Forevermore: **** this one opens up with just acoustic guitar and Warrens vocals.  Very quiet.  About midway thru they kick it up a notch and jam a little before eventually slowing back down to a whisper quiet acoustic ending.  A beautifully sad song of about loss.<br /><br />Inside Outside Woman Blues #3: ***** (9:00)  Scorching guitar! Now this is the kind of Blues that most fans want and love from Warren & Co.and we get almost 9 minutes of this awesome classic Mule jam fest.<br /><br />Scenes from a Troubled Mind: (7:27) **** ½  another slow, cool, bluesy track.  Very nice vocal harmonies and background keyboards, and what do you know, midway thru they completely kick this thing into high gear and let loose.  Also another long song at over 7 minutes.<br /><br />World Wake Up : *** nothing special.  Total Average: 4.04 stars<br /><br />Compact Disc includes a 14 page booklet with photos of the band and complete lyrics in a regular plastic jewel case.½  another slow, cool, bluesy track.

B00005LC1H|5.0|The writing is so good and the physical humor is so over the top.  \\"The Germans\\" stands out in my mind, but every episode has a little gem, like:  \\"Now Mr Fawltey, don't do anything we wouldn't do.  Oh. surely ladies, a little breathing.\\" or \\"Never mind him, he's from Barcelona.\\"    A really great show.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I rarely give five stars to anything, but this was truely an outstanding film. From the brilliantly executed feux documetary intro (which may not be for the attention span challenged) and on there is a great deal of character development. The story is captivating and compelling and I found myself thinking that something like this could actually happen, and could even play out similarly.  Appearantly there are some folks out there who just didn't get it.  So if you thought Independence day was a great movie, or Bad Boys II was a cinamatic masterpiece, you may want to give this one a miss.      That being said, I would recomend renting this movie, for as imersive and intense as it is, I couldn't see really wanting to watch it more than once or twice.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|What fun to have all these Wilde plays on video in one fell swoop.  Everything from Dorian Gray to the Importance of Being Earnest and all in between show the genius of Wilde and the contrast between his subtlety and his sheer silliness.  Dorian Gray is, of course, the dark side of his experience and life, but the rest are side-splittingly funny.<br />Laughter heals.  Watch the Wilde comedies and get well fast.
B001GMH8SI|4.0|outstanding, just as the film. really intriguing, well written. also the diversion about various outcasts is appropriate in my opinion
B002SJIO5E|5.0|The film gets straight into it and within minutes you are up to date with the current ongoings in johannesburg. I really, really enjoyed this film as I do love sci-fi movies. But I do think there is 1 unanswered question straight from the start which contnues to the end unanswered. It begins with a spaceship hovering over johannesburg, however when the movie ends the question still remains - why did they come! Anyway apart from that small niggling curiosity what can I say.... Exceptional. CGI is excellent, the main actor says F**k alot, and then theres the advanced alien weapons... yes advanced alien weapons, which eventually we get a taste of what they can do....all of them. And to top it off, advanced robotic body armor, with all the trimmings.    The movies storyline is basic enough, aliens arrive, we take them in as refugees, exploit them, one man gets infected and begins mutating and it then revolves around that.  I got the blu-ray version and I have to say it is well worth it. I gave this film a 5star rating as it has all of what I could ever want.... aliens - on earth, spaceships, advanced weapons, excellent CGI and most of all, in all probability.... a sequel !! And possible a pre-quel !!
006190628X|4.0|In anticipation of the movie release in February 2010, I was anxious to read/listen to Shutter Island. I've read and enjoyed LeHane's earlier books: Mystic River and Prayers for Rain and have not been disappointed. The audio version is read by Tom Stechschulte who happens to be an amazing reader. He was able to effectively handle voice changes for multiple characters.<br /><br />It's 1954 and Teddy Daniels is a U.S. marshal assigned to check out a reported escape of a Rachel Solando, a murderess, at Ashcliff Hospital, a federal asylum for the criminally insane. The facility is located on an island off the coast of Massachusetts. While aboard the ferry taking him to Shutter Island, Teddy meets another marshal, his new partner Chuck Aule.<br /><br />Once they arrive at the hospital they begin  interviewing patients and staff. Although most of the people they talk to seem helpful, some seem to be hiding something. The medical director responsible for the missing woman's care seems very odd and suspicious, and at times even Teddy seems a bit messed up, from flashbacks of the war, and the loss of his wife in an apartment fire set by an arsonist.<br /><br />The location and description of this asylum set on a remote island is enough to send chills up the reader's spine, but then a hurricane hits.  When the ferry services from the island are stopped , and no one can leave, things take a turn for the worst.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS - Do you like creepy psychological thriller --the sort of book with imagery that makes the reading experience all the more intense? Do you like a thriller with disturbing events and multiple twists are turns? Not every reader will be satisfied with the way that this book ends, but remember it's fiction. In my opinion, the plot and ending were written with movie options in mind back in 2003 when the book was first published. Can't wait to see the movie - RECOMMENDED - (rating - 4/5 stars).
B001P06GX4|5.0|We got this game because we like Tetris and the pieces look like Tetris pieces.  The rules are simple and easy to understand.<br /><br />What I like about this game is people at all different levels can play.  There are not many games that adults and children can play together but with this game you can.  Once you know the rules you can start developing a strategy to get better.<br /><br />This is a 2, 3, or 4 player game.<br /><br />Some of the playing pieces are small but they do not feel cheap. The game board is durable and I expect it will last a long time.  There are plastic storage bins included in the box for storing the pieces.  The game is easy to set up and take down.<br /><br />Great purchase for people of all ages.

B002OR18HQ|5.0|This is the third concert video release of John Fogerty's career, and another red hot document of the BEST American rock n' roll you will ever hear from any artist in today's world. In 2006 I was blown away by John's excellent concert DVD &#34;The Long Road Home&#34; which showed this rock n' roll hall of famer looking and sounding 20 years younger than his real age as he rocked his way through a great selection of his classic tunes with a top-notch backing band. That fine DVD offered stunning evidence that a 60 year old Fogerty had lost nothing with age and can still rock better than most superstars half his age. Three years later, this new DVD captures a 63 year old John still at the peak of his powers as he rocks England's Royal Albert Hall with another top-notch backing band and a killer set list of classic rock n' roll. The result is one of the best rock n' roll concerts ever released on DVD.  This DVD delivers everything a great rock n' roll concert is supposed to be: high energy musicianship with no smoke, mirrors, booty shaking, and other pretty boy gimmicks to compensate for a lack of true talent. This isn't American Idol or the grammy awards....this is REAL DEAL ROCK N' ROLL FOR THE REAL MUSIC FAN! And nobody on the charts today does it any better than John Cameron Fogerty. Song after song, this concert packs the same punch as The Long Road Home, proving once again that John is an ageless master of pure, three-chord, feel-good rock n' roll. John still rocks with the enthusiasm of a 30 year old and doesn't look a day over 45!  After all these years, Fogerty remains the ultimate rock n' roll artist...a great songwriter, a blistering and underrated guitarist, and a strong singer who can deliver a hardcore country song like Broken Down Cowboy or Blue Ridge Mountain Blues as convincingly as he belts out hard rocking tunes like Fortunate Son or Traveling Band.  Fogerty and the band kick off the show with the fantastic &#34;Comin Down the Road&#34;, a high-energyslice of boogie rock greatness that just might be the best pure rock n' roll tune John has written since Creedence broke up. This show focuses on a lot of John's solo material including several pure country songs that show his versatility. Many of the essential Creedence masterpieces are also here, including strong versions of Commotion and the extended jam Ramble Tamble which were not included on John's previous two concert videos.  Fogerty's legendary talents alone would be enough to satisfy any fan, but this show is made even better thanks to the dynamic powerhouse called Kenny Aronoff behind the drumkit.  This guy is a relentless force of power and energy who rocks his butt off for an hour and 40 minutes and never lets up! Aronoff is so good he nearly steals the show from Fogerty and proves himself to be nothing less than the ultimate rock drummer.  This fabulous concert is a true Godsend that belongs in the collection of any music fan who values what the &#34;Real Deal&#34; is all about. This easily ranks with Carl Perkins' classic 1985 &#34;Rockabilly Session&#34; concert as one of the finest ever captured on video.  In this sad new era of cookie-cutter pop stars/record company puppets that dominate the mainstream, it gets no better than this concert!  Buy two copies of this DVD and give one to your kids so they can witness the kind of talent and musicianship they will never hear on American Idol or your local Top 40 station. Thank you John for keeping real music alive in the modern music world!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Frankly I found this film bad. The writing was bad, the acting was execrable, the direction amateurish. The story line was absurd. The situation at the beginning was truly shocking and unfortunately, probably close to the truth. But switch off after that and go do something worthwhile. And Brad Pitt! WHAT was that accent he was attempting? Sorry Brad, but it was a bad decision of yours to have annything to do with this turkey.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|The movie was something I actually didn't expect.  I figured it'd be a science fiction \\"aliens vs. humans\\" thing, but I didn't expect the whole humanity side of the movie.  It really took me by surprise, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Plus the Blu-ray version of this was simply beautiful.  Great quality, an excellent buy.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|A very interesting film on food from the farm to the table.  If everyone saw this film, it would drastically change  where and from whom we buy our food. It is not for the \\"Faint of Heart\\".  I loaned it to a friend, (older woman), who returned it saying, \\"It was too disturbing to watch\\".  It is an important film that should be seen by everyone, but especially by our \\"Lawmakers.\\" We vote on our food supply every time we go to the supermarket.  In order to vote intelligently, we need to know the facts.  This film does an excellent job of providing those facts.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I have seen 3 Ring Cycles, 2 with James Morris, and have the Ring on vinyl. This DVD set allows me to relive the excitement, drama and extraordinary music that the Ring provides. This cast is excellent. I am totally pleased with this set, and the service provided by Amazon. BMcC
B000274THQ|1.0|This was such a boring film. It may have some interest to people living in the former East Berlin, but for the rest of us.....BORING. So boring in fact that, very soon after watching it, I gave my copy to the local Op. Shop.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I have been wanting this movie for a long time, and it was just great to be able to purchase it at such a reasonable price, in such good condition!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. It had good action and special effects and it wasn't boring. It also had some humor. I liked that it had a fast pace and a lot of twists and turns in the plot. OK so the plot doesn't quite make 100% sense but it was still pretty cool. It was also great on a visual level. The actors did manage to capture some of the essence of the original characters. I must say too the actors were a good fit as far as physical likeness and personality, particularly Spock.     I will give a star for being original and one more just because the movie was better than I expected and an improvement over previous, more forgettable Star Trek movies. It had a few \\"What the...??\\" moments but there were also many redeeming qualities. When I read the reviews, I honestly thought this would suck but I was pleasantly surprised.     I guess the writers of this figured if they were going to do another Star Trek movie, they would do something totally crazy and far out. The plot involves time travel and an alternate universe...one where Spock and Uhura make out...Here is where the movie loses a star. Kirk or Bones I would understand, but SPOCK? C'mon, gimmie a break! Anyone who is a fan of the old Star Trek shows knows that Uhura would never go for Spock! Besides, Kirk always gets the chicks! Not to mention, anyone who is a fan of the original series already knows Vulcans only mate every 7 years! Oh well, this movie does take place in an alternate universe...and in this case it is VERY alternate one! Still though, this was a fun movie and I did enjoy it!
B00001OH7Y|3.0|The remastering here is biased to the treble, and overall is rather cool and lean sounding. I know part of this is a \\"Bowie Sound\\" thing, but really...  I am just saying, if you have some audiophilic leanings, this will give you a headache, as, I am told, will the other Virgin re-issues.  Even some of the LP versions were recorded this way, so no relief there...  I use my disc to keep my mug off the coffee table.
B001JNNDGA|4.0|While the clarity of the high definition per se is comparatively good, I am quite a bit disappointed with the audio. But overall, this is good
B0030MM68O|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  If at all possible it should be viewed without interuption becaise of the continued increasing amplification of suspense during the film.  This movie is about bomb squads in Iraq and it very artfully reflects the tension present when our soldiers are doing their jobs in disarming IED's.  The big differnce between this film and other contemporary war movies is that this film rides on suspense and the character of the soldiers as opposed to continued violence.  I am not familiar with the director of this film.  But she has directed a movie with a skill that perhaps no man could do.  This may sound sexist, but I firmly beleive her viewpoints were what made this film so unusually good.  The Hurt Locker rates near the top of any movies I have seen in my many years.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I have to admit this is the first Nicholas Sparks book I read. And the only reason I read it is because the movie will be out in theaters in a few weeks. I want to compare them because the previews sure give the impression of a happy ending. I don't get why so many reviewers are upset with Savannah tho. SPOILER ALERT! IMHO she could've waited for John 6 more months, but love is an unexpected thing. And needs much nurturing. John learned what true love was and became a Tim and decided to be unselfish to give their love a chance. It broke my heart, but it also gave me some strange satisfaction to know John was mature enough to not break up their marriage. The way she helped him understand his dad was beautiful. Fact is uncontrollable things happen in life, and this book dwelled on that. Overall, I enjoyed this book very much, tears and all.
B000G73U5Y|3.0|I agree that yet another Steely Dan hits disc seems excessive, but not if one is after a better mastering job than the older cds provided. However,<br />I disagree that this is a better remaster. It is a subjective, relative matter, but I prefer the \\"Decade of Steely Dan\\" original disc to this one.<br /><br />I do agree that the earlier remasters were a bit lean sounding, lacking some natural richness, especially in the midrange. But this one is excessively warm with rolled-off treble. If you have a treble biased solid state amp, this might do it for you, but I have a system with pretty good resolution and overall neutrality, and this disk is worse than the originals, but in the other direction!<br />I just picked up all of their records in used vinyl, at really decent prices, and the sound is better than either of the discs mentioned, or any other cd I have heard from Steely Dan. I don't have a great turntable or anything, its just that the source is so much better with the LPs.
B00005KARK|5.0|I gave this to my wife as a gift, due to having a new baby. Its a great gift and great for kids. Oh yea pink Elephants can make you crazy, if your not sober.
0671578855|5.0|I'm probably committing heresy by saying that I generally like Bujold's fantasies better than her space operas, but I am really sold on this episode in the life of Miles Vorkosigan.  The audible download file is about18 hours long and I gulped it down in two sessions, one beginning Saturday afternoon and then finishing up on Sunday.<br /><br />The reader, as in the other Miles books I have listened to, was Grover Gardner.  While I'm not as keen on his narration as I was on Lloyd James' reading of The Curse of Chalion, he does a good job in distinguishing the characters by voice without going overboard.<br /><br />While some people want to focus on the various love stories in this book, my favorite part was the political wrangling that is tied to together oh, so neatly in the end. There's a good bit of comedy as well as action and mystery.<br /><br />I've read some of the Miles books but thought this one did a good job of standing alone with just enough information to help the reader understand who is who in the large cast of characters.<br /><br />Something I really did not like was the cover used for the audiobook.  The backlit bride and groom facing away from the viewer is rather puzzling given that the only person actually getting married in the story is the Emperor Gregor.  If the male figure is meant to be Miles, it honestly doesn't look like the various descriptions given by Bujold.  In fact, if required to describe the male character on the cover it would be as an old geezer, not Miles in his mid 30's.<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommended.  And the audio download from audible is a bargain compared to the price of the CD.
B002LBGBR2|3.0|It's a good CD, however should of just bought the CD and not the DVD with it.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|The cover of this album shows Rob Zombie with no makeup, no painted background, and no vibrant red and hellish colors.  This album properly reflects the nature of this album.  Rob takes away the theatrical he's known for, the movie clips, the crazy circus feel, and creates a smarter and darker album.  This was a risky move, and in many ways is more of a chance than most musicians take.  Luckily, Rob, knowing his career in movies is going well, doesn't have to play by the rules to make something he's interested in.  The trouble is that most music fans like the same thing, again and again, and want the old rob. Which is a shame as this album has a lot to like, but its something that requires a little understanding and a little more patience.  What is ultimately found is an excellent album, with some great music.
1578988411|4.0|Book arrived after just a couple of days in good condition and as was described in the ad. Totally satisfied.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|Outstanding to see this movie in blu ray, with great video and sound, finallyLed Zep is rockin through my insane home theater!
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|...to load the 'Final Cut' into the 'video on demand' page?<br /><br />It's one thing to send out the wrong version to physical addresses--with 5 of them out there, I can see how packaging could get mixed up--sort of.<br /><br />But how in the world can the the 2-day download version of the Final Cut be mislabeled? It is timed at 1 hour 58, a full 20 minutes short of the Final Cut version, so is no substitute.<br /><br />Baffled and really kinda ticked off. Have a guest here to watch with me, popcorn, etc.<br /><br />I have seen the original many times, so...<br /><br />From the other reviews here, it is apparent that this movie has soundly defeated the seemingly endless resources of Amazon.com, repeatedly, with no end in sight.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|I'll admit, I was a little worried about lost after season 3.  Sure, there were plenty of good episodes, but there too many filler episodes, and things seemed to be moving in a direction of aimlessness.  Luckily, Season 4 returned to greatness, and was arguably the best season yet.  The story was rather well done, as the story involved the characters off the island, and how they got off the island in the first place, ending almost at the same time as season 3 ended.  Mysteries were answered, while some new ones were added, but the important thing was that it was well written, acted, and incredibly entertaining the entire time.  I highly recommend it as a fan of lost, and a fan of excellent television in general.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is a great knife. It is heavy, strong, sharp, and feels good in your hand. 2 things could have been better, the finish on the blade wears off with use, and I would like to see a stainless version.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|You can tell a new style plus the sadness of this CD... I am enjoying it!
B002XTBEDI|3.0|The original Cranford series was not devoid of painful moments, but there was a balance of joy and grief.  The sequel seems to overbalance on the grief side, with two major losses.  One seemed to sacrifice the storyline for excessive dramatic purpose, a loss from which I think the series could not easily recover.    There seemed to be many holes in this series compared to the former one. No explanation was given for why Cranford went from two doctors to none.  And so much of what went on seemed to make little sense, or the characters indulged in excessive acts for no good reason except to furnish dramatic content -- Lady Ludlow's final stand, Jem Hearn's decision, and Harry's inexplicable comings and goings.  Even the town, which should have been booming (even if the railroad was going to be a few miles rather than right at their doorstep) was supposedly in an economic tailspin. After all, Jem was run off his feet by his business even before the railroad came.      For those of us that paid attention and really took in the details of the first series, it's not so easy for us to swallow whole a hasty, ill conceived and ill justified second series.      OTOH, there's enough of Cranford in it to make it passable to good, if not the excellent rating the first series got.  Imelda Stanton  and her feathers alone is worth the watch.      I can only hope we get more Cranford in future, though I wish they would  do the first series  and its devoted viewers justice and take a little more care to make a more sensible storyline.
0312305060|1.0|This book was chosen as a book club selection.  I would consider myself a very open minded reader and choose books from all subjects.  There are very few books that I have not been able to finish and this is one of them.  I found myself having to re-read parts just to remember what character I was reading about at that point.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and now I know why the library I picked it from had only one copy and it was on the shelf.  This is one book I definately won't be paying a late fee on and will be back in plenty of time for another sucker to pick up off the shelf.
0316069906|1.0|Perhaps if this book came out about ten years ago, before any of the Pollan books, Food Inc., Fast Food Nation, etc. had inundated our food eating nation, I would give it two stars.<br /><br />On second thought, no, I wouldn't.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Overrall I loved the video. I definitely felt like I was working out. the only annoying part was that there was a lot of get up/ get down movements; One min. your doing jumping jacks the next min your doing push ups. Also I advise you to switch up between the levels. One day do level one the next day do level two. If you dont i garuantee you'll get bored fast. Other than that, this dvd is definitely a must buy.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|particularly when Bertie Wooster lends a hand.<br /><br />Once again all the principals are in place, Bertie Wooster has returned from a few weeks on the Riviera with one of his numerous Aunts to discover his man Jeeves has taken to giving advice of the romantic sort to Bertie's pals.  Since Bertie and Jeeves are engaged in one of their many battles of will over Bertie's wardrobe Bertie quickly decides to take over the task.  Soon Bertie finds himself in a stately country home, and embroiled in a romance himself!  With more than a few hilarious twists and turns all ends up well, but not before Jeeves has arrived on the scene.<br /><br />In the Wodehouse world it is always that lovely era between the Wars when smart young things had the time and money to spend long weekends in stately English country houses to recuperate from nights spent at the theatre and various nightclubs.  Everyone knows everyone else and still manages to become involved in complicated misunderstandings that would make Shakespeare proud.<br /><br />Fans of the 1eeves and Wooster series featuring Frye and Laurie will undoubtedly recognize this one, but knowing how the story ends will in no way diminish the delight of reading about the misadventures along the way.<br /><br />This review is based on the Kindle version of the novel, a particular delight since it was located and delivered on a dreary night in a matter of minutes at no charge.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I have always liked Pink Floyd. After David Gilmour split,I continued collecting both Roger Waters and David Gilmour's Pink Floyd Music. David's Live at the Rayol Albert Hall shows he hasn't lost his touch and exellence in his Pink Floyd feel. I recomend this Cd and DVD to all Pink Floyd Fans.
0132350882|2.0|Chapter 1 presents some very interesting thoughts from some well-known software engineers on what it means for code to be \\"clean\\". Good stuff. And there's a good, quick summary of Lean's 5S's, with obvious application to code:   - seiri - sort - organization   - seiton - systematize - tidiness   - seiso - shine - cleaning   - seiketso - standardize   - shutsuke - [self-]discipline    The rest of the book isn't so good. The approach isn't bad - take code and show how to improve it - but the preferred coding style is verbose, and to my mind, often considerably less maintainable than the original code.
B000024E9J|4.0|One of the 3 albums Genesis made at their peak of creativity . The music is what I expected, but this review has nothing to do with the music. I bought the 2008 version and I received the argentinian 1994 version TWICE!!!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|By far this CD is Michael's best so far.  As he continues to mature, his voice, song selection and attitude is reflected.
B001U0HAZM|5.0|I can't really think of anything catchy that will make you want to see this. All I can say is that you simply must see this!!!<br />Christian Bale gives, what I consider to be, his best performance ever. This movie is for movie buffs all the way. Watching this at points feels like a game of clue. You're trying to put all the pieces together to make sense of whats going on. You'll watch this more than once, and find metaphors and symbology and clues that you didn't notice before... AND THEY ARE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT! You will enjoy and appreciate that. The story itself is very well written, and almost flawless. The special features are pretty nice and informative, so even if you've never seen it, you're in for a treat. If you haven't seen this at all yet (like me), GET IT!<br /><br />P.S, my only gripe is the menus. Its very hard to tell which one is highlighted.
B0015DROBO|2.0|excellent book! wonderful characters. draws you into the story--and you become part of it all.you don't want it to end! great writing--great enjoyment great book. the fact it takes place in Sweeden adds another dimenion
B0007939NO|5.0|This one of my wife's favorite movies. We both enjoyed seeing it again after many years.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Having been to Darwin, this looks like it was filmed there right on the pier.<br /><br />Good story and good acting.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|A while back I remember seeing a movie called Dark City at one of bigger stores (like Kmart or something). It was a slightly older movie, and I had never heard of it, but the cover looked cool. I read the back of the cover, only to find a quote from the movie... At any rate, I didn't purchase it, but looked at it just about every time I went into that store.    So one day I'm bored and I think of the movie but I can't remember what it was called. I just got my blu ray player so I was shopping on Amazon for some new movies. This one was suggested to me. I don't know why I was so interested in a movie I knew nothing about, but I went for it.     I've put off watching this, and last night, I finally did. All I can say is: I put THIS movie off? This movie was incredible. It was visually incredible, and the effects they pulled off in this movie (given that it came out in the late 90's) were jaw dropping. The movie is the freak child of film noir, mystery, scifi, and many more. The story is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who has patience with movies (you'll be very confused at the beginning).     They could have done more with the special features I guess, but what you get is still great. If you've never seen this movie, or you haven't seen the directors cut, you need to see this movie and get this on blu ray or dvd now.
B0034E4JA6|5.0|Its been a while since I have heard Four Tet but this album reminds me yet again that he is damn good.  Its not the most groundbreaking album, but they don't have to be to be really good.  Ultimately, its a very nicely done album.
0810982862|4.0|I have kind of mixed feelings about this book.  I agree with those that are critical of the book:  that it is too skimpy, that it doesn't have much in the way of insightful text, etc.  But on the other hand, as a huge Avatar fan, it is a great keepsake, and does have some nice art in it.  What I *do* like:  there is some interesting original concept art from James Cameron himself that is real interesting.  Also, mostly what this book contains is concept art, or supporting art of various kinds, not simply screens from the movie.  So you are kind of seeing the process unfold, not simply seeing the finished product.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I enjoy this book and am glad that I bought it.  For the price I do think it's a decent value.  But I do wish it had more art, and more discussion of the art that it contains.
B00000DFRS|5.0|This was one of her better Cd's.  I have to buy another one because I played the original one I had until it would not play anymore.
0470477237|4.0|Erik Qualman is a well regarded social media marketer.  Understanding that this is a book written about marketing by a marketer is helpful to keep in mind while reading it.<br /><br />Erik looks at a variety of marketing situations in which social media could, and does, play an important role. The book is heavy on anecdotal information presented as case studies.  The reader that finds this style appealing will benefit from Erik's work.<br /><br />I personally found the first three chapters the most useful because I am looking for context more than details at this point.  Erik does a good job of providing both.<br /><br />Socialnomics is a fast, easy read.  For anyone wanting an easily accessible marketing overview of social media this is a good choice.  I recommend it.
B001993Y2C|5.0|The packaging is nowhere near as horrible as many of the reviews lead me to believe. Yes, it's a large box, but you can see that from the pictures, and I think it's a cool setup. The discs are in cardboard sleeves, but not tightly packed at all; no need to worry about scratching them. I almost bought this by individual seasons because of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I didn't listen. The only thing I agree with is that I wish it came with an episode/special features list, but this is easily found online.     Very pleased with the blu-ray quality, and of course I love the show!
B002GJU54E|2.0|Ho Hum. This book did not come together very well.  Some good Plum dialouge and tricky situations, but scary people were not that clever and funny people were kind of low key. Generally, I laugh all the way through Evanovich's book.  This one was not that funny. It also did not make much sense from a content point of view.  Most of her novels are very low tech crime.  This was not, and she did not explain how Stephanie could follow the techy stuff from a New Jersey gals point of view.    Evanovich has so many other funny books, don't get this one unless it's a good sale.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|The movie itself is simply excellent, and I think that's been well-covered by the other writers, so I'll write about my opinion that the 2-disc edition is preferable to the single-disk edition.    The 2-disk edition comes with the deleted scenes, and one never knows for any tv & film product whether the DVD scenes will be worth anything. I would say that the deleted scenes add to the story, and as they do not contradict the story I would consider them canon.     There are three sets of deleted scenes:  1) Spock and Kirk as children  2) Nero on the Klingon present planet  3) Kirk and the green woman.    Spoilers below.    Of those 3, I'd say they add to the story in that order. With the green woman, we learn Kirk was just using her to get her help to cheat on the Kobayashi test. In the case of Nero, it was merely cool to see. The CGI on these scenes is unfinished. Right after the Kelvin crashes into the Narada, the Narada ends up heavily damaged and is surrounded by about 30 Klingon ships. They surrender, following this Nero ends up on a Klingon prison planet, from which he escapes, a plot twist I find unebelievable.    It is the childhood scenes that really shine. We learn why Kirk was driving that car off the cliff, it's not because he's a young maniac. We see his stepdad treat his older brother like garbage, and then his older brother tells him that car doesn't really belong to their stepdad, but to their real dad. He drives the car off the cliff out of a sense of righteousness.    Spock's childhood scenes... can you say awesome? It seems most of Winona Ryder's screen time was eliminated. We have Spock's birth scene. We have a scene of Spock's mother and father arguing after Spock got into a fight. It brings life to Spock's mother, and I wonder if Spock's mother's death would have been as much of a tear jerker as Kirk's father's death had these scenes been included in a seamless manner.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|If you've seen the show that this movie is based on, then it's worth getting. It ties up a lot of loose ends left by the show.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|Average ease of use.  The sound quality is good, but there is significant skipping.  As always, Sony blames that on cleanliness(my old vinyl is clean).    Does the job with moderate satisfaction, but I'm sure there are better units out there.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was very satisfied with the Susan Boyle CD I purchased.  The Cd was sent very fast and I could not have asked for better service.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I've loved Lady A ever since their debut single came out, \\"Love Don't Live Here\\" and as far as i'm concerned this trio continues to produce some of the best country music on the radio. I knew that by buying their first album it would be worth it even if they weren't the most popular at the time. Now the only place for Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood to go is WAY up -  Such an original sound and AMAZING chemistry. Move over Rascal Flatts... there's a new trio taking country music by storm and it's about time! My favorite band BY FAR. I would highly recommend this CD and of course their self titled debut album. 5 stars!!!
0545123267|5.0|I loved loved this book.  It was excellent.  I rate this book up there with the Twilight series.  Grace and Sam, what can I say but WOW!  I feel that their relationship is similar to Edward and Bella of Twilight.  You feel the love, the excitement and the sorrow that they go through.  I was happy when they were happy, I was excited when they were excited and I was sad when they were sad. This is a must read.  You won't be disappointed.  Can't wait for the second book, Linger.  I've already got that one on pre-order.
0393317552|2.0|I read this book some years ago, and provided many \\"aha\\" moments. Diamond's explanations are extremely compelling, even to someone with more than a passing education in history, geography and historiography. Of course, they are all a \\"just so\\" story, rather than an accurate representation of how things  turned out. Geography *of course* is important in the historical development of different nations and civilizations. Is geography (along with associated factors of agricultural technology, domesticated animals and his pained explanation about why Europeans were better with guns than the Chinese who invented them) the only factor in why Western Civilization grew to dominate others? Of course it isn't. Europe had  no unique access to these things: Asian civilizations had arguably superior such advantages. Victor Davis Hanson makes a similar \\"one factor\\" argument in his book \\"Carnage and Culture.\\" Hanson's argument is that Westerners are simply better at war than other civilizations, because most Westerners were influenced by the Ancient Greeks, who developed a superior method of combat and of developing innovations than other nations did. Is Hanson's theory 100% the One True Answer? No, the rise of Japan and the invincibility of Mongol raiders rather puts his theory to fault, but it's at least as important as geography. There are all kinds of \\"one factor\\" arguments possible, all of which could make for as convincing a book as this one. Victorian historians thought it was the vigor of \\"nordic\\" civilizations which made Western world domination inevitable: also convincing if that was the only book you had read on that particular day, and also ultimately deeply silly (basically, this means the West dominates because it is dominant). Other Victorian historians made out human history to be the product of great battles, all of which had a huge element of random chance. Spengler also famously thought of civilizations as \\"cultural organisms\\" which eventually get old, become frail and die, just like any other organism whose telemeres have gotten shorter. I would imagine, like in, say, finance, the actual explanation for history is kind of complicated. I bet the Greek way of war has something to do with it, along with geography, culture, the Catholic Church, language and a whole lot of random chance. It's nice to think we know exactly why something happened, but a lot of what happens in the world, especially the world of human beings, is just plain random noise. Putting one factor explanations on history as Diamond does is not particularly helpful.<br /><br />There is also the matter of historical perspective. Diamond writes as if everything leading up to the present  time of European world cultural domination were some kind of historical inevitability, and that *of course* -thus it will always be. This is the sheerest nonsense. At various times in human history, \\"Western Civilization\\"  consisted of illiterate barbarians living in mud huts. In very recent times in human history (like, say, the 1930s), it kind of looked like that's where the West was heading again. Other civilizations culturally and physically eclipsed or dominated the West through history: the Japanese, the Chinese, the Islamic civilizations, Egyptian, Assyrian, Mongolian, Persian or Russian (if you count them as different, which I do) civilizations made Western civilization irrelevant through vast swathes of human history. Such civilizations may again eclipse Western civilization. Just to take one example, the Zoroastrian Persian civilization lasted longer than Rome,  covered more territory and was in many ways more advanced: they even generally beat the Romans in warfare in the middle east. Why should I privilege the Romans over the Persians, just because some nations who were rather vaguely influenced by Rome now dominate the nations who were influenced by the Persians? I privilege them because they are my cultural ancestors, though in 1000 years, the poetry of Rumi maybe more important than that of Martial.<br /><br />Finally, there are the matters of Diamond's historical veracity and bigotry. To address the second thing first, he seems to take a sort of perverse glee in making racial pronouncements to the detriment of \\"Western\\" people. According to Diamond, Western people are dirty, and have developed special immune systems; something I find hard to believe, and doubt is backed up by anything resembling statistical fact. Why wouldn't east Asians have developed superior immune systems? They lived in cities longer than the ancestors of most Westerners. Also, according to Diamond, he can tell that the average New Guinean is \\"on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive and more interested in things and people than the average European or American. (page 20, along with a tortured explanation of why Diamond's vacation perceptions are supposed to be superior to a century of psychometric research)\\" This is the sort of casual bigotry that used to inform Nordicist history about the dominance of the West, except somehow it becomes politically correct when pointed at Western people in modern times. Personally, I figure this just makes Diamond a garden variety modern bigot: a late 20th century version of a pith helmeted Kipling type who yammers on about \\"lesser breeds without the law.\\" To make matters worse, he's also empirically wrong: New Guineans have an average IQ of around 85, wheras Europeans and Americans are closer to 95 or 100, depending where you look (source; wakipedia). His historical veracity leaves rather a lot to be desired as well. I don't think he actually *knows* any history, other than the type of silliness you pick up in High School history classes. Diamond is a professional zoologist by trade, and it shows. For example, his ideas about China would be laughable to a Chinese person conversant with their history. He also got some of the dates and a lot of facts wrong about the conquest of South America.  Sure, lots of Aztecs and Incas died of disease: most of them *after* they were conquered by the Spaniards. In fact, the few Spaniards there were were far more afflicted by tropical diseases than were the Aztecs: this is recorded historical fact. Yet, it doesn't fit Diamond's \\"Westerner as plague rat\\" theory, so he doesn't think to bring it up. Either he learned his history of the conquest of South America in a comic book, or he's deliberately misleading the reader. This is a complete travesty, and rather indicates you shouldn't trust anything else he's stated either.<br />When people find out I write about history, the often bring this book up. I tend to politely change the subject. Everyone who reads this book thinks they're uniquely enlightened for having read it. In reality, they've been duped by a half baked popular writer who knows very little about history, and has some very ugly views about humanity.important than that of Martial.

0786838655|5.0|I know this is meant to be for kids, but I am 20 years old.  Percy Jackson and the Olympians is simply irresistible. From cover to cover, it is stuffed with thrilling action that is smart rather than repetitive. It's never boring. At times, it feels like a video game with the plot neatly divided into successive mini-quests, but each part is so engaging and artful, I couldn't let me bother me if I tried. As a life-long lover of Greek mythology, I loved seeing Riordan fearlessly and cleverly modernize so many of my favorite stories in his own distinct way.    This series is more of a continuation of the original mythos than a rewrite. Riordan makes good use of symbolism and practicality to describe how the gods and their domain have changed over time. I cannot get enough of his style.

1591843162|4.0|This is Seth Godin's most important book yet.  His other books are essentially about making money - this is about changing your life and making art.  Similar to his other books, it reads like a series of blog posts.  Small nuggets that are quick reading, make a point and move on. But this book is much more passionate and much more personal.     In Linchpin, Godin challenges you - why not be indispensible?  Why settle for good enough?  Why not bring your passion to your work?  He challenges you , but has no easy answers.  There is no series of steps:  do this and change your life.  You need to figure it out.  What Godin does is spell out why you need to change and where the resistance is coming from (the lizard brain).      I really enjoyed the book.  Could not put it down and immediately after finishing passed it along to a co-worker, who is devouring it.  The book really made me think hard about my career.

0439023483|5.0|I have never, ever read a book like The Hunger Games. I was completely blown away, in a good way. :) The plot, the characters, the entire world Collins created is completely original and unlike anything I've ever encountered before. I'd heard that this book was good, but I had no idea that it would be this amazing. Why I let it sit on my shelf for so long before giving it a short is beyond my comprehension.     From the very fist chapter, I felt myself bonding with the characters. They are incredibly realistic, and they bring the story to life. Katniss is a strong protagonist that I can admire and believe. Unlike some strong female characters, Katniss tough personality is a learned skill instead of a personality trait. This helped me to understand her a lot more. The other tributes and characters are equally interesting. They all certainly added to my love of the novel.     I've always loved drama. Who doesn't like a bit of suspense in their books? Everything about The Hunger Games is dramatic- from the reaping to the games. I was constantly wondering what would happen next. This is one of the first books I've read in a long time that had me sneaking away to my room every chance I got. I was desperate to find out what happened next. While the concept of teens battling it out in an area  is somewhat disturbing, it was impossible to not be fascinated.     The Hunger Games is now one of my favorite books. It was absolutely brilliant, and I will be recommending it to all of my fellow readers. I've heard awesome things about the sequel, Catching Fire, and I cannot wait to see what happens next in this captivating series. Five stars!
0689859368|4.0|The field guide is an amazing introductory little book with its creative, illustrative pictures into the magical world of fairies. As you delve further and further into the book, you will feel as though you have become a part of their world. I read the book in one sitting as I could not put it down. Each chapter provided more insight into the supernatural world and the Grace children; I wanted to know more. The only downside is that I did not buy the other four books. I should have bought all five, I wanted to more and therefore felt dissatisfied.

038073186X|4.0|I've never really read Lehane before. I've seen `Mystic River', but I'd never really read anything of his. I had heard a few good things about this book & figured that I'd give it a chance. Oh man... this book was awesome.<br /><br />Teddy Daniel is a US Marshall who has been sent to find the whereabouts of a missing patient, Rachel Solando- a murderess who drowned her children. Solando was previously housed in a mental institution on Shutter Island, but went missing one night without a trace of where she had gone & nothing to show how she accomplished this. Alongside his partner Chuck, Daniels attempts to not only discover where Solando has gone, but also investigate rumors of horrific crimes done in the name of science.<br /><br />This book was incredibly well done. The pacing was nice & I have to say that this is going to be something I'm going to re-read in the near future- there's little things to this that I undoubtedly missed on the first go round. I like the character of Teddy Daniels, who is portrayed from the start as someone we could empathize with.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about the book is that while the ending still thrilled me, I was able to see it coming. Maybe it's just because I've become accustomed to such things, but the ending was slightly predictable. Even so, it was still a great read & if all I can complain about is that I can anticipate the ending of a well written book, then that's really nothing to sniff at.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews stating that this is one of his weaker novels & if so, I can only look forward to picking up one of his better reads. For now, this one is something I can say I'll be lending out to friends & talking up to coworkers.
044656740X|4.0|I remember walking into the bookstore feeling defeated at my failed attempt to study pharmacy.  I didn't know what to do nor what to study.  My other worry was I had no money and no job.  I was feeling depressed so I began to walk around the book store trying to forget my worries.  I am not sure what I was trying to find but I ran into another of Robert Kiyosaki's books [[ASIN:0446677477 Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom]].  I picked it up and the first couple of pages sounded like my life.  If I hadn't lived with my parents, it would be exactly like his life.  So I decided to buy a package of his three books to see what this guy did to get out of his rut.      A book in the package: Rich Dad Poor Dad, I loved for many years.  It gave me inspiration, hope, and knowledge of a different path.  I followed his advice to become financially and business educated.  I give this book five stars for being inspirational and thanks to this book I have read books on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, day trading, marketing, stocks, sales and business.  I have taken classes in accounting, speech, and sales.  I am thankful that this book crossed my path because it has given me hope and opened my knowledge base.     Now that four years have passed since I read this book.  I started a personal training service (struggling, but at least i started it), have experience in stock investing, and trading (shouldn't have done trading so soon), and ofcourse dealing with all the work that involves running a small business.      The main concept that stood out to me from Rich Dad Poor Dad was to not specialize in a particular subject.  That was a terrible mistake.  After recently reading [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]] (highly recommend it), Malcolm Gladwell suggest that one part of success is to at least have 10,000 hours of work in a field you want to be successful in.  He gives very successful people as examples.  Other people have said to specialize in a subject yet I chose to follow Mr. Kiyosaki's.  Robert Kiyosaki's suggest you become knowledgeable in all trades, but become a master of none.  But there are not many examples of people being successful following his approach.  For that I give this book three stars.     For what it's worth, the book inspirational.  But, if I could go back in time I wish would have picked up [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]] first on success and [[ASIN:1585424331 Think and Grow Rich: The Landmark Bestseller--Now Revised and Updated for the 21st Century]] for inspiration.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is James Cameron's $237 million parable on the evils of imperialism, corporatism and Manifest Destiny.<br /><br />The time is 2154, the place an earthlike moon called Pandora, where an American company has set up a major mining operation to extract a precious mineral - presumably an energy source - from beneath the planetoid's lush, verdant surface.  The problem is that one of the richest veins lies directly under a massive tree that holds great spiritual significance for the indigenous folk who live there - a race of nine-foot-tall, blue-complexioned natives called the Na'vi who dwell in the forest, wield old-fashioned bows-and-arrows, fly around on giant pterodactyl-type birds, and have a strong pantheistic connection with the world around them.<br /><br />As the story begins, it is clear that, thus far, the earthlings have had very limited success in winning over the Na'vi through such outreach efforts as building them schools and teaching them English.  Fortunately, a group of scientists have found a way to create facsimiles of the Na'vi - called Avatars - into which a human mind can be transported while the original body remains behind in a state of suspended animation.  Enter Jake Sully, a young marine who's lost the use of his legs in battle and now has been chosen to enter into an avatar so he can learn more about the Na'vi by living amongst them in the hopes of eventually winning them over to the Americans' side.  Unfortunately, not everyone is as concerned with making nice with the Na'vi as is Grace Augustine, the humanistic biologist who heads up the research, and Jake soon discovers that the more he comes to feel like a Na'vi himself, the more he is expected to spy on and then betray his new-found compatriots in the earthlings' cause.  Jake's gradual transition from cocky, human-centric warrior to nature-loving ersatz-alien provides the dramatic and thematic arc of the film.<br /><br />The parallels between the conflict in \\"Avatar\\" and America's involvement in the Iraq war are never far from Cameron's mind and the movie suffers a bit for it (ironically, \\"Avatar\\" is a far more overtly political film than \\"The Hurt Locker\\" which is actually SET in  Iraq).  I suspect that, had he wanted to, Cameron could probably have gotten his point across without taking a narrative sledgehammer to the audience.  Heck, there's even a reference to \\"shock and awe\\" as the Americans gear up for battle, just in case you missed the inference.  That being said, \\"Avatar\\" is enough of a technical triumph to overcome its occasional heavy-handed polemical tendencies and to successfully take us to a place we've never been before.<br /><br />Through the wizardry of computer-generated 3-D special effects, Cameron has created a magical world of shimmering forests, floating mountains, and strange and exotic flora and fauna - a place where love can convincingly flourish between creatures from alien worlds and alien species.  In fact, the romance between Jake and a female Na'vi who teaches him the ways of her people - an even more unlikely coupling than Rose and Jack in \\"Titanic\\" - has something of a \\"New World\\" quality about it.  And, indeed, Cameron's near-worshipful attitude towards nature here echoes Terrance Malick's work in that earlier film.  Actually, that seems a particularly appropriate reference point given that \\"Avatar\\" can easily be viewed as an allegory of the European white man's conquest of the American continent and the genocide perpetrated on the native population that played such a crucial role in bringing that outcome about.  The look of the movie is something akin to a John Howe painting done in bold florescent colors and placed under a black light.<br /><br />Of the performers, it's frankly a little hard to evaluate fully Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's work in this film since clearly much of what appears on screen is the product of CGI manipulation and enhancement.  But they're both certainly adequate to the task they`ve been called upon to fulfill, and Sigourney Weaver as Grace and Giovanni Ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine - and the movie's arch villain - turn in genuinely powerful performances.  And once again, as with \\"Titanic,\\" James Horner provides a soaring power-ballad to help transition the audience out of the theater and back into the real world.<br /><br />Almost inevitably, perhaps, \\"Avatar\\" is one of those movies wherein the storyline is bound to become at least partially subsumed by the special effects.  But, as he did with \\"Titanic\\" - though to a somewhat lesser extent in this case - Cameron proves that he is capable of finding that happy medium between the two sides better than most.to fulfill, and Sigourney Weaver as Grace and Giovanni Ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine - and the movie's arch villain - turn in genuinely powerful performances.

0061706620|2.0|This really should have been written as a novel and titled, \\"John's Story\\".  At least then it could have stood on its own as an interesting prequel.  The author seems to be really out of touch with fans of Supernatural for purporting it be John Winchester's Journal, as it's not even close to being the journal from the show.  He should have at least gotten a hold of the pages we've seen in the show and included them, and added a blurb from John at the end saying something along the lines of \\"I'm going to rip out the personal stuff and just give the boys the resource pages\\".  Also, they shouldn't have bothered with the font changes -- that just made some of the sections of the book harder to read.  Unfortunately, the publication of this book probably means we'll never get the \\"real\\" deal.
B00005O438|5.0|Donna Trenton is a frustrated suburban housewife whose life is a turmoil after her husband learns about her having an affair. Brett Camber is a young boy whose only companion is a Saint-Bernard named \\"Cujo\\", who in turn is bitten by a rabid bat. Whilst Vic, Donna's husband is away on business, and thinking over his marital troubles, Donna and her 5-year-old son Tad take her Pinto to Brett Cambers' dad's car shop, the car fails, and \\"Cujo\\" is very, very sick. What is great about Cujo is how it shows the dog coming unravelled. We see the transformation from lovable  family dog, to vicious killing machine that has an insatiable need for blood. It is understood that Cujo has to have a happy hollywood ending, and that is fine, but the book tells a much more clear yet paradoxically involved tale of a boy, his dog, and how sin is never really forgiven. Cujo is a great movie. It is scary and has a point. It does a good job of bringing King's vision to life. A movie that tells you that your demons will come back to haunt you.

B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie White is the outsider of her class. She's a mousy girl, all of her classmates hate her, and her mother is a religious fanatic who walks around in a black cape. After she unexpectedly has her first period, she is teased by the girls more ruthlessly than before. The gym teacher punishes the girls that were involved and one of them, Sue Snell, feels sorry for what she did and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom instead of her. But another girl that has been banned from the prom, Chris Hargenson, isn't so forgiving and hatches an evil plan with her boyfriend that involves Carrie and a bucket full of pig's blood. But what none of the students realize is that Carrie has the power of telekinesis, the power to move things with your mind, and that when you make her mad, she transforms from an innocent girl to a rage-filled monster. And this is gonna be a prom no one will ever forget. You want to call this horror movie or thriller or whatever else is up to you, Carrie's scope can't reach beyond just one genre. It is a thriller, but at the same time a very humane movie. This movie wasn't made for cheap scares: every scene is brilliantly captured. The scary parts may be rare but when they are there you just can't move from your seat. If you are looking for a terrifying but also moving movie, Carrie is just right for you.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Their vocals are great, many would agree. I like the fact that his voice is in the middle of country, rock, pop so it's not overdone in any type of genre yet enough to please everyone. I am not a country music fan (just my preference, don't mean to offend anyone) but I still like the 2 lead singers here especially the guy. He can reach high note like a tenor but still doesn't lose the warmnth of his soul.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon are bending time and space on their fourth studio album. \\"Crack The Skye\\" picks up where the progressive leaning [[ASIN:B000GPI2EK Blood Mountain]], but they expand even deeper into the elements of the music. If there was ever a band that made the melodic chiming sounds of an army of panzer tanks, it's Mastodon. This album is that heavy a trip.<br /><br />Allegedly a concept album about the rise and fall of Tsarist Russia, \\"Crack The Skye\\" is ambitious and thoughtful at the same time it is skull crushing. The centerpiece of the CD, \\"The Czar,\\" is a sonic spiral of heavy rock with textures shifting throughout the four parts of the piece. There's plenty of menacing atmosphere to the point that some listeners might be taken aback...most metal depends one speed and the harshness of the sound to provide the intimidation, yet Mastodon have mastered that most elusive of beasts; dynamic. The drawn out harmonies of \\"The Last Baron\\" wouldn't be possible if the band were trying to crack land speed records, yet there's no way to miss the power and the weight of the song itself.<br /><br />\\"Crack The Skye\\" was my favorite metal album of 2009, and on a par with another conceptual rocking fave, Iced Earth's [[ASIN:B0000YTOXA Glorious Burden]]. Months later, it continues to reveal new things on repeat listens. Along with producer Brendan O'Brien, Mastodon have delivered an album that is both a sonic boom (listen on headphones or a surround system for the best effect) and rocks harder than 90% of what most metal bands and fans collectively obsess over.
6301971272|5.0|Finally, a decently produced version of what is arguably the greatest western ever made! I discarded the VHS version of this film when the first DVD appeared, and like other reviewers, was disappointed at the audio and video quality of the early DVD. This latest version more than makes up for previous format inadequacies. The film is crystal clear; the audio does total justice to Ennio Morricone's magnificent soundtrack and the action in the film. If you are a fan of this film, do not hesitate to acquire this wondrous version.

Delving deeper than its predecessor, Catching Fire makes a sticky situation into an impossible situation. A cliffhanger of sorts at the end left me absolutely dying to get my hands on the as of yet unnamed third and final book in the series.<br /><br />I had no idea how after The Hunger Games the series could continue. The first book wraps everything up in a neat little bow. Unfortunately, the capitol is raging angry in the second book over a particular stunt that Katniss pulls during the Hunger Games. Just when she thinks she is safe, she finds out that her situation is even more perilous than she could have imagined.<br /><br />Catching Fire moves a bit slower than Hunger Games, but the reader gets to know a lot more about the Capitol and the people that reside in the ultra lush area that rules Panem. At one point Katniss remarks on the fact that the people in the Capitol like to throw up their food, so that they may eat more and taste everything. All the while people in the districts are starving to death, Katniss finds the Capitol to be utterly disgusting.<br /><br />Even though the book starts out slow, the pace picks up about halfway through and again (if you are anything like me) you will be staying up all night to find out what happens. Don't say I didn't warn you, this book is a drug.<br /><br />Very well written, oozing creativity, this series is an instant classic. I am really looking forward to the conclusion of the series, and I plan pre-order The Hunger Games: Book 3 so that I know I will have a copy! If you are one of the few people that has yet to start the series, there is no time like the present. Enjoy!
068484267X|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said countless times about Angela's Ashes.  I see now why it has all the fans that it does.  I wish McCourt were a Chicano so I could claim him.  Or maybe say I too am Irish.  That's what I would say, that he made me feel Irish.  If not for the \\"brogue\\", his story is not that different than what many of us go through growing up poor, and that includes many of us who are born and raised here.
1580176941|5.0|As a pastry chef with my own bakery, I'd been trying different sugar cookie recipes for months and couldn't find one that created the kind of blank canvas I needed. Sure they were yummy, but the dough was too sticky and the end product too chewy and crackled to decorate.    The recipes in this book create beautiful blank canvases every time -- sharp corners and points stay sharp in the oven, and the surfaces are as smooth as glass. The book is full of detailed pictures of groups of decorated cookies for every holiday and occasion -- great inspirations for me to key off of and create my own pieces of art.     Thanks for producing such a fantastic (and pretty) reference!

1591396190|5.0|This is the type of book that keeps coming back off the shelf over the years. I know a number of people who have made a systematic study of the Blue Ocean Strategy and applied it to their business, including myself. Although I can't contest the rigorous critical analysis of some of the reviews posted here -- and I agree that there are gaps in the practical step-by-step application -- I suggest that the approach is overwhelmingly inspiring. If you are open to challenging yourself and your organization to re-think, re-design and manage to new competitive advantages, the ideas here will provide a framework for breaking away from the old habits of business and identifying new, profitable ones. As a marketer, I consider the business strategies presented here to be necessary underpinnings of bold marketing strategies.

1591843162|5.0|I read [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]] and now Linchpin. Seth's books read a lot like his blog, condensing ideas into one page lessons. So if you like his blog, you won't be disappointed. It's transformational writing and well worth it for its lessons on not being a cog but an artist.
B002TZS5GU|3.0|While I still can't make up my mind as to whether or not I liked this movie, I must say I don't know why lots of people are calling it a zombie movie. Granted, if you only saw the trailer, I wouldn't blame you for thinking that. As a big fan of zombie movies, I know 2 basic qualities zombies must have- 1) dying, then coming back to \\"life,\\" and 2) eating people. None of this happens in Carriers. It's a disease...that makes you rot slowly...or something. It's never explained, which can work but doesn't in this case.  My main problem is with the characters; they're not likeable or hateable- just there. Older brother is loud and dominating, younger brother is a wimp on all levels (until he's forced to not be), and the two girls are dumb even by horror movie standards.  The ending, also, made me cringe. First off, voice-over endings are weak. Secondly, younger brother goes on a rant of how alone he feels. It may have worked had he actually been alone at the beach. But no, a girl was there. And a good-looking one. STOP WHINING!!!  Anyway, I'll definitely give this another shot once it comes on HBO, so then I can really make my mind up about it knowing what to expect. But on first viewing it seems like Carriers falls into the category of \\"could/should have been good, but fell short.\\"
0792838084|5.0|This is Lynch at his most classic and refined at the same time.  Though signs of Lynch's obsession to be weird are ever present, the story is layered and deeply symbolic.  This VHS recording means even more to me as it broke the night I lost my virginity, but that's another story.

0312944098|3.0|This one really hooked me at the beginning. I was telling my wife after the first disc (I listened to audio version) that she needed to read this.  By the 3rd or 4th disc (of 13), my enthusiasm for the story had begun to seriously wane;  it's as though Mr. Archer started with full creative powers, and then made a decision to mail it in.  The characters, language, and conversations all become trite and predictable.  And there is very little shading to the characters - each one is either a pillar of his society or the blackest villain to ever populate the earth...no in-between.  The book does however create its own momentum, and so though increasingly disappointed, I did get to the end.  At the end, there are a couple of plot/logic holes that made me a bit disgusted that I had continued.  If you decide to read this, see if you can spot them - they both occur when the chief villain is in court on the stand being questioned by Sir Matthew, and have to do with incompleteness of the scenarios setup by the lawyer for how the murder and wounding had occurred, and the inability of the witness to see a question coming that anyone of the witness' intelligence would have prepared for...

B00012QM9K|5.0|This movie IS, what is seen as a very much misused and misguided label on this company's reviews, one of the most moving and beautifully crafted films ever made.<br />The very level to which \\"human\\" beings will sink when brain-washed by any power... religious or un...is caught so brilliantly and man's atavistic nature is always lying on the surface just ready to erupt and stike.
B0013K1ALE|2.0|Wow. I'm super disappointed in this DVD. Just watched a bit today. The sound of Bonham's drums is awful! They are all full of reverb and the crack of the snare is completely gone. Jimmy Page is losing it. The powerful \\"Thunder of Drums\\" is not there. Zeppelin is not Zeppelin without the classic sound of Bonham's Vistalites. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I'll probably go back to watching my old DVD of TSRTS.<br /><br />1-26-2013<br />To add to this review, I must put some blame on Kevin Shirley. I'm sure he had something to do with the horrible mix and the neutering of Bonham's snare drum sound. I just watched the two versions back to back yesterday. It's really bad.<br /><br />I will say one thing positive - there is an absolute gem on the second disc. When the menu comes up, the music that plays is a previously unreleased short segment of Whole Lotta Love that is probably one of the grooviest things Zeppelin ever played. Too bad the original soundtrack didn't have this nugget of gold, but given the fact that the original movie was pieced together from different nights and that the film crew didn't actually capture an entire version of Whole Lotta Love during the three nights in MSG, I guess it's somewhat understandable. But since they filmed the concert over again a year later at Shepperton studios, they could have picked the best sounding bits and made the film fit the sound. Don't believe that most of the movie is not from MSG? Read \\"Peter Grant - The Man Who Led Zeppelin\\" or Google \\"Led Zeppelin Shepperton\\" and see what comes up. But I digress...
B002PQ7JQK|2.0|I liked playing the discs, it was very enjoyable seeing the old shows. Unfortunatly, I could not get any of the discs on Season 2 to play at all. Upon doing some research, I found out that in some situations, other people also had this same problem. I am using a Sharp Blu Ray player. It may be related to the type of player, or not, I am not sure. I would like to be able to play these discs, but I do not know how. I had to send the discs back for a refund, which I must say was a very easy process with Amazon. If anyone knows of a solution to the problem with the Season 2 discs, let me know.

1591843162|5.0|I'm no dispassionate reviewer.  I'm a fan.  Bought my first Godin book in '96, The Guerrilla Marketer's Handbook, with the original Guerrilla Marketer, Jay Conrad Levinson.    These are only three sentences that show why you should buy Seth Godin's Linchpin:    1)  \\"It's OK if i get fired because I'll have demonstrated my value to the marketplace.  IF THE RULES ARE THE ONLY THING BETWEEN ME AND BECOMING INDISPENSABLE, I DON'T NEED THE RULES.\\" (Emphasis mine.)    2)  \\"Emotional labor changes the recipient, and we care about that. That's why emotional labor is so much more valuable than physical labor.\\"    3)  \\"Thinking About Your Choice: And it is a choice...to buy into the fear and the system, or to chart your own path and create value as you do.  It's your job to figure how to chart the path, because charting the path is the point.\\"    OK, OK.  So these are three excerpts, not sentences.    My point is -- Seth Godin gets it, gets it, gets it.    In Linchpin, he gives it to you.    It's a gift.    Pick it up.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Miss Boyle has a beautiful voice and I hope she will have future Albums with an even greater variety of songs.  Some of the songs are little more than filler and I fault the producers for that and therefore give it 4 Stars versus 5.
0061537969|5.0|I listened to this story during my commute to work.  I found myself anticipating through-out the day to hear more.

0307341569|3.0|THREE QUICK POINTS:<br />* Point 1: Multiple personality disorder. The book alternates between three different perspectives, the main character Libby Day (in first person), and Patty and Ben Day (in third person).<br /><br />* Point 2: A twisted Jerry Springer episode. None of the characters had any redeeming qualities, but on some level, they were truly human. And the situation, as it unfolded, was twisted but on some level you had to wonder could this possibly happen?<br /><br />* Point 3: Smartly written. I am surprised and delighted by Flynn's fluid writing style.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />Twenty-five years after her mother and two sisters were slaughtered, Libby Day finds herself nearly penniless, which is why she was willing to dredge up her past by the offer of quick and easy cash.<br /><br />Back in early January 1985, when the murders occurred, Libby's brother Ben had been accused, arrested, and convicted--partly due to Libby's own testimony. But as Libby starts looking at the actual events of the day, she realizes that her memories might not have been accurate.<br /><br />As Libby puts the pieces of the puzzle together, working from the present to the past, we the readers get to see the events unfolding from the past to the present through Patty and Ben Day's perspectives beginning on that fateful morning.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />The prose and flow of this novel is enthralling. Flynn has this way with words that just tugs at your physical senses, and she deftly handled switching between the various points of view (Libby, Patty, & Ben). One problem, however, was that it became difficult to connect with the characters on more than a superficial level. Right when I thought I was finally connecting with Libby, bam I'm thrown into Patty's or Ben's story and vice versa. Some of the switching also provided lulls right when the action from one character's perspective began to pick up, so it was constantly building tension then dropping like a stone.<br /><br />That said, it could have much more to do with the actual characters than Flynn's shifting between them. Libby is a bitter kleptomaniac who's deeply troubled, partly due to what happened to her family and partly because that's who she is.<br /><br />Patty, though I hate to admit it, is probably a good reflection of most struggling mothers and, of the three characters, seemed most genuine. Her stress was understandable, her motives were clear, and her actions reflected it. She was real.<br /><br />Ben was just twisted in ways that I'm still trying to piece together. How much can be blamed on just being a teenage boy in a bad situation and just plain having a screw loose isn't exactly clear. He may very well reflect some teenage boys (actually, I'm certain he does), but he was just too incongruous. Either way, it was difficult to get beneath the surface. Then there's the Ben after he's all grown up. We get a clearer picture of who he is and I was glad to see that he'd learned much from his youth (spent mostly in prison).<br /><br />One section of the book completely took me out of the story. Unfortunately, I can't say much else because it would be a HUGE spoiler. Let's just say that a chapter just randomly appeared out of nowhere from a different perspective and it left me scratching my head and wondering what just happened?<br /><br />At the end of the day, this story needed at least one redeeming character to provide some level of balance. And it would have helped if the momentum and tension of each character's story built upon each other. (Not to say every chapter was jarring, but a few toward the middle and end were.) The story and climax were exciting, but not especially so.<br /><br />Aside from the characters, I loved the common thread throughout the book: Money (or the lack thereof). It was interesting to watch how the desperation caused by a lack of money could destroy the lives of everyone involved and leave those in its wake an empty shell of ahuman.<br /><br />I fluctuated between really liking and just liking this book. I loved the writing and liked the story, but unfortunately, the characters and the balance just left too much to be desired., but unfortunately, the characters and the balance just left too much to be desired.

But Pandorum has some entertaining (and thrilling) aspects, and the temptation of a young spaceman is certainly thought-provoking. The special effects are above average, the acting is point on (given the script which is a bit convoluted at times,) and overall, it was worth a watch.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I for one have not yet been so fortunate to have read Charlotte Bronte's novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but this film is among my favorites in the Masterpiece Theater productions, and I have seen almost every single one to date. It draws you in from the very start, and continues to pull you into its emotional, beautiful and twisting tale until the very end . Many people complain about a few \\"inappropriate scenes\\" throughout the movie, but I will say that this movie is not meant for children to view. It is an adult romance, and there are a couple very intimate yet clean scenes in the film. In each of said scenes, the characters involved are fully clothed, and nothing explicit is said. Jane Eyre is a passionate, suspenseful and gripping tale with wonderful directing, acting and cinematography, and I am very happy to say that I am now the proud owner of this wonderful DVD! Buy it, you won't regret your purchase!
1591843162|5.0|In his new book Linchpin, Seth Godin convinces you to become a linchpin -- someone who's indispensible. How do you do that? By being a freak and a revolutionary.<br /><br />I'm not even kidding.<br /><br />Seth doesn't use those exact words, but this book is about the Freak Revolution. It's about how we can revolutionize the job culture and thereby the world.<br /><br />Be a freak (what Seth would call a heretic) because the old way of doing things is broken. The freaks are the only ones who are willing to break the rules and step outside the box.<br /><br />Be a revolutionary (what Seth would call a leader) because no one is going to tell you what to do. There is no map. It's up to you to step up and change the world.<br /><br />Like we've been saying. (:<br /><br />p.20<br /><br />There's a revolution going on, baby, and things ain't never gonna be the same. It used to be that you could make a good living being told what to do (control paradigm), but in the new world of work, it's all about creativity and authentic human interactions (connection paradigm).<br /><br />It reminds me of all those sci-fi stories about the future economies that arise after all our basic and comfort needs are trivially met by a workforce of robot drones. What do those sci-fi economies value? Art. Delivering unique creativity. The future is closer than you might have thought.<br /><br />It also reminds me of Atlas Shrugged 2: One Hour Later. (:<br /><br />p.46<br /><br />Public school teaches you to conform and obey. Seth doesn't talk explicitly about homeschooling or unschooling, but we're on the same page when it comes to our opinions of public school.<br /><br />p.158<br /><br />Gifts build connection.

Seth is also right that you can't depend on emotional safety, unless you're perfectly armored or perfectly enlightened.<br /><br />But Mark is right that you can depend on spiritual safety. If you know that you are Loved, if you know that your Self is far more than your circumstances, if you know that there is love available even here... then you know, deep in your heart, that everything will be okay, no matter what.<br /><br />Yes, you might face hardship. Yes, your project might fail. Yes, people might be cruel to you.<br /><br />Yes, there is love available even here.<br /><br />p.106<br /><br />Well, I'll be! Seth Godin is talking about the triple soul! He labels Higher Self daemon, and Fetch lizard brain. He only mentions Talking Self implicitly (as the part of us that strives to bridge the two other parts) but it's fascinating to see it from a different perspective.<br /><br />pp.32,175-178<br /><br />I'm always amazed by Seth's talent for brevity with impact. He summarizes four entire chapters of The Usual Error in four pages. The usual error, it's not all about me, the lollipop, and part of rephrasing things positively -- the part that talks about how \\"I can't\\" is a cop-out. We can always come up with excuses to limit ourselves and make ourselves feel comfortable and safe, but don't fool yourself into thinking it's anything but your own choice.<br /><br />pp.31,105,116,129<br /><br />Real art requires imperfectionism. Delegate wholeheartedly. Always have exactly one mid-boss. Seek out discomfort. No one actually knows what to do. \\"I'll do what I love later\\" never works. Accept that you might step on a snake.<br /><br />We tell ourselves stories in which we play the part of the hero: the iPhone effect. This particularly amuses me because I thought the iPhone effect was inspired by a post Seth wrote, but it wasn't. And now he finally writes about it in Linchpin.<br /><br />Growth can be painful.

1591843162|5.0|Genius Marketer Markets Book Ingeniously   If Seth Godin was doing anything with his past books it was perhaps leading a trail of breadcrumbs to this current book, Linchpin. Where Tribes (2008) was a call to finding a following and to stake out a territory as a leader, Linchpin, is more a call to arms. It reaches out, grabs your lapels (or collar, if you don't have lapels, or neck if you don't have a collar) and gives you a good shake. Linchpin directly addresses the anxiety of our time and offers a self-directed path away from that experience. It points toward a future where we can control how and where and with whom we will make meaning. And it does so with a joy and enthusiasm that are all Seth's own.    Linchpin seemed to really come into its own when Seth began to re-frame the concept of work. He offers up the concept of hard work as something physical, or boring, or mundane; then he concludes that perhaps the important work, the investment of our emotional selves in our efforts, is a more important form of hard work. The emotional life of the workforce is often relegated to the backwaters of Human Resources practices, something around which everyone should tread lightly. Seth, gloriously wades into the middle of this and calls out emotional labor for what it is.    The job is not your work; what you do with your heart and soul is the work.  - Seth Godin, Linchpin    Having done my share of work both in the human resources domain and in the volunteer world, where emotional laboring is the order of the day, to have someone describe that work accurately as \\"a gift\\" is wonderful. It requires engagement. It demands the best of us. It draws on our creativity, or passions, our insight, our willingness to take risks and to be generous. I love that this kind of work lies at the heart of being a linchpin in Seth's eyes.    After all, for a linchpin to be effective, they need the connection of others. Because if they are not connecting, and giving, what the heck are theydoing? Take a look at Linchpin, I think this book is not only an invaluable tool I think it is a great and necessary call to action.

The setting alone, an insane asylum on an isolated island run by an ex-OSS doctor and an ex-Nazi, grabs you by the throat.  The way Lehane let's his story unfold doesn't let you go until you finish the last chapter.  The story of Teddy Daniels will stay with you long after you put the book down.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Exceeded my expectation for excellence. Susan Boyle's voice is truly a God given gift. I listen to this CD one or more times a day and it brings me near tears every time. Her personal take on each song hand written on the insert is heartfelt. Go Susan!

B002VJ0576|4.0|I got to admit I was really looking forward to this one but the trailer left me a little worried on the effects and on the acting fronts. First let me just say again, no one dare call this a rip-off when there has been many Sherlock Holmes movies made way before the theatrical title even came out so this is just another take on the master sleuth. I managed to go see see the big budget film in theaters mainly because I am a fan of Downey Jr. and now after sitting down to this film I got to say for entertainment purposes this film was much better. Sure it doesn't have the star power or amazing effects the other has but it has other things that make it much more fun. Like for example the villain has a iron suit he uses to walk in, there is a giant octopus and a very cool giant mechanical dragon, how awesome is that I ask you? So getting back to what I said earlier, I was a bit worried yes but after seeing the the film I got to say the acting was very good for the most part and the effects were good as well considering the budget and were only used to enhance the story for the most part which was not only a smart idea but it never over took the story itself. Filmed on location in Wales which really gave the film the look it needed, the scenery and settings were breath-taking. You have to take and judge every film for what it is and as far as this one goes I got to say I had a great time watching it and hope The Asylum decides to do a sequel at some point. Easily one of their better films filled with action,adventure, fantasy and humor. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes I suggest giving this one a shot. The Asylum seems to just get better and better with their effects and the story here is a perfect match as well. The DVD comes with a \\"Making of Featurette\\" which gives you a good look at behind the scenes the obstacles they had to face while attempting to get this shot in two weeks time.    Released by The Asylum Home Entertainment    **** Out Of *****
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It's perfect for families or adults. :) The young Nausicaa is mature and charming. I love that Miyazaki's movies always have an environmental aspect to them and in this day and age it's great to educate children young on how important plants and trees are to our lives.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is one of my long time favorites, so I decided to buy it on DVD for my little but growing vampire movies collection.  A must have for every vampire film lover, like me!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Both the video and audio of this Disney classic have been well restored in this Diamond Edition release.  Contrary to what another reviewer here has written, the colors, IMO, have not been made overly vivid.  This restoration retains the look of classic cel animation yet has been refreshed to look how I imagine it must have appeared when this film debuted in 1937.  After all, Disney would know better than anyone what the original colors would have looked like and applied that knowledge in the restoration process.  In addition, the audio has also been well restored and sounds remarkably good for a film that is over 70 years old.  I did not watch the included DVD version of the feature in its entirety, but I forwarded through it enough to tell that it looks very good, too.  If you have yet to buy a Blu-ray player but want to future-proof your purchase, you can enjoy the DVD version now and the Blu-ray version later when you have a Blu-ray player.    The bonus feature I enjoyed most was two scenes that had been cut from the original release for pacing reasons.  One is a soup-eating scene where the dwarves eat soup Snow White made for them while they sing a song.  The other is a bed-making scene where the dwarves make a bed for Snow White as a gift.  Fortunately, the dialogue, sound and music tracks were recorded at the time, so you can watch the scenes with the audio that would have been used had the scenes been included.  Unfortunately, the animation never got to the coloring phase, so the animation is just pen and ink (and in a few spots there are only static, non-animated sketches).  While I understand why these scenes were cut, they are still enjoyable to watch as extras and provide a fun look at what might have been.    If you're a fan of this Disney film, you'll enjoy watching it in its restored state on this Diamond Edition release.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Lots of indie artist on it, you will love it even if you don't like the Twilight Saga. Best song, for me, is Hearing Damage.
0812550757|2.0|If like me you really enjoyed Ender's game beware:  this book is quite different.  I did not enjoy reading it, the attitude of the characters is infuriating and the author makes it seems as if the whole human race is made of idiots, except of course for Ender.  A couple of intriguing concepts are introduced, but overall I was very disappointed.
0307474275|5.0|The fast pace and constant action in this book is better that any of his others.  As always, its a fiction book, regardless of what the forward says, so read it as such.  It is a great ride well worth the price of admission.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Saddled with an unwieldy subtitle due to another film of the novel's original name being released in 2008, \\"Precious\\" is nevertheless one of the standout films of 2009.  The second film of director Lee Daniels (the first went undistributed), previously the producer of some films as \\"Monster's Ball\\" and \\"The Woodsman\\", this is a grueling look at life in the lowest dregs of American society, where hope for the future is a fragile thing indeed.  Backed by such prominent African American media icons as Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, it is a film well worth seeing.    We open in Harlem in 1987, in an America wholly divorced from the \\"Morning in America\\" that Ronald Reagan spoke of.  Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe, in an amazing breakout performance; sadly, I can't imagine someone of her weight getting too many lead roles in the future) is sixteen years old, obese, illiterate, and more or less listless.  One can hardly blame her, given the circumstances:  repeatedly raped and twice impregnated by her own father, she lives with her abusive mother Mary (comedian Mo'Nique, playing way against type in a searing depiction of pure evil).  Precious struggles to make her way forward, while a collection of moderately sympathetic authority figures (something of a first for her) enter the picture.  Chief among these is Ms. Rain (first name Blu; someone's mother didn't like her very much), played by Paula Patton, and a social worker played by Mariah Carey (deglammed to the point of unrecognizability).    Based on an even bleaker novel, \\"Precious\\" would probably cause Thomas Hardy himself to balk and advise a bit of letting up on the protagonist.  The cast, virtually all female (the only significant male character is Lenny Kravitz as a male nurse, and there are half a dozen characters with more screentime than him), carries the film.  Sidibe and Mo'Nique, the latter virtually sweeping the supporting actress awards this year, are the main attractions.  Mo'Nique's Mary is the year's most frightening cinematic villain.  Also deserving recognition is Patton, who is luminous (and seemingly the only castmember with access to makeup, which makes her stand out even more).  Carey and Kravitz also acquit themselves well in their minor roles.    Recommended (for those with a strong stomach).
B002GY9F9K|1.0|As a huge fan of Terry Goodkind's work, I was very excited to see this story come to life on tv. I was very disappointed with this series. I know it is Sam Raimi, but I did not except to feel like I was still watching a Hercules or Xena episode. The dialog is disappointing, and the plot changes are unnecessary. The actor they chose to Richard is unbelievable. Richard is supposed to be a big, confident, mature man in his mid to late 20's, not a scrawny boy in his early 20's. No serious complaints about everyone else, but if you get the main character wrong, you kind of get the whole thing wrong. I noticed many of the fans of this are Raimi fans who have never read the books. So, for all you readers out there, be warned, this is NOT the Sword of Truth you are looking for. For arguments sake, I did not get to the third episode, I was already feeling to alienated from the story I knew by the end of the second to go any farther. And not being a fan of the Hercules/Xena style of production I was not hooked by any of Raimi's elements.

B0033TJATW|4.0|After many, many years, Moonwalker is finally available on DVD!    Unlike the description would lead you to believe, this is actually a Korean release (region 1/3/4, NTSC). The text on the case is both English and Korean (mostly korean, especially the back), but the coverart is reversible (to an english only version with no text on the back).    For anyone wanting the tech-specs, this is a DVD-5 (single sided, single layer) encoded at 1.37:1 (fullscreen) and Dolby 2.0 english audio (and a number of different subtitle options), 93 minute runtime. The only extras are a theatrical trailer.     The disc contains the entire Moonwalker 'movie' (concert footage, music videos, claymation films and Smooth Criminal \\"movie\\" with Joe Pesci) - a classic movie, especially if you grew up watching it!    Video quality is generally good, same for the audio (5.1 would be nice, but the 2.0 is very good). The video quality, however, appears to be overly dark - I noticed some \\"black crush\\" (areas that are so dark, no detail is to be found - but that could just be the display I watched it on. Not a dealbreaker, but worth noting. I'll update the review once I have a chance to try another display.    Some more extras would be nice, but I'm more than happy just to have this film on DVD. Next - bring on Captain EO and Ghosts to complete the collection!    Definitely recommended - who knows when the disc will release in the USA, and even then it would likely be the same exact content.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I saw the Preview and I am very eager to watch the full length movie. I must watch first myself to find out what type of movie is this.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I missed seeing most of this series when it was first broadcast on television (school, work, etc.)  Now I have just purchased it and am eagerly looking forward to watching it with a relative who will be recovering from surgery.  What was most fun about the few episodes of Gilmore Girls that I did see when they originally aired was the very UNreality of this idealized story.      A real-life Lorelai would likely have been much more worn down by the stresses of single parenthood, the real Grandparents would likely have already died by the time their money paid for Rory's schooling, and a real Rory and Tristan would likely have been too reserved, too shy and \\"appropriate\\" ever to have dared reveal to anyone, let alone to one another, that each one carried a torch for the other.  Thus, real-life characters even partially similar to our favorites in Gilmore Girls would likely have had lives whose tone far more closely matched that of an O Henry or Anton Checkov short story than this bubbly, cheerful TV series.  Nevertheless, at times it is the very fantasy of a happy ending that we reach for, as I will be reaching to watch these unlikely but heartening and essentially hopeful vignettes in the weeks ahead.
0884271536|5.0|I just finished my undergraduate degree, and have started on my masters. We were required to read this book for one of my project management grad classes, and I have barely been able to put it down. It is a refreshing break from the dry and boring books most classes require you to read. Goldratt does a great job of using stories to layout his case for a new way of thinking about projects.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedan at his best.  Too bad the show is not still in production.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This DVD is a wonderful way to see Michael Jackson in his last days. At least we are shown a glimpse of what his concert would have been like. It shows you his caring, sweet, and humble side, which you never got to see in the media. I thought he was a beautiful person before, but this pushes him out of this world. This is an awesome movie!
B000000186|5.0|I remember when this album came out in 1972, there is not one bad song on it. Great album that was co-produced by George Harrison and Todd Rungren, Harrison left before the album was fully produced to do his work on the Concert for Bangladesh, then Runtgren finished it. This is one of my favorite albums ever, certainly in my top 10 of all time. yes I read what the Rolling Critic wrote way back then, I do not agree. Maybe he has had enough time to realize tah his review of this album was completely dumb.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|I saw this movie on cable,Starz to be exact.I enjoyed it,but the story line was so typical.It could have been great if someone had used their imagination.It was a little similar to \\"Fatal Attraction\\" but not exact.You see Michael Douglas really did cheat on his wife and Idris Alba's character did not.It was also very obvious that Beyonce's character was very insecure.But overall I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark drama.But what I'm trying to find out is where is the soundtrack from this movie.The music was slammin' and of course the majority of the songs that were in the movie were sung by Beyonce' and I MUST have it.So If anyone know's how I can go about obtaining the music from \\"Obsessed\\" pls let me know.Also if you really want to see Beyonce' in a much more humble role and believable rent/buy \\"The Fighting Temptations\\".Now that was a fabulous movie and the soundtrack is off the hook.Especially the cut The O'jays do that features Beyonce' and Angie Stone.The movie stars:Cuba Gooding Jr,Beyonce',Mike Epps,Little Zane,Rue Maclaahan(Golden Girls)Angie Stone,Montel Jordan and a host of other great actors/actresses.Trust me you won't be disappointed.But getting back to \\"Obsessed's\\" soundtrack drop me a line if you know something about this music.Some times it's so frustrating to hear great songs from these movies and it's so difficult to find or purchase.Maybe Amazon.com should start a division where you can find out about any musical artist on a particular movie soundtrack or at least point us in the right direction in terms of finding the artist and purchasing the songs from them directly or their label/record company.Thanking you in advance for any help on this.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I can't believe every review bashed the packaging. This complete series set is one of the best....no is the best packaging I have ever received. I am a collector & either I got something the other reviewers didn't or ? This collection is very well done. The artwork on the pages & episode info is very well done. If allowed I would give it 10 stars. All this goes without saying this was one of the best series on television. 10 STARS
B0000AQS0F|5.0|IMHO Firefly was one of the best SF shows ever.  For whatever reason this particular cast and story line, struck a chord with me that has me wondering who did the marketing.  A moron?  I had no idea this was on TV.  I saw the movie Serenity and thought that was it.  Talk about bad marketing.  A person that loves SF and isn't even aware of a really great production.  I had to find out about it myself.  If you own Serenity buy this now.  Every episode is just as good.  Same cast and excellent writing.  Did I mention excellent writing?    500 years in the future we have terraformed \\"dozens of planets and hundreds of moons\\" with the central planets forming the \\"Alliance\\" and the outer planets the \\"Independents\\".  Science and technology is advanced on the central planets however on the outer planets things are not so easy.  Imagine how would you and your best 1000 friends survive after being dropped off on an unpopulated planet.  Without any real support.  Better have a gun. :)  Imagine a wild west mentality and settings with a wide range of technology and enough \\"differences\\" to make you belive this really is the future.  Definitely not Star Trek technology nor philosopy.  Pretty much everybody is \\"really bad\\", \\"bad\\" or \\"not so bad\\" and I mean pretty much everybody.      If you watched Serenity more than a few times you won't be disappointed with Firefly.  It doesn't have a REAL ending however watch the whole series then watch Serenity again and that brings it to a nice closing.
B000O599WG|5.0|Don't expect any deep messages in this one, just pure entertainment.  Same plot as El Dorado with Dean Martin (rather than Robert Mitchum) as the drunken sheriff who must be saved and Ricky Nelson (rather than James Caan) as the young partner.  A classic Duke western with some singing by Dean and Ricky.

0743298020|5.0|I have a new favorite book! I want to read it again and again and again1!!
B002T9H2L0|2.0|There's one thing about this movie that none of the previous reviews have touched on, which is how do you know who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?   I realize that this sounds strange when talking about a Nazi movie, but it's the truth.   I always watch movies with a clean slate, meaning I suspend my reality and like to get lost in the movie's reality.  Other than the opening scence of the movie where Nazis are shooting through the floorboards of a house where a farmer  is hiding Jews, there's really nothing here to convince me to root against the Nazis.    When it comes time to intrduce us to the Basterds, there is really nothing to make me want to root for them.   There is a scene where, after a battle (which we never see)the Basterds are scalping dead Germans (which is the Basterds' trademark), they give one of the surviving Germans a chance to live if he informs on another German patrol, when he refuses to betray his countrymen, he is beaten to death with a baseball bat.   A second surviving German, an infantryman, is given the same option to inform and willingly gives up the information.   His reward?   He is allowed to live but the leader of the Basterds carves a scar into his forhead, in the shape of a swastiki, with a Bowe knife.    Latter in the movie, when one of the Allied informants (a German actress)is laying in an operating room, the leader of the Basterds sticks his figure in her open leg wound becuase he doesn't think she is giving him the correct information.    That sums up this entire movie.   There really nothing that make you want to root for either side.   You never see the Germans commiting attrocites, and you never see the Basterds doing anything but hurting people.   Would it have killed Tarantino to have a scene where the Basterds save civilons from Nazis?    I wonder if Tarantino isn't a closet Nazi lover?
B0009W5JS2|1.0|This movie stinks! What a waste of time. I hate when Hollywood tries to produce a \\"bad ass\\" movie and instead it ends up being \\"dumb ass\\"! I know it is action and fiction, but it just so over-the-top. Just watch Ice Cube as he is falling into the Potomac from a bridge still shooting. I call B.S.! However, if you don't mind killing some brain cells and enjoying something mindless and pure action, then this will be right up your alley. Otherwise, avoid at all cost.
B002SVBDYQ|2.0|I thought because Twilight's sountrack was soooo wonderful that this one would be as well. I still can't get enough of Twilight's soundtrack!! Well I bought it the day it came out and boy was I disappointed! I think the person that was in charge of picking the music for this movie should be fired! I wish I could've reviewed the music before purchasing it because I wouldn't have even bought it.  I think that's probably why they kept it so hush hush.  Especially the second to the last song, No Sound But The Wind, that sounds like some kind of old man music I can't even bare to make it through that song ever again!! I really hope someone makes better decisions for Eclipse!! I know one thing I won't buy it till I review it even if I do have to wait till they put the review option up.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|The music is wonderful.  The video is beautiful.  The DVD is a wonderful  addition to my collection.
1573220485|4.0|This is a very good read. The book allows you to escape reality & be transported to paradise. A lot of twist & turns that take you away to an exotic location halfway across the world.
B00005JPGO|5.0|Having spent time in Africa in various places and even met the guys from EO I have to say, this movie is great! Especially DiCaprio made an excellent performance and must have had an excellent language coach for the African dialect (South Afrikan dialect as well as Afrenglish of West Africa); great picture, great story, good action;
B000AS4L16|5.0|I first saw this film when it aired on PBS in 1985 and was completely bowled over by it.  First of all, the immense length of the film is enough scare one away from it, but over nine hours about the Holocaust leaves you more than a little bruised.  And the passions and feelings of so many of the people!  We will never know what the Holocaust was really like because it was something, I believe, that had to be experienced to be properly understood, so it isn't just the stories that the people being interviewed convey.  It's their feeling about what they experienced that breathes life into the stories.  This is much more effective as a film than as a written document.  The people who bare witness to the events they describe made me wonder how anyone came out of this a functioning human being.  This is a terribly important film.  Please, don't miss it.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|A must-see movie with excellent performances of DeNiro and Damon, excellent cast in general. As I like movies with more than 120 minutes, this is of course one of my favorites! Highly recommendable.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie. It shows you what an extreme talent he was and there will never be another!  He was so respected and loved by all the people involved in this project and he gave them the same in return.  He was such a kind hearted soul and a true gift from God.  It breaks my heart how he left this world but now he is at peace and Kenny Ortega should be commended for making this movie.  Thank you from one of the many MJ fans!
159562015X|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It has given me a shift in how I think, from focusing in areas in which I am not gifted, to focusing on my personal strengths, and this has given me a new found sense of self-confidence and understanding of how I can put my talents to use most efficiently in my job and life.  After you complete the online portion, the results of the analysis give a clear picture of who you can be when you focus your energy on your personal talents, and the book also offers an online support community.  For anyone who is not sure what they should be doing with their life, this book is a valuable resource.
0385737424|5.0|WHEN YOU REACH ME was a one-sitting read for me.<br /><br />Miranda lives in New York City with her mother.  She and her best friend, Sal, spend most of their time together, navigating the ins and outs of life, school, and their neighborhood.  One day when walking home from school, Sal gets punched in the stomach by an older boy who hangs out down the street from their apartment building.  Sal pulls away from Miranda after that and stops hanging out with her.  Miranda feels completely lost without him.<br /><br />Since Miranda isn't spending much time with Sal anymore, she has plenty of time to help her mother prepare for an appearance on The $20,000 Pyramid.  Miranda and Richard, her mother's boyfriend, drill her every night on different questions that could appear on the show.  Sal's mother even takes notes on the game show every day to help.<br /><br />Losing Sal's friendship bothers Miranda a lot.  Not having him to talk to is bad enough, but she really hates walking home alone.  Not only does she have to walk by the group of older boys by herself, she also has to walk past the crazy old man by the mailbox.  Then, the notes start arriving - notes telling her things about the future.<br /><br />Can Miranda trust the notes?  Can she really save the life of someone she knows by doing what they say?  You'll love following along with the mystery to find out what Miranda does, who she saves, and what the old man has to do with it.<br /><br />If you like WHEN YOU REACH ME, you need to find THE POWER OF UN by Nancy Etchemendy.  It is fantastic and shares some of the same story elements.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Karin Librarian
1401323820|1.0|This book was a major let down. As a huge fan of the TV show I was expecting great things from the book. It came off as exactly what it is-a rapidly tossed together piece of fiction from a ghostwriter trying too hard to emulate the old 1950s feel and falling flat. The dialogue was trite, characters lacked depth and the action left you begging for more...literally. The story line dragged, there was little suspense-overall, I was extremely disappointed. The only thing the book had going for it was the fact that Rook and Heat finally hooked up in the end-undoubtedly a relief to everyone watching the show and grinding their teeth at the tension between Castle and Beckett. This isn't \\"Castle,\\" however, so be prepared.
B0002B15XI|5.0|...I watched [[ASIN:B0002B15XI M*A*S*H (Widescreen Edition)]].  Not to be confused with the TV show starring Alan Alda, this is a hilarious movie with an edge.  The first motion picture film to use the F-bomb, an excellent shower scene, adultery, drinking, and general debauchery set against the backdrop of the Korean War.  I consider this a must-have for any movie lover's home collection.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Classic movie that never gets old.  I love Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in this movie.  I wish I had had a Mary Poppins when I was a child!
1401323820|2.0|I have the ability to put this book down for days. It's getting to the point where I want to read it solely for the purpose of never having to pick it up again.
0553582461|1.0|As with Hobb's previous Fitz series, she cannot figure out how to bring a story line to an end without great bouts of paraphrasing. That aside, there are way too many reasons to question the reasons why the characters are stuck on her adventure.  There's no good reason for the Farseers to bind themselves to the Outishlanders. They have nothing to offer trade wise, they're not consolidated so marrying one clan does squat to guarantee the others will follow, there's a MUCH better offer from another \\"country\\" to bind themselves too and great reasons to go with it, and barely any of the characters have an interest in this driving force of the whole story.  Kill a dragon? A 15 year old heir to the throne is going to be allowed by his mother, their advisors, the nobles, EVERYONE to run off to kill a huge monster in \\"fair\\" combat by himself? Pathetic.  We once again get a tale of long irritating trips, lots of talking and chances to whine, and even in the interpersonal drama plenty of plot holes and reasons not to believe the choices Hobb makes. I utterly regret reading this series not just for the failed plot but the idiocy of the characters decisions. I'm not just talking about a few of them, in this one they all seem to be stupid. Perhaps Hobb included a half-wit to make the other characters seem smarter.  Don't bother with this book unless you adored all the others. It's another great step down.
0307269981|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire by Stieg Larrson is a totally gripping book.  I simply could not put it down!<br /><br />I cannot wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
0553381687|5.0|The writing is seemless and powerful. Every character seems given just the right amount of attention and they have personalities outside the cookie cutters. As with real people's lives, there isn't a clear cut end or complete resolution in the end (in any of this series) however I find satisfaction in seeing the characters progress through the intrigues. The story rings of the historical while very occasionally peppering you with the concept of mystical forces the might be real. Well worth your time to read for a taste of reality in your fantasy.
0810979772|5.0|My 11 yr.old son, really enjoyed reading The Diary of A Wimpy Kid series.  It is great, because he really doesn't read much on his own.  He only reads on his own, when he has to for school.  With these books, he picks them up on his own.  I enjoy watching him read.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|There isn't much new on this CD so if you own other CD's of MJ's you aren't going to get a bunch of new music.  However, disc 2, including the reading of his poem and the song This is It is worth the purchase price of this CD alone.    In addition, the CD's come in a book like case.  There are great pictures.  My daughter really loves looking at each of the pages.  For myself, I am not all that sold on those pictures--they are a nice touch, however, I wouldn't buy the CD for that alone.    Planet Earth is the poem Michael wrote and recorded and it gives me the chills.  Absolutely worth the purchase just for that.  Although I would have to say that This is It, the song is worth the purchase as well.    RIP MJ

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Even if you saw the movie, the extras are worth buying the DVD for.  Can't speak for the blu ray--it may even have more.    It is amazing to see Michael Jackson work, his level of passion, care, gentleness.  Michael the performer is awesome, unmatched.  Michael as the person working with dancers and others in his concert is beautiful to see too.  He loved his craft, and he wanted others to as well.  And he was very willing to teach.    Despite what people said about this upcoming tour, he does not appear to be someone distressed about performing--no, he seems to be brought alive by it.  And he seems so comfortable in his body.      I am glad to own this DVD and piece of magic of Michael.  It is great to see behind the scenes things.  I just wish there was another version coming out that was the actual tour.  How sad that the tour will not happen.  And at least we have this.    My 10 year old is now a big Michael Jackson fan and although she doesn't sit still for long, she watched the whole dvd.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Anyone who likes board games or games in general should enjoy this.  Kids 5 and up (maybe even younger) could figure this out and play it and have a great time.  As some have mentioned, it isn't for 3 players although there is a way to play it like this.  It is best with 2 or 4 people.<br /><br />We've played this game many times and it is a favorite of everyone. I'd recommend the Blokus Trigon too. I think it is slightly more interesting as a game but the geometric shapes in this version are probably more fun for younger players.<br /><br />I can't recommend this game enough.
0307473473|1.0|The cover drew me in as did the first few pages.  I was hoping for a well written, interesting book, but got neither.  Should have read the back page hype from Glamor \\"A sexy, addictive thriller\\".  There's sex and a mystery, but they're neither one addictive.  The female protagonist is a young anorexic hacker and is missing through half the story!  This is a long drawn out pedantic wandering disguised as a \\"thriller\\".  Could have been a good story if reduced by 50%.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|For many days now I have lingered on this film. I recently rented it off of Netflix, and I was stunned by how much it moved me. For the longest time I avoided seeing this film, because I was afraid of how I would feel about it. Not for it's subject matter, I have sat through and enjoyed many gay themed films. I feared more that this was just another over-hyped oscar winning dissapointment, Like so many other oscar winners over the past few decades. Personally I was deeply moved by this film.  There are very many lessons to be learned from Brokeback Mountain. Not necessarily about homosexuality, but about the nature of love itself. Brokeback Mountain makes you realize how powerful a force like love is. It can create such beauty and passion. Yet at the same time destroy lives with the intensity of a furious hurricane. The main thing I liked about the picture, is that it doesn't take sides. Every character in this film is a victim. Jack and Ennis are both lonely and miserable, while Alma and Lureen have to suffer through infidelity and loveless marriages. They could have easily turned this film into a mockery of itself, although people make fun of it anyway, it never made a wrong turn for me.<br /><br />The performances are revolutionary. I really agree with people who put Heath Ledger's performance up there with Brando. He completly embodied Ennis Del Mar, the way Charlize Theron embodied Aileen Wurnos in \\"Monster. The moment where he breaks down in the alleyway after Jack left just really tears you up. Saying that, I have to say as great as Jake Gyllenhaal was in this film, I did think he was bit overshadowed by Ledger. But I really loved the way that you could guess what he was feeling just from his facial expressions. One scene that comes to mind, is the one where he is dancing with Lureen and you can see this sadness in his eyes as he turns away from her, like he is pining for something pining for Ennis.<br />Michelle Williams is an incredible actress, I've seen her in Wendy and Lucy and Synechdoche,NY, and it amazes me that she hasn't gotten more recognition then she's already recieved, the moment when she see's Ennis from the porch she shows such a genuine reaction.This was also a huge breakout movie for Anne Hathaway, who before had only been known for playing disney princesses.<br /><br />Out of all the films Ang Lee has directed this is probably my favorite of his, or at least tied with The Ice Storm. It amazes me how versatile  he continues to be from doing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Sense & Sensibility. I recently heard that he was set to do the Film adaptation of \\"Life of Pi\\" and if it is anywhere as good as this adaptation of Annie Proulx's story(which is worth a look) then I will be eternally grateful.y and Lucy and Synechdoche,NY, and it amazes me that she hasn't gotten more recognition then she's already recieved, the moment when she see's Ennis from the porch she shows such a genuine reaction.This was also a huge breakout movie for Anne Hathaway, who before had only been known for playing disney princesses.

0312370849|2.0|I felt this book was written by an American tourist in Paris who stumbled across a plaque commemorating the Vel d'Hiv and thought, \\"wow, this would make a great book.\\" Hence, you have a modern narrator who stumbles across Sarah's story, and thereafter we trade off chapters in modern day and WWII. The writing itself is very forced and distracting, using colloquialisms that seem out of place for its characters (who uses the term \\"beau\\" for boyfriend, especially if the character is from Boston?). The characters themselves lack the specificity of good writing--a brother-in-law is \\"a successful lawyer,\\" her husband is \\"an architect\\" but none of the specific qualities that make the characters unique. As a result, the historical elements shine over the modern-day, which seem quite shoehorned into a plotline. I was a few steps ahead of the plot at every turn, as the main character conveniently happened to run into exactly the person she needed to in order to advance the plot. The ending ultimately came as little surprise. Along the lines of Dan Brown, there are certainly interesting elements of story here, but the writing is far too distracting to make this worth even 3 stars for me.
0679420266|4.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus, a winner of Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. Originally written in French and published in 1942. Although it was then translated by Matthew Ward and was published in 1988. I describe this book as philosophical crime fiction, in that it makes you really think about what's happening. Understanding it is difficult because of the actions that the characters take and which come off very mysterious.  With 123 pages, no pictures except the ones you can imagine in your head.       Three people that really stand out in the story are Meursault, Raymond Sintes, and Marie Cardona. Meursault is a type of person who lives for the day and tries to make it as wonderful as possible. Knowing him, he doesn't worry about the future to much or think before he takes action. As for Raymond, he beats his mistress and her brother becomes a conflict. Raymond is the cause of Meursault's downfall, because he gives him the gun that later kills his mistress's brother. Originally Raymond just wanted to use Meursault, but in the end they ended up trusting each other, which they both gained a friend. Marie is in love with Meursault. Inside she wants to marry him, although he feels indifferent about it but that doesn't run her away. She remains loyal to him even when he goes to court. She is known as the mixed blessing in his life.      The main problem of the story is a murder. It starts out with Meursault receiving a telegram explaining that his mother has died. He travels to Algiers, to attend his mother's funeral but he doesn't remember much of it. The day after the funeral he goes to the beach for a swim and runs into Marie Cardona, a former co-worker. They make plans that evening to see a movie, then they stay the night together when he awakes Marie is nowhere to be seen, so he sits on his balcony and watches people go by. The following day he returns to work, on his way home to his apartment he runs into his neighbor Raymond, he invites him in for dinner. Overdinner Raymond brags about beating up his mistress because she cheated on him and he got in a fight with her brother. He wants to torment her more but he needs Meursault to write her a letter telling her to come back, so he agrees to do so. Marie later comes and visits Meursault, they hear shouting and the police show up and arrest Raymond for beating his mistress. Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf so he agrees to do so.      Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her and he replies indifferently and says if you want to we can so they become engaged. Bringing Raymond with them to a friends beach house, where they run into the Arabs, one of which is Raymond's mistress' brother, a fight breaks out and Raymond gets stabbed, they leave to go treat it. When returning to go find the Arabs again Raymond thinks about shooting them but Meursault stops him and takes the gun. Meursault then returns to the spring to cool off when he shoots Raymond's mistress' brother for no reason. He's then arrested and thrown into jail. Meursault is heartless. He is asked to put his faith in God but refuses to do so. Adapting to prison life pretty well he keeps his mind of the things he always had. Usually by sleeping most of the day.      Meursault is taken to court. During the trial the subjects shifted from the murder to a discussion of his own character. Many people were called upon to testify, although they all attested to his lack of grief and tears. Because of his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society the prosecutor calls him a monster. Sentenced to death by beheading. He is given one more chance to turn to god but gets angry and refuses to. Believing he is right in living in a meaningless world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. Which he abandons all hope for the future and accepts the \\"gentle indifference of the world.\\" This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy.     As we look back on thisbook it didn't really have a great meaning to it. Although it kind of did. It's sad to think that many people in our world think this way. Life is meaningless and they can just kill anyone who makes them upset, but you can't do that. We need to learn to tolerate people, you can be sad or mad but you just can't take it out on people who have done nothing to you for no reason. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this book to teenagers because they could think wrong about it. Besides that I think it is a good book that you really have to think about and understand the concepts.
B00000FYIL|5.0|This soundtrack is a perfect companion for the story and the time period.  The music is both passionate and sweet, mysterious and filled with glee.  You can imagine the story unfolding as you listen to this soundtrack.  Definitely worth the buy.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|The basics of this movie has been done several times before but just with a little twist.  Two people pretending to be engaged for ulterior motives.  Betty White stole the movie -- she was great.  I was very disappointed in Sandra Bullock doing a nude scene -  she's too good of an actress to have to do that.  She is the boss lady and her visa is up so she needs to either marry an American or be deported.  Naturally, the latter is not to her liking so she enlists the (unwilling) assistance of her assistant.  As part of the ploy they have to visit his family for his grandmother's birthday (played by Betty White).  At first his family is a little too country for the sophisticated boss lady but as she gets to know them, she takes another look at her too structured and perfect life and decides that she likes them.  The usual last minute detractors pop up but all's well that ends well.  Sandra Bullock could have done better.
B0001HAISG|5.0|What a perfect movie!  This is the beloved children's story that I think has never truly been done justice until now.  The movie is perfectly cast, perfectly acted, and the soundtrack is the most magical music you've ever heard.  Every scene will draw you more into this lovely story.  With a slight twist on the friendship between Peter and Wendy, and amazing special effects, this story comes to life in a way that only the magic of film-making can accomplish.  This is not just a children's movie! Families and couples everywhere can appreciate the magic spell cast by \\"Peter Pan.\\"
0545123267|3.0|Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater  Book review     Grace has always felt a strange connection with the wolves after they attacked her.  She felt a special connection, however, with the yellow-eyed wolf that saved her. Six years later, after another attack on a boy from her school, Grace finds a yellow-eyed boy lying on her back porch, shot.  She instantly knows it's her wolf, and rushes to save him.  While Grace and her wolf, Sam, get to know each other, and grow more in love, Sam finds it more and more difficult to tell her that as soon as it gets too cold, he'll turn back into a wolf.  Permanently. Grace, dealing with uncaring parents and friend troubles, now has a girl claiming she's seen her dead brother, Jack, the boy who was attacked by wolves, alive. She believes Grace can help her because of Grace's connection with the wolves.  The only problem is Grace is not supposed to tell anyone about the werewolves.  Sam, while struggling to stay human  and making his limited time with Grace as best it can be, also takes on the responsibility of finding Jack, who turned into a werewolf.  When Sam finds him, Jack insists there must be a cure, because Grace was bitten, and she never changed.   Will they find a cure, or will Sam be lost to the wolves forever?   I thought Shiver was OK.  At times it got a little boring, but then there were really exciting parts, mostly when one of the wolves from Sam's pack would come.  I thought some of it was a little predictable.  I also couldn't really connect with the character of Grace.  She didn't seem very real and  I couldn't tell if she was supposed to be smart, or sort of ditzy. I enjoyed the way the author told the story as both Sam and Grace, but I liked reading as Sam more because you read about some of his past, and you can tell how it has affected him in the present.  I don't think the author made the story very convincing, especially the way Grace fell in love with Sam while he was a wolf. I have to say, I am getting sick of thevampire/werewolf fantasy romances.   I would give this book a 6 ½ because it was a little boring, predictable, and I feel like there are a lot of other books like this.  I think it was just too much of a romance for my taste.  I think this book would be good for girls 12 or 13 and up, because there's a lot of kissing. I think anyone who is interested in Twilight would like Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater. Maybe they'll even like it more.         By Kiaora
0061537969|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. As an animal lover/owner I couldn't help but relate. A friend of mine has a older sick dog and this book helped them to be more understanding.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Boring, badly written, badly acted, historically and artistically false; this movie isn't even good enough to be a comic book. Brad Pitt is laughable, although he is looking surprisingly haggard. The only interesting part was trying to figure out why it's so hyped.  I guess some people can't stop beating up on their dead enemies.
0316096199|2.0|After reading many of the great reviews here, I was eager to get my hands on this book - I rushed to Borders and bought it brand new.  The first couple of chapters were great, but then I lost interest.  Still, I continued reading in hopes that the story would pick up pace, provide more personality and emotions.  Instead, I found the tone of the book to be dull and boring.  I gave up reading after page 145 (out of 243 pages).  I had more fun in traffic school than reading this book.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Everybody hates this album... broken lyrics, broken people, too much introspection, overproduced---nope.  It's painful. And it's brilliant. I don't know how he wrote all of these very sad and painful, gut wrenching songs.  Easy to toss it off, but this is sorrow that we have all felt and BECK CONVEYS IT COMPLETELY AND WITHOUT MERCY.  This is merciless personal bloodletting. It absolutely brought me to tears. It's extreme and at times over produced.  But most of the time it's just digging directly into the part of my soul, the human soul that matters, the soul that's terrified of the next painful cut, the loss, the one perfect woman that walked away, the imperfect parents that are now children in my eyes--all stability and attachment wrenched away, say hello to personal desolation...    I tried to find Guthrie, Dylan, the great folk artists  of the 1960's like Fred Neil (who I really love - wrote \\"Everybody's Talkin' at Me and \\"The Dolphins\\") Nope. This is original introspection and fear, written with some of the greatest acoustic guitar licks that push it forward into future standalone territory. It's goddamned genius. Listen to it - all of it. Draw your own conclusions. I doubt you'll hate it. You may sense an element of commercialism toward the end (which, BTW, fails) Why do I love this album. It's very simple...it dragged me through almost every emotion I am capable of feeling. And so few musical productions lately can elicit that kind of response--especially in a fairly jaded (near) 50 year old.    Just listen to it. No amount of page text can ever do it justice.    And, no, it's not the Holy Grail either!

1563890119|4.0|Both Gaiman and his editor readily admit that these first issues of The Sandman are more conventional than the later run of the series, and it's not a comment I disagree with. By the same token, I think both underplay the pleasures to be had from this volume, in which Gaiman takes his first steps with the character and begins to establish a rich and complex cosmology that I can't wait to see develop. Even in the midst of a story about a supervillain who has one of Sandman's gems, Gaiman spins a unique and horrific tale called \\"24 Hours,\\" in which a group of people slowly deteriorate into madness and violence. Still, nothing quite prepares you for the collection's final tale, \\"The Sound of Her Wings,\\" which introduces Death and provides not only a sense of where the series will be going, but also the distanced, fascinating way it regards humanity. I haven't read much of what's to come, and I don't doubt that this first volume may not be as groundbreaking as the later ones, but that in no way diminishes the inventiveness and rich world on display here.

B002I9Z8DK|5.0|Now before I get into the review, I must make a disclaimer: I am a Trekkie.  Always have been, always will be.  Star Trek is a flourishing franchise that gives a positive outlook on our future.  The characters are compelling, the stories speak to us, and we grow as these memorable people on the screen do.<br />Now on to the movie.  Star Trek 6 is probably my second favorite of the \\"Original Series Movies,\\" with number one being Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.  The reason for this is simple: we see these characters at their best.  The chemistry they have with each other is astounding, and is evident as only a tried-and-true cast of talented professionals can provide.  One can sense the feeling of family from this cast.  The story is fantastic, too.  A chance at peace, a frame-up, deception, intrigue, appropriate comedy, and of course, the cast kicking ass like we love watching them do.  I always get a nice feeling of nostalgia and comfort after watching this movie.<br />The Blu-Ray of this film is remarkable (although that can be said about all of the Star Trek Blu-Ray series).  There are hours of extras, and it's fun watching them all.  The deleted scenes are in there, too.  The picture is very crisp, although I can't review what it would look like on an HD TV as I still have an analog.  But even on the analog it looks great.<br />In my opinion, a must buy for even the casual fan of Star Trek.  Just pop in the Blu-ray, sit on your favorite Lay-Z-Boy or couch, relax and watch one of the best Star Trek films ever made.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Where do we begin?<br /><br />Three years ago, movie-goers wouldn't dare touch a Batman movie. I mean, what happened? Did you get your act together and deliver us one of the best bat-flicks ever?<br /><br />Seems so.<br /><br />And now you've done it again . . . times ten!<br /><br />Batman has made a difference in Gotham. Criminals are running scared. Underworld organizations are toppling. He has indeed become the symbol he set out to be.<br /><br />Now a psychotic clown-faced criminal is tearing his way through the Gotham City underworld, quickly establishing himself as the Clown Prince of Crime. His method: death, and lots of it. His motive: madness. But is he crazy? As he would say, \\"I'm not. No, I'm not.\\" And he's right. He's not crazy. This man--this \\"Joker\\"--is brilliant, and if he gets his way, Gotham will fall into his hands.<br /><br />Unless Batman can stop him.<br /><br />The Joker's reign of terror starts in the underworld but reaches deep into Gotham's social structure, various men strategically placed throughout the police, mayoral offices, everywhere. And they listen to him. Except for Gotham's White Knight, Harvey Dent, the do-gooding District Attorney who's dedicated himself to cleaning up Gotham and taking down the crime syndicates that have oppressed it for so long.<br /><br />Death reigns supreme in this movie. People die, and Batman is faced with the hard choice of becoming that which he hates . . . or risk losing Gotham and those he loves to this madman.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Going into this thing back in 2008, and despite the crazy good trailers for The Dark Knight, I wasn't sure if Batman Begins could be beat or even tied. Batman Begins was what put serious superhero flicks back on the map in a big, big way. It was what restored the faith of us fans in DC Comics and gave us hope that they'd start the journey to taking down their number one competitor at the box office, Marvel. And with Superman Returns being just plain poopy, I hoped against hope they'd at least get Batman right a second time.<br /><br />And they did. They so did and me and everyone in that theatre were gushing with joy that not only was The Dark Knight as good as Batman Begins, it was even better.<br /><br />Christian Bale delivered another solid performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. The new suit rocked hard. Loved the detail. Though he was less buff than the previous film--why? who knows? You'd think a crimefighter would maintain a fitness regime--he did a great job differentiating between the boring and dull playboy Bruce Wayne and the rage-filled-justice-driven Batman. My only issue was the voice. In Batman Begins, it was gruff, cool and tough. In this one, he sounded like he was growling the whole time and he had to force the words out to make them all gravelly. (And, FYI, WB, Batman's voice doesn't have to be like he's talking through pebbles and sand; Kevin Conroy proved that.)<br /><br />Heath Ledger's Joker was utterly amazing. Creepy. Gothic. Funny, but not comical (like Jack Nicholson's was). Eerie, disturbed, crazy--delicious. What I loved the most was two things 1) the clown make up was just that: make up. At first I didn't like this idea and wanted the Joker to have been a victim of an acid bath ala his comics backstory, but after watching the movie, I see why they went this route. Bringing us to 2) Joker was a genius. It was his brilliant criminal mind that enabled him to quickly establish himself as a powerful evil force in Gotham and the make up was his edge in doing that both in a scary-because-I'm-crazy way, but also it made others think he was merely a lunatic in turn making them drop their guard so he could move in.<br /><br />Once more, I really dug Gary Oldman's James Gordon and seeing him officially become commissioner in this was cool.<br /><br />Likewise Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and, eventually, Two-Face--hey, he did a good job on both sides of the, um, coin. My only thing with Two-Face in this flick was that I wasn't expecting him to show up. I thought this movie would establish the Harvey Dent character in turn setting him up to become Two-Face in the next one. So, yeah, that part was a bit rushed but them's the breaks.<br /><br />I enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes. Maggie's kind and cute, but can be rough and touch when she needs to. Worked well for Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, especially when that twist came that changed Rachel's future forever.<br /><br />My only other little quibble was the whole bat-sonar thing. That was venturing into Batman Forever territory and we all know how that one turned out, but the positives of this movie more than make up for the couple of minor issues I had with it.<br /><br />This movie is just tremendously good. Good fighting. Good story. Good stuff.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />A.P. Fuchs<br />Canister Xthe Harvey Dent character in turn setting him up to become Two-Face in the next one.

B002X20W2E|4.0|To be honest, I was really disappointed when I saw Rihanna debuting her first couple of singles on various awards shows, and I was worried her latest album would be a disappointment, especially after her excellent last album. I got it on sale on Amazon because it was just too cheap to pass on, but I've found myself loving it more and more with each listen. Whew! It's not quite as dance club friendly as the last album, but it is very well done, and there's a heart and soul here that wasn't quite as prevalent in previous efforts. She's come a long way since Pon De Replay!

The first couple tracks are OK (not great, no really good hooks)but there is an oddly placed love song which clearly should not be there.  Then head crusher came on and the imagry the shared was so repulsive that it started making me sick to think about.  Political viewpoints - OK, terror overview of nuclear destruction - OK, describing torture in detail - not OK.  I thought this guy was a born again?  What the heck was that?  I will not listen to this album again and I will not go see them when they come by with Slayer later this year.

It inspired me to write my first book [[ASIN:1905430973 Stone Soup: The Secret Recipe for Making Something from Nothing]] and while Malcolm Gladwell's work in [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]] hints at some of the goings on in our brains The Talent code demonstrates what is really going on when we get good at something and it also demonstrates how a moment of inspiration can leed to a lifelong passion that looks like pure talent on the outside but belies the deep practice on the inside.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to do something new, anyone who works with children or is a parent and anyone who wants to be world class at something need to buy this book.
B0000048CX|5.0|I had never heard this band before, so I previewed this CD on Amazon, and really enjoyed their sound. Since I have never heard the original versions of these songs before (except maybe two), I can't really compare how they sound, but to my ears, these versions are great! A big thumbs up from me.
0385342020|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the latest Sophie Kinsella book, Twenties Girl. The main character and narrator, Lara, is sweet, funny, and trying to navigate her way through her late \\"twenties\\" when she discovers that she is the only one who can see or hear the ghost of her recently departed great aunt Sadie, who appears as a flapper from the 1920s as a twenty-three year old. (I am not usually a big fan of paranormal plot lines but Kinsella delivers this in a great, unique way that is not cheesy or spooky.) Lara and Sadie form a hilarious relationship (Sadie mostly badgers Lara to do her bidding and encourages Lara to take the reins of her own life as well) from the start that turns into love and respect for one another by the end of the novel.    The story has a little bit of everything: chick lit, ghost story, mystery, comedy, romance, and the importance of family... written in Kinsella's classically humorous and breezy style. It also portrays elderly adults in such a sweet manner, reminding readers that everyone was young and vibrant at a point in their lives and that even as a person ages and people view them as \\"old,\\" they may think of themselves as young, carefree and fun as they were in earlier times of their lives.     I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book and sad to see it end. I think it is a must read whether you have never read Kinsella's books or are a long-time fan. Happy reading!
B002UZCJP2|3.0|Decent fun made better by Bruce.  SURROGATES is a decent movie that is largely unorginal but fun to watch.  The point of the movie is solid and Bruce shows us that he is still a great action star.  Enjoy.
B002PMV9K6|1.0|This DVD was so dark in parts that I felt I was looking at a blank screen, I know the subject matter was dark but it would have been nice to see what was going on. The other Harry Potter DVD's managed to convey the dread felt by Harry without such gloomy film. The producer and director obviously tried the old way of Film Noir and it just was annoying. I hope the last Harry Potter will be more visible.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|This took my surprise re: how good it was. It's also a great family film. Lots to discuss and ponder. Sam Rockwell is a amazing actor. I'm not sure if he was nominated for an academy award for this, but he should've been. I very highly recommend this!

B0012Z361C|5.0|I tried to find the DVD Vivere: Live in Tuscany, with Andrea Bocelli, but 3 bookstores didn't carry it, so I was thrilled to purchase it on Amazon.  My boyfriend and I watched it together and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The songs were gorgeous, the setting was phenomenal, and the different entertainers in addition to Bocelli were top-notch.  I'd highly recommend it!  Well worth your time and money.  Carol Joy Goldstein-Hall  Author of:  Creating Your Life as a Blessing (for purchase on Amazon)
6305537313|3.0|The item arrived in good condition, however, the description claimed that it was in brand new packaging, when in fact it was a new cover, with new shrink wrap --which anyone can do, and the art card was so generic! And to top it all off, the DVD was scratched.     There is just no way that this was a new DVD.     On a good note, it plays well and it arrived in a timely manner and it was inexpensive.
1591843162|5.0|I know that personally, this book really resonated with me. I'm in a position where my boss IS giving me the encouragement and freedom to THINK and make things happen. But, honestly, I've been too scared to take that leap, put myself on the edge, and be accountable for making some meaningful change. And man, it really is tiring to be a \\"cog,\\" as Seth so aptly puts it. Instead, I love those days when I feel that I've been able to give a part of my \\"gift\\" and expressed myself as an \\"artist\\" within my craft. So why do I fight it? Why do we resist being ourselves so much, when doing so is one of the only ways to feel that genuine satisfaction at the end of the day?    Seth nails this thesis with great arguments, and makes sure you really get it by the end of the book by proving it from every angle. But it's neither redundant nor pejorative: he writes with authority and urgency to call each one of us to action, to bring forth only our best. We are the only ones who can give our unique gift, and if we don't give it, no one else can... or will. \\"It's up to you.\\" (125)

0316069906|5.0|A friend of mine always says a prayer for the animals on cattle trucks as she passes them by in her car. I thought that was nice but I had no idea. Around the Holiday season on the the Ellen DeGeneres Show a young man named Jonathan Safran Foer told about his book, \\"Eating Animals.\\"[[ASIN:0316069906 Eating Animals]] I still had no idea what this book was about and where this book was going to take me. I know animals are being slaughtered but I had no idea what kind of life they were living and what really goes on behind the closed doors of the factory farms. I would defend my pets to the end like my own children...I can't stand the thought of any animals in the Wilderness being hunted and killed...but some how the very animals I had eaten all my life were being overlooked! Feeling guilty I purchased this book and I made myself read every gut-wrenching word.     This was the most difficult book I have ever read in my life!    No book has ever moved me the way this book did and make me realize how much cruelty is inflicted on these poor beasts everyday in our own country, the very animals that are sacrificing their lives so we may eat them. It just seems so unreal but this is NOT a fairy tale, Mr. Foer has facts to back everything up. He has given space in his book for the factory farm workers to tell their horror stories too. How can one eat another animal after reading his book? I know I can't...and I won't!    [[ASIN:1432731033 Mud Witch Boy of Ghost Canyon]]
B002UD56I6|5.0|I sat down to watch THIS IS IT, the concert film of Michael Jackson made of regular and dress rehearsal footage, I was skeptical. Yes, Jackson was a talented song writer and performer, but in the past year he'd achieved near sainthood from his fans. It was as if all the accusations concerning him had been pushed aside and forgotten.<br /><br />I don't know if any of them were true. I don't know if people were paid off. For all any of us know, save for those directly involved, nothing ever happened. By the same token, knowing of all of these items, you have to reflect on them. And all of that comes rushing in while watching this film though indirectly.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the music and the videos released over the years by Michael Jackson, I was never one of those die hard fans. I didn't rush out to buy each new CD or DVD. I never sat glued to the TV set when word leaked about a new video being released. All that changed after watching this release.<br /><br />So what IS the film all about? Is it simply a concert on film? It's more than that. What we have here is a glimpse behind the scenes in snippets that culminate in a concert film. The movie shows hiring dancers for the show, has interviews with everyone from these dancers to the musicians and shows us Jackson in the midst of trying to make an experience for his fans to enjoy.<br /><br />Had this show gone on to be performed, it would have been a spectacle to behold. Not an over the top one, but a total package of entertainment that combined dance, vocals and music unlike most concerts ever performed. The stage is there to be seen, the movements watched and the music floating from the speakers to immerse you in the experience that would have been.<br /><br />Beginning with \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", the pulsing sound of the bass and drums kicks into full gear providing a beat that I challenge anyone not to start toe tapping to. Jackson does the usual animated moves he was known for, the somewhat herky jerky motions and glides across the floor that he created and a generation followed and copied. And while these moves seem a bit repetitive at times, to see a talent like Jackson who can make it seem to fluid, so easy, is a sight to behold. Had he chosen to do so, you wonder if he could have been the next major musical film star ala Gene Kelly.<br /><br />The songs that follow are combined with the interview footage shot during the rehearsals. We get a glimpse of Jackson working with the musicians to get the tempos correct, the sound right and the music just the way he wanted it to be when he would perform. All the while he seems calm and cordial, thanking each person as they go, offering a \\"God bless you\\" here and there and commenting more than once \\"This is why we rehearse.\\"<br /><br />Songs included in this showcase include \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\", Jackson Five songs like \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", and \\"I'll Be There\\". Also featured are \\"Thriller\\" (no way could this have been left out), \\"Black or White\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\" and more.<br /><br />Along with the concert footage is some of the film pieces that were to have played in the background on a giant screen during the show. The biggest of these pieces involve a black and white segment imposing Jackson in an old Bogart movie for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and a newly formed opening featuring his dancers in complete make up for \\"Thriller\\" which ends with a giant spider crawling on stage from which Jackson would emerge.<br /><br />As I said earlier, you watch this film and are filled with a wide range of emotions. The one that surfaces at once is the feeling that Jackson is sometimes hard to look at after the changes he made to himself. But that leads to the next, a feeling of sadness seeing a man who had no chance at a normal life, who was never allowed to grow like a normal child to an adult.<br /><br />There is a caring side to Michael Jackson no matter how many documentaries captured the strange behaviors seen on occasion. There is a man inside the machine who could capture a crowd with ease. But most of all there is an incredible talent on view in this film that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />I sat down expecting to see another lionization of Michael Jackson, placing him on a pedestal that no mere mortal should achieve. What I ended with was the chance to see an amazing talent who passed away without a chance to continue. I was moved by this film, enjoyed it from start to finish and walked away feeling that this was a more fitting tribute to the man than the media circus that was his funeral.<br /><br />Looking here I noticed there were no negative reviews of this DVD. That's something quite rare for any review site. But it says a lot about this release.<br /><br />THIS IS IT, is not just a film that should be rented. It is one that belongs in your collection. And if you are fortunate enough to have large screen and/or surround capabilities, sit back and hold on to your hats and try not to move to the beat.There is a man inside the machine who could capture a crowd with ease.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is a fantastic watch. I had not been introduced into the dark and twisted world of Dexter Morgan. The wife and I watched th entire season over the corse of two days. Both evenings, like clockwork as soon as we both set down for dinner it was Dexter and Dexter alone that kept our company. I have just ordered season 2 and we are ready for it to arrive so that we may continue in our disturbing journey of murder and discovery.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|As a young girl I read Jane Eyre, and although it is not my favorite British book I have always enjoyed it.  I have seen just about every film version staring actors including; Welles and Fontaine, Timothy Dalton, Findlay and Hinds, and Hurt and Gainsbourg. Not only does this new version follow the book closely (only ommitting a few scenes from Jane's childhood such as the cutting of Helen's hair, the kind teacher, and the kind doctor), but it also exemplifies the fine acting associated with the BBC. Toby Stephens, whom I adored in A Twelth Night with Imogen Stubbs and Helena B-Carter, gave a stellar performance as the witty, \\"changable,\\" and passionate Mr. Rochester. Ruth Wilson was a pleasant surprise both as an actress and as a shell for Jane. She is a bit plain when she is trying to fit her \\"station,\\" but she sparkles when animated by happiness, depression, passion, and wrath. If you love Jane Eyre or enjoy literature of this period you will love this rendition.
0446567337|2.0|I picked up the book Dear John after seeing the romantic and exciting commercials on tv. After falling in love with the movie the notebook I tried to read the novel but it didn't excite me like the movie did. So after that fail I was wary when picking up Dear John. Although it was a smoother read (in my opinion) than the Notebook, the relationship between main characters John and Savannah was difficult to root for. With only a couple encounters together, half of them being arguments, and Johns determination to make this \\"love\\" work, I just wasn't buying it. The depth of all their conversations are equivalent to those held on a typical first date, leaving me wondering how shallow John is that he can already know she is the only woman he will ever want. By the end I was hoping Savannah would move on and do something better with her life and maybe we could read about that! I wish the author could have given the characters a little more depth, a little more of a connection, and more of a reason for us to care!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Take a venerated Sci-Fi Classic and add new CGI effects. What do you get? Star Trek 2.0!    The Bluray edition of STTOS is simply top notch. Apart from the enhanced CGI effects, the audio has been given a multichannel channel treatment (making it enormously better, but don't be expecting audio that's anything like The Dark Knight or Lord of the Rings). The picture, already immaculate in previous releases for a 40 year old show, has been remastered and cleaned up to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine you're watching something from 1966.    The main menu, somewhat confusing, nevertheless contains a plethora of interesting options and facts. The most interesting of these is when an episode is played along with a video/audio commentary that utilizes picture-in-picture to demonstrate exactly how much effort has gone into the remastered series by showcasing new special effects and also the rationale for including some effects and not others (the producers exercised enormous restraint in not going crazy with massive CGI space battles, now made possible by new technology). The most impressive thing about these commentaries is the realization that everyone did their utmost to preserve the original vision of the directors and writers.    Now on to the CGI effects... the most obvious difference is that the Enterprise has been rendered in full CGI and replaced in all exterior shots. In addition, planets have been rendered in glorious detail (often designed from dialogue cues about the atmosphere, storms, etc. when Spock gives an analysis), and phaser fire has been cleaned up somewhat. Explosions have become more dramatic, and in some cases, extra actors have been digitally inserted into the frame to enhance a backdrop (similar to what Lucas did in the Star Wars Special Editions). The Enterprise viewscreen is also enhanced, with such seemingly minor details as showing the Enterprise nacelles when moving away from a planet. These touches really help us to spend less time commenting on the cheesy special effects and more time enjoying the immersion into the Star Trek universe. One of the best additions can be found in Season 2's Amok Time, when the first shot of Vulcan includes a panoramic version of the surface. It's an extraordinary establishing shot which lends atmosphere to the proceedings. Wondering what the big deal is? Use the ANGLE button on your remote control to switch seamlessly between old and new special effects, and you'll get your answer!    Thanks to these enhancements, the Bluray edition of Star Trek The Original Series provides an experience akin to watching an entirely new show. And yet, the cheese factor still exists in the form of the occasionally silly plots (Spock's Brain, anyone?) and. the. wonderfully. enigmatic. delivery. of.... William-Shatner! A must see and must buy for any Trek fan, even if you own previous releases. There is simply so much to love in this new box set.
0393061310|5.0|What is really amazing in this book is how the author managed to present his ideas in only 500 pages. Usually 500 pages are a lot, especially if the book is bad. However, this book is about the evolution of different societies in different places on the earth. The book attempts (and succeeds) to explain why some people moved forward while others stayed stuck in their places. Such a feat requires much more than 500 pages, but Jared Diamond pulled it off without sacrificing the readability or the scientific rigor of his book. This is without a doubt one of the most important books that I have read. The author deals a huge blow to racist interpretations of human evolution and progression. Even though some people would think any kind of determinism is degrading to humanity, one can hardly argue that our environment (be it culture, land, language, beliefs...etc) plays a huge role in shaping our future. This is not the first time that someone has used environmental determinism as an argument to human behavior, but the data and quality of the arguments used in this book are definitely the best used so far. Yet the book is still readable by all. Kudos to the author.
B0029RQE84|5.0|We are very pleased and totally enamored of Mark Knopfler's work. He is an awesome musician, endlessly versatile and always exciting! This CD is no exception! We really enjoyed the DVD tour of his studio. He surrounds himself with the best of the best...!
1400067936|4.0|I think that it is important to review a book by concentrating on its coherency, strength of its ideas and originality. Whether a person agrees with the author or not should not be a factor. This is why I give this book four stars although I do not completely agree with the author.  This book raises some very interesting points and is in many ways an eye opener. Bookshops are filled with books about the \\"characteristics\\" of successful people. In business articles and books we always read about the leader that helped transform the company. We read about the stars of the company and how their attitudes helped them to lead a successful life. N. Taleb shows us that success depends on many factors that we don't control. The author also shows us that luck plays a larger role than we think. The author also raises an important point when he concentrates on the magnitude of a scenario no matter how low its probability is. Most people ignore low probability scenarios although if they do happen, and they often happen, the consequences will be severe.  That said, I think that the author is too extreme is his views. He seems to attribute everything to randomness. The real problem is when he takes his theories about the financial market (which are extremely true) and tries to implement them onto broader subjects. Yes the financial market is chaotic, yes it is unpredictable and yes it certainly is no science, but life is not the same as the financial market.  However, the author managed to defend his opinion well, even though he didn't convince me.  The reason I give this book four stars although it was very hard to put down once you pick it up is that Nassim Taleb is simply the greatest fan of.....Nassim Taleb. I was really amazed at how much the author is in love with himself. Nassim Taleb is clearly well read and he manages to pull ideas from a broad range of subjects, but he keeps reminding us that he reads many topics. We are constantly reading how he is a \\"voracious\\" readerof medical journals. He also finds the time to tell us that at one time he had little furniture because every time he went out to buy some he would end up buying books. Again and again we read how he has a stack of books in his house, and how he reads anything that he gets his hands one. The author also quotes many poems (which are in French so we know he speaks French) and inserts book titles in places where there was no need to do so.  Mr. Taleb has written an excellent book. Once you start reading you just have to go on. I agree with many things he said but he is too extreme for my taste. I admire his knowledge of many subjects, but he could have kept his love affair with himself a secret.
B0009K7RES|5.0|What can we say?  He is an incredible musician!  We have never been disappointed by him. The tag, Bards and Minstrels, says it all!  We think he must have lived a previous life during the Middle Ages with the content of some of his many songs. Keep going Mark, we love you!
B002UD56I6|5.0|So much has been said about the content and experience of the film itself and I agree whole-heartedly.  This review is to highlight the awesome sights and sounds of the Blu-ray edition. The film flat out looks and sounds fabulous in 1080P High Definition!  Colors are bright and vibrant.  And the SOUND!  5.1 DTS that gave my speakers a workout from the opening bars of \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\" till the end.  The sound was so hot, it made my 4 year old break forth in a series of frenzied dancing right in front of my 55 inch Sony!  That was PURE JOY!    If you're still on the fence about buying a Blu-ray, let this movie be the deciding factor.  You'll thank me later!
0140620109|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B001U0HBPQ|5.0|This film felt like a cross between Forest Gump and Time Traveler's Wife.  It's a wonderful movie that leave you appreciating life.  Brad Pitt did an excellent job.  The cast was perfect.  The plot and story were interesting and well done.  The story takes us through Benjamin's life as he ages in reverse.  It examines his ability to cope and adapt and his relationships.  The makeup and period pieces were done well and once you suspend belief, the entire film seems very true and real.  A great film.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|I couldn't pass up the three pack \\"box set\\" of Austin Powers DVD's for little more than the price of a single DVD.  While the humor is crude at times, it still gets a laugh out of me.  When I'm not in the mood for a gripping drama, any one of these films will get me smiling.
0786838655|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book. The way that Riordan brings the Gods and characters to life is astounding. I also love the fact that I have learned a lot about the greek Gods! I could not put this book down ! non stop action all the way through!
B002UD56I6|5.0|Ditto! I Agree w/Shanny G.      This Blu-Ray This is It! DVD is a wonderful way to see Michael Jackson in his last days. At least we are shown a glimpse of what his concert would have been like. It shows you his caring, sweet, and humble side, which you never got to see in the media. I thought he was a beautiful person before, but this pushes him out of this world. This Is It! is an awesome Blu-Ray rehearsal! The Thriller portion was kid of creepy.     It was also nice the way they included his three kids(at the very end of all the credits)on the Blu-Ray DVD. It also thanked Mr & Mrs. Jackson (I guess for creating MJ). RIP MJ    I was also stupid enough to purchase the \\"Kingston DataTraveler 2 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive\\" expecting to see the extra's on the go.  What a big disappointment - all that is on the USB is the This is it movie, and NOTHING ELSE. What a Freaking BUMMER. Why did Amazon not have it listed as a separate review?  I would NOT have purchased it - feel pretty stupid!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This product was great, it came brand new, it great condition, and worked perfectly. I am incredibly satisfied. I would have liked there to be a few more special features, but that is just due to the edition of the DVD, and does not at all take away from this seller's service. Thank you!
B002W1HBN4|4.0|Arista Records has wisely re-released Whitney's debut album for early 2010.  For obvious reasons, the album is celebrating its 25th anniversary; but more importantly, the album was in desperate need of a remaster.  The remastering on this commemorative edition is excellent.  Whitney's voice, so pure and soulful back in her formative years, shines through.  Some of the tracks, such as Someone for Me, sound dated (particularly the reliance on drum machines, which were very popular back in the '80s).  But as a whole, this is still a solid album.  Of course, the album's monster singles, \\"You Give Good Love\\" (Whitney has never sounded more soulful), \\"How Will I Know\\", \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" and \\"Greatest Love of All,\\" sound as good as ever.  It's also touching to hear Whitney's duet with Teddy Pendergrass, \\"Hold Me,\\" especially in light of Pendergrass' recent passing.  There are some bonus mixes of \\"Thinking of You,\\" \\"Someone For Me,\\" and \\"How Will I Know,\\" as well as a live version of \\"Greatest Love of All.\\"      When I heard Arista was re-releasing this album, I was hoping we would get to hear some demos.  There is a long-standing rumour that Whitney recorded a more soulful, R&B version of \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" but it was shelved in favour of the more pop-leaning version available on this edition. If this is true, I would love to hear that version.  Unfortunately, there are no demos here.  I get the impression that Clive Davis (executive producer, and who is featured in a lengthy interview in the the enclosed booklet) just wants to celebrate what was, not what could have been.  He's featured so prominently throughout this commemorative edition that you almost begin to think that this is his album, but it's obvious he is still extremely proud of this album, which is understandable - this album was a defining moment in both his and Whitney's careers.    There is a bonus DVD featuring promotional videos and a live version of \\"Home\\" from the Wiz (these are already available on Whitney's Greatest Hits DVD) as well as a live version of \\"I Am Changing\\" from Dreamgirls, and a live version of \\"You Give Good Love. \\"    If you don't own this, Whitney's first album, I highly recommend it. You will understand why this album was such a major success between 1985 and 1986.  Back then, hearing this album, you knew Whitney was something special.  The album was so successful, and the singles so good, many thought Whitney would never achieve the amount of success as her debut did.  Seven years later, she would prove them wrong.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin's Linchpin is a must read for anyone in the workforce. As a young professional, I'd go so far as to say a copy of this book should be given to all new hires (or recent grads for that matter) - it's an inspirational manual on the changing professional atmosphere and what it means to be a valuable employee and a successful contributor in the workforce.     I was nervous about reading this book, as it was my first Seth Godin read (besides his blog). I have no regrets, I understood completely where Godin was coming from and took a lot out of the book. Although I finished the book in two days, it would be wrong of me to say it's a fast read. In fact, it's anything but. I'm now re-reading it and am in awe of how much can be taken away from this book.     If you're looking for ways to improve your work-life and your professional relationships, pick up a copy of this book fast.
B002W1HBN4|5.0|I couldn´t wait for this Anniversary Release of Whitney Houston´s first album. The songs are just wonderfully remastered, and  it´s a pleasure to hear them again in such good quality! They did a wonderful job to add the Bonus Tracks - Thinking about you - Someone for me - How will I know (Acapella) as well as How will I know as dance remix. But the absolute highlight for me is the live version of The Greatest love of all from er performance in Radio City Music Hall in 1990! I guarantee everyone will get goosebumps over and over when hearing this song! She sounds just absolutely amazing! The second disc is a DVD with a conversation of Whitney and Clive Davis, which is very interesting. Also included are rare and wonderful performances. The first ever television appearance of Whitney with the amazing song \\"Home\\" at the \\"Merv Griffin Show\\" in 1983. Also an powerful early performance of her singing \\"I am changing\\" from Dreamgirls during the Arista Records 10th Anniversary in 1985. Amazing also the superb performance of \\"You give good love\\" from the 1st Soul Train Awards in 1987. In addition are the promo videos of \\"You give good love, Saving all my love for you, How will I know and The greatest love of all. If you are a Whitney Houston fan this is an absolute must have! If you want to listen to what made Whitney Houston \\"The Voice\\", please buy this Album, and you will be blown away by her very special talent!
1416594787|3.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Dawkins.  As a graduate student in molecular biology, I appreciate his unapologetic resistance toward all things dogmatic and his support of a public understanding of science, especially the biological sciences, which are so often misunderstood and misinterpreted.  Unfortunately, beyond having the right message, this book is pretty weak.    The prose is often repetetive and boring.  I know he's English, but one doesn't convey the glory of nature with rigid, stuffy sentence structure and GRE vocabulary words.  I never got the feeling of excitement at just how fantastic it all is that I often get from my TEXTBOOKS of all things, but maybe that's because his laborious explanations of things scientific bored me.    That point brooks another issue - the target audience of this book.  People who have majored in a biological science or otherwise know a lot about biology and evolution will probably be bored by his long, long explanations of simple ideas, without the detailed diagrams found in textbooks which make it all comprehensible.  However, these lengthy explanations are simply too poorly written and too confusing for the lay person to understand, with a few exceptions (his description of proteins as chains of magnets with different properties that then bundle together in a defined manner was excellent).  This leaves his target audience as those who are intelligent and well-read enough to grasp complex scientific concepts fairly quickly, but have little experience with biology.  If that's you, buy this book.      If you're a scientist... don't expect any new insights from this one.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is the second heat sink fan I purchased to build a custom pc for someone. I read the reviews, and the price was right so I went and took a shot at this. Yes, all the reviews are true about how hard the installation for this heat sink is. I had to youtube the video on how to install as well. Once I got it hooked up though, this thing works wonders.    The Cooler Master heatsink will come with 1(one) 120mm fan. If you want a second one you will have to purchase another on your own to clamp on to the other side. I set up only 1 fan, and when I overclocked the Intel Dual Core E5200 from its stock 2.50Ghz to 3.62Ghz, the temperature never exceeded 41 degrees Fahrenheit. So yes, it keeps the processor really really cool.    The heat sink is quite large, as it will take up a lot of space in your tower. Before deciding on purchasing it, make sure your tower will be wide enough to fit this cooler on top of your cpu. I have an Antec 300 case, which still has about 2\\" of room to spare before it blocks my side case.

B0035XZ54U|4.0|There is no question about this past year for Whitney Houston. She came back from the brink of destruction, and proved that she is still a voice to be heard aloud with the Platinum-selling I Look To You, and a hard-hitting tell-all on Oprah, where fans and audiences welcomed the artist defined as \\"The Voice\\" back with open arms. Not only that, but this is also a year for Whitney that she also is celebrating for her music too. This year marks the 25th Anniversary since Whitney made her musical debut album, that is still one of the most acclaimed records in music history. Now, Whitney is celebrating that milestone since she first starting giving good love, with the re-release of her classic debut was released, and it definitely is worth the effort.<br /><br />The exclusive 2010 re-release of Whitney Houston's debut album is extra special here to download through Amazon, and is a real worth-while effort that shows just why Whitney has been the definitive diva that we've heard for all these years. This edition doesn't just include all the songs being reissued, but all the DVD content that is on the Deluxe Anniversary Edition on CD as well. All the songs have been remastered beautifully, and include extra songs that mostly make it worth the purchase. The album includes her biggest hits including her #1 smashes How Will I Know, You Give Good Love, the intimate Saving All My Love For You, as well her collaborations with Jermaine Jackson on Nobody Loves Me Like You Do, and the recently-departed Teddy Pendergrass with Hold Me. The extra tracks are mostly worth the effort as well, with a few remixes that are interesting, one of them that mainly struck me was the acapella remix of How Will I Know, and a intimate live performance of Greatest Love Of All.<br /><br />But, what makes this a better download through Amazon a better buy is that you get all the videos from her first record, including How Will I Know, and Greatest Love Of All, and extra footage of Whitney and the man whom discovered her, Clive Davis, reflect on the record with interviews and never-before released footage of Whitney performing songs including her performance of How Will I Know on the very first Soul Train Music Awards, and her landmark debut performing Home on The Merv Griffin Home back in 1983.<br /><br />All in all, Whitney Houston: The Deluxe Anniversary Edition is definitely more worth the effort as a great download for your computer here, than other sites like Rhapsody or Napster, where with them you can only download the songs. If you've never owned a Whitney Houston record, than this is honestly the best place to start right here.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Extras: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+her, Clive Davis, reflect on the record with interviews and never-before released footage of Whitney performing songs including her performance of How Will I Know on the very first Soul Train Music Awards, and her landmark debut performing Home on The Merv Griffin Home back in 1983.

B002HRTMHQ|5.0|This guy really has something.  I happen to like his arrangements.  Most are taken from the old Motown sounds but it's good to hear someone has listen to and heard the quality of music from the 60's that was at the top of the charts and has rebirth that flavor.  He's not the greatest singer yet on some songs he sounds good.  I saw him on Jimmy Kimmel and rushed to buy his CD.  He has a very professional gimmick that I think will work if he's promoted right.  Over all I like his style and I will do all I can to get my friends to listen to his project.  Bring this sound to Chicago.

NONE OF US ARE LIKE WE WERE IN THE 80's!!  The songs on here are great, ESPECIALLY the title song, \\"I look to you.\\"  She still has some of her signature style of singing, and let's thank Clive Davis for bringing her back to Arista.  He is the ONLY one that stood by her through all that Bobby Brown put her through, knowing that he could get her back one day.  I look forward to her next CD.
B002WY65UQ|3.0|Rupert Everett's goofily winning dual performance- as slimy art dealer Carnaby Fritton and as his twin sister Headmistress Camilla Fritton- is the only high point in an otherwise thoroughly forgettable film.    St. Trinian's (\\"like Hogwart's for pikeys\\"), is failing. Half a million pounds in debt and the prime target of the new Minister of Education (Firth) and his crusade to clean up England's schools, the girls must put aside their differences to save their school or else risk going to a 'normal' school. This move would surely negatively impact their bootleg vodka and designer tampon businesses.    The problems begin with the script; populated by poorly sketched characters and a story that stirs few emotions. The primary mistake is simply the attempt to cram too much into this feeble frame. The 'belles' of St. Trinian's are divided into stereotypical (and tired) cliques, but beyond the obvious superficial differences, these groups are basically interchangeable and provide very few surprises.    The various female leads are solid, but unremarkable. Gemma Arterton is a lone stand out- she exudes a smoky, dangerous and clever sex appeal.    There is a lack of memorable sequences and a number that fall flat due to sub-par direction and/or editing. One brief sequence early in the film involves the new girl being tarred and feathered, however, it is so poorly edited, I momentarily thought I was watching a montage of several mornings' worth of hazing.    Cameos by Stephen Fry and Russell Brand add little and are not as funny as the film believes them to be.    There is one bright point in an unexpected little twist in the \\"Ocean's Eleven\\"-inspired heist subplot but it does not redeem this limp and tepid entry.    If you are NOT a fan of British entertainment, you may find much of the dialogue incomprehensible as the accents combine with slang. If you ARE a fan of British entertainment, you may not be amused by the film's focus on 'gross' humor and weak attempts at edginess.

0316017922|4.0|This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous \\"Stories of Success,\\" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created \\"Outliers\\" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule)  and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.<br /><br />Weaving these diverse stories into meaningful arguments through focused biographies including Bill Gates, Robert Oppenheimer and Joe Flom (the last living \\"named\\" partner of a large NYC law firm, whose success is closely related to his ethnicity, demographics and the garment industry), Gladwell shows that Outliers are actually not what they appear, but are individuals who were able to take advantage of the situation before them to forge their unique identities.<br /><br />Satisfying work, says Gladwell, is composed of three key themes - autonomy, complexity and a clear connection between effort and reward - themes that are often missing in the workday world of many individuals. As he is closing this remarkable book, he makes what I feel to be his central point: \\"To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success - the fortunate birth dates and happy accidents of history - with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell punctuates this by telling a story of his own family and his extraordinary grandmother, Daisy Nation, in the chapter titled \\"A Jamaican Story.\\" I won't spoil it for you. Read it for yourself.<br /><br />To quote the author one last time, \\"It is impossible for a hockey player, or Bill Gates, or Robert Oppenheimer, or any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and say with truthfulness, `I did this, all by myself.'\\"ey player, or Bill Gates, or Robert Oppenheimer, or any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and say with truthfulness, `I did this, all by myself.'\\"
0545140315|4.0|Boys suck. (Okay, maybe not ALL the time). And our leading lady, Penny Lane, has had it with them. Especially the boys at school with their fake persona's and childish behavior. As it turns out, Penny wasn't the only one. What started as a club of three, soon blossoms into a club consisting of forty-plus girls all feeling the same way. And that turns into a bit of a fiasco at McKinley High School with the opposite gender. With Penny's lifelong crush pleading for reconciliation after breaking her heart, the school's principle breathing down her neck demanding that the club shut down, and a new boy on the horizon, Penny begins to understand that you CAN get by with a little help from your friends.<br /><br />And that was my favorite aspect of this novel. While the story begins with a broken heart and a feeling of hopelessness, the theme matures to a tale of independence and self-discovery. We see the rise of friendship through many differences and all odds. A group of girls coming together through hardships to stand by one another. And the great characters just kept coming. I loved the vast array of personalities that contributed to the story. Even the boys.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed was the Beatles undertones, which played very nicely with the rest of the content. (The inclusion of The Beatles is actually one of the first reasons I decided to read this book.) Penny's parents are a riot in the fact that they would probably put most Beatles fans to shame. Naming all three of their daughters after Beatles songs (Lucy, Rita, & Penny Lane), swearing against Beatles cover-bands, taking yearly trips to Liverpool, AND being vegetarians to follow Paul's beliefs - they would make most children cringe at their obsession. But for Penny, the Beatles were her vice - the 4 boys who never let her down.<br /><br />Overall consensus: The Lonely Hearts Club is a genuinely good read. Slightly predictable in some parts but I completely felt for Penny and enjoyed the camaraderie within the story. A book flowing with teenage issues, self-discovery, and love - it will have you smiling and cheering on Penny and The Lonely Hearts Club.flowing with teenage issues, self-discovery, and love - it will have you smiling and cheering on Penny and The Lonely Hearts Club.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I've been a fan of True Blood since it came out, before it really \\"blew up.\\"  I currently have all of season one and two recorded on my DVR but having S1 on Blue-Ray was a must (as will owning S2)!  The show is uniquely different than the books.  Being an avid book reader and lover, I rarely care for \\"movie\\" or \\"TV\\" versions of books.  I do, however, absolutely love TB the series.  I'm thoroughly enjoying the fact that you can read the books and not know exactly what the expect in the series. The series is \\"loosely\\" based on the books, so if you're expecting a word-for-word reenactment of the books, you will be disappointed.  Also, if you haven't read the books, I suggest you do so!  It will give you a \\"heads-up\\" as to what is going to come in the series! :)

0385523904|5.0|Nothing to Envy is an excellent book, interviews with North Koreans who have escaped the country.  Most everything else written on the subject of North Korean oppression has been academic and scholarly, not very interesting to a regular person who just wants to know what the situation in N. Korea is like, under the dictatorship of Kim-IL Sung (he died in 1994) and his son, Kim-Jong IL.<br /><br />Author Barbara Demick spent years as the Los Angeles Times Bureau Chief in South Korea.  I think her perspective as a woman makes all the difference in why this book is incredibly moving and emotional.  When male scholars and policy wonks write about the politics of North Korea, they tend to focus on the facts without remembering there are human beings behind all of those numbers and statistics.<br /><br />Demick has provided an extensive bibliography and useful source notes for anyone interested in following up on her research.  I highly recommend this book.

B002ZIAC26|3.0|Much like their namesake, Beach House as a musical construct is an escape, a carefully crafted fortress of peaceful reverie surrounded on all sides by walls of dreamy indie pop and buttressed by vocalist Victoria Legrand's soft wails. Those more fortunate than me retreat to beach houses to get away from bustling city life or for simple weekend excursions; hipster listeners and blogosphere addicts alike come to Beach House for musical restoration of another sort, but it all comes down to the same thing: peaceful, relaxing quiet.  Teen Dream, the duo's third album (multi-instrumentalist Alex Scally being the other half) is their most fully realized effort yet, an album that truly captures the Beach House dynamic. It's also much more exciting (well, as exciting as these two get) than 2008's slothful Devotion, and features some of the most tasteful melodies Beach House have ever put down.<br /><br />But the same problem that has plagued Beach House their entire career crops up here again, despite Teen Dream's immediately fascinating soundscapes and seemingly effortless melodies. Whereas a beach house is generally considered a haven of sunshine, one of beauty and unrefined fun, Beach House themselves continue to craft songs that, while impeccably beautiful and fashioned with the delicate care of two master songsmiths, stand at a distance from the world, closed off by a sort of intangible iciness that lends too much of Teen Dream an ethereal quality that makes it nearly impossible to connect to.<br /><br />Not that this seems much of an issue to begin with. The first few songs are practically flawless examples of how dream pop should be done, from the lilting chorus of \\"Zebra\\" to the resonant guitar of \\"Silver Soul\\" to the relentlessly catchy hum of first single \\"Norway.\\" I found myself fairly shocked that Beach House was actually engaging me at this juncture in their career, when I thought they had exhausted all their limited sound had to offer. But after the jazzy hop-step of \\"Used To Be,\\" perhaps Legrand's strongest performance and easily the record's most upbeat song, the second half of Teen Dream starts up and brings absolutely nothing new to the table.<br /><br />It's more a function of the Beach House vibe and mood rather than a failure of the band themselves that as Teen Dream flows on, the record continues to become more and more expressionless and indistinctive. Legrand and Scally perfect the dream-pop formula on the first half of the record, but their failure is in continuing to do the same thing over and over again for the second. It's not particularly bad; the harmonies are as sharp as they always were, the crystalline song structures are as pure as ever, and the musicianship is predictably gorgeous. It's just that the overall sameness of the material lends itself to a running-together, a flow of the album that tends to lead songs into each other and make it harder and harder to distinguish between individual tracks.<br /><br />It's this cold attention to detail, a single-minded directive to match a dream-pop aesthetic that lends Teen Dream its rather distant vibe and make the album a success as a work of art, but one that seems strangely impersonal and aloof at the same time. Perhaps it's Legrand's androgynous vocals that so often seem restrained and unemotional, or the way the band treats melodic climaxes the same way they do the first verse of the song, with the same amount of ardor or lack thereof. It's a shimmery, escapist release, without a doubt, but as anything more than a mild sleeping aid, Teen Dream fails to rise above its genre.Be,\\" perhaps Legrand's strongest performance and easily the record's most upbeat song, the second half of Teen Dream starts up and brings absolutely nothing new to the table.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I cannot believe the practices that are outlined in this movie.  How sad is it that WE as Americans trusted the FDA to do the right thing regarding our health, only to find out that AGAIN capitalism is more important than the health of the citizens of the United States of America.  I'm appauled and pissed off that this has been swept under the rug.  Not only are we suffering, our children are suffering, and dis-eases as being allowed to proliferate and kill individuals every day as a result of the processing that is taking place!    Watching the Oprah Show may have saved my life and members of my families life, it's that simple!  This FOOD SYSTEM is killing you!  Do yourself and YOUR FAMILY a favor and start shopping local.  Find local vendors and use them and stop buying and feeding your family the crap that they so arrogantly put on the market!  I know many people who have illnesses that have become RAMPANT since this processing started, going green has changed their LIFE AND THEIR HEALTH!  Think about all of the chemicals that they are using to process those meats, and the fact that you are ingesting those chemicals, and the fact that you have allergies, and the fact that you have hormonal imbalances, and the fact that you have no energy, and the fact that you have CANDIDA, and the fact that your child has a learning disability, and the fact that your hair is falling out, and the fact that your child can't control their temper, and the fact that you have fibro, ADHD, lyme disease, thyroid disorders, mental illness, constipation, gerd, etc.  That list is long and while the doctors will be happy to provide you with a prescription, the prescription that will cost you a little bit more on the front end but HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS, is ORGANIC FOODS!   Save your life today AND VOTE WITH YOUR POCKETBOOK, THREE TIMES A DAY!!!      YES, this prescription will take you more time, YES this prescription means that you have to cook EVERYTHING, yes it will get you closer to your family, YES, YES, YES, but in the long run you'll feel better so you can exercise and feel good about it and have more energy to spend with your family!:)

I came to Amazon to purchase it on CD, because I do not listen to cassette tapes anymore. I would have purchased it from iTunes but Amazon has a better deal. Of course my ultimate favorite is FAST CAR, but I love almost all of the other tracks. I can't say that about most of the albums I have purchased in my lifetime. At best you get two songs that you would play often. Tracy's debut album surpasses that there are 11 songs and I love probably 9 of them. She should have been a superstar indeed. I hope she comes out with more beautiful music. I am a fan.

These are the movies I have seen this one compared to:  \\"Alien,\\" \\"Solaris,\\" \\"Event Horizon,\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\"  This flagrant need to compare movies is largely due, in my opinion, to Hollywood's decade long quandary with not being able to come up with much new material...everything has already been done...and everyone has been conditioned to not expect anything new from that corner of the planet.  Well, I'm not buyin' it!  Books pour out of author's imaginations and onto the shelves of our local bookstores on a daily basis, and they are ALL different from the next.  If book writers can do it, then I'm sure movie writers can do it as well.  And this movie is no exception.  It has plenty of newness to it.  As a matter of fact, once you get through the creepy and atmospheric body of \\"Pandorum,\\" which takes place on a spaceship meant to transport everything needed to start anew on another planet much like Earth, and finally reach the climactic ending, the breath of fresh air is resultant of a movie that never let on where it was going, reveals a story that has never been told (even remotely), and leaves the watcher with good feelings in their hearts...feelings of hope and reverie.  The acting is superb by all in attendance, although, I believe Ben Foster should have gotten top billing, not Dennis Quaid.  The vast majority of the time spent here is centered around Ben's character, whereas, Dennis' character doesn't do much more than try to stay connected with him from another part of the ship.  All in all, \\"Pandorum\\" delivered on all eight cylinders.  It had suspense, tension, depth, a well-thought-out plot, exceptional acting, production, and direction, creepiness, absorption, and reward.  If you like the sci-fi/horror type thing, DON'T MISS IT!!!!!  Five Stars *****
B00007KWHO|3.0|Time and a Word - Yes (3.38 stars)<br />Original Release: 6/0/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed (4 stars)<br />Organ, strings and bass play an openning fanfare that sounds like a theme for a Wild West movie.  The bass is groovin' throughout the song.  The instrumental mid-section is rockin' with the band and the orchestra moving as one.  The lyrics suggest some kind of wake up call to be positive and not dwell on the negative; as a Christian I hear an indirect reference to Jesus in the lyrics as well.<br /><br />Then (3 stars)<br />The lyrics describe the conditions and qualities of how a better world on earth with heavenly overtones of greater experience and mutual cooperation will come to pass.  Dramatic strings accent the song's pensive tone until the chorus opens up the mood to a mild rapture.  Then a long instrumental section revs up the energy before it slows way down into a serene jazzy space.  The previous lyrics are repeated against this mellower background while the bass plays jazzy phrases.  The song abruptly ends with an explosion of brass and brass aftershocks.<br /><br />Everydays (3 stars)<br />The lyrics seem to hint at the many joys and wonders that seem all but buried in the mundanity of everyday life.  This is presented to a laid back swing beat and jazzy vocals; la-de-da.  Then the word \\"day\\" which ends a lyrical stanze is repeated with eerie instrumental sounds hinting at something about to break to the surface.  The dull illusion fades as the instrumental section comes in on an intense hi hat.  Then a staccato bass and organ melody followed by a guitar jam.  Then organ and orchestra join in eventually climaxing...and the song returns to its dull world vision; la-de-da, de-da.  Both this song and to a lesser extent the previous one have the quality that they attempt to take the listener on a journey somewhere in short order and back again; and these songs have the little extra length to help accomplish that journey without it feeling too rushed.  These are signs of a definite impulse towards the grand progressive rock songs Yes would later create.<br /><br />Sweet Dreams (3 stars)<br />Dreams can bring you out of any hole you may fall into says this straight-forward pop song.  The bass is out for a rigorous stroll hear and pumps a great deal of rhythmic energy into this song giving it almost a march-like feel.  The other instruments hunker down and provide the background to the vocals and bass.<br /><br />The Prophet (4 stars)<br />Ah, the blazing, seering organ that starts this song is a great dose of keyboard wizardry, one that I haven't seen enough appreciation given to.  The long, satisfying spell of an organ solo finds its way into a theme from Holst's \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\".  Then the guitar comes in to guide the energy down into a more flowing energy.  The strings highlight the spiritual lyrics who tell of a man who speaks of a higher truth that is both personal and more than personal.  The strings once again add drama and by the end of the song you have really rocked and rolled.<br /><br />Clear Days (3 stars)<br />Our happiness becomes clear in brief moments but those moments are in touch with eternity.  Sweet strings and piano accompany these lyrics.  The song ends with a more apprehensive tone.<br /><br />Astral Traveller (4 stars)<br />The lyrics seem to allude to out of body experiences in the form of efforts at literally soaring into the sky.  The guitar sets the tone for the traveller.  The singer's distorted voice suggests a transportation to another realm.  Staccato rhythm throughout sets you up for the instrumental section which starts with baroque variations on a melody.  This changes into a slow guitar mediation against the faster background.  Then as the guitar rachets things up we come back to the original instrumental theme.  Throughout this song there is a percussive quality that lends a unique tone.  It begins to chip away at the 60s pop and jazz style into something more abstract and more like rock.  The contrast between lyrical section and the instrumental section is not so stark as in many of Yes' other songs at this point.<br /><br />Time and a Word (3 stars)<br />This is straight-forward hippy love song sung with all due seriousness by a sincere believer.  Like \\"Sweet Dreams\\" this song relaxes the instrumental muscles a bit.  The chorus is surprisingly infectious and makes for an excellent closing song for the album.<br /><br />Dear Father (3 stars)<br />Lyrics seem to be about Jesus speaking with God, the Father, about his mission.  He shows his human side, resisting His calling.  The instrumentals and orchestra play a grand theme behind the vocals.  The instrumental coda is nice with the orchestra as well ending the song with that 60s pop energy that will suddenly disappear on their next album.<br /><br />No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed (Original Mix) (2 stars)<br />No stereo back and forth to the strings on the openning of this edit (which didn't seem to sound right on the album version of this song anyway).  With a suppressed or absent orchestra other elements like organ and background vocals stand out more, but often not to good effect.<br /><br />Sweet Dreams (Original Mix) (2 stars)<br />Again background elements, in this case, backing vocals, are brought forward.  There is additional guitar work in the solo which ends up making this song longer in spite of it being played a bit faster.<br /><br />The Prophet (Single Version) (2 stars)<br />Again a subdued orchestar reveals some sounds that don't quite mesh.<br /><br />Album:<br />As I felt in my review of Jethro Tull's \\"Benefit\\" this album by Yes makes an incremental improvement over the previous album.  The songs have a more coherent, natural quality even as they attempt to reach out at times into contrasting musical moods.  The band and the orchestra play well together, each with their own confidence.  The serious song lyrics are somewhat deluted by the giddy energy of 60s pop and shaken up by the muscular thump of the bass.  Yes was a band that seemed ready to break the bounds of pop-rock but still felt restrained to not so long songs and even doing covers.  But by the time the year 1971 rolls around progressive rock will have entered its golden age and such restraints will be left far behind by Yes and the other giants of the still birthing genre.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Four stars (4 stars)<br />1.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|The good:     These headphones are great. You can hear enemy reloads from 10-20 feet away. You can hear footsteps. You have great directional audio. Everything you expect from a nice pair of headphones    THE BAD:    For $200 I am amazed by how much feedback/static you get. For $200 I expect dead silence during loading screens and quiet moments, not a nasty high pitch static 'hiss' (which is what you get). And here's a newsflash- even if you can't hear the hiss (eg during louder action sequences), it's still there. So after a few hours of playing you will likely have a bad headache.     I returned these after a few days on a matter of principle. I will be ordering A40's soon to see if they are better.
B00204AA0O|5.0|I'd have to say this is the best album I've heard since the Avett Brothers' Emotionalism. Fantastic.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  I HATE history, but LOVED this series -- it's a very easy watch and very informative on the men and situations during the war. Definately two thumbs way up!
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I decided to spend an artsy weekend and was able to watch most of Robert Pattinson's indie films (Little Ashes, The Haunted Airman, Bad Mother's Handbook, and How To Be).  Of all the films, I was tremendously impressed at the skill in delivery of Salvador Dali's character by Pattinson.  So many people are aware of him on the BIG screen with works like Twilight, New Moon and Harry Potter, but I believe that his true calling may be with the independent artsy films like Little Ashes.    It may be difficult to see Pattinson as a character so opposite to his Twilight persona of Edward Cullen; however, he is truly an artist in its purist sense.  I look forward to seeing what he will do in the future with period works like Bel Ami and Water for Elephants.    I highly recommend watching Little Ashes.
006621131X|5.0|A glorious read. I cannot express how much I've enjoyed this very moving story of unconditional love, fierce loyalty and boundless spirituality.  I initially caught an excerpt in the January 21st issue of Rolling Stone which gives a great preview of what to expect.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I think this movie is a lock to win Best Picture. Why? Two major reasons:    1. It's boring! Critics love movies where nothing ever happens, or, as they will insist, \\"the drama is beneath the surface\\". Yes, a movie cannot truly achieve greatness unless 4 years of film school are required to \\"grasp the subtleties\\". We are spending 10 minutes of screen time staring at a sand hill in the desert not, as you may suspect, because the director couldn't think of anything else, but so that we can \\"feel the tension\\". Was the dialogue composed of random bits of conversation picked up by stray boom mikes? It may seem so to the average viewer, but a true movie buff will see the deep significance here. Trust me on this.     2. It's about an extremely depressing subject that Hollywood knows nothing about. Voting for movies about war, genocide, poverty, and other things that they hear about on NPR allows Academy members to show us how \\"tuned in\\" and \\"empathetic\\" they are. Of course, when one spends all of one's time at awards galas, it's difficult to check the accuracy of such movies. No matter though, because everyone will be impressed by the amount of effort it took you to come to such complex conclusions as \\"war is bad\\" and \\"genocide should be stopped\\". (And yes, I am a liberal Democrat, but I am SO SICK of heavy-handed \\"message movies\\".)    In an average year, a movie with only one of these shining characteristics might have a hope of winning. \\"Avatar\\" and \\"Up in the Air\\", for example, both beat viewers repeatedly over the head with their messages of \\"environmentalism is good\\" and \\"the country is in recession\\". Other critic's picks are excruciatingly boring. But only The Hurt Locker has the twin power to bore the premiere attendees to sleep AND make them think about us little people on their way to the afterparty. Engrave the  Oscar now.

B002R4K6AG|5.0|Before purchasing this album you need to ask yourself...do you love Bob Dylan primarily because of the sound of his voice, or do you love Bob Dylan primarily as a songwriter? If you mostly appreciate him as a songwriter and not so much for the quality of his voice, you're going to want to pass. These are mostly traditional Christmas songs he's singing...not like he's written/sung an entire new approach to Christmas carols here.<br />I am an all around Bob Dylan lover, so I knew what to expect and am extremely happy with the album!

0786860707|5.0|This book is a masterpiece.  I have several impressive Disney books of this style on my shelf, and this kills all of them.<br /><br />My version was printed in 1981.  This means is has nothing later than \\"The Rescuers,\\" although I see from Amazon's site that there's a \\"revised 1995\\" edition floating around.  I think that's merely a reprint, and does not substantially rework the text to include animated features released since 1981.<br /><br />It's huge, about the size of an unabridged dictionary.  If you're looking to learn about cell animation and how the Disney animators got around several thorny problems, go no further.  Also hundreds of incredible glossy pictures, including conceptual sketches, background paintings, line drawings, and a whole lot else.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I really liked the movie. Blu-ray version was worth it, surround sound was perfect. Price was great online here on amazon as well. I might stick to buying blu-rays online here from now on.
B00008973A|1.0|I may be writing this review years after seeing this movie, but it left such a bad impression I will never forget it!  I had the supreme privilege of seeing the original Chorus Line Broadway cast production in San Francisco back in the mid-70's.  What a fabulous, heart-felt, grab-you-by-the-throat-and-not-let-you-go show!  I remember being SO excited when I heard that a movie was being made of the play . . . I went to see it opening day.  Now, I had heard about the various production problems that had delayed the completion and release of the movie, that they had gone thru a few directors before they signed Attenborough, but I still foolishly thought it would be a good movie - I somehow expected that if Attenborough couldn't save it no one could (and I think I was right!) . . . anyhow . . . I simply could not believe that anyone could take a fabulous show like Chorus Line and make such a flat, dull, awkward and just plain awful movie out of it!  The emphasis of the story was shifted from the dancer's stories and struggles and love of dance to the non-existant \\"love story\\" between Cassie and Zach, most of the stories were changed and most of the roles were miss-cast, taking the heart out of the production (even Michael Douglas as Zach didn't work). The absolutely glorious Bennett choreography was messed with (their idea of improvement? - HELP!) and the music - OMG!!!! instead of the full orchestra, they twanged away with an electric guitar, drums and a bass!  It was just HIDEOUS! Yes, I really didn't like this movie!     I am glad that some people enjoyed the movie (I'll bet they never saw the original show!), but for those of us who did see the original, stay away from this catastrophe!  If you want to see something that will give you a taste of the original production, I highly recommend \\"Every Little Step\\"[[ASIN:B002JT69LE Every Little Step] . . . it even had Donna McKechnie's original Cassie dance!  Now, that was a WOW!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game can be as challenging as you desire.  Beginners can handle and then you can take on more challenging aspects of the game because it can be ever changing!  Great strategy tool.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This was a beautiful movie with the best aerial views of the earth I have ever seen.It also scared me to death how fast this beautiful earth is being degraded  as a fit planet to sustain human life.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Yes, the songs are boring.  But this album finds other ways to disappoint.  Michael talked in interviews about the recording quality and trying to keep it high.  This is a horrible recording.      There is too much compression on this cd- every instrument is equally loud- and there is no dynamic range.  Because of this is it impossible to listen to it for any amount of time.  Google \\"death of dynamic range\\" and check out this link:  [...]
B0000VCZK2|5.0|My son had seen \\"Alien vs Predator\\" and didn't know the background of either creature so, realizing that we were remiss in his pop culture education, we bought the Alien Quadrilogy. This is a fantastic 9 DVD set that contains two versions of each movie and more extras than we will ever be able (or inclined) to watch. While not detailed reviews of each movie, here are my general observations:<br /><br />* Alien  - This is a great movie that contains all of the elements of a classic sci-fi\horror. Like several other reviewers, I prefer the original release over the extended version.<br /><br />* Aliens - Really good sequel which stays true to what made the original movie great. This time I liked the extended version better.<br /><br />* Alien 3 - Not nearly as good as the first two, but still watchable. I think the theatrical release is the better one (other reviews disagree), but the extended version is still interesting to watch.<br /><br />* Alien Resurrection - I really disliked this movie all around, it doesn't matter which version, but it still needs to be seen to round out the series.<br /><br />The box cover art is in an attractive holographic like motif that looks very nice on the shelf. The DVDs are kept in a somewhat unwieldy fold out arrangement, but they do take up surprising little room.<br /><br />Overall this a great value for all that is packed into this great set!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B000ICL3CE|2.0|Sure it is a Cure album but the remix was a waste of time.  While they did some improving and it sounds nice, they compressed it so it is super loud.  This cd is not worth the money.  Buy the original release, it sounds much better.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I saw some reviewers say that they like the theatrical (shorter) version better than the Director's Cut. I think it depends on what version they saw first.     Whatever version you see, you fall in love with this film, and don't want to change anything in it. I saw only the Director's Cut, and I wouldn't drop a single episode from it. This is a masterpiece.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought the Beatles Stereo Box set from Japan.  The box contains remastered CDs, it affects the modern acoustic, but all are the real THE BEATLES sound.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Saw III picks up right where II left off and then forwards goes six months ahead, a new victim is discovered is an inescapable trap. Usually \\"patients\\" of John \\"Jigsaw\\" Kramer can escape the games; this time the trap is unusual which brings questions about the inventor of this trap. Saw III is basically a large and complicated game much like the first movie. Jigsaw is dying and Amanda brings in Doctor Lynn Denlon who has to keep him alive for the game's length in order to succeed her game. Meanwhile her husband Jeff is the one playing the \\"real\\" game which will decide of everyone's fate. This one is also Amanda's big test even if she doesn't know it. The fact that Saw III is so complex, logical and that it makes sense at the same is quite an accomplishment for a horror movie as they rather ignore connectivity from a movie to another, Saw does not. It's obvious that with this third movie they tried to end the trilogy while knowing that there might be a next movie, they could have ended Saw right there if they wanted to. It is the most profitable Saw movie to date having earned an estimated total of $164,874,275 worldwide.<br /><br />I feel this is one of the better Saw movies, first of all it has a great story and its complicated which I think is what fans will love about it. Secondly why someone may or may not like it is because it's the goriest of the Saw movies in my opinion, the traps are amazing I felt they put in some extra effort for those.
B002U6CJCE|4.0|15 minutes into this, I noticed something strange. I didn't want to turn it off which is pretty rare when talking about most of Van Damme's movies over the past decade. The thing that might kill this movie with some fans though, is that it is so different from the great original.  It is not a polished Terminator type action flick like the original was.  Director John Hyams' retelling is much grittier and with some of the locations and fights, it almost has more of a Bourne style feeling to it.  The action is furiously directed...very quick with no dopey slow motion.  The acting isn't great but it's decent and convincing enough...two qualities that have been lacking in recent Van Damme DTV casts.  It is true that Van Damme is only sprinkled throughout, but the film is so fast moving, before you know it, you are already at the final 40 minutes ...and he owns the *beep* out of it!!  There is a long tracking shot of him tearing up terrorist ass and it's probably the best action sequence he has ever been a part of.  It truly gets the heart pounding, and like me, you will probably re-watch it about 10 times.   It's also a refreshing blast to see Lundgren on screen even if it is pretty brief.  His and JC's fight is completely different from the one in the original.  There is no Hollywood gloss to it at all.  This is how the fight would be if these two met up and decided to scrap and it comes of very effective.  You can feel the anger and rage.  All in all, Unisol: Regeneration is  a solid little action flick.   Other than JCVD, it's easily his best movie since Sudden Death, which happened to be given to us by another Hyams...John's father, Peter.  It may not be a masterpiece and isn`t quite on par with the original but it`s still a lot of fun and it`s definitely a worthy addition to my bluray collection.  I'll definitely be keeping my eye on director John Hyams.  I'd like to see what he can do with a decent budget and some better filming locations. The subtle synthmusic score was well done too. Think along the lines of Vangelis, who created the Blade Runner soundtrack, or something John Carpenter might have composed back in the day.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This entry includes John Turturro (as Pete), the stressed pessimist; Tim Blake Nelson (as Delmar),  the child-like optimist; and George Clooney (as Everett), the realist intellectual-- all bumbling idiots.     In a vibrant sepia tone 1930's Mississippi, Everette dupes his friends into breaking out of prison to seek a fortune, but the fortune they find is not what they sought. Along the way, they get themselves into mishap after mishap, learn something about themselves and about life, and run across a bunch of similarly caricature-like characters.     O Brother blends some stunning cinematography, brilliant direction, quotable dialog, a very catchy soundtrack, great cast, interesting characters, memorable performances, excellent sets, and a thoroughly entertaining story.     Due to language and the social climate of the time, I recommend parental supervision or a slightly older audience (although it's carried out satisfactorily). Story based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey.\\"     Another Coen Brothers hit - 8.4/10
0446567337|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it is told from the perspective of John, which was different from many of Nicholas Sparks books.  It was loving, sad, heartbreaking,and wonderful.  It showed how love sometimes doesn't always work the way we expect it to but in life in all situations it is still present.  I couldn't put it down.

B002T9H2LK|5.0|the price was right.and it was in the mail on time.i would buy from again.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|The first thing that irritates enormously is the title of the album - maybe there is a good concept behind it, but musically (and especially VISUALLY) it is not given the slightest shape to believe in. It's no crime DM sound 'of the universe', they are grown people with an obvious age crisis, so it is understandable this collection is either a die-hard fans formality or their own waste of time (read: ultimate lack of ideas well packed in).     Even though every next possible new album by DM will keep intriguing us on first mention because they still can deliver a good album, 'Sounds of the universe' will very probably remain their weakest, if not the worst offering - of course, depending on each subjective view of it. In recent years the group still managed to compete with their better past; 'Playing the Angel' for example, was a truly fine-produced, vital album despite some horrifying rhymes ('Lillian').     On 'Sounds of the universe' these rhymes might fare a little better on occasion but in conjunction with the forcibly minimalist music, everything flops dreadfully. And the saddest thing about it is, they could have made it a much better retro album from what's actually based on so much analogue equipment's pomposity. Martin definitely wasted a lot of money, spending it on vintage gear to participate in an album this shallow. Only tiny reminders of something better lay in 'Jezebel' or 'Little Soul'. Most other songs are affectingly claustrophobic, pathetic ballads without substance - 'Perfect' and 'Miles Away/The Truth Is' are Fad Gadget rip-offs, 'Peace' is a 'See You' rip-off, 'In Chains' is a 'Pain That I'm Used To' rip-off... 'Wrong' is a 'Precious' rip-off... and so on. Until the 'Universe' dries out.     Personally, I may be tone-deaf and blind at something I should recognize a decent album as a die-hard fan of the group myself, but I might think just the same for all those people praising it enormously without particular argument other than the fact it isa Depeche Mode album. But I just don't see the importance of this one alone, too many songs are just lazy re-writes in one way or the other, something we've heard before in far better tonal shape - and neither Anton Corbijn or a de-luxe package will help. And speaking of Corbijn's artwork here, the layout for 'Sounds' should be voted one of the most pointless ever; to produce a front cover this cheap hurts even more than the musical side of it.    All in all, this is the sound of Depeche Mode on a life-support. Let's hope, they wake from coma next time around.

0143034901|5.0|When ten year old Daniel finds a book by Julian Carax, `The Shadow of the Wind', he reads it in one long sitting and becomes obsessed with the author. Seeking to find more of Carax's work, he finds that Carax has never been popular, that few copies of his books were ever sold- and that someone is systematically destroying them. As he seeks more information over the next 8 years, he finds myriad dead ends- or are they? Slowly he unearths a labyrinthine story of love, betrayal, perversity and hatred. And then his own life starts to echo that of the author.<br /><br />Set in mid-century Barcelona, Zafon's story is populated with harsh, authoritarian fathers, psychotic policemen, whores with hearts of gold, kindly book sellers, and a sidekick/mentor with nine lives. But while these could be cardboard stereotypes, they are actually good characters.I worried about them and what would happen to them. The story drew me in right at the beginning, where the Cemetery of Forgotten Books is introduced, and I realized that this book had some elements of surrealism. Lush, even Gothic in tone, the prose can be almost over the top at times, but it fits perfectly with the plot. The story lives in shadow and rain, deserted houses and filthy alleys. It's a mystery, a coming of age story, and a story of many loves of many types. The jacket blurbs compare it to something written by Marquez, Eco or Borges; to this list I would add A.S. Byatt.<br /><br />My only problem with the book was that I sometimes got characters mixed up, and because large parts of the story are told in letters and memoir,  I would sometimes get confused as to who had said or experienced what. Despite this, I found it a stunning, can't put it down read. `Shadow of the Wind' is the first in a connected four book series; I can't wait to read the next one.
B000BZIT5M|4.0|Can't the audio glitches be addressed in this delicious performance?  There is so much to like, even love about it.  Let's face it, Rodolfo and Mimi are often thoroughly boring, but this pair is so endearingly sung and characterized by Shicoff and Cotrubas.  The scale also seems right-- warm, ardent voices come out of people, who on the whole, look right for their parts, and the sets are cleverly deployed without Zeffirellian opulence.  The impression here is of a great ensemble piece with remarkable evenness of high quality throughout, rather than a star turn for two superstars.  So the young artists' horseplay looks and feels real, and sharpens the poignancy of the tragedy-- which seems like what Puccini intended.  A very sexy and funny young Tom Allen rampages through the proceedings as Marcello -- I wish there were an opera about him  (watch his face as he cons the landlord Benoit-- it's priceless). He and his Musetta, Marilyn Zschau, reveal a suprising tenderness amidst their crockery-throwing.
B000FZETKC|4.0|John Hughes was behind some of the most revered teen movies of the 1980s and beyond. Several of his films (i.e. The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) have achieved pop culture immortality, so it's a bit surprising that one of his best contributions to the genre remains relatively unknown. He supposedly made Some Kind of Wonderful because he was unsatisfied with the ending to his previous film with director Howard Deutch, Pretty in Pink. The similarities between the two movies are numerous and occasionally glaring, but this time the characters are more tangible and their situations are less contrived. Some Kind of Wonderful centers on Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz), an artsy misfit from a blue-collar family who pines for Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), the most popular girl in school. Like Keith, Amanda is from the \\"wrong side of the tracks,\\" but she uses her good looks to elevate her status. Keith's best friend Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) is an angsty social outcast.  She's falling hard for Keith, but he remains frustratingly oblivious. The plot may sound like a typical high school soap opera, but this is a story of redemption. The sheer amount of hard work, humor, and sensitivity contributed by the cast and crew elevates this film above the cliché.  The lead actors, particularly Masterson, offer pitch-perfect performances. Sidekicks like Duncan the Skinhead (Elias Koteas) and Keith's younger sisters (played by Maddie Corman and a pre-Full House Candace Cameron) deliver hilarious one-liners. Combine all of that with one of the best soundtracks of the 80s, and you have the recipe for a Hughes classic. 4 Stars.
B000RHKARO|5.0|You must ceck this album out... it is a MASTERPIECE! John Mayall had an incredible knack of re-inventing sounds and new albums that always have their roots in the blues... This is another masterful work that needs to be heard as a complete album not just one or two tracks. It is a musical journey in th blues.
0671042858|2.0|Mom and brother are arguing so the daughter, the good daughter, opts to slip into the woods. She teels herself she has to go to the bathroom but she doesn't really need to. What she needs is a break before she screams because she can't stand it anymore. The problem here is that this girl who loves #36, Tom gordon, slips a little too far away and, before she knows it, she's lost. Thank goodness she has Tom to keep the terrible things away or else \\"it\\" might find and get her.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the book but I found that these were quickly dashed against repeating metaphoric rocks. There were pages upon pages spent telling the reader about snakes and being lost and \\"I wonder if I'm really using the third object in my homemade compass to tell me the right way to go?\\" Over and over again there seemed to be things added into the background that really didn't matter, and the repeating - it felt like it was meant to drive me insane.<br /><br />She loved Tom gordon. got it.<br />He protects her from \\"it.\\" got it.<br />She wants to be found. Got it yet again.<br /><br />For fans of King, this isn't for you. It advertised itself as something of a fairytale - I really didn't see that. I saw a kid who was lost in the woods and was scared - scared that she would be attacked and scared that she would not be missed and scared that Tom Gordon would be her only saviour in the end.<br />Not recommended.

0061922315|4.0|There is a saying that once you become a mother, you will always be a mother. This book sets out to prove that adage true and it is a very lovely book. The only problem I had with it was that it didn't go more into details about the conditions that face women in India. Then again, this is not a political book as it is fiction but there is that small part of me wishing for more details of Asha's report.     This is a book about a young mother who had already lost one daughter and was fearful of losing another one. Just hours after giving birth, she traveled to an orphanage to deliver her daughter there into what possibly might be a better life. She named her daughter Usha, meaning Dawn. Usha/Asha did get adopted by an American couple and did move onto having a wonderful life. Somer, her adoptive mother, struggled with her fears of losing her and along the way lost sight of herself, her family and her marriage. Asha returns to India to complete a year-long study there and finally discovers the reality of India that isn't normally portrayed in the news.     The chapters veer from character to character ... each of them have a strong voice and while living parallel lives across the world from one another, the reader can sense their connection (even though they're not aware of it). Bonded by love for the same daughter, each woman lives her own life. Asha comes into her own idenity while bonding with her Indian family (though not her biological family) as she spends months there. Not only that, she comes into understanding just how complex the Indians really are.     It is a quick read and perfect for those long cold nights. It is a thoughtful book and while it lags a quarter of the way into the book, it does pick up again and the last few chapters really punched emotions in the gut. I, for one, couldn't stop crying at the bittersweetness of this book. (I must have needed a good cry too!)     This book is about the complex relationship mothers and daughters have ... and it is a worth-while read.    1/27/10
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I thought this book was so wonderful.It just made me remember my first love of my life. It made me laugh and especially cry. I could not believe I found a book that could do that to me. I had told all my friends and family about this book to read it before seeing the movie. And for those who did read they were not disappointed with it and not one of them could say they did not cry. We all agree this is the book to have on your shelf. It is a book that I feel everyone should read.
0143034901|5.0|Just wanted to chip in and say that I don't see what the recent criticism is about. I don't think the author is trying to put himself in the same league as A Hundred Years of Solitude or Dickens. What he has done is written a tale that, while fueled by perhaps a few too many coincidences, is thoroughly engaging. I found this book to be a pageturner that succeeds for a great many reasons. The main protagonist develops and grows up. The value of books and their meaning to their authors is central. The book has just a little bit of magic but not really very much.<br /><br />This book is a contemporary literary romance that like many of today's best pop songs, knows that it is part of a tradition and delivers the goods on hitting that tradition. This book transported me to a world of post war Spain, made me feel part of that world, and forced me to compare about compelling characters. I don't think it's a classic that we'll be reading years from now but I do feel this is thinking people's literary entertainment and there's everything right with that.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br />--SD
B0026SCMNM|1.0|I hated this book.  Nothing happens!  And, when something is about to happen, the author stops writing on that part of the sotry and moves to another story.  The ending, just ended!  Right when you thought, great, something is about to happen, the book ends.  The author \\"teases\\" you with innuendo that makes you think something, but never follows up on it.  I do not recommend this book.
0920668364|5.0|My Mom use to read this book to me when I was little and would always cry. I could never figure out why. Then when I was pregnant my Mom went through all my old children's books, found this and sent it to me. I now read it to my daughter and the first time I did I sobbed uncontrollably. Of course it was right after she was born and I still had all those crazy hormones. Now when I read it I just quietly cry at the end. It's about a Mother's love for her child. Something I didn't understand until I had my own child. Although I never plan to drive over to my children's houses with a ladder and climb up their window to rock them I will, through out the years say \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\"...just as my Mom still says to me.
1591843162|5.0|I've been a fan of Seth's writing since Purple Cow. His thoughts on marketing, business, and life have challenged me and people that I've worked with for several years.<br /><br />As I read Linchpin, I found myself scribbling note after note, marking up page after page, and tweeting quotes that really jumped out at me. At the heart of the book is the message that we are all geniuses with the potential to create great things-to be artists rather than cogs in a machine. Though I've been writing (and getting paid to do so) for more than eight years, I've never much thought of myself as an artist. Seth really challenged me to look at everything I do-even the stuff that doesn't feel like creativity or art--and figure out how to do it differently, better. And the reality is, with Seth's definition of artist, no matter what you do or who you are, you have the potential to be an artist:<br /><br />\\"Artists are people with a genius for finding a new answer, a new connection, or a new way of getting things done.\\"<br /><br />See, artists are the linchpin in an organization. They're the ones who are indispensable because they \\"bring humanity and connection and art\\" to the organization.<br /><br />The thing that stood out to me the most in Linchpin was the point that Seth made repeatedly about how our culture has been teaching us to be cogs and fit into the machines that are the factories (read: corporations). And while at one point in time our country was based on factory work and cogs fit very nicely, today what a company really needs in order to survive are the people who do not fit into a neat and orderly system-the people who are willing to create new ways of doing things, challenge the status quo, and shake things up.<br /><br />Honestly, while I think everyone in business (and especially leadership) needs to read this book, an even more important audience would be all the school administrators who continue to crank out the same plans to create the same cogs to fit into machines that no longer exist. It's a new world order, and in this world the linchpins will be the ones who rise to the top.world order, and in this world the linchpins will be the ones who rise to the top.
B0028RXXE8|2.0|I had not seen any parts of the series when I ordered it, and the reviews are generally positive, albeit mixed, so I was curious about the project. The first season starts out with an adventure of the two fictional indestructible, fairly flat supermacho heroes, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who pretty much hold center stage through the whole series. Historical events and characters are all too often overshadowed or supplanted by the fictional characters and their intrigues and (mis)deeds, in particular the two scheming and multi-layered superwomen Atia and Servilia. Needless to say, historical license abounds from beginning to end. Historical characters (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Cicero, Pompeius, Brutus, Cassius et al.) occasionally show some profile, sporadically even a bit of depth, but are by far not explored in their full potential. After all, Roman historiography has a wealth of source texts that could have been studied to provide deeper insight into these characters, their motivations and the impact of their actions and omissions on Roman history. We do get insights into the lives of the impoverished, but much of the focus is on the criminal underworld. Scriptwriting is very uneven and ranges from fair to abominable. The formulaic ingredients of copious (often brutal) sex and violence, blood and gore, suspense and soap are strategically placed and can become annoying or at least tedious.  Battle scenes are mostly abbreviated or filmically alluded to, perhaps for the better. But the fates of the thousands of unknown soldiers and bystanders who died for the greed and power hunger of their rulers are pretty much left in the dark. I had high hopes that the second season, produced by HBO in association with BBC, might show at least some aspirations to historical accuracy (not to mention good taste), but on the average it turns out to be of lesser quality than the first. Cleopatra is shown as a mindless, drug-addicted slut, her entourage, including the debauched Marcus Antonius, as a grotesque menagerie of creepy beings: all this can hardly reflect a small degree of historical accuracy. - The filmic realization (setting, props, locale, action, makeup, costumes etc.) appears to strive for some kind of Hollywood \\"neo-realism\\", distinctly (and thankfully) different from the sanitized creakers of yore &agrave; la \\"Cleopatra\\" (1963) and such, but somehow not quite credible in terms of a convincing realization of what might have been. The viewer is constantly aware that this is not the real ancient Rome, as it emerges from the historical texts, but a fantasy place created by and visualized through the lens of present-day filmmakers. All in all, this is at times entertaining, at times suspenseful and at times annoying fare which would have greatly benefited from a good team of scriptwriters, capable historical advisors and a much stronger accent on the representation of the \\"grand\\" historical narrative. As it stands, one is not too surprised that the project folded after two seasons, probably due to a lack of appeal to both the more sophisticated and the more basic audiences: there is not that much middle ground between these groups. In good conscience, I can not give it more than two stars.arcus Antonius, as a grotesque menagerie of creepy beings: all this can hardly reflect a small degree of historical accuracy. - The filmic realization (setting, props, locale, action, makeup, costumes etc.) appears to strive for some kind of Hollywood \\"neo-realism\\", distinctly (and thankfully) different from the sanitized creakers of yore à la \\"Cleopatra\\" (1963) and such, but somehow not quite credible in terms of a convincing realization of what might have been.

B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|I rated this a \\"3\\" because I thought the movie was watchable and, in some ways, i liked it. The premise was an interesting one and I liked some of the ways that things played out, but a few movies are beginning to overlap in my mind and show just how cyclical Hollywood is. The Gamer has the \\"controlling actions\\" that remind me of the Sims in some ways, and the idea behind this did that to me as well. It didn't help that there were some powerhouse names associated with the movie and that they couldn't redeem the project, either, leading me from the land of plenty to the land of \\"what the -.\\"<br /><br />As the movie began, I was there and wondering exactly what had happened. I was also wondering about the technological aspects of things, and the way that some things didn't fit well with others. As one reviewer noted, people drove around in junky cars all the time and yet there was this technology that allowed people to have their own Surrogates kicking it around town.<br />Confusing? Well, other parts of the movie do that as well.<br /><br />The bad thing was that the movie did like to make fun of its own concept, seemingly not really into the whole \\"we are the future\\" idea. This made me wonder about some things I saw, namely those that did not really offer up explanations. There are ways around that, too, simply ignoring the fact and saying \\"in the future, this is how things are.\\" That doesn't happen, though, and the loopholes in the movie are astounding.<br /><br />Should you watch it? You might enjoy the movie and you might not, but you will see the things that are obviously broken. Those little pieces are what hurts the movie, not to mention some slow \\"who is behind this nefarious plot\\" kinda stuff that make me a little tired. It wasn't baffling, wasn't hard to figure out, and it didn't leave me wanting more. Anything that was asked made me ask more as well, and that's never good.<br />So, should you watch it? Perhaps, but at your own risk.

B000UBMWG4|2.0|I am in the process of replacing all my HD-DVD's to Blu-Ray in order to reduce my equipment rack to a single Blu-Ray player.  I received my copy of the Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) in Blu-Ray.  The packaging indicates Dolby TrueHD is the primary sound track for the \\"Final Cut\\" disc of the movie.  However, there are only 2 sound tracks on the disc--Dolby Digital 5.1 and a stereo sound track for director commentary...no others; not even foreign language tracks.    The HD-DVD version of the \\"Final Cut\\" disc DOES include the Dolby TrueHD.  This appears to be an engineering oversight on the Blu-Ray version.  This is not acceptable.  The manufacturer MUST be aware of this.  As a result I cannot recommend that anyone waste [...] bucks on this collection.  I give the video 5 stars but the audio doesn't even warrant half a star so I'm giving it the average--2 stars.
B00004RITP|5.0|In today's popular culture there is no dearth of demands for attention.  Look at me, listen to me, watch me!!!  Ad nauseum!  Everyone's a star, everyone's the center of attention, everyone is a performer.  Thing is, people are so phony, so uninformed  and so plain flatout dumb, they're not worth a flash of our time.  For most people, one single intelligent thought, finely expressed, has an incredibly short half-life.  Itr just dies of lonliness.  Then there are the few great thinkers and doers in history.  Nationalities, religions and languages aren's important.  Content is.  When they speak we sould all listen, if, of course, we haven't forgotten how to.           Don't nobody call for the WHITE COATS, but Mahler has spoken to me many times, most profoulndly in his final symphony.  The Derryk Cooke final Performing Version is one of the 20th Century's true masterpieces and I never tire of hearing it.  There are several fine readings of the Agagio, itself THE completed symphony, and a couple of really nice Cooke 10ths but this newer Berlin Philharmonic treatment by  one of the most annoyingly demonstrative conductors working today, Sir Simon Rattle is a genuine treasure.  It just simply sings forth with such honest and manly emotion, that I can't imagine any true Romantic not being swept away by its beauty and sweetness.  Thankfully, Rattle is heard and not seen.           The opening adagio has just the right pacing and exspansiveness to allow all the beautiful BPO's string tone to fill our ears and the wind word is raturous and haunting.  The symhony's inner movements have never been my favorites, but they fit into Rattle's structure seemlessly and the wonderful Finale seems to be right on time.   We hear enough air around the inmstruments and the spatial sound resolution is delicately handled by the  EMI engineers.  I haven't heard any of Rattle's other Mahlers yet, but I suspect this may or may not be the best installment of the 10 symphony cycle.  Dispite his showboating and over the top exterior style, he has remarkable insight for a \\"young\\" conductor and I hope he continues to grow.           The additions in this Cooke Version, by Goldschmidt et al, are insignificant and unnecessary.  With or without them, this is magnificent music, straight from the heart, aimed right at the heart.  If you're a guy, like me, this is one of those man-to-man experiences that doesn't come around very often.  And, all you need is the cd, some equipment and prefeably some great speakers and tolerant neighboors.  This work works best at higher volume.  Sit back and let it wash over your heart.  A very enthusiastic 5 stars!!

B0000CABBW|5.0|In a native Maori New Zealand tribe, a set of twins are born into a long line of chiefs, the boy being the one  destined to carry on the lineage of warriors, but fate takes a hand and alters the future. Both mother and her newborn son die shortly after the birth and a baby girl is left behind to fulfill a legacy. The father, too distraught over the loss of his wife and newborn son leaves his daughter in his parents' care. From the moment she was born Paikea was a reminder to her grandfather Koro that there was no male to carry on generations of Maori chiefs. Paikea struggles to convince her grandfather that she does not have to be a male to be a great leader and that she is the one who is meant to carry on the tradition and will lead their people forward into the future. Her father returns home with news that he is an expectant father and asks Paikea to go back to Germany with him. When she hears the distant sounds of the whales, it was a call to turn around and go home to her village. Still she was unable to stir emotion in her sober-faced grandfather. When Koro gathers a group of young boys for training to seek out the next one who was to be the leader, Paikea seizes the opportunity to prove herself worthy to her grandfather. Koro refuses to see her as anything other than a 12 year old girl. She only succeeds in angering him further in her futile attempts to become a fighter. Koro's spirit is broken when neither of the two potential boys who were chosen to find the whale's tooth he tosses overboard is able to deliver. Paikea, who senses her grandfather's pain and disappointment, takes it upon herself to call to the ancestors when Koro's attempts fail. Paikea tests her faith once again when she invites her grandfather to a school production only to leave heartbroken with trophy in hand and tears in her eyes. There is a very strong sense of tradition, family, togetherness and spirituality that bonds the people of the Maori tribe. They are an indigenous group of people that all bans together for celebrations and share a close knit relationship and profound belief in their heritage and rituals. Their primal instincts give them the strength of one and a true sense of brotherhood. When  the next morning comes the village is awoken in horror at the sight of multiple beached whales on the shore.  In her final, desperate attempt, young Paikea risks her life and sets out to prove once and for all that she is brave and can be a great leader. She is determined to fulfill her destiny in spite of the odds, ready to join the ranks of her ancestors and become the next generation Whale Rider.

The concepts in this book weren't new to me but I thought that Tolle had an engaging style of explaining them that kept me interested. It was repetitive at times but I think someone who was learning about enlightenment and the principles of consciousness for the first time might need that repetition to reinforce them. Most of the book was theoretical - I would have like more concrete examples of how to implement the concepts in my own life. I did not do Oprah's online classes, perhaps those would have some.
1423119509|5.0|I found out about this book series through research and it sounded very interesting to me. I just started reading the first book, The Lightning Thief, and I am almost done with it. I noticed that it does kind of borrow ideas from the Harry Potter series, except in a Greek mythology fashion. I'm into Greek mythology and I know the series is for young children to teenagers, but this author did something unique: he wrote these books with an educational purspose in them. He portrays the greek mythology characters and their stories in the book, and tells a censored version of the character backgrounds. He also tosses in words that kids will not learn until they reach high school and college. Pretty much they are learning with out them even knowing they are. I am looking forward to reading the other books and recommend this series to anybody that is a fan of the harry potter series. Books come in a nice package, but books are hard to pull out of case; have to turn upside down and shake the books out. Other than that, this boxset is worth the money.
0756655730|5.0|I'm a big fan of visual presentations of information and over the past few years have purchased all of the major biology, wildlife, and evolution books that appealed to me.  This one stands head and shoulders over them all.  It is comprehensive, colorful, well-organized, entertaining, and informative.  No, not just informative--that makes it sound like a government pamphlet.  It is thrilling.  Life on earth has been so varied, so fantastical and stunning, that who would have thought that any book could adaquately capture it?  But \\"Preshistoric Life\\" manages to.  So good are the organism reconstructions that my girlfriend asked me how they could \\"get photos of those animals if they're extinct?\\" And she's the smartest person I know, so if she was fooled by their verisimilitude, you can believe the quality was exceptionally high.  And at the risk of sounding like a carnival barker, this book is fun for all ages.  I can't imagine a kid not becoming rapt by the astounding dinosaurs and other early animals, but it's also sophisticated enough to act as a reference tool for adults.  Best in class; highly recommended.
B00102F5WK|3.0|This film is highly engaging, well paced and skillfully filmed.  For that, and that only, I give it 3 stars.    Two flaws in the film are the selection of two male leads who look too much alike, for no apparent purpose in the film.  The other flaw was a supposedly clever surprise flashback, that the viewer finds impossible.  Why do that?    Yet, the real problem with this film is its message.  Not until the sappy/contrived ending do we find out that we've been lured into a trap to feel sorry for the misunderstood, wrongly-suspected, upstanding Muslims living among us here in America.    Maybe I should have seen it coming by the film's use of weepy instrumental music throughout.  Maybe I should have guessed that because the top American actress/actor is Meryl Streep, the message would once again be blame-America-first.  (Remember her in: Deer Hunter (1979), Silkwood (1983), A Cry In The Dark (1988)(blaming English-speaking Australia), First Do No Harm (1997), and Manchurian Candidate (2004).)    By use of flashing from one scene to the other, the movie presents a dual climax.  The one storyline is the \\"likeable\\" young Muslim lover guy... strapped with bombs... who sheds tears as he walks toward the father of his girlfriend to blow him up along with the entire village square.  Pardon me if I don't wipe a tear from my own eye, moved by his \\"love\\" for his approaching girlfriend.  Nor did I get a tear for the girlfriend who apologetically pleads for him to consider sparing her about-to-be-killed father (no, she does not warn her father).    The other crescendo scene (interspersed with the \\"likeable\\" terrorist climax) is the unjaded wooden-faced American CIA upstart courageously rescuing an Egyptian-born abductee.  By this late scene of the movie, the viewer is supposed to have joined with this CIA onlooker to be disgusted by the torture techniques (done for the USA, but in a Muslim country).  The viewer is supposedly convinced that the Americanized bomb scientist who just happened to have been in frequent contact with Muslim terrorists, is obviously innocent (because he says he is).    While this movie was in the making, I was shown (along with a group of other attorneys) a proposed movie clip of a Muslim detainee pleading his case in a similar \\"rendition\\" courtroom.  That script matched this movie's script almost word for word.  We were then treated to a telephone conference with one of the actors.  While denying he had any agenda, he suggested that all such detainees are as wrongly suspected as the character in their theatrical creation.    These propaganda efforts offer a thin veil to, not just alternative reasonable views, but to the world's most intentionally violent and vindictive group.    Maybe Meryl Streep's next movie can take on the personal challenge of presenting something she likes about America.
B002ECN4P0|1.0|I eagerly bought this CD wanting to get a good compilation of Stones Music. I popped it in my car as soon as I got it. At first I thought it was my car stereo, but my home stereo and computer got the same results. Something is just WRONG with these recordings. I mean WRONG! For one thing, the vocal track on each song sounds reduced in volume, so sometimes you can't even hear Mick. Another thing is some of the songs have an audible fuzzy noise that sounds like your speakers are blown.<br /><br />It just doesn't sound like the Rolling Stones I grew up with. I think that either there are bootlegs out there and I got one, or someone remastered these songs quite poorly.<br /><br />If you got different results than I, please write a review. I hate this CD and won't play it again. I hope I just got ripped off for the Stones sake.

B00064WSNM|5.0|Having bought this LP way back in 1974, I have always considered (and still do) that what on the LP was Side 2 (Starless and Bible Black and Fracture) are authentic masterpieces and have always been amazed by the fact that they were live improvisations!<br />Side 1 is good too!<br />I hope this is also released in the future in 5.1 surround... I think I can die after that!<br /><br />\\"This Night Wounds Time\\"
B002QW7ALM|4.0|For a while I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with the movie.  It seemed to be an odd mishmash of Alien meets Saw meets the Cube trilogy, and I don't totally buy Dennis Quaid in a sci fi horror movie.  But I stuck with it because I wanted to see what had gone wrong and how these humans were going to get out of this mess, trapped as they are on a ship with murderous creatures on board that were never supposed to be there.<br /><br />It turned out to be worth it.  Without ruining the ending, I will just say that it worked out logically and still had a good twist which was not at all predictable.
B002ASVYWS|5.0|This album is great; buy it today.  If you like rock music, I don't think there is any possiblity that you will not enjoy and appreciate this album.  I think this is the one of the best albums to come out in many years.  It's multi-layered and you will appreciate it more and more every time you listen to it.  The whole album is solid.  It's filled with great tracks, all unique in their own way, building up to the final two 10-minute long epic journeys.  I give this album 9/10, as it's about as perfect of an album as I've ever seen, up there with the best.  I loved the first album, which is pretty much just the work of the guitarist and drummer; a great little rock album.  Now they went out and got an amazing drummer and bass player, and they put out this amazing album... it's kind of like when Tool got Justin Chancellor and put out Aenema (then Lateralus & 10,000 days); the quality of the music intensified threefold. I expect these guys to get big when the come to the US around February to promote the release of the album here; I'll be at their show if they come to Chicago!
0061914177|5.0|I bought Gary's book way back in the pre-sell days.  I have been following his work for a couple of years now and I was really looking forward to finally getting a little more in depth view on his success.<br /><br />I have spent a decent amount of time reading through the reviews here so I will go at this in two parts-<br /><br />MY OWN OPINION-<br />I bought the book already knowing the brand and the man behind it (as well as I can know him from online interactions anyhow....) and intrigued to learn more.  I also understand the \\"functionality\\" of using social media to build a brand so I wasn't necessarily looking for the nuts and bolts but more for the theory and ideas behind the actions.<br />I think Gary did a great job at telling his story in context of the book's purpose.  He included a lot of his life's history in the book to support his idea's which I saw as a welcome addition, instead of boring drivel about blahblahblah.com and so forth.<br />After reading the book I felt inspired and ready to take on the world.  I didn't feel as though I gained much knowledge about the workings of social media but I believe this was Gary's intent when he sat down to write.  After all, there are more than enough places to learn how to use facebook, twitter, etc. and if you're having trouble figuring them out just ask a teenager.....<br />As this was part of a multiple book deal I expect we will see more coming in the way of ideas and thoughts and not instruction.  We live in a day and age that anyone with the desire can learn to do just about anything.  Gary's book just encourages you to share what you learn with the world.<br />On another note, I was lucky enough to pick up the book when Gary was offering up a bonus.  The communication from Gary (haven't had an unreturned email or tweet yet) and the package I was sent (worth over twice the price of the book) sold me for life on Gary's books.  Maybe you should pre-sell the other nine books right now.....this was the best $15 bucks I've spent on a book yet.<br /><br />COMMENTS ON OTHER REVIEWS-<br />In the negative comments I see many folks saying that there was no step by step or how-to in the book (there was, it was short, you probably missed it, look again).  As mentioned, I don't think that is what he wanted to deliver.  After all, the title says \\"Why NOW is the time to cash in on your passion\\".  If it was a how-to book it might have read \\"How to cash in on your passion right now\\".  If you bought the book expecting something different then it doesn't mean he didn't deliver what was advertised.<br />As for him coming from a wealthy family (although I didn't get that impression) maybe he has an advantage over some.  Maybe it would take someone less fortunate to use the ideas a little longer than Gary did.  Maybe they don't have the money to pay a designer for a website, hire an assistant, buy a camera or anything else.  The point of the book is to share your passion, last time I checked that didn't cost anything, which brings us right back to the point of the book- the cost of entry is so low today that anyone can do it!<br /><br />And if you didn't like this book, don't spend your money on the other leader in the category- [[ASIN:0470743085 Trust Agents: Using the Web to Build Influence, Improve Reputation, and Earn Trust]]<br /><br />C Jolly<br />misterfnygy.comCOMMENTS ON OTHER REVIEWS-  In the negative comments I see many folks saying that there was no step by step or how-to in the book (there was, it was short, you probably missed it, look again).

B002VWNICW|4.0|I like this version of Pride & Prejudice and love Kiera Knightly, but it honestly can't hold a candle to the 1995 BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle now also out on Blu Ray.  That newly restored HD release is simply breath taking (and I'm not that big of chick flick fan!).  To each his or her own obviously, but I recomend the five hour BBC version!
B000I2JDEY|5.0|It's a classic.  \\"Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolfe?\\" brought back black and white as a film media and broke the language code of Hollywood allowing more realism in adult situations.
6305972591|4.0|Classic film by a classic writer. It started with Carrie then it went from there. I dont think there is one bad movie that King has ever did.    Made in 84' Its a story about a town that is overun by a group of cult children. They kill off there parents and act crazy all round. The kids meet up in the middle of a cornfield and they all bow down to this figure they call the blue man. Isaac is the leader of the cult group. If you join there group there is no leaving. If you try and leave they kill you.    This is a real scary tail. King will take you to hell and back with this movie. If you like Kings other work I think that you should give this movie a try. Pick it up at amazon.
B002T921AC|5.0|I bought this CD for my granddaughter for Xmas, both her & her sister listen to it everyday:-)They Love him, she just turned 10....lol
B0000509C4|5.0|Wow, thats all that I really need to say. This was one of the first horror movies I ever seen and it is also one of my alltime favorites.   It is just like the first one except this movie has only three storys to it instead of five. But the movie is still really good.   Made in 87' The first story is called Old Chief Wooden Head. It is a really good story of a wooden Indian that gets his revenge on three thiefs. The second is called The Raft. Its about three friends that go and party on a raft in the middle of a lake. But there is something else in the water with them..... The last and my favorite story is called the Hitchhiker. Its about a woman that runs over a bum/drifter and kills him. The man comes back haunting her.   I think this one is just as good as the first one. Pick it up at amazon.
B001QOGYBS|5.0|I enjoy a wide range of films. Movies are, and always have been a big part of my everyday life. Every now and then a movie comes along that can only be described as a masterpiece. Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of those films. The dialog was tight and witty, animation style was spot on, the plot was well developed, and the voices fit the characters well. Yes, I know that it was a British book set in an obviously British town and most of the main characters spoke with American accents.  But you must remember....it's comedy, not a historical documentary. The cast did a great job brining these characters to life. I saw this movie several times in the theater and have preordered the Blu-Ray. I can't wait to watch this truly fantastic movie again.
B00005K3O4|4.0|I just bought this movie and watched it and I think more people shouldnt know about this movie. This is another one of those movies that should be so hard to find   Made in 88' Its a story about a couple that goes to make out in there car. Then they see something fall from the sky. They are not sure what it is so they go and check it out. What they found shocked them. It was a circus tent. what comes with a circus, clowns. In this case Killer Klowns...From Outer Space. The clowns go and take over the town. They take over the town fast killing the people. Can the two couple save the rest of the towns people from these killer clowns.  I think if you like cheesy horror movies you should pick this one up. If you dont, maybe look elsewhere. Pick it up at amazon.

B00004X10B|5.0|I'm a serious amateur photographer and needed a base camp for all of my photography goodies.  This bag allows me to keep everything together and I pull from there whatever I need for whatever shoot I plan on doing that day.  It has tons of pockets and all of my 5 lenses, filters, and lots of other stuff fits in there nicely.  It closes quite securely and is well padded.  Love it.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|i like them, but i think they should stick out a bit less. in response to the guy that said that they pinched him i have had this happen, but only if i hold my hand in a weird way, so i wouldn't worry about that. i recommend that everyone try these. If you don't like em what have you lost really?
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Without debating the merits of the original music, the remastering on this CD is nothing short of phenomenal. No, it is not an exact recreation of the original, compressed 4 track recording on vinyl. That muddy warm sound was state of the art for its day, but that day is over. This newly remastered CD sounds so fresh, so cutting edge, that it unchains the original LP and makes it relevant again. Sgt. Pepper has been called the greatest rock album of all time. Now 21st century fans will be able to judge for themselves. It's still one of the baddest kids on the block, the rocket launcher for all modern rock.
B00003CX8N|4.0|Good addition to my collection of Hopkins Movies. But wasn't the best movie he's ever done.
0786838655|4.0|Being a lover of Greek mythology, I approached Percy Jackson with interest. Will this series satisfy, or will it displease?  Well if you're not American, some things at the beginning may make your guts churn in protest. Wow, wow, whoa. The Greek gods are now in the USA because it's the centre of Western civilization now? It seems a bit silly I laughed, but my laughter stopped dead when I thought that, well, if I were the author and I wanted to make the Greek gods to live in Indonesia right now, I would find a way to justify my story. And anyway, later a character will state that the Western civilization is deteriorating the world, so no more discussion on that from me for now. I need to read the other books to see whether Riordan really has something to say about this Western civilization' thing or it's just a way to explain the settings.   In my opinion, although I have read only one Percy Jackson book I already begin to think that this series is more interesting than Fowl. I can't stop thinking about this because of the frequent comparisons between the two. (Well, we can't always have Harry Potter as a standard.) Percy Jackson is fast-paced, and because we see the world through Percy's eyes, the narration feels fluid and lively. That, and because Percy itself is an interesting character: dyslexic, suffering from ADHD, cynical, inevitably funny. (Yes, there's an explanation also for the godlings' dyslexia and ADHD.) Another thing I like from the book is how the godlings - well, at least Percy and Annabeth at the moment - try to shake free of the inherited hate between their parents. Just because their father and mother are not in good terms, it doesn't mean that their children may not become good friends. If there's anything that may ruin your fun in reading, it's how predictable some things turn out. But all in all, I recommend this book for lovers of fantasy and mythology. And now I have high expectations toward the next books.
055380684X|5.0|What suprised me about the book was how easy it was to apply \\"Talent Code\\" principals in both the classroom and the practice room.    The real information in the book could be condensed to about 30 pages. Most of the space is deticated to examples, supporting evidence, and repitition.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|This is truly an amazing documentary not just about the electric guitar but how it really speaks. Hearing about 3 musicians from different eras and different styles and how the guitar effected them is amazing. I love Jack White and Jimmy Page, but not such a huge Edge fan. Their stories were the most catching to me but maybe because I am a bit biased to them. If you like music even a bit you need to watch this movie.
1591843162|5.0|This is another great book from Seth Gooding.  I waited for it with anticipation for several weeks and was delighted when it arrived.  As a professional marketer of many years I am not the least bit ashamed to title Seth a \\"Guru\\".  He gets you think about things from a different and interesting perspective.  Buy this book - and read Permission Marketing - or re-read it.  Highly relevant!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Why pay money for a poor transfer?  Wait until the re-release!      This sort of studio avarice is akin to that of the distributors of Lord of the Rings, who will release a Blu-ray in the shorter thetrical version in April, only to snatch more of your money by releasing the longer definitive version within the next 12 months thereafter.
1843106698|1.0|I purchased this book after it was recommended to me as the best book about Asperger's Syndrome.  Imagine my dismay when I found it riddled with generalizations and stereotypes of 'normal' children, and many incorrect assumptions about all 'normal' children's reasoning abilities.  That sets the tone for the entire book, how 'normal' children can do just about everything correctly all the time, and children with Asperger's Syndrome can't possibly do anything unless the world stops and adapts to these children.<br /><br />So, now my copy is full of red arrows, question marks, and I've yet to find one useful piece of information in there that would actually help a child with Asperger's Syndrome.<br /><br />I didn't read every single word of it, mainly because Attwood seems to go around in circles about certain characteristics, so that I felt I was reading the same information over and over and over again.  The guide is certainly complete (a few time over, actually) and if you have a bad case of insomnia, it works wonders.<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my money on it, but feel free to check it out at your local library.
0307266303|5.0|I'm not a runner. I have worked out my whole life and tried to stay fit and healthy, but I'm not a hardcore runner. I never believed running was necessary for fitness and health. This book changed my mind.     I always enjoyed the treadmill or sprinting for cardio work though and this book explains why. I avoided it b/c I was worried about the injuries associated with running, especially since I had foot problems from playing basketball and football. Or even walking the golf course and this book goes into the injuries and what has happened to our feet.     But it is so much more than that. It is an adventure story ripe with great characters, great setting, and a great \\"plot.\\"  I say 'plot' because sometimes it is hard to believe this story is true!
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell, a writer for the New Yorker (wonderful articles on NFL concussions and NYC rubber rooms in 2009), released this book in the fall of 2008. It spent a few months on the non-fiction best seller list. Gladwell explains that stories of success are usually much more complicated than people (or the media) often make them appear. He writes that the American arch-type of the self-made man is really a myth, and that a great deal of success is often the result of a mixture of time, parents, practice, opportunity and chance.<br /><br />(1) A brilliant point that he offers is that 14 of the 75 richest people in world history (translated into 2008 dollars) were Americans born in the 1830's. He cites that they had to be young enough to avoid the pre-civil War mind-set but old enough to take advantage of the opportunities that Wall Street, the railroads and industrial manufacturing provided between 1865 and 1880. This was one of his several examples about the importance of being born at the right time.<br /><br />(2) Gladwell explained how most of the European immigrants who ended up in NYC in the late 1800's and early 1900's did not have a skill or trade. The Jews that came from Eastern Europe usually had some experience with clothing; as a result, NYC was the world center of garment making during the first half of the 20th century, and the new businesses that sprung up and flourished were almost entirely owned and run by Jews. The children of garment workers (and owners) learned the importance of persuasion, hustle, shrewdness and long hours. Many garment workers' children became professionals, such as doctors and lawyers.<br /><br />(3) He forwards the \\"10,000\\" rule in chapter 2 and cites that the Beatles were on stage for about 10,000 hours in Hamburg, Germany, and that experience transformed them into a band that could play lots of songs in a variety of different styles. Bill Gates also had 10,000 hours of practice on a computer in the late 60's, and Mozart wrote music for about 10,000 hours before he started turning out his greatest work.<br /><br />(4) The Beatles were given the opportunity to play in Hamburg because of the relationship that a booking agent from Liverpool had with some Germans. Gates had access to a computer because of where he grew up (going to a rich school that was close to the University of Washington) and who he knew (a friend's parents got them 24 hour access to computers around Seattle). Chris Langan, an American with an IQ of 195, never had many opportunities, and so his brain was largely squandered (which Gladwell details in his chapter \\"The Trouble with Geniuses, Part I\\").<br /><br />(5) There is a huge amount of luck that runs through all of these pieces. Working at something for 10,000 hours is individually driven, but timing, parents and opportunity has nothing to do with being self-made.<br /><br />Gladwell writes in the same style as ESPN's Bill Simmons (whose latest book he wrote the intro for). He is easy to follow, he is funny and he uses a great deal of footnotes. The great flaw in Gladwell's work is that while his arguments and connections are interesting and make sense, they are not driven by research or that much hard data. He relies on anecdotal stories and hammering his points repeatedly. He rarely provides an opposing view to his points.rote music for about 10,000 hours before he started turning out his greatest work.<br /><br />(4) The Beatles were given the opportunity to play in Hamburg because of the relationship that a booking agent from Liverpool had with some Germans.

0385504225|2.0|Contains Spoilers!!!!   As someone who really enjoyed both the Da Vinci Code and especially Angels and Demons I was initially very excited for this book to come out. However as I began reading it just wasn't holding my attention. This book spends A LOT of time explaining historical background and there is not a lot of action, and when there is it seems drawn out and silly to a degree. There were several different points through out the book that I simply found myself bored. This is something that never happened in the other two Robert Langdon novels.   Another problem I have with this book is the presence of so many different sub-plots that don't do anything to advance the characters or major plots. The whole aspect of the tattoo guy being Peter's son, I saw no real point to that. The presence of Noetic Science seemed to have no real link as well. In Angels and Demons the science was woven into the plot very well but in this one it kind of just makes an appearance every once in a while with no plot connections.    I do have to say that the overall idea of the story is not a bad one. It was just not told in the best way. I did sort of like the characters of Directer Soto, and Dean Galloway, but the others seemed rather flat, even Robert. I think a lot of Dan Brown fans will be a little disappointed with The Lost Symbol. I know I was. I hope his next one is more up to par with DC and A&D.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is by far one of my Favorite Shows in a Very long Time. I love the cast (Craig Horner, Bridget Regan, Bruce Spence) and Sam Rami (Who did Drag me to hell, the Spider-Man Movies and The Evil Dead Movies as well As Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules The Legendary Journeys). And now with the New Second Season with a New cast member Cara (Tabrett Bethell) it's just as good if not better then season 1 I can't wait for the future of this show.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen!<br /><br />Bland, boring, poor script/story not even Mr Willis could save, I couldnt wait for it to end, and when it did... I spent the rest of the day wishing I was dead. Yes, thats how bad this movie is!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I loved this novel, and I am doubtful it will ever leave me.  However, it was one of the most bittersweet stories I've ever read.  For the entire last quarter of the book, I cried.  And...I don't remember ever crying during a book!!  Fabulous read, but be prepared for a hard ending.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Celtic Women - Songs From The Heart is more than great music you HEAR, it's great music you FEEL.  Awesome.
0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol is a fitting followup to Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code. It share with previous books all the elements of ancient secrets, a scavenger hunt through history, loathsome villians, and cliff-hanger transitions (though, thankfully the Lost Symbol cliff-hangers are not so annoying, but rather help the pace of story-telling.<br /><br />I really like where the story ends up with a world of possibility wide open to human potential. The seeds were planted early in the story and find ample development and realization in the epilogue. I enjoyed the several days in the world of intrigue Dan Brown created.

Thanks Amazon Rest in peace Michael. P.S. you won't be sorry if you get this.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this CD and was very surprised to find How Great Thou Art, Amazing Grace and Silent Night as song choices. I thought this very bold and in line with who I thought Susan Boyle to be. From the moment she stepped on the stage, she had a confidence and a knowing about her purpose that is unlike many. She was made fun of and didn't really care. She was focused on her dream and didn't let the opinions of shallow people penetrate who she thought she was or what she was meant to do. She is the perfect example of a diamond in the rough. We can learn a lot about life by her example. Not only is her voice powerful and pure, the positive light that is behind it, her attitude, her humility and determination continues to inspire me. I love this CD because the music is good, the lyrics are meaningful and most of all because the person singing it is the most sincere person the music business has come across in a long time. They don't make people like Susan anymore. She is truely one of a kind and has a clear purpose to bless people with inspiration and hope. I wish her the greatest success from here and forward and may she always stay as grounded and real as she is today.  God bless you Susan  Kris

B002SF9YUM|5.0|Beautifully evocative of the 1920's, just a gorgeous film. Tailored clothes, period cars, and location shooting along with a talented cast and poetic script make this a sensuous journey to another age and culture.<br /><br />Although the film focuses more on the poet Lorca than Dali, it perfectly captures the free-wheeling artistic milieu and the fervor of young artists finding themselves, creating environments with words, paint, costumes to express who they are.<br /><br />If you are old and cynical you may not appreciate the beauty and sense of exploration and discovery of new worlds expressed by the young artists.  The film inspired me to read more about Dali, Lorca and the art scene of the time. Every moment Robert Pattinson was on camera, from the moment of his entrance in linen ruffles and riding boots, you couldn't take your eyes off him. Pattinson captured the complexity, intelligence and artistic sensibility of this artist, along with his (probably necessary) narcissistic and self-aggrandizing temperament. (Don't all artists need the belief in their genius to promote their art, rather than to end up crazy, cutting off their ears?)<br /><br />It was disappointing that there were only 4 extras on the DVD, which consist of interviews with the director, screenwriter, and two actors. It would have been great to see some behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes or an audio commentary.<br /><br />Recommended for a dreamy night spent in another time, another country, being other people.

These really aren't intended to be played & some even came with a disclaimer explaining that the quality was inferior to the black vinyl. There will be far more pops & cracks with the picture discs. For the most part I have never played my picture discs mainly because I didn't want to damage my quite expensive Ortofon stylus.

Tailored clothes, period cars, and location shooting along with a talented cast and poetic script make this a sensuous journey to another age and culture.<br /><br />Although the film focuses more on the poet Lorca than Dali, it perfectly captures the free-wheeling artistic milieu and the fervor of young artists finding themselves, creating environments with words, paint, costumes to express who they are.<br /><br />If you are old and cynical you may not appreciate the beauty and sense of exploration and discovery of new worlds expressed by the young artists.  The film inspired me to read more about Dali, Lorca and the art scene of the time.<br /><br />Only complaint was on my version there were only 4 extras (interviews); would have been great to see some behind-the-scenes footage or an audio track.<br /><br />Recommended for a dreamy night spent in another time, another country, being other people.
006621131X|2.0|I guess I just like my celebrity bios with a little more intrigue and scandal, and you'd think with Robert Mapplethorpe as one of the main characters, you'd have that, but no.  This is a boring, low-key love note from Patti about Robert and their days in the Chelsea Hotel, full of name dropping without the relevant story development.  And as if to drive home the point that she IS an intellectual who reads French, there were a ZILLION references to Rimbaud and Genet.  We get it, Patti.  You've read their work.  I just rolled my eyes at each new mention of their names.  She tries to see everything through this one-note lens.  Blah.<br /><br />I knew when I was 2/3 of the way through the book and we were still in 1970 that I wouldn't be getting a true picture of Mapplethorpe's (or her) life.  In fact, she completely skips over her entire career (and most of his) and goes straight to his death.<br /><br />This book will leave you wanting much more.  It's empty calories.  Skip it.
B00168OIOE|4.0|\\"Monsters, Inc.\\":  4-Disc Edition (BluRay/DVD combo)<br />(Pixar)<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Great movie, one of the best. I first saw it in the theater when it came out, in Emeryville, CA, near the Pixar studios and they had a ginormous, life-sized Sully in the lobby.. With real fur!  So cool... but the movie was even better.<br /><br />I am knocking a point off this particular edition, however, because it's not quite the bargain I thought it would be.  When I wanted to purchase \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" for my kid, and saw that they had an affordable combo pack that had both DVD and Blu-Ray versions, I thought, well, I might get a Blu-Ray someday, so that could come in handy. Yeah, I'll get it!  Unfortunately, the DVD disc does not also include the same material as the Blu-Ray, so a bunch of games and bonus features are not included, which really bummed my daughter out.  These features were already embedded in the old DVD edition: Disney has purposely *removed* them in order to steer customers towards the new format. As a consumer, I resent this enormously, and I think other potential buyers might want to know that the DVD version has been downgraded and will not be as much fun for your kid as you might hope.  Disney is being needlessly manipulative with its product: why not just give us a package that really is in *both* formats?<br /><br />It's still a great movie, though!!  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />(PS.... Sorry, but Amazon aggregates reviews of different formats all together in one review pool.  If I hadn't had issues with the DVD/Blu-Ray bundling, I would have given this a ten-star review.  Same problem with \\"Up\\" too, by the way.)
B0026P3G12|4.0|My husband was so pleased with this CD.  He played it all Christmas day.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Engaging story lines, solid acting for what it is.  If you liked Lord of the Rings, you'd probably like this.
B000E0WJIC|2.0|The Poison is probably the most generic rock album (or heavy metal, if you wish) you will EVER hear.     Some people might actually believe this kind of music is saving the rock scene, or setting a good example for the future of rock and roll, but... I strongly disagree. It's just lingering the generic arena rock formula even *longer* than it really needs to go, that's all.  No originality here folks, move along please.    Bullet for My Valentine likes to combine those dreaded screamer-type vocals with normal alternative rock vocal melodies (the latter obviously more tolerable and the reason the album isn't getting a big fat zero) but to be perfectly honest, blending the two styles together is sort of like combining a big milkshake with a greasy hoagie- you know what's gonna happen sooner or later.    Pertaining to the majority of the Poison album, the results are definitely a mixed bag most likely as a result of the frequent dabbling of those annoying screamer vocals.  Those vocals seriously *have* to go starting right now in this very point in time.    Besides, taking alternative rock vocals and mixing them with obnoxious screamer vocals has been done thousands of times by this point, for over 10 years now, so I fail to see what's supposed to make Bullet for My Valentine stand apart from the rest, and why this album is getting more praise than other, identical efforts by other bands. This is just typical commercial alternative rock done without the creative edge, and nothing more.     What's surprising to me above all else is how people are somehow hearing melodic vocals and guitar riffs. Really? I guess the Iron Maiden ripoff guitar solos are sort of catchy, and the vocal melodies ripped from Green Day albums are alright I suppose, but that's it.     Please avoid this album.
B000UPSKO8|4.0|This concert was very entertaining.Four wonderful singers and great orchestra leader. Over two hours of wonderful arias! I recommend this highly.
B001TW68P4|5.0|An American band from the 60's with an upbeat tempo that even the younger people of today will enjoy. The music from the 1960's is some of the best music ever made! I really like this CD tremendously. The Turtles have an awesome rock n' roll sound that you will love forever. I personally like their sound even better than the Beatles and that is saying a lot!! The music from the Turtles is so positive and enjoyable that you just want to sing along with them.  The Turtles keep their upbeat musical style throughout the CD. These songs never grow old and I highly recommend this CD for your collection. If your having a bad day at work, just put this CD on and you will forget all about it!! Take care and enjoy as life is too short!
B000002KKC|5.0|From the moment this CD, lead largely by Buckingham, kicks off it has every FW melody that could swoon Harry Conick.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife isn't pretty at all, it's plain and simple.  It's not light, it's not stainless, but it's awesome!  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the knife you need when you run out of bullet's for hunting/survival.  It didn't come razor sharp, but then again I didn't expect it to.  It did come sharp enough to split a whole lot of wood on my patio though.  After I split the wood, I tried to throw it into my fence like my other knife's.  Not a good idea cause it hit flat and knocked off the darn picket into my neighbor's yard, still would've hurt pretty bad if it hit someone.  My neighbor then  came over and was admiring it so much that he ordered one from his Iphone right then and there. After we whacked all the tree limbs off that we could reach I got a stone out and put a nice edge on it.  If you want a knife that will last that you can beat the hell out of, this is it, yeah it's not stainless and the finish wears off but so what!?  At this price it's just an awesome knife to have when SHTF!
B002ZIAC4O|5.0|i've been listening to Four Tet since...well, since whenever he started recording. always loved (much of) the music.<br />the new album is absolutely delicious; moody, dreamy, funky.<br />a must-have album (and i don't say that often...).
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I enjoyed this album for a few reasons.  Looking at some influences I feel they had, Heep have had recovered (redone) every album every time a new vocalist has come on board.  But here we have an example of how simple it is to just go back...\\"76 Heeps Very Eavy Very Umble type album (note the keyboards very Heep, so do I hear Ozzy ( I also hear a similar tone in Mastodon as well), yes and Black Sabbath as well the real dark typical old rock, and then, of course so is Zep in there...but more disctictley the White Stripes come to mind.    I just cannot understand why they and some bands have to use the distortion to make it sound old...but anyway the effect does contribute to golden days...but for us who came up the scratchy LP and hissy cassette and got the CD or as Geddy Lee of Rush says those little round thingies it does annoy us a little as you wonder if your  stereo is packing up and are tempted to clean the stylus and put the Dolby button on...    The album good non the less, good to have \\"new\\" rock coming to the fore...so why the Answer well what was the question?  ...Oh yes The Answer also have come unannounced with good old solid rock...please follow my link to other comments    If you like this album then you will like the Answer and I recommend Tinyfish as well...enjoy he hatch...Cosmic Egg...boy I can't wait for mine its the deluxe version       Byt the way if you enjoy Zeppelin please listen to Rushes first album simply called Rush, it was there debute...Why?    Look what they became 32 years later!!! What an answer to Wolfmother Questions and Heeps of answers on Sabbath days just leaves no Stripes!!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Like many other Disney Classics such as Fantasia, Bambi and Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland was not a smash success when it premiered in 1951. Adapted from the famous books from Lewis Carroll, the movie has an inmense challenge to please fans of the books and moviegoers in general. While it failed in its initial run, Alice has now grown in popularity and now it is regarded like a Disney Classic with some of the best animation that had ever come from the studio.<br /><br />While not a straight adaptation of the Lewis Carroll's books (which Disney film is?), Alice in Wonderland takes what works in screen and transforms it in an amazing environment. Wonderland is truly an accomplishment in animation as are the characters that populated it. Full of bright colors you have some of the best artwork that has come from Disney before or since. The humor is great, the characters are memorable and the story maintains you hooked up most of the time. The problem with Alice is the pacing. While some sequences like the Mad Tea Party are spectacular, others like the Tulgey Wood one is a downer and detracts viewers from the whole experience. Still, the movie does more right than wrong and is non-sensical creative enteratinment that will delight everyone. I liked the Tim Burton version, but the Walt Disney version has something more magical and whimsical that makes it superior in every regard to its live-action counterpart.<br /><br />Finally, Disney released Alice in Wonderland on Blu-Ray commemorating its 60th anniversary and what a release it is!!!<br /><br />Video & Audio<br /><br />WOW! WOW! WOW!, that's all I can said for the video quality of Alice. Disney has really outdone itself with this restorarion. The picture is inmaculate, bright, clear with no artifacts or compression issues whatsoever. Colors literally pop out the screen. A magical transfer for a magical film.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also a great audio if not spectacular. But, you can't expect a 60 year old film to hear like Inception. Still, this lossless mix is very appropiate for the film and is far superior than previous remixes.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />You have all the DVD carry overs like the \\"Reflections on Alice\\" featurette, deleted scenes, trailers, art galleries, \\"An Hour in Wonderland\\" program now in HD and much much more.<br /><br />New to this release is one of the best state-of the art documentaries called: \\"Through the Keyhole: A companion's guide to Wonderland\\". Much like the \\"Inside Walt's Story Meetings\\", this documentary delves on everything that concerns the production of the film and its releation with the book. We have Carroll's historians, Disney's historians and Disney animators who talk about who was Lewis Carroll, why he wrote the book and all the producion of the Disney film. An excellent piece that nobody should miss. In addition we have a live-action reference footage and a pencil test which are introduced by Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice), you also have a Walt Disney color introduction and an interactive game.<br /><br />A DVD is also offered and while it looks great, its vastly inferior to the quality of the BD.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br /><br />With each passing year, it seems that Alice grows in reputation and deservely so. The film is really an amazing journey though imagination. With spectacular (and I mean SPECTACULAR) picture and sound and a great amount of bonus features, including a fantatstic documentary, Alice in Wonderland on BD is highly recommended to everyone.d film to hear like Inception.

0812973992|5.0|Magnificently written, though slow to get started, this relaxed wide-ranging novel paints a number of vignettes of people in New York City on or just after August 7, 1974, when for three quarters of an hour Philippe Petit walked on a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. Most of the book concerns people on the edges of society -- an Irish monk who has come to work among prostitutes in the Bronx, a pair of struggling artists, a support group of mothers who have lost their sons in Vietnam -- though one of these is the wife of a judge living in a Park Avenue penthouse. There are also some wonderful side panels, such as a group of computer programmers in California cold-calling pay phones in NYC to obtain a first-hand account from people on the ground.<br /><br />One word of warning. This is not a book to start (as unfortunately I did) if you do not have time on your hands. The early chapters are almost novella length, and apparently unconnected. Though totally absorbing in themselves, they do not yet provide much forward momentum. It is only halfway through, as the chapters get shorter and the connections between characters begin to emerge, that the richness of this multi-voiced tale becomes fully apparent, and the novel accelerates towards a quiet wrap-up of the 1974 events and a gentle epilogue 32 years later. In all, McCann shows an impressive stylistic range, held together by a deep non-judgmental humanity, making him a Tolstoy for our times.<br /><br />I see that I am not alone in thinking of Tom Wolfe's [[ASIN:0312427573 THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES]] (1984), another New York panoply that brings together people from different walks of life; I am not sure if the expressway accident which plays a significant role in both books was intended as an oblique homage. But McCann's novel is less melodramatic, less tightly plotted, and not at all concerned with flaunting an insider status. Its relative looseness is indeed its strength, finding a quiet wisdom in everyday epiphanies. I am reminded too of the wonderful way in which Michael Cunningham wove almost-unconnected stories together in [[ASIN:0312305060 THE HOURS]] (1998), especially in the mood of its New York sections, and even more of what Virginia Woolf did for London in [[ASIN:0156030357 MRS DALLOWAY]] (1925).<br /><br />Like Woolf, McCann also opens his book on a crisp sunlit morning, with a moment of wonder literally in the air. He uses it to focus and refract the lives of relatively ordinary people down below, and reveal their individuality that makes tham anything but ordinary. And although this is never explicitly mentioned, the book brackets the memory of another bright morning by the twin towers, when ordinary New Yorkers were once again shown in extraordinary light.y epiphanies.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|The Forerunner 405cx is my first Forerunner, and overall I'm thrilled to have it. I wanted it primarily for distance and pace measurement, and only after 9 months of owning it am I beginning to use it for other things.     I like all of the basic things -- time it takes to establish connection to the satellite; readability of the screen; the myriad things I can measure mid-run. On a day-to-day basis, this watch works great for me. I would recommend it to anyone who's a serious runner. I was nervous that having it would turn me into a neurotic (I hate pacing myself), but in fact I've learned that I run farther and faster than I would have previously guessed. Good to know!    My only real complaints thus far have to do with size. I'm a slender lady, and the watch is too big for my wrist. This is the updated version of the original 405, so it comes with two adjustable wristbands which are intended to fit under the watch and help it, in cases like mine, to be snug, but in reality they are a pain to adjust (you have to make sure the plastic loop is set *just so* underneath the watch or it digs into your wrist) and are also an extra irritating step. I understand that if Garmin had made the molded face any smaller, it wouldn't fit the average wrist, but surely there was another way.     My bigger complaint, though, is with the sizing of the heart monitor, which at its smallest is still a little loose on me. While I recognize I'm at the small end of the spectrum, size-wise, I'm not a waif. It doesn't seem like it would have been that difficult to make the thing adjust just a few inches smaller. Now, I have to shove the monitor under my sports bra and then hope it stays under there; it's not very comfortable and so I don't use it much. I'm glad I didn't pay an extra fee for the HRM or I would have been much more disappointed.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I thought I would feel sad watching this film. Having grown up listening to his music and watching his videos, his passing hit me hard. But this film was more of a celebration of his talent and I didn't feel sad at all. I saw it in the theater, and the running time seemed to be 5 minutes - I enjoyed it that much. The only thing I may have been sad about was when the film was over! Never a dull moment, it shows MJ putting this incredible show together. From auditioning the dancers, to the lights, the band rehearsals, filming all the video elements - he was the man in charge of it all. And what a wicked sense of humor he had! MJ loved to laugh! I know members of his family were concerned that the film shows Michael only operating at about 80%, and this rehearsal footage was never meant to be shown. I can understand the concern. During some of the musical numbers, Mike does seem to be saving his voice and conserving his energy. To me this is completely understandable. I believe he wanted to save everything he had for the actual live performance in front of an audience. There are not too many artists that would get away with this. Rehearsals are painstaking, tedious, and exhausting - but absolutely crucial so that every single member of the cast and crew knows exactly what they are doing and when. With MJ, when the lights go down - all you had to do was turn him loose. He was in complete and total control. To everyone who had concerns that this rehearsal footage would put Mike in a bad light, I will say this - even on a bad day, even on an \\"80%\\" day, MJ was light years above any other performer. This is true talent. Talent that cannot be learned or rehearsed. This is the talent that was given to him. This is the talent that he shared with us. This is why MJ will always be the King! \\"It's all for love. L.O.V.E.\\"
0618918248|5.0|There is little more that I can add that hasn't already been said before. I cannot recommend this book enough for everybody.     For the science-minded and atheists, this book will give  you a great material with which you can debunk the fallacious explanations and justifications that religious apologists have been presenting. For the religious, this will be the ultimate test of your faith - if you can read this book from cover to cover, with an open mind, and possess the mental capacity to comprehend Mr. Dawkins' arguments fully, and you still decide to remain faithful, I suppose you'd be happy to know that pretty much nothing else will sway you. Congratulations, you're as indoctrinated as they come!
B002T45VX6|1.0|I have to say that after listening to this CD I feel as if Shakira died; little by little with changes to her appearance and style the main stream had consumed her all I hope that perhaps she may get back on track with her next CD; If you ask me I believe this market already has enough Madona's, Britney's, Beyonce's, and a combination of all... And what it needs is a Shakira! which is why I enjoyed her music and style because in some many ways it was diferent.

Overall, you will fall in love with this concert!
B000000WHX|3.0|CHeck out the cut Dreamin'..That whole sound is from Wally Badarou's album, Echoes. Echoes is a wonderful album...all instrumental, mostly synth. Badarou was the best at what he did, and his music on Echoes was very attractive, and had real melodic ideas. A classic. Look up Wally and say hello...and buy Echoes. Wally used the Prophet 5 a lot in his sound...and it's super rich.
B0026P3G12|2.0|Count me among those enchanted with Susan Boyle's performance on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" but disappointed in her first album. While I think she has a wonderful voice, this album doesn't really show it well. Her voice often seems quiet and blends in too much with the soft instrumentation accompanying it. Additionally, all the songs basically follow the same style which doesn't always feel appropriate to the song being covered.    The first song, \\"Wild Horses\\", is beautiful with her lilting voice matched well with the gentle string arrangement. \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is, as expected, a great version much like her performance on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\". After those two songs, I wasn't impressed with the CD much at all. \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" and \\"Proud\\" are decent songs, particularly the latter which is along with the lines of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". \\"Cry Me a River\\" has a soulful sound but comes across as a little plain. Her version of \\"Daydream Believer\\" doesn't feel right at all. The original song is very upbeat, whereas this version is extremely slow and melancholy. I don't think this song works as a ballad at all. \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Up to the Mountain\\" are both very slow and her voice seems hidden. \\"The End of the World\\" pales in comparison to the original by Skeeter Davis. Susan's voice sounds a bit stronger than in the other songs but comes across as monotonous. Her versions of \\"Silent Night\\", \\"How Great Thou Art\\", and \\"Amazing Grace\\" are adequate but uninteresting. Judging by the show, she's capable of more than this.    The liner notes include little notes from Susan about each song. For \\"Daydream Believer\\" she writes about how happiness is \\"out there for everyone who dares to dream\\"; however, none of these songs truly evoke a feeling of happiness. Where is the spirit and spunk we saw from her on TV? I have no problem with slow songs and I love many ballads; however, aside from the first two songs, this CD is rather uninspired and hides her voice far too much.
1601251505|5.0|Being a relative newcomer to the world of tabletop gaming, I've recently starting playing Paizo's 'Pathfinder' with my boyfriend & a local group of friends. When it got a little awkward juggling printouts to figure out my character's stats & abilities, I decided to invest in a copy of the Core Rulebook to make my gaming a little easier.<br /><br />Based off of Dungeon & Dragon's 3.5 version, the book spans 576 pages of information for not only the veteran gamer but for tabletop newbies as well. Starting with the basics, the book is broken down into chapters covering everything from the different races & classes of characters available to play, but well-detailed lists of abilities, feats, spells & items - a great feature that not only helps you quick-reference while playing, but helps you better personalize your character to what you want him or her to become.<br /><br />What especially sets this book apart is the amazing artwork, from the pieces at the beginnings of each chapter, the examples of items/weapons/magical items, and the beautiful renderings of a character for each class. Even the page layout is a work of art, giving the impression of an ancient tome waiting for someone to peruse its pages.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that between playing 'Pathfinder' & the Core Rulebook, my appetite has been whetted for not only playing more of Paizo's adventures in the 'Pathfinder' series, but exploring more of the tabletop RPG world itself. If you're looking to try a new variation on an old favorite or are a fan of tabletop gaming, this book deserves a place in your gaming library, no matter how big or small.
B001TMG3WC|5.0|The tremendous value of this life-altering book lies in how it can help you avoid or reverse the most common Western diseases (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, etc). The multitude of sound, scientific evidence presented is absolutely compelling. The PhD author, who grew up on a dairy farm, has lofty credentials from Cornell, MIT, and Virginia Tech. He presents extensive research that he and others around the world have done to demystify the relationship between diet and Western diseases. The author was also the director of the most comprehensive human diet study ever done: The China Study. His bottom line is that to avoid/reverse disease, minimize animal protein in your diet (meat, dairy & eggs). On only 5 weeks of this diet (and I was not following it to the letter), I enjoyed several exciting health benefits - and I didn't even have any diseases to start with (yet). The book also explains the forceful influences in industry, government, and academia that have prevented you from hearing about this before
B002XZ62HK|5.0|A great CD from Celtic Woman. I do miss True Colors on this CD. I really wanted to be able to listen to it in the car, but eh, what are you gonna do. As I said in my DVD review, I'm not sure it's the BEST show to date from the girls, but it's fabulous nonetheless, and I've played this CD many, many times in the car! I do think, personally, that this will be the best LIVE show ever, and I think this will be my favorite CW concert experience. I mean, how can Nil S'en La NOT be amazing live?<br /><br />There are a few songs I don't care for, \\"Galway Bay,\\" for example, but nevertheless I love most of the songs! \\"Nil S'en La\\" is my favorite, and \\"Fields of Gold\\" as well.<br /><br />So, what's good about the DELUXE CD: The Deluxe CD comes with two extra songs: \\"The Call\\" and the \\"Mo Ghile Mear\\" finale, both live! Good stuff. The CD also comes with a calendar and a heart charm. The calendar is kind of interesting, because it's a series of 18 cards, one for each month (18 month calendar). I'm not really sure how I'm going to display it, but the cards are great quality and contain very pretty photos from the Powerscourt concert. The charm is small but it's very cute and I plan to put it on my keychain.<br /><br />I think every CW fan is going to want to pick up the Deluxe version of this CD, simply for the calendar and the charm. The extra live tracks aren't bad either! ;)
0385342020|5.0|Fun reading, good book that would be great if you are looking for a light read. This was the first book that I have read by Sophie Kinsella/ Madeline Wickham. I own a number of her other books but they are in my 'to read' pile. I had put a hold on this book in the library months ago when it first came out. My number came up so I put the other book I was reading at the time to the side and I am glad that I did.     I really enjoyed reading this fun story about Lara the main character and her Great-Aunt Sadie who lived to be 105, but someone who Lara never really knew when she was alive. The story was well written and had lots of fun little twists that took Lara off in many different directions. Throughout the story Lara gets to know her Great-Aunt Sadie who appears at the age of 23 as a ghost. Lara gets to see and expirence who her Aunt was and how she viewed the world around her. There were some teaching type moments in the story such as, we need to follow our instincts and that the ederly were once young just like us and there was also friendship, family, values and some new love along the way. I have recommended this book to others and would tell anyone considering reading this book to go for it. I am glad I found a new author with a writing style that is enjoyable to read and leaves me feeling satisfied at the end of the story.
0753801728|5.0|As an English major, and teacher, I have read many books in my life.  I have loved some, loathed some, and been indifferent to many.  This book is a must read for anyone interested in human nature and the quest to find meaning in those dark moments in life that both scare us, and make us all-to-human.

0385504225|2.0|This is the most disappointing \\"highly awaited\\" book I've ever read. I don't need to say anything else.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I was amazed at the amazon.com price for this collection.  iTunes does not even give you the option to buy the Platinum Collection, so the amazon.com price was awesome, plus you get the box CD set and music.  I have not had the chance to really listen to all of the 3rd CD, but since Freddy has a great voice, I'm sure they are just great.  I know there has been complaints about the 3rd CD, but come on now!
B000002LVB|5.0|Well yes, probably the worst Velvet Underground album in the sense of sounding the most like a typical pop album.  BUt... an excellent pop album.  (It might be more appropriate to think of it as Lou Reeds first solo album -- Cale was gone, Tucker on pregnancy hiatus.)  Lou Reed was a beguiling and original songwriter, and the classic cuts (Sweet Jane, Rock and Roll) are gems.   Lou, of course, largely disassociated himself from the album, (\\"Loaded, as in loaded with hits.\\") as if he we're somehow not responsible.  And maybe he wasn't.  There is certainly evidence of post-production monkeying with the arrangements to make it even more commercial.  But still.  An album of excellent songs written and mostly sung by Lou Reed in his prime?  How could I not give it five stars?
0470450266|5.0|This book is an excellent follow up to all previous zbrush books. Why?, two reasons...One, it refers to zbrush version 3.5 which has some major changes from previous zbrush versions. But the greatest joy is in following the tutorial of a \\"realistic hero\\" character. My lady friend always asks me about all other zbrush books...\\"why do all the characters look ugly?\\" the answer is simple. It's far easier to create an alien or an ogre. But now Scott Spencer enables us non academically educated artists to create a somewhat life-like character. This is no easy task, but Mr. Spencer enables even a non artist like myself to do so. I no longer have to create aliens and ogres and can actually create a character that is aesthetic to the layperson's eye! BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF ZBRUSH IS A MUST! So keep that in mind. But once you understand the zbrush interface and you are comfortable with the basic standard, clay, inflate, and flatten brushes, you will love this book. Hopefully, the next version will be of a \\"life-like\\" female superhero.    THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE along with \\"The Essential\\" by an author who now advocates mudbox. ZSpheres have come a long way with v.3.5 zspheres2 so he might regret leaving zbrush. BTW...There is no info on zsketching in this new Scott Spencer book, but nevertheless, your skills will grow leaps and bounds as an artist (digital sculpturist) as he does a great job explaining gesture and form as well as detail.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|I almost made the mistake of writing this album off after the first listen, especially after hearing Knopfler pretty much copying exactly yet another piece of tune from a previous album. The track Monteleone has a short melodic bit in it that can also be heard on the track Heart Full Of Holes off the \\"Kill To Get Crimson\\" album.     Since there's so little good music coming out these days I was forced to play this album again a few times. By the third listen, it was well and truly growing on me. By the next listen, I was completely hooked. The one thing this album has in its favor over previous Knopfler solo efforts is consistency. There are no \\"joke\\" songs here (Secondary Waltz), no ugly fillers (Don't Crash The Ambulance) or boring, shapeless tunes that go nowhere (Place Where We Used to Live). You can listen to the whole album without developing a serious frown (except for the recycled bit in Monteleone).    Yes, it's low key, but as many have mentioned Knopfler's stadium rock days are long since behind him, so live with it and stop expecting it.     Standout tracks include the upbeat opener \\"Border Reiver\\", the beautiful \\"Hard Shoulder\\" and \\"Piper To The End\\", the moody \\"Before Gas And TV\\" and \\"So Far From The Clyde\\", as well as the satisfying rhythm of \\"Cleaning My Gun\\".     \\"The Car Was The One\\" and \\"Monteleone\\" are a bit dull, but they manage to remain listenable enough not to warrant brief pressure on the skip button. Overall this is probably Knopfler's second best solo album, with the terrific highlights on the somewhat up and down \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\" still giving that album the top spot in my books.    Had less than stellar tracks like the two mentioned above been replaced by a few smackers like \\"What It Is\\" or \\"Boom Like That\\", you would have had a yourself a true 5 star album here.
1400063515|4.0|The collapse of Lehman Brothers, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, the downfall of Enron--these are all examples of Black Swans: events that are extremely improbable, but if and when--as Nassim Nicholas Taleb points out, they happen have a catastrophic impact. Far from the financial cautionary tale I expected, Taleb's unorthodox and often irreverent approach takes his argument from the world of finance and stretches it across many disciplines including politics, history and philosophy. Along the way Taleb derides nearly every profession for their ignorance, no doubt a result of the harsh criticism he has received from academia. Once you get past his condescension and verbosity, this book contains invaluable insights that should be required reading for all MBA students.
B000002G7G|5.0|What a difference a year makes.  While White Light/White Heat was a sort of orgy of howling, shrieking and pounding, this album sounds more like it was recorded in someone's living room and they were worried about bothering the neighbors.   Only one song (What goes on) rocks in the conventional sense, and even that has uncharacteristically clean, feedback-free guitars.  Needless to say, the big change is the departure of John Cale, and while that loss effectively destroyed the original, unforgettable chemistry of the original Velvet Underground, what remained was still an engaging and unusual group of music-makers.  Well worth owning and studying, especially alone under headphones, late at night, where the claustrophobic mood will be best suited.
B002VWNICW|4.0|Love, Love this movie. Love the acting and music. My only complain with this blu ray is that it is only dubbed in 2 languages and spanish not being one of them. The dvd was dubbed in Spanish which I loved, which is why I don't understand why the blu ray version wouldn't be?!
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Vampires? Check! Werewolves? Check! Awesome Movie? Check! UNDERWORLD is original and entertaining. The movie revolves around vampire Selene, a death dealer. She basically seeks out and hunts werewolves. While on the hunt she uncovers a powerful plot that will destroy the vampire elders and shift the balance of power. The movie isn't a dumb blood and gore horror flick. It's intelligent with a strong plot and some new twists. Finally a vampire/werewolf flick that delivers. Oh, Kate Beckinsale in leather? CHECK!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful transfer. Looks and sounds great. Blu-ray really shines with a movie like this that is filmed with dark lighting schemes. All special features are transferred from the DVD. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY.
0446691437|5.0|As an artist I frequently get \\"blocked\\", lack inspiration, feel negative about my talents and cannot finish pieces I am working on.   This book explains why and what is driving us creatives to not create.  It  is so on target.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has difficulties with the creative process.  It is a must read for any artist, writer, musician, actor, dancer and all others whose work  is of this nature.  A BESTSELLER!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|At first I was really skeptical at the idea of a 1080p version of a film made more than a half-century ago.  Blu-Ray renditions of classic films such as Top Gun and Ghostbusters leave considerably more to be desired since most movie watchers could care less about the plethora of special features per disc.  This begs the question of \\"why should we watch classics on Blu-Ray beyond two dozen different commentaries that couldn't be fit on a single DVD disc?  As such, I was curious to see how Sony would remaster the classic with Blue-Ray capabilities.<br /><br />After watching Snow White on Blu-Ray, my skepticism still remains albeit the film did, to a certain extent, exceed expectation.<br /><br />The film is, indeed, completely remastered in a fashion akin to how George Lucas re-rendered/restored numerous scenes in the original Star Wars trilogy (albeit w/o additional scenes).  The animation is considerably improved upon as the flow seems to be more fluid if not seamless.  It bears a certain resemblance to cell shading although that would be a reasonable stretch.<br /><br />Pertaining to the special features, I'll be bluntly honest here.  I could care less about the silly flash-esque games, the documentaries, storyboards, family game night features, sing-a-long, crap.  I'm sure some kids and film afficianados will appreciate said features, but to the majority of us movie watchers forking over the capitol to invest in a Blu-Ray player we typically have one thing on our mind; high definition viewing.  As such, I really cannot speculate on the alleged awesomeness that is the special features on the disc since I would rather throw in Uncharted 2 into my PS3 and play that instead.<br /><br />However, the digital re-rending/restoring of Snow White was impressive enough to justify obtaining the Blu-Ray copy over a regular DVD disc of the film.  Well done Disney!  Now bring out Beauty and the Beast and Lion King in Blu-Ray before I go buy Mass Effect 2 on my 360!  :P
0812973992|2.0|Nice writing, but way too depressing to finish.  As a lifelong NYC-er born in the Bronx, I really wanted to like this book but stopped reading it halfway through.  Couldn't take all the suffering.    The New York Times Book Review compared this novel to BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES by Tom Wolfe.  I don't think so . . . .
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I just love the show. Missed season one so bought this and got my curiosity satisfied...wish that season 2 was also out on DVD but heard that it'll be out in August. I could have easily been involved in the biker world at one time in my life, so it's kind of a nice escape into what might have been.  Hard to explain to somebody who doesn't \\"get\\" the biker mystique, but it's there for some of us. I say: buy it!

1582701903|5.0|I don't understand how someone wrote that this book is a rip-off of the original book.  This book contains all of the original text/book at the end of the revised version for the new Century.  I have been comparing the new text to the original text contained at the end of the book, and it is very much the same.  It is only revised in a way so that we can understand it due to the change our language over the last 100 years.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  In fact, I have.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Carolina Rua and Danny Boy are NOT on the CD, at least not on the CD I purchased on the release date. I do not know why they are on the track listing. However, I bought them separately on Amazon's MP3 list.     Other than that, I must say I am very pleased with Amazon: I selected the free-delivery option with my purchase of the CD and DVD and received them one day after the release date - score!    In terms of the CD itself, I will say this simply: It is fantastic. I am a relatively new Celtic Woman fan and have been hearing a lot of comparisons of the current group of girls to the former group, but I feel as though Alex and Lynn have been great additions to the team and all their voices compliment each other well. The solos on the CD really bring out each girl's uniqueness and distinctiveness and are underlined by a beautiful, breathtaking, tone each girl possesses. The ensemble pieces aren't too shabby either - I am absolutely thrilled they decided to do their own rendition of Amazing Grace! The harmonies are simply amazing and the arrangement is brilliant.    I'm not going to go into too much detail, but if you are a Celtic Woman fan, you won't have regrets about getting this CD. Of course, we can all critique minute details here and there, but the end-product remains the same as always: astounding music.
0385495323|3.0|This book has many fascinating and important stories to tell, and some of them are told remarkably well.  Still, if you're expecting \\"The Code Book\\" to be as compelling or well-fashioned as Singh's thoroughly absorbing \\"Fermat's Enigma,\\" you will likely be disappointed.  Which is not to say it's a waste of time. \\"The Code Book\\" demonstrates Singh's ability to bring historical characters and events to life, sometimes to great effect.  And it covers a respectable amount of territory.  That said, I think Singh can do better, and I hope one day he decides to revisit this one and work it over a bit.      I have three main issues with the book.    First, Singh glosses over or completely ignores significant details.  For example, while he expertly tells the story of Mary Queen of Scots, he forgets to address one crucial question: How did Mary and her scheming cohorts agree upon a key for their cryptography?  The way Singh tells the story, it seems impossible for them to have established a secret key, for their correspondence was intercepted from the start.  Those reading their encrypted messages would already have had the key.  Yet, Singh's narrative relies on there having been a secret key, because he makes a big deal about when and how their cipher was broken.  So how was the secret key established?  Singh doesn't say.  This simple omission makes Singh's otherwise well-told story deeply problematic.  Another example:  Singh does not explain the Enigma machine very well, leaving out many details which could have at least been relegated to another appendix.  The book has ten appendices already.  What's one more?    Second, Singh is inconsistent at times.  It often feels like he didn't have the time or patience to carefully organize his thoughts.  To take one example, he believes that quantum cryptography is absolutely secure, because it cannot be broken even in theory; yet, he also notes that there are ways of intercepting messages before they are encrypted (for example, by reading electromagnetic signals from a computer as its keys are being struck).  The logical conclusion is that no form of encryption can guarantee absolute privacy, even if it is theoretically unbreakable.  Yet, Singh suggests that global quantum encryption could mean the end of privacy and thus of civilization as we know it.  This could be a case of choosing drama over accuracy, or it could just be the result of sloppy thinking.  Either way, it's annoying.    Lastly, Singh feels the need to spell out a good many concepts repeatedly, in excruciatingly simple detail.  This might be necessary for a small percentage of his readers, but I found it mind-numbing.  Eventually I decided to completely skip over paragraphs that began with the words, \\"To understand this more clearly . . .\\" or anything of that sort.    All in all, I'm not sorry I read this book, and I would not discourage most people from reading it--especially those looking for a very basic introduction to the history of codes and ciphers.  To his credit, Singh explains at the outset that this is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of its subject.  Yet, I cannot help but think that he could have done a better job if only he (and his editors) spent a little more time on it.  A revised edition is in order, in which the flaws in the original are corrected, and in which the present (and future) of codes and ciphers is given an update.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|I can't say I am an IRONMAN afficionado, but I do like the cartoons and can even remember the 1960's animated show growing up.   The 1990's series was well-done and even the youngster version on now (IRONMAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES) are both worth seeing.  Unfortunately, that's not the case with this DVD/Blu-Ray (I have the regular DVD).  Considering how well the IRONMAN movie did, this animated version was a big disappointment.    First, the origins of Ironman theme is slow building.  Second, the main battle in the film seems to be corporate subterfuge.  Third, you really never see or hear from The Mandarin, just a ghostly apparition at the end.  I'm not even crazy about the animation/artwork in this film, although that was the least of my concerns.  Their just isn't enough of Ironman or action in this DVD/BR to make it worth the purchase.  Rental?  Maybe.  Or maybe best to just wait for it to show up on one of the cartoon channels on cable/satellite.    I have yet to check out some of the other MARVEL Comics DVDs/BRs but the reviews there seem to be much better.  But I can't see this DVD as one that either IRONMAN fans or MARVEL fans will be happy with.  I think it is the classic DVD that you watch once and then watch it collect dust for the next few years.  If you want some recent animated releases that will have you watching and re-watching after you've seen it initially, try the SUPERMAN/BATMAN PUBLIC ENEMIES or GREEN LANTERN:  FIRST FLIGHT Blu-Ray's.  Both have plenty of action, good storylines, great story arcs faithful to the comics or recent animated shows, and animation that is translates very well for HDTV/Blu-Ray.  Alot more features on the Blu-Rays than on this DVD, but even if the IRONMAN BR has alot of extras, it won't make up for the mediocre movie product.    If those Blu-Rays were an \\"A\\" I'd have to give THE INVINCIBLE IRONMAN a \\"C-\\" -- and that's being generous and grading on a curve !
B002OR18HQ|5.0|I can't believe what an amazing show this genius/writer/ musicaian provided.   True, I'm a CCR / Fogerty fan,I love his old and new stuff, this DVD has it all.  His band, the drummer, all of them....blew me away!    I ignored reading all the notes on the DVD, just popped it into the player and was greatly entertained with 100 minutes of pure joy.     Ramble Tamble, what a surprise .... this is one of my faves from his CCR days, and all I can say is WOW! Same with Old Man Down The Road.    The love song to his wife Julie, the song he wrote for his daughter. Simply amazing.    His voice is stronger at age 62 then when he was 26, (I think he quit smoking menthols).    What a show!!!!

B000UJCALI|2.0|The Shining has not withstood the test of time; technically this film is skillfully done, the atmosphere is realistic but not altogether successful, there is an empty argument about the child that is not resolved, and that ruins the movie is undoubtedly Jack Nicholson, a good actor, not very versatile but here's terribly overacted and mocker, who with his clown face is not convincing in his transformation, too bad that Stanley Kubrick did not moderate this . Long ago I saw and I do not impress, I've seen and now I am disappointed more but never was and never will be a horror classic.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This movie took me by surprise.. With a great cast of actors I knew this was going to be a good movie. What I didn't realize was how sexuality graphic it was. Now this doesn't bother me, but I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who would be heading for the door.. pronto. This movie has everything in it, mass killings, murder, rape, incest, humiliation and porno. I don't think I missed anything. If none of the above bother's you too much then you should enjoy the movie.

0316017922|3.0|The intro to this book and some previous reviews led me to believe that a consistent \\"it\\" or \\"wow\\" factor would be revealed. Through each of the stories about remarkable people and their acquisition of skill, personal achievement and cultural background a common thread was not delivered. Each of the individuals the author designated as an \\"outlier\\" had a different story. While each of the stories regarding these talented individuals amounted to interesting reading, I found that a common or consistent message was not delivered. Also what are the ingredients or steps to take that an individual can follow to start on the path to become an \\"outlier\\"?
0060573775|1.0|When I saw Ethan Hawke was the reader for this classic, I couldn't wait to check it out.  When I brought it home and hit play, I was confused.  Ethan reads the ENTIRE book an a near monotone WHISPER!  I don't know if he was whispering because it was a stylistic choice, or because he wanted to save his voice, but it ruined the book.  As a comparison, there is a clip of Vonnegut reading after a short interview at the end of the book, and it was a tremendous improvement.    I was heartborken such a gifted actor delivered such a terrible reading.    Do not buy!
B002ECJZ76|4.0|There aren't really many good Christmas movies, and I think I've seen the truly great ones (It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol) about a million times. This dvd is a great addition to this group of movies, and a much better option that The Santa Clause and nonsense of that ilk. Seeing the Santa story from this Finnish perspective is quite fascinating, and it's something anyone can enjoy. As it turned out, I didn't watch it until well after Christmas, but I still enjoyed it. Definitely worth checking out.
0451228731|5.0|\\"Daemon is to novels what The Matrix was to the Movies,\\" reads the front endorsement pages of the paperback edition (Signet:2010).  That statement is spot on at a number of levels. Like The Matrix, Daemon takes the viewer to another realm of \\"reality,\\" where cyberspace meets reality, and we somehow both lose our place and find something disturbingly different.    This is the author's first novel, and it is a stunner. Daniel Suarez writes software for big business, the entertainment industry and for the Department of Defense. His writing talents have spilled over into fiction, where he convinces the reader to suspend belief and come with him to the fantasy world of on-line gaming and computer programming that takes on an real and eerily astonishing life of its own.     What's a Daemon, anyway?    A daemon (pronounced dee-mon) according to Websters is simply a variant of the word \\"demon.\\"  In computer parlance, the word is condensed from \\"Disk and Execution MONitor.\\" Computer daemons are programs that run continuously in the background and perform things at specific times or sometimes in response to a triggering event.  So it would be possible (the author tells us) to secretly embed daemons in an on-line game, for example, and the daemon would run on the web, usually to the detriment of the enemy of the Daemon (with a capital D).The program could, among other things, wipe out someone's bank account or foil security measures in a large corporation's investment records, or even gather irrefutable evidence to get an innocent person executed for a crime he didn't commit.    The daemon runs as a result of continuous web monitoring (by the Daemon) and is triggered by a news article, email or other on-line communication letting the Daemon know that some event has occured. The Daemon (capital D, again), we learn is this dead guy, Matthew A. Sobol, PhD, millionaire computer genius who wrote multibillion-dollar computer programs before succumbing to the ultimate \\"virus\\" (braincancer). He died with a vision and finds a way to implant it as daemons that trigger a series of post-mortem events, which is what the book is all about.     The Daemon's Insidious Plot    From the outset, as the Daemon begins executing his \\"master plan\\" to take over the internet and virtually everything dependent on computer processing - uh, that would really be just about everything, right? - we see Sobol's relentless and remorseless eradication of every impediment to his final goal. That eradication, at first, is the programmers involved in helping Sobol to construct the Daemon. As the plot unfolds, the Daemon's tentacles spread to such a dangerous degree that the Government needs to keep its existence secret. Otherwise really bad things could happen, which include economic, political and social chaos - in other words, the transformation of civilization.     Daemon \\"Bots\\"    The main thing that gets the reader past the need to suspend belief (Could a dead guy really do all that nasty stuff?!) is the realization that our society is just about totally dependent on computers. That processing is connected inextricably with the worldwide web that forms its own \\"matrix.\\" A society thusly wired is consequently vulnerable to genius hacking that could shut us down on every level. Then the reader is taken to the next level and begins to accept the quasi-personification of the Daemon, who is neither good nor evil; he just \\"is.\\" (Creepy, huh?) The Daemon makes no value judgments when removing threats to implementing its plans; it just removes them. (His minions are the disaffected, pizza-stained gamers or gifted outcasts, who form a vast subculture of disaffected people anxious to do the Daemon's bidding. They have no leadership nor hierarchy, and they are directed (vectored) like game \\"bots\\" by the Daemon, receiving \\"game credits\\" and actual financial perks. They are recruited through Sobol's computer game \\"The Gate.\\")     Read this book!    Daemon is swashbuckling, quick read. For 632 pages the reader will be glued to the author's engaging writing style and action-packed supsense. The action, at times, is both actual and real-life \\"computer gaming\\" scenarios where simulation blurs into reality and vice versa. Although the author is a \\"techie,\\" he doesn't burden the average non-techno reader with too much techno-babble. However, there were one or two instances where he just couldn't help himself, but they were instructive and necessary to the plot and enhanced the flavor of a novel replete with first-rate technology, plausibility, and timelines.    Suarez's sequel to Daemon called Freedom is out in hard cover now. You'll need to read it, too.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|These reviews speak for themselves. This movie will clarify the confusing world of food and unmask the secrets we'd never know with out this film.

1584282584|5.0|Excellent book. This is for the photographer who likes to travel light and shoot with speed. The author explains his technique and gets to the point without spending a lot of time going into theory. Just what you need to know and how to acheive the results you're looking for. Niel explains what he uses and why. His homemade equipment is cheap to make and works well and is not camera brand specific. If your camera has a hot shoe and is E-TTL ready his advice will work for you.  If you're tired of dark shadows and washed out hightlights buy this book. My second all time favorite photo book. Monte Zucker's portrait lighting book is my favorite.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I purchased this movie for my daughter.  It was received in a timely manner.  I had heard on other reviews that the movie had changed some with it's conversion to DVD.  I asked my daughter about it and she said that yes, it had a few changes.  Possibly even a new scene or two.  But that did not matter to her.  She loves the movie!
B0000AUHPB|1.0|While the original, interesting only because it was the original, actually did not have the whimsy the Marky W. remake had and the ending of the original was stupid, and attempt at irony that failed badly and a real downer. Michael Caine, great, magnificent gentleman actor that you have always been, why did you do this movie.
0141020644|3.0|Not one of Hornby's best. The two male characters are flawed; and yes, this is always the case in his work. However, they are usually also interesting, and if not witty, surrounded by wit. Duncan is hard to feel sympathy for; he is intelligent but he is also arrogant, mostly thoughtless, selfish and cold. Tucker is easier to sympathise with, not necessarily because he is a better person, but because he is more self-aware and much more honest about his failings, in a sense he accepts the life he has fallen into.   The main female character is Annie; she feels as if she has wasted 15 years of her life with Duncan and while I understood all of her feelings and actions, I didn't really care. None of the characters here made me care, none of the situations are terribly believable and the way they mesh into each other lives and bring about some change is flat, lame even.   Duncan's obsession with Tucker is well drawn, that is believable, but it lacks the passion of Rob's obsession in High Fidelity or Paul's in Fever Pitch (in the novelisation of the movie, I haven't actually read the original Fever Pitch but given that it is autobiographical, I imagine it has more passion that this too!). There were some interesting concepts thrown up about how we define ourselves and why the two males had trouble changing; they would have had to admit that an ideal or theory that they had based their lives on was flawed or just wrong, thereby looking like failures (to themselves at least).  There was also an interesting idea: that children put parents in \\"the unreflective, active present\\" by making parents deal with the minutiae of everyday life and in doing so, \\"retard nostalgia in their parents.\\"  He also threw up the cliché that we regret what we don't do rather than what we do; I find this concept of regret as black and white annoying; imagined loss of not doing something isn't necessarily greater than the real loss or negative outcomes associated with bad choices.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|this is not just bad packaging. the video is VHS quality. I haven't seen the U S release of the individual series to compare, but the picture just looks plain bad to me. this is a chinese set and while it won't kill you, it may make you a little sick...  joe
B000OVLBHG|4.0|It's a boy has girl - boy loses girl - boy gets girl back, movie containing every one of your favourite Hollywood movie cliches ever written (all in one place).    TBH, 5 minutes into this movie, I was thinking 1* for special effects. 1/2 an hour later, I had figured out that you must switch off your brain in order to follow this movie.     If you try to figure out, how it is that bugs, with no technology described, are able to shoot meteors across billions of miles of space to crash into densely populated Earth cities, .. your brain will likely freeze.    Once you get used to the excellent plastic sets, plastic characters, plastic acting and plastic storyline, sit back relax and be prepared for a thrill ride.     I notice many 1* reviewers are comparing the movie to Heinlen's book by the same title (which I have not read). Why can't the movie be taken for its own merits?    Spoilers: My favourite bits:  - The news feed - excellently done.  - The way the bugs hold back in order to allow the injured crew mate to be rescued so that they may give a farewell speech (which is quite impressive considering they had just been stabbed though the heart with a 10' telegraph pole).  - The ending; Brilliant, from the seriously injured officer fighting off bugs and celebrating as if 'tis purely a flesh wound', to the friend who turns out to be not such a bad person afterall (where did all the bugs go?).    Why not 5*s? Well, with a movie like this there is so much that could be done, they must have missed out something - there were actual parts where I wanted to fast-forward, just for a few seconds - and finally, SPOILER ALERT; Denise Richards does NOT, I repeat, DOES NOT, get her kit off in the movie; if only, 5*s for sure.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|Upon graduating from college, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) finds himself with a degree in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies - and little else of the stuff to build a successful life on.  Forced by financial constraints to move back in with his parents, James takes a summer job as a carny at a seedy amusement park known as Adventureland (the movie was shot at Pittsburgh`s Kennywood Park).  His fellow sufferers-in-purgatory include his even more geeky friend, Joel (Martin Starr); his tormentor from elementary school, Frigo (Matt Bush); the elusive girl-of-his-dreams, Emily (Kristen Stewart); hunky security manager, Mike (Ryan Reynolds), who, though married, has got a secret thing going on the side with Emily; sexy hot bombshell, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva); and, finally, two park supervisors played by SNL regulars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, whose function is to add some understated goofiness to the movie's otherwise gently realistic tone.<br /><br />Based partly on the experiences of writer/director Greg Mottola (who established his bona fides in the genre a few years back with \\"Superbad\\"), \\"Adventureland\\" is one of those rare youth comedies in which the characters actually come across as real people and not as contrivances paying script-service to a typical coming-of-age story.  Mottola's flavorful script nicely captures the rhythms and tones of everyday speech.  In fact, much of the humor derives from the fact that James, fresh from his immersion in  liberal arts academia, often has a hard time reeling in his Ivy League phrasing and diction when engaging in everyday conversations with his fellow workers.<br /><br />As James, the perpetually tongue-tied 23-year-old virgin who wears his heart on his sleeve, Eisenberg perfectly captures all the insecurity and awkwardness of a young man utterly inexperienced in the ways of love and romance.  In fact, there's not an unappealing performance from any member of the cast.  And perhaps because the characters are of a somewhat more advanced age here, Mottola never lets the teen-movie hijinks get out of hand despite many opportunities to do so.<br /><br />Thanks to the movie's being set in 1987, the soundtrack provides a veritable treasure-trove of great, nostalgia-evoking tunes from that era (the highlight being Crowded House's incomparable \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\") to transport us back in time.<br /><br />Badly marketed at the time of its release (the ads made it look like just another lame-brained, teen-raunch fest), \\"Adventureland\\" is a sweet, perceptive and heartwarming film that proves there's quite a bit of life left in that creaky old coming-of-age genre after all.hat more advanced age here, Mottola never lets the teen-movie hijinks get out of hand despite many opportunities to do so.      Thanks to the movie's being set in 1987, the soundtrack provides a veritable treasure-trove of great, nostalgia-evoking tunes from that era (the highlight being Crowded House's incomparable \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\") to transport us back in time.    Badly marketed at the time of its release (the ads made it look like just another lame-brained, teen-raunch fest), \\"Adventureland\\" is a sweet, perceptive and heartwarming film that proves there's quite a bit of life left in that creaky old coming-of-age genre after all.
0780622650|3.0|The year is 2058. Most of the Earth's natural resources are virtually exhausted and will no longer support human life. The government decides that another planet shall be the human race's new home and the government begins construction of two \\"Hypergates\\" that will allow the human race to travel across space to the distant planet Alpha Prime. Government scientist Professor John Robinson, decides to set up a vital space mission. Along with his family: His wife Maureen, their children, oldest daughter, medical officer Judy, troubled teenage daughter, video technician Penny and their youngest son, gifted robotics expert Will and joined by heroic military fighter pilot Major Don West, John and his crew travels to Alpha Prime on-board the spaceship \\"Jupiter 2\\". But the traitorous Dr. Zachary Smith, working for terrorists known as the Seditions, uses the ship's robot and sabotages the mission and sends \\"Jupiter 2\\" off-course. But as Jupiter 2 is caught in the gravitational pull of the sun, John uses the ship's hyper-drive to escape. But John, his family and Major West learns that they've entered a uncharted part of the galaxy and they are lost in space. The story may be dull and the acting fairly mediocre, but Lost In Space isn't trying to be Solaris. It just wants to entertain, and no matter how much you try, you cannot truly say that this movie bores you.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Just received and finished listening to this great CD.  Good music is good music and Lady A has done it again.  These 3 are no one hit wonder.  They cowrote 8 of the 11 songs, something many performers never attempt.  I agree with other reviews and enjoyed every song, which isn't the norm, it seems there are always 1 or 2 songs that get the old \\"fastforward\\" but not here.      I know I am repeating myself, but GREAT CD!
B00000I4XR|5.0|In the beautiful quaint beach resort of Amity Island, something hideous, something so deliciously evil has vanquished the tranquility and shattered the peace. First, it violently took the life of a young girl, leaving her mangled remains rotting on the beach, her echoed screams cursing the night skies. Next, it moved its attention to the children, ripping and tearing as blood turned the calm waters red. Then, just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water, it struck again, mercilessly rampaging in the estuary and attacking the piers where the fisherman unknowingly sat waiting for a catch. Now, something must be done, before it returns to feed. With the Amity tourist board and town Mayor Larry Vaugn determined to keep the beaches open for the Summer Season, its up to Police Chief Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and colorful fisherman Quint to hunt down the 200 Pound White Death and put an end to the bloodshed. 'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie entertaining.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Less of a war movie, and more of a Tarantino movie set during World War 2, this movie is none the less a masterpiece. It carries all his usual intensity during the dialogue, with plenty of humor thrown in to break it up. I can't express how great the acting was, by every cast member. I pre-ordered the blu-ray as soon as possible and haven't been able to put it back on my shelf yet. It gets watched anytime someone comes over. The only complaint I've ever had about it was from someone who said it didn't have any fart jokes.
B00000K3CR|5.0|A young boy makes a wish at a fairground machine to be big. He wakes up the following morning to find that his wish has been granted and his body has grown older over night. But he is still the same 12 year old kid on the inside. Now he must learn how to cope with the unfamiliar world of grown ups including getting a job, and having his first romantic encounter with a woman. This movie is timeless, entertaining, moving, splendidly written and stylishly directed classic. If you haven't seen this marvelous first rate comedy try to find it out as fast as you can. Tom Hanks is spectacular.
1591843065|5.0|As a person who strongly believed that I could NEVER draw in my life, Dan shared with me (in just few minutes during our 800-CEO-READ meeting) that my thinking was flawed. He proved to me that I could DRAW and in fact he proved to me right then and there that EVERYONE could draw.<br /><br />Life has never been the same after that.<br /><br />I have posted close to 100 hand-drawn drawings on my blog and people just love them.<br /><br />Also, my thinking has probably improved as I search for ways to illustrate.<br /><br />The book is a MUST READ for anyone who are trying to sell their ideas (which is almost everyone)<br /><br />Thanks Dan.<br /><br />Best,<br />Rajesh
B00003CXAT|5.0|On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results. The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension. Steven Speilberg will take you to places in this movie that no one else ever will. I highly recommend Jurassic Park.
0739383728|5.0|I am a beginning runner.  Just started to run for about half a year ago.  This book has a lot of interesting concepts about running.  And there are so many interesting stories and make it a great novel reading.  I like to listen to it when I run.  It makes me smile or even laugh while running.  I recommended to all the runners!!!
B00003CXXS|5.0|Anxious to fund research for his new theory of velociraptor intelligence, renowned paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant is persuaded by wealthy adventurer Paul Kirby and his wife Amanda to accompany them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. This infamous island, once InGen's site B, has become both a primordial breeding ground for John Hammond's magnificent creations and a magnet for thrill-seekers eager to encounter them. When a tragic accident maroons the party of seven, Grant discovers the true reason his deceptive hosts have invited him along. In their perilous attempt to escape, the dwindling group encounters terrifying new creatures undisclosed by InGen, and Grant is forced to learn the dreadful implications of his raptor intelligence theory firsthand. This movie is extremely fast paced and holds your attention throughout the entire movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Strongly recommended.
0307588335|5.0|This book was an easy read, and got pretty intense towards the end.<br />I remember when everything he mentions in the book was happening because I too was working at a Brokerage Firm.<br />Towards the end of the book, I experienced terrible hyperventilating/anxiety attacks because I clearly remember 2007-2008, and the events that led up to the crash.<br />The Broker/Dealer I worked for shut down in early 2009, and I lost my job.<br />It was a sad time for me, but I'll always have fond memories of the \\"good times\\".<br />Nevertheless, a great read which you can knock-off in a week-end.<br />The story IS riveting!
B0009MAO46|5.0|A little boy named Andy loves to be in his room, playing with his toys, especially his doll named \\"Woody\\". But, what do the toys do when Andy is not with them, they come to life. Woody believes that he has life (as a toy) good. However, he must worry about Andy's family moving, and what Woody does not know is about Andy's birthday party. Woody does not realize that Andy's mother gave him an action figure known as Buzz Lightyear, who does not believe that he is a toy, and quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Woody, who is now consumed with jealousy, tries to get rid of Buzz. Then, both Woody and Buzz are now lost. They must find a way to get back to Andy before he moves without them, but they will have to pass through a ruthless toy killer, Sid Phillips. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. This movie is pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, exciting, entertaining, and good for the whole family.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I was actually reading 1984 when I decided to pick up this movie at the video store.  The only knowledge I had of this move was from the trailers while the movie was in theaters.  I had no clue it was based on a graphic novel.  All of that being said...I loved it so much!  The story line was excellent, touching, moving, inspiring, etc etc etc.  So when I finally got around to getting a blu ray player I knew I would need to get this one (already had it as a regular DVD, but ya know how it is!)      In blu ray this movie is amazing.  AMAZING.  The details you could see were fantastic, right down to the texture on V's coat.   I can't say enough about it.  Everything is crisp and sharp.  The domino scene!!!!!  The sound clarity was just awesome.  If you liked this movie before you will love it now....BLU RAY IS THE WAY MOVIES SHOULD BE WATCHED AT HOME    This is a pretty scattered brained review, but to me this movie just confirmed the fact that everyone needs a blu ray player.
B000002TQV|5.0|While the first Radiohead album, [[ASIN:B000002UR7 Pablo Honey]], was a decent go at the prevailing grunge sound of the time, [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] was where Thom Yorke and company went from imitation to originality. Yorke's infatuation with modern alienation was focused and Jon Greenwood had fine tuned his guitar attacks into a voice that became unique to him and the band. More than any of their other albums, \\"The Bends\\" rocked hard and loud.<br /><br />While the follow-up would find Yorke pushing his view more into the technology of alienation (and produce a masterwork in [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]]), \\"The Bends\\" was still a human album. As \\"High and Dry\\" made it clear:<br /><br />\\"Drying up in conversation,<br />You'll be the one that cannot talk.<br />All your insides fall to pieces,<br />you just sit there<br />wishing you could still make love.\\"<br /><br />That may be the most aching lyric to come off Yorke's pen, and it's followed by yet another bit of brilliance, \\"Fake Plastic Trees.\\" I always though the line \\"that she bought from a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans\\" was a nod to The Beatles in Radiohead's own twisted world. Then there's the band looking at the flukish success of \\"Creep\\" on \\"My Iron Lung,\\" where the sudden recognition of that one song becomes the twin blessing and curse of rock hit and novelty...and insecurity of creative doubt takes root.<br /><br />While Yorke was already pushing Radiohead up and away from the typical rock forms of the day, \\"The Bends\\" remains the band's most rocking and accessible CD. The seeds of artistic explosion had already reached a fertile stage and would jump the tracks on the next two albums, yet to my ears, \\"The Bends\\" was Radiohead's first perfect record.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|The action was remarkable and very fast paced. Everything I expect from a Bond Film. I enjoy the type of character that Daniel Craig is making of James Bond in this incarnation.    I wasn't as happy with the Female lead this time. Her character was not real believable because she was some what wooden in her delivery.    I am enjoying Judi Dench as \\"M\\" a lot. She is a wonderful actress and the back and forth between Bond and \\"M\\" is great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first Jillian purchase.  Love it!!  You really work up a sweat and work harder with each level.  Since I have a little more endurance I usually do 2 levels for an all out butt kicking!!  I have since purchased Boost Your Metabolism and Trouble Zones.  I highly recommend Jillian to anyone who wishes to take their at home workouts to the next level. I traded in my Gilad and The Firm style workouts for her all out cicuit routines and the results are amazing. I look forward to purchasing her Yoga workout in March.  Keep them coming Jillian you are a great trainer!!
0307269981|4.0|In this second excellent novel of the Lisbeth Salander series, the author again paints a vivid picture of his unique and unforgettable protagonist. The story moves with intricate and fascinating detail, and the character of Lisbeth becomes sharper with each chapter. She is lovable, brilliant, incorrigible, delightful. I continue to lament the author's untimely, early death, but am grateful that he was able to complete the third novel of the trilogy before his passing. With each novel, the character of Lisbeth deepens, and I enthusiastically await the final installment of the Salander saga. Perhaps someone might find it legal and possible to continue what Larsson began in creating Lisbeth, although matching his skills would be a difficult task.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am keeping this short and sweet...    Kid A is a master peace of modern music... what else can really be said about it?  It will go down in history along side albums the likes of Wish you were here and Meddle.  Radiohead used to be my favorite band but, in recent years, Sigur Ros has surpassed them simply by the fact that I listen to them far more but no album could ever take Kid A's place as my most favorite and beloved album.    Every song is so much more different form the last and it is the subtle points in the album that I love the most: the point in \\"Everything is in it's right place\\" where the music begins to fade and how it begins to drift into the albums title track.  I just could not say enough about how special this album is to me.    If you have never heard it, what planet have you been on all these years?
B002XTBE8I|5.0|Eminem took a long time off between albums and it was well worth the wait. Amazing songs, beats, lyrics, he just never disappoints. One of his best albums to date and this one was re-released after Relapse with 8 additional songs. Buy it, you'll love it. Crack a Bottle!
B0028K3192|3.0|I am a huge fan of Maxwell.  I have been a fan for years and he and Sade are about the only two artist that I will buy a CD without reading reviews.  I have never had to think twice about getting his music so it's with a heavy heart that I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with this CD.  It's not what I expected it to be.  It is as if he decided to go into a different direction with the music.  There wasn't the usual ballads that made him famous.  \\"Pretty Wings\\" is the only song that grabbed me and of course I heard it way before the album was even released.  Pretty Wings is the type of music that I'm used to hearing from Maxwell.<br /><br />The album is not terrible and there are a few other songs that I  could actually listen to for an example:<br /><br />Bad Habits- Not my favorite but has a nice melody<br /><br />Fistful of Tears- Beautiful Song<br /><br />Pretty Wings- Basically I can listen to this song over and over again.<br /><br />Playing Possum- Strange lyrics, but I love the sound of Maxwell's voice with the guitar.  The song has that acoustic feel to it.  I also like how the saxophone came in towards the end.<br /><br />The album only has 9 songs and I believe this album is the first of three in a series.  I hope the next volume will be much better because I didn't really care for the remaining songs especially track 6 which had too much organ in it for my taste.  I also didn't care for the last track which is instrumental without lyrics.  Overall this latest effort by Maxwell had too many fast beats which I'm not used to coming from him.  I prefer the soft ballads which is why I fell in love with his music in the first place.  I'm patiently waiting for Sade's album to release in the United States on February 9th.  I hope the 10 year wait will totally be worth it!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|A series that has promised so much with 3 very interesting characters in Tyrion, Jon and Ayra. yet they are hardly mentioned in this 1000 page bore fest. Ayra gets a few chapters but she's used to describe like in the city not for any plot development, whilst Jon and Tyrion aren't even mentioned. Massive, massive let down. I'd have given all of the other three books 5 stars without hesitation, but this....
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is one of the best rock documentaries I've seen.  The talent that is showcased, and the candid nature of the film keeps me wanting more. A must have for any music lover.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|I purchased these solely to use as aileron and elevator trim and flap control. They work great for my intended purpose after giving a little dead band to get rid of small jitters.
B0013N7AD8|4.0|I absolutely loved this boxset, almost based completely on the special features of which there are a ton!! Obviously the movies are here, and they look and sound great. But the main thing would be all the special features. Nice buy for any Batman or action fan.
0061231401|4.0|Rollins has written another Sigma Force novel that will make you think.  Since I have enjoyed all the novels in the series, I pre-ordered this but I am so far behind on reading that I just finished it last night.<br /><br />The story focuses on the owner of Viatus Corporation, a bioengineering company who has plans to \\"save\\" the world.  The Guild wants to find the lost \\"Doomsday Key\\" and of our favorite characters from previous books are here as the two groups begin their search...  Rollins does a great job reintroducing his characters and explaining their relationships to each other.  We learn more about the enigmatic agent Seichan but there are still questions left unanswered about her.<br /><br />The story begins with a plague in England in 1066 A.D; then there's a plague from the future, weapons of destruction that are all too real, dying bees, prophecies come true and more.  As our characters explain, soon we will reach a point where there are far too many people on this planet to feed.  Who will decide who lives or who will die?  What would you do if you had to make these very hard choices?  How would you \\"save the world?\\"<br /><br />There is a characteristic Rollins cliffhanger ending that will keep us looking for the next Sigma Force novel.  Overall I'd rate this as 4 ½, if only Amazon would find a way to let us give ¼ or ½ star ratings.  I think this would help us to rate more accurately.
B00132D808|5.0|When I first listened to these songs most of them didn't really seem like my style at all. When I purchased it i thought they would of had music like I Write Sins Not Tradgedies. My mother told me it reminded her of music from the 70's actually. But, I easily grew on the songs and now they are some of my favorites!!
B001MYIQK4|5.0|I NEED TO KNOW IF THE BLU RAY VERSION IS WORTH IT. WILL SOMEONE PLEASE COMPARE THE BLU RAY VERSION DVDS IN THIS SET TO THE REGULAR DVDS? THANKS. EVERYONE ONLY TALKS ABOUT MOVIE CONTENT AND NEVER ABOUT WHETHER THE BLU RAY IS BETTER OR NOT.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|My favourite book of all time!! Whenever I am at a loss to find anything decent to read in the modern literature I find this a real comfort. A great read!!
