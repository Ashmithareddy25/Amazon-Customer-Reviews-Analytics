1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink's Drive is a must read for everyone.  Again and again Pink illustrates the gapping difference between what the scientific data says about motivation and what businesses are doing.        The book is divided into three sections.  Sections two and three should be read by everyone.  However, after the motivation 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 discussion, the first section of the book can be skipped by anyone who has read Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational, Ori and Rom Brafman's Sway or Marc Gerstein's Flirting with Disaster.  Those of you who haven't yet read these books need to read all of section one because it`s a concise review of mush of the subject matter contained in these other books.  For those of you who like to be thorough, Pink's review is mostly entertaining and worth the read.      Sections two and three should be mandatory reading for everyone immersed (drowning?) in corporate culture and those who have escaped.  Section two describes motivation 3.0 in greater detail (autonomy, mastery and purpose).  Highlights for me in section two were the concept of ROWE - results only work environment espoused by Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson and a revisiting of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow.       Section three was by far my favorite though because it gave details regarding how to incorporate the three major characteristics (autonomy, mastery and purpose) into your life.  Practical advice!  Advice you and I can use to make change in ourselves and in our environments. Read the book, It won't take too much time and you'll learn a lot.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|I consider Boondock Saints (the first movie) one of my top five flicks. Like many others I could not way to see All saints day.... I wish I would have.  This was the biggest piece of rat turd I have ever seen. EVERYTHING was wrong with this film  here's a breif list to start  The acting was terrible  Sean Patrick Flannery has you guessing if its really him do to some TERRIBLE plastic surgery (no joke I checked the back of the DVD 3 times to make sure and am still sketchy about it)  The script - embarrassing  The music - Horrible  Plot- there was one?   This movie sucked 5 minutes in and continued straight to the end .   Seriously I can't believe this movie is allowed to exist. I also can't believe that it was the same director and actors as the first.   I cannot express how awful this film was . PLEASE if you loved the first movie DO NOT WATCH this it will ruin it for you.
1400052173|5.0|Henrietta Lacks was born to an impoverished family of in rural Virginia in 1920. Her family worked on the same tobacco fields that their slave ancestors did during the preceding century, and after her mother died she grew up in her grandfather's dilapidated log cabin that served as slave quarters. She left school after the sixth grade to pick tobacco for ten cents per day on the farms of local whites. Henrietta had her first child with her first cousin Day at age 14, and they eventually married and moved to a small town outside of Baltimore during World War II so that Day could work at Bethlehem Steel for less than 80 cents an hour.<br /><br />In early 1951, Henrietta went to the gynecology clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital after feeling a \\"knot\\" in her womb. After she was taken to a \\"Colored\\" examination room, the gynecologist on duty found a firm mass on her cervix that seemed cancerous, but was unlike anything he had ever seen. He sent a slice of the mass for analysis, and Henrietta was soon diagnosed with cervical cancer.<br /><br />Henrietta returned to Johns Hopkins a few weeks later, where she underwent treatment for cervical cancer. She was given a generalized consent form that gave permission for her doctors to perform any operative procedures necessary to treat her illness. However, she was not told that one of the staff gynecologists was collecting specimens of clinic patients with cervical cancer for a clinical study, and biopsies of healthy and cancerous cervical tissues were taken from her during her initial procedure. The cancerous cells, which were named HeLa after the first two letters of Henrietta's first and last names, proved to be the first human cells that could be grown indefinitely in a nutrient broth, and the Johns Hopkins researchers were overjoyed at this long awaited success.<br /><br />The treatment she received at Hopkins was state of the art, but was unsuccessful, due to the aggressive nature of her primary tumor, and she succumbed to her illness several months later. The researchers wanted to acquire more specimens from her tumor ridden body by performing an autopsy with biopsies. Her husband, after initially denying a request for an autopsy, was misled into agreeing to allow the Hopkins pathologists to perform a limited autopsy, after he was told that the doctors wanted to run tests that might help his children someday.<br /><br />The HeLa cell line was provided to scientists and organizations worldwide for minimal cost, as neither the researchers nor Johns Hopkins profited from the first immortal human cell line. However, a number of companies made millions of dollars by mass producing HeLa and selling them at a much higher cost. HeLa was used in numerous important biomedical studies, including the development of the Salk polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh in the mid-1950s, cancer and viral research projects, and studies of the effects of weightlessness and space travel on the human body by NASA.<br /><br />During this time Henrietta's husband and children were completely unaware that her cells had been harvested for medical research by the Hopkins doctors. By that time most of them were living in poverty in Baltimore, and were unable to afford basic health insurance. Articles about HeLa began to appear in medical journals and in the lay press, but it wasn't until 1973 that the family accidentally learned about the HeLa cell line. The family was contacted by Johns Hopkins, so that their cells could be analyzed and compared to those taken from Henrietta 22 years earlier. Once again they were misled into believing that the purpose of these tests was to determine if any of her children also had cancer, which caused Deborah, Henrietta's oldest surviving daughter, many years of anguish.<br /><br />Once Henrietta's name was released in the media, the family was besieged by journalists and others wishing to profit from her story, causing her husband and children to become distrustful and wary.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot became interested in Henrietta Lacks after hearing about the HeLa cell line and its forgotten host as an undergraduate student. She spent many months and countless hours attempting to contact the Lacks family, and she slowly but painfully gained the trust of Deborah and her siblings, after she promised to tell the family's story alongside the history of HeLa.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fantastic achievement, given the hurdles that Skloot had to overcome to obtain information from the Lacks family, Johns Hopkins, and the other key actors in this story. In addition to an in-depth history of this ordinary yet quite remarkable family, she provides just the right amount of information about HeLa and what it meant for biomedical research, along with information about informed consent from the 1950s to the present, the effect of race on medical care in the United States and the views of African-Americans toward medical experimentation, and the biology of cancer. The book is meant for a lay audience, but it would be of interest to those with a formal medical background. I found the book to be a bit overly sentimental and personal at times, but this is a very minor criticism of a fabulous book.nrietta Lacks after hearing about the HeLa cell line and its forgotten host as an undergraduate student.

B001GCUNW6|5.0|Following along in the Ice Age theme, this movie finds the \\"herd\\" Manny, Ellie,Sid, Diego, Crash and Eddie discovering an under ice tropical world populated with dinosaurs. It is a very beautiful and lively adventure with the back theme that Ellie is going to give birth at any given day and the way that it affects the herd. Sid and Diego in particular. It's wonderfully done, full of action and adventure and the usual interaction with the main cast. A great movie overall!
B00275EGX8|1.0|I was absolutely shocked that this film received the 9 nominations that it did, and then I was equally shocked when it took home 6 Oscars! WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE TO ALL THE OTHER GREAT MOVIES IT IS SUPPOSEDLY BETTER THAN!!!!!! WHAT FILM WHERE THESE PEOPLE WATCHING? There were at least 5 other films that were far better this year alone. I am not an Avatar fanatic by a far stretch, but it was way above and beyond anything the Hurt Locker could provide in entertainment. Are they to tell me that the Hurt Locker is a better film than \\"UP\\", even \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" was a much better film! And how's about \\"Up in the AIr\\"? There is no there in this film, there is not one interesting character.   There is no tension in those extremely unrealistic situations they unrealistically \\"stumble\\" into. How did they get there? What was the motivation, what was the story line? Who in Iraq goes out of the green zone in just one vehicle and just a couple of support soldiers, with no one from higher up having any say? One unreality after another in this film. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.........  As far as a war film is concerned, it is another slap in the face to all those other great war films that this film can't hold a candle to, films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, The Big Red One, and how many other great war films out there that are far better than The Hurt Locker. Any single episode of the \\"Band of Brothers\\" is far superior to the Hurt Locker.   I always had reservations about the selection committees, usually I just went with the flow, but the fix was in on this one! It did not deserve one single Oscar. I had to watch it three times to see if I was missing anything that others were seeing, all I have to say to anyone that thinks this film was good in any way, needs to remind themselves of the great films that preceded this one and truly ask themselves if it really deserves to be anywhere near the same class in respect to any of the others. A BIG SLAP IN THE FACE TO ALL THOSE OTHER GREAT FILMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0670033049|5.0|Biblical accounts abound in this John Steinbeck novel revolving around the turn of the century Californians - on a tale loosely based upon relatives or neighbors of the relatives of the author's heritage.<br /><br />East of Eden is the quite simply where Cain - of Cain and Abel fame - was exiled.  The two stories within this tome are of Adam and Charles Trask, and the sons of Adam - Caleb and Aaron whose names mirror alphabetically Cain and Abel: a theme for both  the stories of Adam and Charles (note the initials) and the sons of Adam.<br /><br />Within the confines of the novel are great parables and stories of the pilgrimages of persons who made the America of today so great.  But, the personalities include evil - including the mother of Caleb and Aaron (Aron) - Cathy, later requesting to be called Kate. She is quite simply stealth: \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents,\\" Steinbeck writes in the novel. \\"Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places...And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\"<br /><br />This monster belies all human nature when she gives birth to Caleb and Aaron and on same date abandons them.  She leaves them to do what she does best - be a woman of ill repute and ridicule men at her trade. \\"She combines the brains of a businessman, the toughness of a prize fighter, the warmth of a companion, the humor of a tragedian. Myths collect around her . . . \\"<br /><br />Amid this novel of human weakness exists strong literature.  \\"Samuel Hamilton rode back home in a night so flooded with moonlight that the hills took on the quality of the white and dusty moon.  The trees and earth were moon dry, silent and airless and dead. The shadows were black without shading and the open places white without color.\\"<br /><br />And, amid this novel arises a person or two of great character.  The first is Samuel Hamilton - believed to be based upon the grandfather of the author.  Secondly is the protagonist Adam Trask.  And, lastly is my favorite, Lee, a China man who aids Adam in raising the twins when his monstrous wife leaves them to raise the two infants.  He is more than just a helper.  He is a philosopher - a topic to be discussed more thoroughly later.  As Adam states, \\"I don't see how you could cook and raise the boys and take care of me and still do all this.\\"<br /><br />In the great philosophical dialogue, we return to the Bible - and not surprisingly to the Cain and Abel where Lee discusses how the King James' version differs from the American Standard translation of the Genesis chapter of Cain.  To decipher how the difference came about, Lee read the Hebrew version and found a difference in translation in the word timshel.  And, this little discourse in the first third of the book cannot be forgotten - as that word and the differences of translation become the focus of the ending. So when you go to the end, and if for any reason you forgot the great philosophical dialogue between Lee and Adam and Hamilton about the word timshel, save yourself time and go to [...] where it is all delivered in a few strokes at the monitor. In effect, it is whether you believe there is fate without choice; or does man have the ability to control destiny by choice.<br /><br />There are also great anti-war undertones. \\"There were people who gave everything they had to the war because it was the last war and by winning it we would remove war like a thorn on the flesh of the world and there wouldn't be any more such horrible nonsense.\\"<br /><br />It has been three decades since I read Steinbeck.  And, to be certain, many of the undertones about timshel or the ignorance of youth would probably have been lost upon my younger reader's eyes. Maturity abounds in this novel written in less decorous language, but beautifully painted verse, of the life and times in romantic agrarian northern California when it was truly the land of fruit and plenty.<br /><br />At this time of my life, when I have read most of this author's works, and all of the acclaimed works, I must claim this to be my favorite. This is a masterpiece. And probably because of its size and occasional rough topics, not the choice for classrooms.  Unfortunate choices by the classrooms.unds in this novel written in less decorous language, but beautifully painted verse, of the life and times in romantic agrarian northern California when it was truly the land of fruit and plenty.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|I have watched most kinds of disaster or end of the world movies in the last 20 years. The idea won't be as fresh anymore, of course, since it's just about when or how the world will end, the topic is the same. I honestly just want to review the movie itself not the the education or research of the 2012 stuffs at all, I personally 85% totally believe that God will always take care of His children but 15% I still don't want to be just like all the people around Noah at his time, when they're laughing and mocking him but at the end, it's gonna be a reality ;p so anyway mostly faith, little part still listening and be aware of the truth , if there is any.    The movie has one of the best, if not the best, visual effect in any disaster movie I ever saw. The story is simple, the approcah Emmerich used is a little bit off with the jokes and over the top characters, but the disasters visualization, the message of humanity and Christianity, themselves alrady make it worth the price of the DVD or theatre admission fee, it's top notch for the first timer watching end of the world movie, it's one of the best of all end of the world movies, definitely. It's up there with Deep Impact, Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow but way better than Aaron Eckhart's the Core.    Overall, great movie, at least in my genuine opinion.

0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol is The Da Vinci Code is Angel's and Demons is Deception Point.  Unfortunately the novelty of the of super smart symbology sleuth solving impossible-to-solve ancient mysteries has really run it's course.  The result: The Lost Symbol is just plain dull.<br /><br />If you've read any of Brown's other books, you know before opening this book that Robert Langdon will pull off the impossible, he will partner with an intellectual female, there will be some sort of uber zealous secret society, and the secret society will not want whatever secrets Langon will uncover to see the light of day (or in this case, see the light of day in someone else's hands).<br /><br />And between learning valuable information from THE ONLY people on the planet that can provide that key info (darn lucky for Langdon) there is a bit of action with generally predictable outcomes.<br /><br />But the biggest \\"things that make you go 'huh'\\" moment has got to be the ending.  After expending the energy to slog through hundreds of pages of numerous \\"Oh, I get it now\\" moments where Langon has some partial epiphany that leads him to the next clue, you are rewarded with fizzle.<br /><br />I may have given The Lost Symbol an extra star if the ending were a bit more interesting and less preachy.  However, it wasn't so 2 stars is as good as it gets.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons were fair escapist stories and worth reading.  The Lost Symbol has some fun Dan Brown moments (specifically insights into real or make-believe facts about our nation's capital), but mostly it's just not very fun to read.
B00007KWHO|5.0|This Yes album was a favorite of my older brother, back then when it came out we have listened to it many times at home and on 8 tracks while riding in his 1964 Plymouth Valiant.  I found that I was thinking about this album recently and decided to get a copy for my library.  Very Happy to have it in the musical stable as the charming and magical sounds of early Yes now eminate from my speakers! It is as good as I recall, actually it's even better.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I won't try to sum up the movie itself because by now you'll probably either already love or hate it, and if you don't, there are plenty of better reviews of the movie than anything I could write.  Suffice to say it's way over the top, but full of some delightfully original ideas that it's able to embrace because it doesn't feel it has to stay in conventional storytelling or realism.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />What's more important to you here is how good the Blu-ray master is, and it's awesome.  The sound is particularly rich.  It doesn't rumble my subwoofer a lot, but it does when it needs to.  What it does do is use surround to put me in the action, and really extend the sweeping camera pans and coming-from-behind action.  You don't just see the bullets curve, you hear them curve, as they wend their way through the three-dimensional space of surround sound.  The video is perfectly crisp, with a good balance of lightness and dark; the film's natural tendency towards more monochrome means it's probably not what you'd pull out to show off your new 62\\" HDTV, but it's still something that will make great use of that TV.  It's as close as you're going to get at home to what it was like to see it in the theater.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|As someone who grew up watching the original series, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.  I was thrilled with the result. This was a great script, with great actors, and it just brought me back in time.  Chris Pine was superb as Kirk, Karl Urban nailed McCoy, and Zachary Quinto was a compelling Spock, although the 'human side' was more of a departure from the series.  I'm ready for that to be explored, however.  I'm sure some devotees would disagree, but I think this movie did it right by capturing the essence of the characters, but not copying them.  I look forward to the next installment of this series - if done as well as this one, it will undoubtedly be my favorite movie again.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I am not a Jane Austen fan and didn't watch this; I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife.  So I can't speak to the quality of the production beyond the usual second-hand comments about it being perhaps the best filmed version of this book.<br /><br />However, I'm posting a review anyway because there's one important observation I can make.  There are a lot of reviews on the old DVD version of this movie that commented on how the colors were washed out, the sound muddy, and the video quality on the whole was worse than VHS.  When I ordered this, there were no reviews for the Blu-ray version, so I couldn't tell if it would have the same problems.<br /><br />I can safely say it does not.  The video is crisp, the colors true to life, the images strong and compelling.  The sound is also rock-solid.  It doesn't take a lot of advantage of Dolby surround, of course, but what can you do?  But the remaster from BBC's original video was done with all the care to quality that apparently the DVD remaster completely lacked.

They have a lot of challenges to overcome like in any movie, and then they overcome them. But here's the thing about the movie that you won't believe: no one ever looks really serious and says \\"It's daylight saving time.\\"<br /><br />Not one character. No one says \\"It's daylight saving time.\\" In the entire movie. I know you don't think it's possible, but if you watch it you'll feel like you wasted 4 hours of your life (time moves slower when you're waiting for someone to deliver an amazing line). What were the writers thinking!?
B00201X7XO|5.0|i think there is no need to say how great pearl jam is as a rock band. If you are reading this, you already know what you are checking out now. NO CODE is a great album, even though media, (commercial) music industry and many other music critiscist weren't quite fond of PJ's anti-commercial-more-subjective-experimental way of creating outstanding music phylosophy. You know that, and as a PJ fan you know that this art concept of the NO CODE album is unique. This vinyl edition, as the cd edition, comes in a 4 way fold out picture sleeve, and includes the 9 polaroid pictures with size 12\\" aprox. inside a pictured inner card-holder, and of course the vinyl itself comes in another pictured inner holder. It is such a great item to have as a PJ fan.

0743297334|2.0|Simply put, The Sun Also Rises is the story of a handful Parisian-based expat men who go on a trip to Spain to fish and enjoy the running of the bulls. (The anthropology of the bull-fighting is the most famous part of this book.) As classics go, this one has a high chance of disappointing: the tension in the novel, such as it is, comes from their all being in love with the same soon-to-be divorced Englishwoman, and if the characters change at all over the course of the novel, it's vanishingly subtle --- except they're all much closer to the day that a doctor diagnoses them with cirrhosis of the liver.    Yeah, yeah, I know we're also supposed to genuflect before the icon of the great Revolutionary of Style, but in truth, Hemingway leaves me cold. The way everyone talks about how `economical' his writing was makes him sound less like a writer and more like a home-front housewife who cleverly figured out how to stretch her family's ration coupons further. Take for instance this passage:    >There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett's hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was town up and men were working on the cartracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down.    Say this out loud and it just sounds silly: you have the clumsy instances in which back-to-back sentences end with the same word (`street' and then `flares') plus the repetition of four-word sentences actually sounds wordy because you the reader have to stop and supply the missing connections. This writing might have played a key role in the evolution of fiction, but it can't, on its own, be said to be good writing, or even decent writing. And the clipping of words gets to be downright irritating in three-way conversations when you're not told who is speaking and the dialogue is so vague that the words are not obviously in the style of one person.     The novel isn't all bad. Hemingway's style, for instance, can sometimes lend itself to capturing the essence of drunken conversation, and since everyone is always `tight' in this novel --- in every scene you're told what they're drinking --- he gets a lot of chances to nail it. Two moments in particular stand out. One is in which a guy gets silly as his blood alcohol level increases and he makes an argument that ends with, \\"[The] Road to hell [is] paved with unstuffed dogs.\\" In context, this makes sense and for a moment the character seems like a warm and funny person. The second successfully inebriated moment is when the tension over the woman breaks above the surface and one drunk launches a relentless verbal attack on another man despite everyone telling him to shut up. The scene is brilliant, but it was too little too late: as I paused to absorb the scene, I glanced up to the top of the page and thought, \\"Page 146 and something is finally happening.\\"    But what really sinks _The Sun Also Rises_ are the comparisons it begs. The novel fits into two saturated genres. Two vastly superior `expats of Paris' novels are George Orwell's _Down and Out in London and Paris_ and Geoff Dyer's more recent _Paris Trance_ (and there's a lot in between). One could argue that novels like this have the benefit of having _The Sun Also Rises_ to draw upon. That's true, but it doesn't make Hemingway anymore fun to read and it doesn't hold water when talking about the other saturated genre this novel represents, namely, accounts of the Great War generation. In that case, F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Beautiful and Damned_ dances circles around _The Sun Also Rises_, like Fred Astaire sensually gliding around a dumb fire hydrant. Ironically, Fitzgerald, who helped in the editing of _The Sun Also Rises_, would go on to die in obscurity while this novel began Hemingway's march to the Nobel Prize. Such is justice in the literary world.

B002S0OBMS|4.0|Being a huge fan of the Phantom of the Opera, I was very weary when I first heard that Webber was going to make a sequel. I thought he was mad and was just doing it for the money. My mind changed when I heard the songs from the initial launch, and I can't wait to see the show.  I got this soundtrack yesterday, and I have listened to it several times since. At first, I wasn't that impressed with it, but it grew on me after awhile. I really loved the music, and I believe it's ALW's best in a long time. There are some places where some of the music hints at ALW's previous works. It happens to all great composers, and it didn't bother me.   The lyrics themselves are ok. Granted, I wasn't expecting greatness from Glen Slater because I wasn't too impressed with his previous works. The main problem I had was that I feel like some of the phrases could've been done better. A lot of the times, the lyrics seem way too simple. They have grown on me since my first listen, but they aren't my favorite.   The singers on the soundtrack are excellent. I really enjoy Ramin and Sierra, and the rest of the supporting cast is great. They really deliver the material, and I can't wait to see them on stage  Overall, good recording with good singers. The question now: Is it a worthy sequel to the Phantom of the Opera? Basing it on the recording, yes. I have no troubles with how the characters have been transformed, and I have no issues with the story itself. Phantom will always be my favorite ALW musical, and this has not ruined anything for me.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community starring Joel McHale, host of \\"The Soup\\" on E!, is arguably the funniest show on television right now!  Some of the things they say make you go, \\"did they just say that?\\".  It is fun, entertaining and HILARIOUS!!!!  Joel is great in the lead role and the supporting cast is top notch.  Chevy Chase is hysterical and it's great to see him back doing what he does best - making us laugh!<br /><br />Overall this is my favorite show on television and one of the funniest sitcoms to come along in years!  I highly reccomend it to all and I can't wait to watch it on DVD!!!!  I've been putting the show on DVD myself since it started just in case they weren't going to release it in seasons.  Now I don't have to worry about missing an episode!<br /><br />LIFE IS GOOD.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Historically accurate? No, it's really not intended to be a documentary... Violent? Very, not for kiddies... typical 1.5 hr. length? No, thankfully...Entertaining? It is, I enjoyed it. Nice work Mr. Tarantino, I got it. I think if you are a fan of his other movies and understand he beats to a different drum you'll also like this movie. A blend of comedy, drama, & action set in the early 40's w/ some cool camera angles. Only thing I didn't like was the subtitles b/c I found myself pausing the movie a lot to read them, however the german & french dialog does add to the authentic setting of the movie. A to the point ending, excellent acting from the German SS Col. played by Christoph Waltz. \\"Soouund Goood!?\\"

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this DVD as I am a huge fan of Sons Of Anarchy.  The show is amazing and the DVD is great because there is commentary from Kurt Sutter, Katey Sagal and Charlie Hunnam.  If you did not watch Season One I suggest you buy this and I guantee you that you will be hooked on this show.  Anxioulsy awaiting Season Two on DVD and Season Three on tv.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Although I did not grow up as the child of a Madison Avenue type, I recognize this as the world of my childhood.  I guess that I was about the age of Don's daughter Sally back then.  Mad Men certainly captures the ambiance of that highly sexualized and politically incorrect era.  I find Don and his pals both troubling and sympathetic.  The men are certainly passionate about their work, but their interactions with their wives and girlfriends seem almost completely phoned in.  When Don looses an client--he is shattered--but loosing a girlfriend (or a terrible fight with his wife) hardly makes him blink.  Really, the only relationship between a man and a woman that seems significant to me is that between Pete Campbell and his  wife Trudy--even though he is fooling around with Peggy on the side.<br /><br />I also find Don interesting as a sort of interface between the 60's Urban metropolis of his work world and his depression era rural roots.  One of my parents came from a rural community and home lit by only kerosine lanterns and devoid of indoor plumbing.  Much of my young life was spent trying to come to terms with the modern world as seen through the prism of my parents' rural and small town perspective.  Sadly for poor Don though, his childhood was an unpleasant one that left him without the emotional context necessary to find happiness in his personal life.

0375507256|5.0|As various reviewers have said, this book is fugue-like in its structure, revealing more and more interconnections the further one gets into it. With a mind-bending sweep that starts on a clipper ship in New Zealand in the 1800s, and lurches forward many centuries into a (actually several) dystopian future(s), and back again, this book will alternately draw the reader in to its intricate plot twists, spin his or her head with its contrasting literary styles, and dazzle with its mathematically symmetrical organization. A highly satisfying read that will leave the reader exhausted from traveling across so many times and places. It's totally different from Mitchell's other wonderful prize-winner, \\"Black Swan Green.\\"
B002SF9YNO|4.0|Without irony, there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy, so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu ([[ASIN:B00005JLV7 Tokyo Story]]) in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist, Daigo Kobayashi, a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyo-based orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity, he and his sunny, supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.<br /><br />As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay, the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life, no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo, bereft of his passion, answers a job ad involving \\"departures\\", which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However, he quickly realizes the two-person operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial, ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast, he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession, including Mika, who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo, however, realizes he has found his passion in the pre-burial ceremony, and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls how he taught Nobuko Miyamoto how to open a successful ramen shop in Juzo Itami's beloved comedy, [[ASIN:B000GG4RMU Tampopo]] a quarter century earlier.<br /><br />Former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo, while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort, while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is top-notch with some memorable images offered along the way (like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop), and Joe Hisaishi's ([[ASIN:B00004Z1FE Kikujiro]]) music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside, the film runs too long at 130 minutes, and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still, the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity, and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry.

0375842209|5.0|This book worked for me on several levels: simple yet captivating prose, memorable characters and scenes, a story that is at once grim, hopeful and oddly whimsical, and a truly unique narrator (Death). It conveys not only the well-known horrors of Nazi Germany but also the many levels of victimhood that dominate all parts of a society at war. The Book Thief should appeal to thoughtful teens as well as adults.
B000MTOKXM|5.0|For many years i refused to buy Grateful Dead albums because of a gentleman i worked with who insisted anything shorter than 9 minutes wasn't REAL \\"Dead music\\". As of gotten older and shaken the ghost's of dead past, i've come to open my mind to giving the Dead another go around. Let me say i'm not sorry to have done that ONE bit as this album is a bonafied classic! Great musicianship, fantastic songs and --here's the key--- no crazy 16 minute jams! (i feel the dead fans coming out of the wood-work getting ready to pelt me with rotten veggies)<br /><br />If you are like me and you are unsure whether to make the plunge because of what people have said about the Dead, go forward and do yourself a favor and GRAB this album.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Im not going to try to outdo the sea of reviews that precede me I will just simply say that this is an awesome movie that is worth every penny you spend on it.<br /><br />Even if you dont like or care about the Batman franchise you are still bound to like this action packed movie. From the plot to the action scenes this film is an all around package.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I recieved the DVDs in a good time frame.  The only problem I had was that the case for the DVDs was dented.  I could not get the dent out.  But otehr than that the DVDs were in good condition.
B002IYEQR4|2.0|Bottom Line: If you take away only one point from this review it's to save your money and get any of the other versions. Avoid versions with the Black Freighter in the movie. The extra animated Black Freighter footage in the \\"Ultimate Cut\\" version added ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the Watchmen story and actually took away from the movie.       I really liked the theatrical version of the Watchmen so I bought Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut thinking that surely it would have lots of deleted scenes and the addition of the Black Freighter would enhance the story.  As far as I can tell the Black Freighter had nothing to do with the Watchmen.  It was just a comic book that a teen in the movie was reading.  [If pressed for time skip to next paragraph] The only connection I could see with the Black Freighter portions was it dealt with obsession to the point of self destruction which was a theme in the Watchmen.  The problem is that the extra animated portions just slowed the movie down and took you away from what you paid to see.  Actually it was like hitting PAUSE throughout the movie to stop and talk about a completely different movie.  The Black Freighter should not even be called the Watchmen.     Unfortunately you end up paying a ridiculous amount of money for a movie that is actually two separate and competing movies.  If you pay full price for this \\"Ultimate Cut\\" version you will be extremely disappointed.     To be fair the Black Freighter was a decent piece of animation but it needs to be a separate movie that is not associated with the Watchmen.  The story however is rather predictable.  It's essentially Heavy Metal meets Pirates of the Caribbean.
B00006AVRK|5.0|The DVDs were in really good shape.  I recieved them in a good time frame.  They made a wonderful present for my dad.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This two disc DVD has the extra's any true fan would hope for, it is much more in-depth than the theatrical version and the extras are well worth it. The Director Cameron Crowe brings the audience in far more in-depth with really great interviews and an honest and unmerciful audio-commentary which had me in stitches. For anyone who loves true rock music, I highly recommend this special edition as you get swept along for the highs, lows and everything in between.
B001TH16DI|4.0|The video on blu ray is not bad, but not the best.  The sound was excellant.  The only thing that I would complain about, is that there are missing scenes from when I saw Star Trek 6 in the theatres.  At the end of the movie when the sniper is shot and falls from his sniper spot, he lands and there is red blood where he is.  Some one comes up and says \\"This is not klingon blood!\\"  Well this scene is now gone.  What the hell?  Are all the movies like this?
B000001H3E|4.0|This album continued developments only hinted at on the preceding 'Under the Sign of the Black Mark', and took Bathory's music to a new level of splendor and intensity.<br /><br />'Odens Ride Over Nordland' breathes mystery over the darkening world before segueing into the opening of 'A Fine Day to Die', a paean to dying in battle. An eerie acoustic passage recounts the night before the conflict, then thunderously heavy guitars announce the onset of battle. Another piece, 'For All Those Who Died', is a tribute to the victims of institutionalised Christianity, who died \\"burning naked but smiling, not full of fear but pride.\\"<br /><br />But the most epic and moving song is the title track, which seems to sing of the fate of Europeans, who have lost their identity and are now mental slaves:<br /><br />\\"Children of all slaves, unite be proud<br />Rise out of darkness and pain<br /><br />\\"A chariot of thunder and gold will come loud<br />And a warrior with thunder and rain<br /><br />\\"With hair white as snow, hammer of steel<br />To set you free of your chains<br /><br />\\"And lead you all where horses run free<br />And the souls of your ancient ones reign.\\"<br /><br />This messianic longing is actually a bad thing - it's up to us to save ourselves, and no 'warrior with thunder and rain' is going to do it for us. But it's hard not to be moved by the intense emotion with which Quorthon sings those lines. Maybe we should interpret the 'warrior' as our own innermost Selves, who will rise and fight in our hour of deepest need...<br /><br />Now where's my hammer?

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|As somebody who likes things simple and sweet it is with no surprise that I just love this movie. Clint Eastwood's style of directing just gives you the necessary. There are no 'fast cuts' just for the purposes of creating tension or action. He just lets the actors and story do there jobs. Eastwood's performance as an actor is one of his best. As a director he manages to get many of his supporting actors, many of whom had never acted before, to give credible performances that don't diminish what he wants to convey.

1592289444|3.0|The Long Walk by Slavomir Rawicz is a story of an escape from prison, an escape from the Soviet gulag. This is a usual thriller/ adventure story but an unusual memoir of Soviet gulag. Rawicz is not in the line of Solzhenitsyn, or Ginzburg or Shalamov. The main subject of the memoirs of these great Soviet dissidents was the description of life in Communist prisons and camps. The Long Walk however is a story of the adventures of seven men who fled the gulag.<br /><br />Though never reaching the intensity of the great gulag memoirists, the description of the prison cells and of the interrogation by the NKVD officers in the Lubyanka, are authentic enough to produce a harrowing sensation in the reader.<br /><br />The journey on the Trans-Siberian railway is well portrayed though it is from here that the reader starts feeling the ease of a fairy tale in which even tragic circumstances have an inevitable sense of happy ending... and even if there is a sense of doom it is born with a superior feeling of a Christian martyr who has Heaven in sight after all the suffering.<br /><br />Nothing is seriously wrong with the narrative until the prisoners reach Irkutsk. Then it goes all mythical. We are told of a 600 miles plus trek of prisoners in the Siberian winters with -20 degree temperature or worse, and that with just the minimal clothing of fufaika?<br /><br />Apart from the fact that no human party could survive such at trek, it would serve no purpose to the gulag authorities to run all the prisoners to their death after taking enormous trouble of imprisoning them for months and then carting them over for more than 4,000 miles. The gulag indeed was meant for punishing the common people but it also had an economic angle, particularly in the decade of 1940s, the time when the events depicted in the book transpired. By this time the Great Terror (1937-38) under Yezhov had already passed and the gulag had a more economic purpose under its new chief Lavrenti Beria.<br /><br />This is the first time when the readers feel that the story is fake. The BBC has confirmed that the story is not entirely true. The most probable course of events is: Rawicz did suffer in gulag, but he never escaped but was rehabilitated in the amnesty of 1942. This sounds true as the latter half of the book which is about the escape seems fake, while the former half is sufficiently authentic.<br /><br />But then why did Rawicz depict the stupid trek to Yakutia when he did experience deportation from the transit camp? Maybe Rawicz is just preparing his readers for the shocking fancies of the escape. Perhaps it is a necessary prelude for what follows later.<br /><br />As soon as they reach the gulag the talk of escape starts. Rawicz finds a Dickensian character in the camp commander's wife who quizzically helps them to escape by helping them in hoarding food for the journey. When it comes to gathering enough men for forming the escape party, Rawicz finds the appropriate men as if the whole thing is just a play being enacted on a domestic stage, with actors taking up their respective roles, enthusiastically anticipating the adventure!<br /><br />The account of the prison break is so short that it almost feels like the prison is just a baby cage, surmountable for toddlers over five.<br /><br />Rawicz goes from dubious to impossible when we come to the Gobi trail. Going on for days on end in the scorching heat, without shelter and without water! It's simply ridiculous. In a desert like Gobi, a man can die in less than six hours without water, out of sheer exhaustion. Eating snakes is quite convincing but how did they make fire and from what? Quite later in the book (Oops! I almost said novel!) it is described that Zano used to gather animal droppings to use as firewood. The reader wonders again: in a place where the only thing to eat was snake meat, how the hell did they gather enough droppings for the firewood? And anyways how did they manage to find stones to light theirfire in a sea of sand? A possible explanation is the air dropping of cow dung as relief packages in the Gobi by the United Nations, but sadly it had not come into existence then!<br /><br />There are a lot of other such incongruities but even on the level of story the book is weak. The characters are all caricatures and stereotypes. They have no individuality of their own. There is no character development by the author. The characters are all shades of good: jolly, patronizing , wise, morose...  There is also a fine specimen of fair sex in the party, who keeps the atmosphere light and enjoyable. It is as if the characters were handpicked for making a zoo of human virtues. All the classic gulag memoirists tell of the dehumanizing character of the camps where the sheer hunger and cold drove out every human feeling out of most of the prisoners and made them mad, hungry animals who could trade anything for just a warm bowl of soup.<br /><br />To cap it all there is the final shocker: the crossing of the Himalayas by six brave men with no mountaineering kit and next to no experience! And remember guys! It's not only one peak we are talking about, but the whole range of the highest mountains on earth! There is a reason James Bond has not crossed the Himalayas yet!<br /><br />All these hurdles are passed with the obligatory casualties and such ease that it almost feels like a picnic. It can even make the reader yearn for going on such a trek!<br /><br />...and as dessert, there are Yetis...<br /><br />There is one authentic feature of Rawicz's writing, though a misplaced one. He always calls his persecutors as `the Russians', reflecting the traditional Polish hatred of everything Russian. Very rarely does he use the word `Communist', a fact which shows a lack of understanding of the ideological basis of the crimes of the Soviets.<br /><br />The Long Walk would have made for a good novel, but it is claimed to be a memoir. It is interesting but it's certainly fake.<br /><br />Peter Weir in Hollywood has caught on the story and with hard work it may turn out to be a good movie.w dung as relief packages in the Gobi by the United Nations, but sadly it had not come into existence then!

B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Triangle was good, but with one catch: It has already been done as a movie.  Save for the film's setting and story changes, the film's concept was taken from the 2007 movie \\"Los Cronocr&iacute;menes\\", also known as TimeCrimes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Triangle, I won't spoil it by pointing out the obvious similarities between the two movies.  While Triangle was well shot and well-acted by Melissa George, the film's concept would have been much more powerful if I hadn't seen it before.  The exact moment that the ship's killer is first seen, I immediately knew where the story was going.  Even the killer's disguise was entirely borrowed from the TimeCrimes story.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching Triangle.  Certain elements of the story are unique, and I was happy with the cast.  But ultimately, the film lost most of it's spark once I realized that the film's main concept was borrowed from a popular sci-fi movie from Spain.  So while Triangle is worth checking out, I would absolutely suggest that you watch TimeCrimes as well.

The whole family, including chidren, minus mother was sent to Yodok, one of the North Korean gulag. The book is for the most part the description of this gulag. Yodok had natural barriers of mountains and jungles on all sides except one which was fenced. The prisoners did try to escape but most failed and those who were caught were publicly executed, often stoned to death.    The description of one such public execution reminds the reader of stoning to death in Islam, a process which not only terrifies the would-be transgressors, but also fuels the hatred towards those who dare to oppose the totalitarian regime. One cannot help but make comparisons between the two inhuman ideologies.    Food rations, being typically gulag, were hardly above the starvation levels, and so the inmates were reduced to eat rats and live salamanders.    While the Soviet gulags had cold cells, North Korean ones have `sweat boxes' in which one is left to survive on cockroaches and other insects in a crouching position.    The book is an average account of a great tragedy, the still continuing North Korean gulags. The author is not a great artist and falls short of the great prison memoirists like Ginzburg and Solzhenitsyn. What makes the book remarkable is the immense human tragedy which speaks through the simple and direct words of the author.    Although the homage to George W. Bush in the preface and the warm view of Christian proselytizers spoils it a little bit. The title is also not very appropriate. The author used to keep an aquarium in his house in Pyongyang, which he took to the gulag as one thing to carry. The fishes kept dying until the last one died after some months into the gulag... hence the name. However the title gives a feeling as if the life in Pyongyang was what there was to desire against all the atrocities of Communism. Something related to eating rats and salamanders would have been a better choice.    I deduct one star from my review because of the narrative lacunae and not because of the content. The content deserves ten stars! This is a damning review of the evil ideology of Communism.

0385504225|4.0|Many friends and colleagues who I consider to be both intelligent and conscious have recommended this book.  I finally had time to read it during a recent beach vacation and agree that it is both entertaining, thought-provoking and action-packed.  I enjoyed learning about the rich histories of the monuments and buildings in Washington DC which are so nicely woven into the mystical underlying story.  Dan Brown treats us to fiction loaded with rich descriptions, places and facts.  I loved the book because it emphasizes the power of human thought and the power of love to conquer fear.  It also reminds the reader of the powerful force of  emerging human consciousness that is possible in this age though globalization and technological innovation.<br /><br />I didn't give it a five because the characters and situations described in the story are extreme and a bit hard to believe.  Nevertheless, it makes for a good escape -- just what I was looking for on the beach.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Well after all this time, Evangelion 1.11 came out last Tuesday. I have been waiting for this movie ever since October when I first discovered it and then I found out that the November Evangelion 1.01 release was a bad dvd release with problems, so I had to wait until Evangelion 1.11 came out so I waited about 5 months for this movie. During that time however I watched the whole original Neon Genesis Evangelion series, all the way till the end of End of Evangelion. I will not give anything away at the end but the ending to the Original Series was not what I hoped for but I was glad that Anno made End of Evangelion instead of leaving it to the even worse ending that the original TV series left off at.       Ok, now moving back to Evangelion 1.11 release. Well I was so excited about this release that I pre-ordered my blu-ray copy in January and I received it this Wednesday and just watched it today which is Saturday. After watching it I was glad. This movie met with my expectations and was a faithful remake and it was just as I expected. It did not exceed my expectations because I knew what was coming from the movie and I did not see how they would be able to make the first 6 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion any more interesting because this movie was meant to introduce the characters so I knew they would not change anything major from the start. So the story is about the same as the original TV series except that they cut out what was unnecessary to the main plot like all of Shinji's classmates knowing that he was an Eva pilot or when Shinji camped out with Kensuke when he was returning home after he was trying to run away. So the story is very faithful to the first 6 episodes       The animation is wonderful and looks really clean and the CG is the best that I have ever seen in an animated movie, especially the Evas and Angels look a lot better than they did in the original anime series. I played this movie off my Playstation 3 and I was watching it through my 13year old TV that only projects movies and games in 480i but it still looked really good and in the future when I get an HDTV, it will probably look way better. The dub is really great too but I cannot comment on the audio yet because I do not have a stereo system and that one of the speakers on my TV is dead so I had to put my TV volume high while listening to the movie in mono.        The only thing that I have to complain about this blu-ray is the packaging. I am not saying the packaging looks bad however, I actually really liked how the packaging looks, it is just physical how the case was. The case is pure cardboard and I though it would have a blu-ray case like all of my other blu-rays but everything about the case is made out of cardboard so that is my only complaint.        So it is a good movie for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans like myself, but for people who did not watch the original anime may think there was not enough action in it and that it was too short. Well just wait until the other 3 movies to come out because this movie is not like Final Fantasy 7 Advent of Children, because it is rebuilding a story that actually makes sense instead of pointless action sequences. So this is a must have for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans and people new to the series, just watch this movie and wait for the rest because this is just an introduction to an epic story, just like the first Lord of the Rings movie.

Her family remained relatively unaware of her contribution until the medical community started approaching them about obtaining their DNA and cells.

And yes, it was lightly based on the authors life. But again, it is fiction.      There was not a boring chapter in this book! It holds you and never lets go until the very ending...    I read 200 or more books a year, and I can HONESTLY say this is the best book I have ever read.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|The special effects in this movie are amazing. It's like watching a train wreck over and over again only nobody gets killed but Woody, and that's a good thing because it puts him out of his misery. If you enjoy a good story with characterization, plot, and theme this is not the movie for you. Maybe, just maybe, if I had watched it on a big screen, probably Imax in 3D, it would have held my interest, as it was I fell asleep toward the end of the movie. It was so mediocre I didn't even bother to watch the rest of it the next morning.<br />I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the box office. I can't wait to mail it back to Netflix.
1594488843|4.0|Drive by Daniel Pink is a quality reflection on what motivates others and yourself.  Some of his ideas are new and others are ones that we, as a reader, may just not have thought of recently.  The book is simply set into three parts and here is my summary of the parts.  Part 1: How does motivation play a role in society?  Part 2: 3 keys to being a driven person, Part 3: Tool kit to become better.  The best part of the entire book is in the tool kit portion which is dedicated to make you a more driven person as well as focusing hard on \\"driving\\" those who may work for you to be better.  This book is both technical and practical.  The ideas written about are not revolutionary but really make you think of how to do things better.  Drive is a solid read that is very much set up for people who are leaders within any type of organization or those who are wanting to better themselves.

From the first page I enjoyed the book immensely and am looking forward to reading the other two books written by Larsson.  I passed the book along to my dad who while an avid reader, tends to be a little pickier than me and he enjoyed the book as well.  I thought the plots were well written and believable and the characters were very interesting.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to those who enjoy murder mysteries with a nice touch of suspense.

B000002GYI|5.0|Despite a varied taste in music, before listening to \\"Computer World\\" by Kraftwerk I had limited exposure to electronic music and especially electronic music of the last forty years.  However, even a basic understanding of electronic music cannot inhibit the glowing brilliance of this music from being readily apparent.  Simply, Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World\\" clearly stands as a landmark album in the history of electronic music, as the album pushes electronic music to new places while blending human elements of music with computer music technology.   Recorded in 1981, the primary instruments are Moog synthesizers, rhythm machines, vocoders, a Texas Instrument \\"Speak and Spell\\", a calculator, and a few other sources of sounds.  While Moog synthesizers had been used in recording electronic music for several years, the combination of the synthesizers and other instruments developed a sound that certainly reflected current technology.  Technology obviously plays a critical role in the music, but a different, larger role compared to past electronic music.  Initially I was struck by the sheer quality of the recording, as electronic music of the past, especially that which puts samples recorded on tapes together, often has noticeable flaws in the basic recording quality.  Furthermore, Kraftwerk shows complete mastery of creating music out of a diverse array of electronic sounds.  Their somewhat minimalistic approach produces engaging music that is much more accessible and listenable than the electronic music from the past.  Since Kraftwerk clearly seems more focused on creating sounds rather than sampling, they are more influenced by the electronische muzik background of electronic music rather than sample emphasizing music concrete.  On \\"Computer World\\" Kraftwerk makes appealing and interesting music with nothing but up to date technology, but makes this album special is the intersection of that technology with the human elements of music.   Many of my first experiences with electronic music were simply frustrating.  The music sounds like a totally random collection of filtered sounds that do not display any talent in the assemblage. Yet, the brilliance of this music results from the balance of the sonic elements of the technology and electronic music and the more traditional, human elements of melody, composition, and themes.  The first track, \\"Computer World\\", is a well-developed, layered composition with a definitive melody and chord progression while the fifth track \\"Computer Love\\" maintains the album wide pattern of artful and thorough compositions but includes deep and serious lyrics that add another dimension to the album.  \\"Home Computer\\" displays more complexity as the song evolves more over the course of the song relative to other tracks on the album and the song contains several distinct sections.  The album as a whole definitely resonated with me and left me appreciating the talent of Kraftwerk and their music.  Again the excellence of \\"Computer World\\" stems from the combination of technology and the electronic music sound with the more traditional, human elements of melody and composition, and the result is a unique sound that is accessible, interesting, and transcends pre-conceived notions of electronic music.  Beyond the unique and groundbreaking mix of pure technology with principles of music, Kraftwerk continues to take electronic music to new spaces as \\"Computer World\\" is music with a message and clear themes.  In the past, electronic music was created purely because of advances in technology or simply because it could be.  Rarely did electronic music contain themes and messages.  However, \\"Computer World\\" firmly establishes that electronic music can be larger than the music itself. The title track of the album lists different organizations that will likely gain access to everyone's personal information.  Also, the lyrics of \\"Computer Love\\" discuss the loss and displacement of human interaction due to the riseof computers and technology.  As whole, \\"Computer World\\" explores the rise of the computer in everyday life through the lyrics and structure of the album.  The music of \\"Computer World\\" is as great as it is thought provoking, as Kraftwerk's landmark album pushes electronic music into a more insightful place.  No longer is electronic music a concert hall gimmick, but it can have meaning and a message.  As someone who until recently had absolutely no exposure to electronic music at all, I highly recommend Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World\\".  I particularly enjoy the bright and playful \\"Pocket Calculator\\" and also the heavier, introspective \\"Computer Love\\".  Many of the songs sound very similar given the instrumentation, but given the album's short length it is hardly an issue.  The music on the whole album is well constructed, thought provoking, and very accessible for the genre.  \\"Computer World\\" should not be missed by music enthusiasts as the album showcases an artists pushing their genre in new directions while creating music that has resonated with many in the past, present, and will most certainly in the future.
B00337KM2S|1.0|This movie should be called \\"George Clooney saying and doing stuff\\".  I guess middle-aged women will love this movie, that still doesn't explain guy positive guy reviews.  This movie has almost zero plot, it is basically about a guy that enjoys flying because of his job and doesn't want to get married.  So basically, this movie is about a lot of people that fly.    I think that is the flaw of the movie, you have to actually hate the George Clooney character.  I didn't, I loved it.  The character, not Geoge Clooney.  Seriously, he made a great lifestyle choice and we are supposed to hate that?  He doesn't want to have kids?  So what?  If you see the commercials, that is what the film is about.  A guy has a boring job where he tells people that they are fired and he has to travel to do it.    Oh yea, his life sucks and he is a loner but he has a girlfriend through out the entire film?  The director serves this film to us in a dry/boring, almost too realistic manner.  I guess we are supposed to appreciate the low-key subtleness of the film.  Sorry, you guys aren't the Cohen brothers.  It just comes off as very, very boring.    If you ever worked in an office and you ever went into a meeting, this is what this film is like.  A really long, boring meeting with George Clooney saying stuff.
0307269981|4.0|As someone who doesn't read a lot of fiction, I highly enjoyed Larsson's tale of the convoluted life that is Lisbeth Salander.  The author does an excellent job at building a noir atmosphere that fits the plot, and Larsson's habit of quickly switching the third-person narration from character to character is manageable by the reader.  While the plot includes some dead ends and some false information, it's still easy to find a rooting interest in the story, and the last 100 pages or so are impossible to put down.<br /><br />That being said, there are a couple of flaws that keep the text from being fantastic.  Larsson apparently attended the Stephenie Meyer school of exposition, which means that the center of the book tends to be dragged down by its own minutia.  Similarly, the heroine (Lisbeth Salander) is such an engaging person that, when she disappears, the plot also slows to a crawl.<br /><br />Overall, Larsson produced an entertaining, if long, read that keeps your attention and draws you in to a world where you're not going to be able to wait for the final book of the trilogy.

B000M0XJ88|5.0|Seiko offers two similar versions of a mechanical \\"military\\" watch:     The SNK809 (which is black, but there are other colors). This has a 21 jewel movement (generally the 7S26B, but the earlier models have the 7S26). It has a 36mm case (excluding the crown) and18mm wide band.     The other model is the lager SNZG15 (which is black, but there are other colors). This has a 23 jewel movement (generally the 7S36B, but earlier models have the 7S36).  It has a 40mm case (excluding crown) and an 22mm band.     Both of these watches are gray market. You won't see them for sale in US stores.     I've owned my SNK809 for several months and love it. Its very accurate for the price. Mine gains about 5 sec/day. You'll have to spend a lot of money to do better than that in the mechanical watch world.    Two of my friends own the SNZG15, and they seem to gain about 10 sec/day. Note: The fact the SNZG15 has 23 jewels doesn't mean its more accurate than a 21 jewel movement.  It's larger, pushes more mass (bigger hands), and thus I speculate is inherently less accurate than the smaller SNK809.     I got my SNK809 on eBay for $45 + $25 shipping (2009). However, it was shipped from Hong Kong. It had to clear customs, shipping takes about three weeks, and has more inherent risk. I'd expect to pay more on Amazon if it was shipped from within the US. Similarly, I've seen the SNG15 for as little as $105 with free shipping, shipped from Singapore.     What I did not appreciate at the time I bought my SNK809 is that its water resistant rating is 30 meters (WR30M).  98 ft.  That seems sufficient unless you're a serious scuba diver, right?     Wrong.     Look up water resistant ratings for watches on Wikipedia.     30 meters is the static water pressure for the test conducted in the ratings lab.  The working/dynamic pressure rating will be much less.  You should not even shower wearing a WR30M watch, let alone swim with it. WR30M is considered splash resistant only. I have splashed my watch,it still runs great, but depending upon your lifestyle, this may or may not be an issue.     The bigger SNZG15 is rated at WR100M, which you can swim and skin dive with. The smallest rating you should swim with (but no skin diving) is WR50M.     The other aspect of the SNK809 you should be aware of is that its smaller than most watches are today. In the 1960's an 18mm band was typical. Today its small, aesthetically, particularly for a person with large wrists.     When I first got my SNK809, I was taken aback by how thin the band looked (and I have smaller than average wrists).   I have read the market Seiko is targeting with this model is teenagers in Asia.  That market base probably has smaller wrists than the average American male.    But after wearing it for awhile, I noticed I wasn't banging it into things like I do with my larger watch.  And it fit under my shirt sleeves better.     Its notable that my friends say the 22mm SNZG15 is a bit bigger than they wish it was.     I've concluded I like the 18mm band.   I'm an outdoorsman (when I can be), and do wish the SNK809 was at least WR50M.  Other reviewers will say they wish it had a hacking mechanism or a sapphire crystal.   Those are not issues for me, and for the price, let's get real.    This is a phenomenal mechanical watch for what you'll pay.  I wear mine to work every day.  I wear it to meetings and snicker to myself as my second hand moves at six clicks per second, while others sitting at the table suffer the one second lurch of the ubiquitous quartz movement.  Yes, I'm a watch geek.   Just be aware of the smaller width of the band and WR30M rating.  If those aren't big issues for you, you can't beat it.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Ok, I'll make this short and simple with just enough detail so most anyone can understand what I'm writing about.                               First- About the product. I purchase this product because I wanted 7.1-5.1 surround sound, but I have to worry about not waking my family up at night. I had a pair of the older X1 wired surround stereo head set, but they were getting old. I first looked at the price and thought they were a bit much. You can get a 5.1 home unit for you TV for about the same price yes, but I tend to play when others are sleeping (kids, GF, so on) and the x1 were perfect but need to be replaced (kids tripping over cords).                                Second- The hook up was really easy, just a glance and the manual and basic entertainment center knowledge and I was done in 3 minutes.                  Third- Performance of the X41's and EXCELLENT! I use them with Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 mostly and that they are worth every penny. With the volume up really loud I can even hear other players when they are using Ninja Pro (something suppose to make them perfectly quite) Some other review say there is a slight buzzing sound with this model headset, but only if the game volume is REALLY HIGH. they are powered by 2 AAA batteries, that depending on play time, last 2-5 days I recommend rechargeable batteries. The wireless transmitter is powered via USB cable. Your suppose to plug it in to your Xbox 360, but all my slots were full, so i plugged it into my TV's service technichins slot and it works perfectly. Unlike my friends X4's, the sound doesn't brake up when I move around because these are RF, not IR, so you don't have to be line of sight. The range is about 30 feet, just like your wireless controller. I have friends thats have other wireless headset made by Triton and Astro, and when I tried there (and vice-versa), Turtle Beach felt better to wear, had just as good game and voice sound, and was the better deals for the money (my friends now have X41's too).                  The las thing I have to note is about the transmitter itself. It works as a stand to hold the headset when not in use, it has the ability to hook up to the console (or any 5.1-7.1 fiber optic device) and really  to another (like you home surround unit) and even has stereo plugs (red and white component) in slots on the back for another device (like MP3 player). It even looks on the shelf' but is also small enough to hide behind the TV. The only thing that would be nice to have on it would be if the voice chat worked with other devices (Play Station 3, PC, so). Other than that, if your thinking of buying, don't think, just buy them.                  Hope people find this helpful. If your just a serious gamer who play for fun and/or to win, and/or you have to consider being quite for others in the house, this is the headset for you. It is truly worth every penny.

032147404X|5.0|As an amateur photographer (at best), I found this book entertaining, easy to read and just as easy to follow. This book has great tips, and is one of the best that I have found out there. Kelby does not really teach you the \\"science,\\" but rather what he would do in certain situations. It is written as if you are standing beside him at a photo shoot, he more or less directs you to which settings you should change and when, not necessarily why.

B0031RAOVY|1.0|WARNING! Spoiler Alert!    I'm an animal lover so I really wanted to see this film. I am very particular about not having any spoilers before seeing a film for myself or reading reviews. I knew the story was going to be sad and it was. In the beginning I had high hopes for the film as it felt inspiring, at first. After all, an animal's devotion and loyalty wins over the hearts of those who try to resist and he ends up in a loving home. Everyone's life is enriched. But for me something went drastically wrong after the owner's death.    The film is a tear jerker. I cried, for the loss of the family as well as the dog's loss. And I kept waiting for someone to care enough about this intelligent, loyal dog to care for it. But, no one did. It was so disturbing to me that I couldn't even speak. That poor animal was abandoned by his entire family, because he was too loyal and devoted. Over the years hundreds of passers by and employees said hi and neglected him. No one even bothered to put up a shelter for him or a blanket. He was not rescued.    I realize this is based on a true story and we all know that human cruelty has no bounds. What was so shocking to me is that the makers of this film had no problems changing the location of the story and embellishing it as they saw fit. Why did they completely ignore the neglect that dog suffered? It is supposed to be a dog's tale, right? And I guess freezing in winter, baking in the summer, having all the people in your life throw up their hands and walk away from you, fighting to survive on the streets and dying alone was great joy for Hachiko?    I expected that the makers of this film would have warnings at the beginning and end of the film about adopting pets or purchasing from reputable breeders. I was sure they would have acknowledged that this wonderful, loving animal deserved better than what happened to him. This movie, actually looking at it from Hachiko's perspective, left me feeling sick and angry and crushed.    I'vebeen searching the net and haven't heard one thing about any of this film's proceeds doing anything to help any animal.I have rarely found any review expressing concern for how this precious animal was forced to live after his owner died. I feel like these filmmakers preyed on animal lovers' appreciation of the special bonds we share with the many species on the Earth to loosen our wallets. It truly horrified me and I would NEVER watch this film again and wish I had not seen it to begin with. It glamorizes animal neglect.
B0035V35P8|5.0|I originally saw Ninja Assasin in the theatre and it blew me away. Now THIS is a martial arts movie worthy of even the Run Run Shaw label. It has all the right elements and it does not skimp on the blood. If you want to see a really good popcorn movie - N. A. is it.    Suprise #1: A pop singer stars in this movie as the rogue ninja fighting his former comrades. Suprise #2: He is superb in the role. His stunt work is impressive as well as his acting. The atuff with the Kyoketsu shoge (whip chain) was amazing.     Surprise #3: The director of this film knows his craft - the fight scenes were well choreographed and edited and the movie moved along at a good pace.    The biggest surprise: Sho Kosugi, Mr. Ninja Theatre himself, is in this movie portraying the Ninja clan leader. If you like films like \\"Shogun Assasin\\", then buy this film.    I can't wait for the sequel!
B000005RPX|5.0|This is a great collection for any Purple freak.  Lots of the same songs during the 3 shows but there is enough variation to keep it very interesting.  This was DP in their prime and remains one of the best live collections in rock history.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me, and it didn't sound like my cup of tea. However I ordered it anyway and I loved it.  It's the story of three friends  filmmaker Luis Bunel, poet Frederico Garcia Lorca, and painter Salvador Dali when they were students at Art school in Spain.  However the focus of the film is the relationship between Lorca and Dali.  It's very moving and heart-wrenching.  The characters are beautifully  played by Javier Beltran and Robert Pattinson.  Both actors are fantastic.  I was surprized by the chemistry between these two actors.  They played off each other very well. Beltran illustrated Lorca's passion for Dali and Pattinson portrayed the conflicted & eccentric Dali to perfection.  It's about love, loss, fear,regret, love of country & family, prejudice and violence. I decided to look up the work of these artists b/c of the film.  I saw some films of Dali.  He really was eccentric and Robert nailed that.  I was crying at the end because it was very moving and sad.  I would have liked more background information on all three major characters.  They could have hired a dialect coach to make the English of the two British actors sound more like that of the Spanish actor.  Other than that I highly recommend the film.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|This is an action packed film involving a mountaineering adventure, a love story, and the politics of pre-1936 Olympic Games Germany.  Pay close attention to the dialogue to catch the subtle politics emerging in the social setting at the posh hotel in the Alps.  The mountaineers make basic mistakes which result in a nailbiting climax.  The film is based on a true story and should be watched by anyone who thinks they want to climb a mountain.  I'm recommending it to all my dear mountaineering friends and relatives to remind them to plan well, climb wisely, and return home safe.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Sherlock Holmes will have to employ himself hard in order to decipher and follow the traces of this serial killer (Lord Blackwood), unraveling these puzzled clues and rejoining them in order to capture him and finally to reveal his sinister plans of conspiracy to rule the world.<br /><br />As you may expect there will be lots of the well known steeled British humor all along the film. Once more, Robert Downey  confirms what Robert Altman said about him, labeling as the Best Actor of his generation. Jude Law is breathtaking too as his fervent collaborator, Dr. Watson.<br /><br />Don't miss this engaging and irresistible masterwork. The opened finale clearly suggest us the second saga.
0061914177|2.0|Gary is great at one thing... convincing people to buy his book. There isnt much substance to this book. As one other review mentions this is not a &#34;how to&#34; book rather a &#34;this is what I did&#34; book.<br /><br />Gary could sell anything. In fact I think he was great at selling mediocre wine when he needed to move bottles.
B000ICLRJ8|5.0|This was a Great action movie with a lot of edge of your seat suspense.  Caught myself holding my breath a couple times.  Very good drama and action movie.  The Aircraft launches were wonderful.  We loved it!  We will be watching this movie several more times!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I loved The Dark Knight when I saw it in the theater back in the summer of 08 - it was one of my favorite movies of the year.  Despite that fact, this was no exception to my recent difficulty calmly sitting through a movie I've seen before (because there's so much else out there I need to be watching!), but that's just me.  The real reason I bought this Blu-Ray was for some excellent special features chronicling the making of this triumphant summer blockbuster, and what I got was a bit underwhelming.  The two slick documentaries about Batman technology and psychology were neat but lacked much input from the film's creators, just a lot of \\"experts\\" and third parties jabbing about Batman-ish subjects.  Other than that, there's really just a series of short web documentaries, featuring feedback from Nolan and the rest of the crew, even if the story is largely told in still images.  I realize the special features I wanted (something on par with Star Trek or Iron Man) requires lots of extra effort (an extra film crew essentially to see everything go down) and maybe the filmmakers were respecting the late Ledger in not showing day to day behind the scenes footage fearing it would be too unsettling, but I kind of was hoping to be unsettled.  What I got was just... meh.
0393072231|5.0|Hugely entertaining look at the genesis of our current economic mess.  Lewis finds the very few investors who predicted and profited from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown and follows their journey from initial realization of the impending disaster to eventual payout.  Following these eccentric characters and their interactions with the big Wall Street investment banks is at turns laugh out loud funny and head shaking incredulous.  Lewis knows how to turn a phrase and does a good job teasing out the dark humor of the situations.  He also does a very good job at explaining the essence of very complicated financial transactions and gives the reader a good understanding of the whys and hows of the financial meltdown.  While this book is an important addition to our understanding of what happened, it isn't complete as it doesn't spend any time talking about US government policies that contributed to the crash (specifically, the special legal status given to the three rating agencies, and Fannie and Freddie's role in weakening underwriting standards).  Nonetheless, this is still both an important and entertaining book.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|My review is from the perspective of a single girl, grad student. I watched this on a Sunday afternoon and I thought it was just 'okay'.  It's nothing I would invite friends over to see.  I could appreciate the story line about a highly skilled guy trying to outsmart the authorities but more than anything I was a tad disappointed to see Jamie Foxx in this; it just seems like he should be in better roles.  This is good for a relaxing day because it's the type of movie where you don't have to think much and you can get up and get refreshments and go to the bathroom and not miss the story line.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|Percy (Perseus, get it?) is a teenager with a goofy sidekick, listens to music while his teachers lecture, a bit arrogant and know-it-all, who thinks his mom married badly (at least he's right about the bald drunk for a step-father) and leads the usual high schooler's life.  Example:  He walks down the hall of his school with a fight or two happening in the background, and his crutched friend and himself are casually going down the hall chatting.<br /><br />His mother and he live in a run-down apartment where she brings beer on command when her husband asks for it.  Wow, I'm marrying this gal!  The bum husband is not developed very well in the story and is in purely as a plot device.  Later in the film the relationship is further developed but predictable and silly.  Holy Mount Olympus!<br /><br />Meantime, back at the skyscraper (long story) Zeus and Poseidon (the king of the gods and the king of the sea, respectively) get angry with each other when Zeus accuses Poseidon's son (hey, Percy!) with stealing Zeus's source of power: a lightning bolt.  Pose has until the summer solstice to find out what's happening or else get the consequences.<br /><br />I mean, really now!  What proof?  Never explained.  Why does Poseidon walk in plain sight of everyone when he changes to human form?  Not explained.  So far so hole-ish....  :P<br /><br />After a particularly silly scene where Percy is learning about the Greeks in a museum but not paying attention with the ear buds from his iPod.  Gee, the irony.<br /><br />Then the magic happens.  His English teacher with the pinched face turns into a Harpy and demands the bolt.  I mean, you always knew your teachers were harpies, right?<br /><br />Pierce Brosnon is a guy in a wheelchair doing the Greek lecturing.  (Spoiler) we learn later that Pearce's character is really a centaur (half man, half horse) with the usual jokes of being a horse's ass.  (No, I'm not making this up).  (End spoiler)<br /><br />The inevitable mom gets kidnapped to Hell and Percy's quest, with the help of the daughter of Athena (who he sort of loves) and his crutched friend who turns out to be a satyr (mild sex jokes here) and they're off.<br /><br />If you know your Greek mythology you will be mildly insulted.  If you just want to watch a show of teenagers on a quest to deal with the devil, then you might enjoy a Friday night rental.<br /><br />The Medusa effects are interesting, turning people into stone.  But why did that woman grab Athena's daughter and bring her before Medusa only to herself turn into stone??  Sorry, thinking too much.  :P<br /><br />The original Perseus vanquished Medusa and was the son of Zeus, but the film did not pretend to be faithful to the Greek myths.  There are some scenes where the sons and daughters of these mortal/immortal unions were at Camp Half-blood (very \\"potter\\" like) where they train all day and fight all day.  No explanation as to why or for what purpose they train.  They just like to have a boot camp for these kids I guess.<br /><br />The whole film plods on and on like this.  From what I understand the film is based on a series of four books by Rick Riordan.  I may pick up these young adult novels to see what the fuss is all about.<br /><br />Director Chris Columbus did a lot better with Harry Potter.  \\"Percy Jackson\\" has a lot of plot holes, very derivative and predictable storylines, subplots that make no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions.<br /><br />I'm hoping the books make more sense, but in my book, \\"Percy Jackson\\" is a failed attempt at not only a decent book to film adaptation, but leaves little to the imagination, more special effects than a Michael Bay movie and not much else.<br /><br />Better:<br /><br />Shall I say it?  Read a BOOK about Greek Myths!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:1606310585 Oh My Gods!: A Look-it-Up Guide to the Gods of Mythology (Mythlopedia)]]<br />[[ASIN:0762414979 The Classic Treasury of Bulfinch's Mythology (Courage Classics)]]<br /><br />Another choice:<br /><br />Read the actual Rick Riordan books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]]<br /><br />Other Chris Columbus films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002GJT4Y6 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Ultimate Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004U1EX My Best Friend's Wedding / Stepmom]]d Set (Books 1-3)]]    Other Chris Columbus films:     [[ASIN:B002GJT4Y6 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Ultimate Edition)]]  [[ASIN:B00004U1EX My Best Friend's Wedding / Stepmom]]
B000VS6R26|5.0|Of course I love the movie; I'm happy with this DVD version, and the price was right.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|The movie Came super fast! And it was in mint condition! The seller was right on point about everything in the description.
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|What a great movie !!! As someone who grew up in the 60's and 70's, I must say this movie really got it right, Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll.  An absolute dream come true for many a teenager in that era, to travel on tour behind the scenes with the likes of Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, AC/DC, or the Stones. Special kudos to Kate Hudson, she truly stole the show, what a wonderful performance. An all-time classic.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I saw the show on PBS and even though I'm not crazy about their style, they have wonderful voices and Mom is gonna love it!
B0020H47EQ|5.0|Tremendous movie. Great acting, fascinating story, stimulating and provocative. As current and thought provoking today as when it came out.
1439163855|4.0|This book has a unique, a very original plot and during reading  you continuosly ask the \\"what if\\" question.  What if you were Sara, what if you were Kate, what if you were Anna?     very touching...I read this book after I saw the movie ads. didnt see the movie yet but certainly recommend this novel for adult / young adult female readers. but beware, don't read it during or before mensturation period; its too sad to handle in those times...
B001IAOEXU|3.0|Check it out, it's Frankie from ClosetX reviewing this product for you. If you play CoD or any other game with these be careful not to tap or play with the triggers. I use the throwing knife in CoD MW2 and I always end up throwing my knife at the wrong time because of it's sensitivity. It's also quite uncomfortable. I think the original triggers for the Ps3 are far better then these.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Had my doubts about this remake. Sean Connery is my all time favorite Bond! But I will wholeheartedly admit that Daniel Craig does a great job as the new Bond...James Bond!! Even my husband liked this one and he's not really a Bond fan at all. The film kept my attention and I appreciated the romantic aspect as well!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Well, i think people who buys Thriller, knows is a master piece.. there is no need to see reviews.  I have bought this, and i loved it... DVD contains the best videos (BEAT IT, BILLIE JEAN AND THRILLER) and the mototown special where MJ showed for first time the moonwalk.    What else can you ask?
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Yes this is the answer I was looking for. I bought an iSight FIrewire 400 for my brand new Mac Mini (Firewire 800) in March 2010 and read horror stories of people having to buy $200 externally powered hard drive enclosures as an answer to get their iSIght working. Uhm no. Just buy this adapter and dont worry it will work. I read a prior review of someone saying the same thing and I agree. It works for me also.
B001MYIXAW|2.0|Does anyone know if they corrected the subtitles yet?  I'd love to buy this but won't until they get it right.  I would rate the theatrical version of the film 5 Stars but until they fix the subtitles, I can only give the home video version 2 Stars.  The book, however, is also 5 Stars and surpasses the movie.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I was reading some bad reviews about this movie, and I was a bit amazed.    The CGI to me it was pretty good, at least I liked it better than the Terminator 3 CGI...    Some people said it had many plotholes but I really didn't see them, we didn't know much about the story about Kyle and John becoming a leader, etc...    Some of the reviews I read were also complaining for things they either didn't understand or didn't pay enought attention, or simply didn't know some things and just criticized for the sake of it.    One HUGE mistake that I notice constantly that people make, is when they go to see a movie with a preovious expectation...    If you go to see a movie thinking it's going to be awesome (or at least thinking it might be similar to \\"something\\") you're probably gonna exit the theater dissapointed... As how it happens if you don't know what to expect of a movie and you end up liking it (sometimes you go see a movie thinking it will suck and when you finish it, you keep thinking the same, but that's just the mistake of going to see that movie with a fixed expectation of failure)    Overall I liked the movie, the acting wasn't anything amazing, but it was enough for this movie, and the story of Marcus I found it to be interesting and well adapted into the idea of the movie.    Finally, I think that people who went to see this movie and didn't like it is because they were expecting another terminator, like the previous ones, or simply was expecting to be dissapointed and got what they hoped for, but still it's a good story, maybe not a huge story, but an important part of the mythology IMO, it added new things to our knowledge, it confirmed others and just played with information we already knew just for the viwer's pleasure...
B00028HBKC|5.0|This DVD Video is exactly what I was looking for, thank you.   Ernie
B000VFGQUC|2.0|My dad is a Huge Thin Lizzy fan, so I figured this would be a perfect gift. When we first started the dvd there was no sound we had to go into the extras and sound settings. once we figured out how to adjust the sound the quality was not that great, and we have a rockin sorround sound system? We figured it was because of the recording of the dvd? All and all it was fun to watch but it would have been so much better if there would have been a better recording.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This movie is so much better than the one with G. Paltrow.  We watched both discs on a marathon movie night and loved it.  You could watch this movie without the sound on - just the expressions on Emma's face while she talks tells the story.  I just read Pride and Prejudice - I can't wait to read Emma now.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|the game came quickly and in great shape.  It is a lot of fun, but a little hard to figure out at first if you have not ever played the game before.
1401203078|4.0|This is a significant shift away from the two earlier LEG books, as one might expect (based on the ending of the second). Here, Moore testing the boundaries of his own genre and playing games with the comic book medium. My favorite portion was the 'Forrest-Gump'-esque character who travels through the annals of empire and history--Orlando. Overall, less action and more careful, conceptual thought than the earlier LEGs.
B001N26GFM|5.0|There were so many things taught in this movie. The total innocence of one child and the age and wisdom of another child of the same age. Knowing the history of the period. Sometimes we forget we can still learn something NEW. From a perspective it breaks our heart to think of THE CHILDREN.
B002WY65W4|3.0|This wasn't an excellent movie, but if your bored it's entertaining. I wouldn't give it an award or anything, but for entertainment value it was okay. I would have bought the DVD rather than the Blu-ray though. It would have been cheaper.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|I remember when this album came out, and how everyone I knew was blown away. The poet/folkie/rocker/genius of his generation outdid himself. Every song a miniature masterpiece. Now with the release of the SACD, I can enjoy this album even more. The warmth of the acoustic guitars is warmer. The acid vocals of \\"Idiot Wind\\" could melt your face. The saddle bum delivery of \\"Lilly, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" makes me want to get on a horse, ride into town and get me a whiskey. Do yourself a favor, but this SACD - NOW! I don't know how they did, but they improved on perfection.  Yee-haa!
B002VECM6S|5.0|THIS IS NOT JUST A CHICK FLICK! (ALTHOUGH PISTOL PACKING SANDRA IS GREAT IN THIS MOVIE)  I CANNOT WAIT TO BUY THIS MOVIE!  WELL WORTH THE $$$ YOU WILL SPEND ON IT.  THE STORY HAS A WONDERFUL THEME TO IT.  IT IS A MOVIE THAT YOU GET UP FROM WATCHING AND KNOW YOU WILL BUY IT!!!!!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|The cd is awesome!  The popular tracks are great, and even their other songs are mellow and relaxing.
0399534601|5.0|I first picked up a copy of this book while waiting for my son in the mall. Within 10 minutes of opening this inspiring work by Keri Smith, I purchased 9 more copies and distributed them to friends and family, I then purchased more for a few teachers at my son's school. I visited the author's website (even more fantastic ideas to add to the journey), wrote to her, and I was delighted to hear back from her. So far, I have loved every minute of the journey. The author has a gift for getting you \\"unstuck\\" creatively, and inspiring you to look at the world in a new way. I definitely plan to purchase more copies to keep on hand. Bravo Keri Smith, Bravo!!!
B000002VQQ|4.0|For a long time I had little understanding of who Patti Smith was: she was seen as one of the leaders of the \\"punk revolution\\", of which I had come to think the inherent violence and repetitiveness of much of the music had overshadowed a number of genuinenely valuable musical innovations by such artists as [[ASIN:B0000AI45P Television]], [[ASIN:B000A2PLHA the Slits]] and [[ASIN:B000S6EYNU ESG]].<br /><br />Yet, on the other hand, Patti was seen as a close relative of such artists as Laura Nyro and Kate Bush of whom I was a big fan, and the complexity, femininity and focus on natural ability rather than attitude or virtuosity of these artists was something I never saw in the stripped-down, hypermasculine, aggressive attitude of punk. Yet, despite her association with Tom Verlaine (whose [[ASIN:0674194462 adopted name]] Patti really has more claim to than Tom himself!), Patti Smith's albums as I had heard them never had the distinctive, free-flowing, late-night feel that made \\"Marquee Moon\\" so fine a record.<br /><br />It was only recently, as a result of being impressed by the proto-post-rock dynamics of [[ASIN:B000002VQO \\"Ain't It Strange\\"]] that I felt I had a genuine need to at least understand what the decades-long hype about Patti Smith really was. Her debut album, \\"Horses\\", has always been her most acclaimed as the first album to really show women could rock like men. It is true that \\"Horses\\" defied stereotypes of women in music and sensitive balladeers or singer/songwriters in the public mind, but in fact \\"Horses\\" itself was not in any way a conventional rock album. Indeed, the best moments of \\"Horses\\", especially \\"Birdland\\" and \\"Free Money\\", very much have the quality of a 1950s torch balladeer. The difference that makes \\"Horses\\" truly a worthwhile album is the way in which Patti is very effective at twisting these soundscapes into dark and beautiful epic songs. \\"Birdland\\" is particularly good in this respect: its quiet piano is interlaced with fierce guitar parts in the later stages, all the while maintaining a dark, late-night quality that fits the mood ideally. \\"Free Money\\" might be a classic of childishly simple decadent imagination, but its power is undeniable especailly during the chorus, whilst \\"Kimberley\\" is eerie and slow in a sensual manner that makes Smith's claim as a predecessor for Kate Bush's 1980s masterpieces sound true. The danceable groove makes \\"Kimberley\\" the most accessible song on \\"Horses\\", but it has a wonderful beauty. \\"Break It Up\\", which features Tom Verlaine on guitar and backing vocals, is the most straightforward rocker on \\"Horses\\" and at times drags a little, but there is still quite a bit of heartfelt power. \\"Elegie\\", the closer, is a shorter version of \\"Birdland\\" that shows clearly why the former song needed its full length to be so effective because the guitar does not fire so fully even though the piano is equally beautiful.<br /><br />On the other hand, \\"Redondo Beach\\", whose lyrics are as cryptic as \\"Birdland\\" lacks the fire that made \\"Free Money\\" and \\"Kimberley\\" outstanding songs of great notice. More than that, the trebly quality of John Cale's production seems not to give the song any more tunefulness and to seemingly eliminate the low end to anchor this song. Then there is the cover of \\"My Generation\\" by the Who (whom I regard as overrated because I view them as a bad influence on much awful power pop) that falls into the trap of that genre completely. Also, I do not have much regard for the epics \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Land\\", feeling that the way Smith tries to blend songs together is too stop-start to be effective at all.<br /><br />Still, I must say \\"Horses\\" is a worthy listen, if not quite as good as commonly thought, and for me (contrary to popular opinion) Cale's trebly production does not suit Smith's style so well as does Jack Douglas on what was to be her best album, 1976's \\"Radio Ethiopia\\".er stages, all the while maintaining a dark, late-night quality that fits the mood ideally. \\"Free Money\\" might be a classic of childishly simple decadent imagination, but its power is undeniable especailly during the chorus, whilst \\"Kimberley\\" is eerie and slow in a sensual manner that makes Smith's claim as a predecessor for Kate Bush's 1980s masterpieces sound true.

1423119509|5.0|I purchased the Percy Jackson five book set based upon a recommendation from a friend. I'm a very huge Harry Potter fan and was looking for something else fun to read.  While I'm an adult, I still find great enjoyment from stories such as these.  Everyone needs good clean fun in their life.  I had no expectations when I started but I was still very surprised how much I came to love the Percy series. The first book in the series was a quick read but it was very fun and entertaining. The author does a lovely job of setting up an over arching plot line that covers all five books, while giving each individual book a definite substantial plot in and of itself.  Each successive book really added a layer of depth to the characters, with many new characters revolving through each book.  All five books were a delight to read and I was only sad when I came to the end.<br /><br />I wouldn't compare these books directly to something like Harry Potter, as they are a different type of book in my opinion, however they have the same basic premise of larger story lines, younger people being the heroes, a sense of innocence at war with the real world.  There is much more action adventure in these books that may appeal to many, and you may not consider this series as dark as some consider the later Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I've come to really adore this series and recommend the books to anyone looking for something fun to read.  This was a great series.<br /><br />The packaging for the five hardcover boxed set was perfect. My set had no issues at all. It was shipped from the Deleware wharehouse and came as perfect as can be.  I was very pleased all around.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone.

The alchemist believes if you don't listen to your heart, for whatever reason, then you will live your life with constant fear of the unknown and unable to live a fulfilling life.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have had a half-dozen Garmin products and would have considered myself a loyalist -- until I switched from Windows to the Mac 3 years ago.  Garmin treats Mac users as an afterthought, providing inferior software and updating it infrequently.  When you try to get customer support, they have no idea about their Mac-based software, and usually give you the canned answers for the Windows software.  When reporting major flaws in their too-few Mac updates, I have had to point out to customer service repeatedly that I am talking about the Mac software and have to tell them what is the latest version of the applicable software.  Currently, the Mac software for the 405CX takes over all of the memory on my Mac and stops my wireless mouse and keyboard from working.  I have little hope that what appears to be a serious flaw in their latest software update (Ant Agent 2.15) will be fixed anytime soon, as they don't seem to be able to understand what I'm talking about.
B0035G9ABG|3.0|I ventured on board the Gorillaz hype machine during Demon Days, their 2nd album and possibly their best to date. At the time I picked up the Deluxe version of Demon Days and loved the incredible quality of the package. With a great plastic slip, unique artwork and an entire mini-art book and DVD / CD it was truly an exceptional value as well as collector's piece.    When I saw the artwork for the Gorillaz latest album, 'Plastic Beach' I immediately thought of how great the last Deluxe edition had been and put in my pre-order. Upon it's arrival, the first thing that immediately struck me is how cheap it looked. Rather than any sort of slip case or plastic, everything in this \\"Deluxe\\" edition is cardboard. It looks terrible in comparison to the Demon Days deluxe package and basically it's a fold out cardboard piece with 2 sleeves that hold 2 smaller cardboard sleeves for the CD & DVD 'Making Of.' The saving grace for the packaging is the artwork, with vivid colors and images it almost provides the necessary incentive to pay about twice as much for this edition compared to the standard release.     With that said, I can't whole heartedly recommend this as a purchase. While the packaging is poorly made, the biggest disappointment by far is the included DVD. Prior to the release of Plastic Beach, I was lucky enough to see the music video for Stylo on youtube. It was great, with CGI Gorillaz members and even Bruce Willis. On the Demon Days deluxe edition, there was a nice variety of content included on the bonus DVD including the album's leading song in music video format.     On the Plastic Beach Deluxe edition, they have made a dire error that I feel should stop anyone who was a fan of the DVD in Demon Day's Deluxe from picking this edition up. As is becoming more of the norm these days, the producers of this package opted to include special downloadable and streaming content via the Gorillaz website rather than including said games, videos and more on the bonus DVD. In my opinion, this is incredibly disappointing and takes away from the actual physical package. The Demon Days DVD was solid and really made the purchase worthwhile ... the Plastic Beach is only a 45 minute \\"making of feature\\" that offers very little of the Gorillaz artwork or any mention of the Stylo video ... that's it, there is nothing else on the disc. I'm sure the bonus online content is quite good but down the road in 5 to 10 years, I'll still be able to pop in the Demon Days DVD and get everything in one convenient place, sadly the same cannot be said for this \\"Deluxe\\" edition.    For those on the fence about this edition, I say go with the standard and save your money ... only diehard Gorillaz fans will find the extras worthwhile and while the artwork on the packaging is incredible, the medium on which it is presented is cheap and disappointing.     2 1/2 stars out of 5 for the Deluxe edition(rounded up for Amazon.com)

0553274503|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is an interesting science fiction novel that deals with the ethical issues of experimentation on humans and the treatment of the mentally handicapped. Charlie Gordon is chosen to have a surgery to increase his intelligence. Written in Charlie's perspective the novel changes as his intelligence changes. It is a very interesting read that addresses the many aspects of human nature and the desire for knowledge and friendship. I definitely recommend it.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This movie is simply brilliant. I am blown away by QTs movies but this is by far his best. QT is the master at creating tension in scenes to the point you think everything is about to burst. And it does. With great satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds is a remake but really it's a QT movie. And QT brings an instant classic to film. Based in WW2 before the US invasion. Jewish american's gurilla force is used to scare the germans. There is amazing blood and gore in this film. And the acting, dialog and action are fantastic. There is not one dull moment in this movie and you will be on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. And when it's over you will stand up and litearly applaud. I did and I was alone in my living room. Bravo QT. Bravo.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|I expected the most out of this film because it starred Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio and even though it is a good film, I found it to not live up to my expectations. The acting is very good and the plot is fairly easy to follow, but I found myself wanting a little more out of this story. I rate it 3 1/2 stars for it's good use of locations, good acting and an interesting story about what goes on outside our little comfort zone we live in. It's a good film, just not the best I've seen on the subject. I suggest you rent this before you buy it as I don't think I would watch this more than twice in a life time.

B001OQCV2O|2.0|I liked it... Great special effects and good Disaster movie. I would have bought it, but really? just French and English Subtitles? What about Spanish Subtitles? Spanish is the second most common language in the US, it holds the world's fifth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia.<br />I like subtitles because it helps me (not always) read in other languages (especially Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese) while watching and listening movies. And I bet some potential buyers would still need those subtitles to watch the movie.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I tend to look for movies that draw me in and that provoke an emotional response. Martin Scorcese's \\"Shutter Island\\" did indeed draw me in, even though I found the film disturbing. Scorcese explores difficult questions of guilt, personal identity, and mind control.<br /><br />The movie takes place in 1954 on a craggy, remote and forbidding island off the coast of Boston. (I have some familiarity with a United States possession called Navassa, an uninhabited, little-known island in the Carribean surrounded by steep, inaccessible cliffs and was reminded of Navassa by the movie.) Shutter Island serves as a hospital and prison for the criminally insane operated by the United States government. A United States Marshall, Teddy Daniels, and his ostensible partner, Chuck Aule, who calls Daniels \\"boss\\", are ferried to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate who has apparently escaped.  The inmate is said to have drowned her three children before her incarceration. Daniels himself carries with him many emotional issues.  He witnessed the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and has had problems with alcohol. His wife died in a fire set by an arsonist. Daniels sought an assignment to Shutter Island because the arsonist and another individual from Daniels' past are incarcerated there, and Daniels wanted to see for himself what was going on.<br /><br />At the hospital, Daniels meets the head psychiatrist, a bearded, crafty and intelligent individual named Cawley, and his sinister German assistant, Nehring. He meets with staff, with prisoners, both male and female, and with inmates of the \\"C\\" ward, used to house the most dangerous prisoners. As the movie progresses, Daniels suffers increasingly from tremors and from hallucinations, most of which are in the form of his dead wife warning him about the island.  Daniels also receives warnings and augurs from the patients. He senses that something is not right about the investigation but cannot let it go.<br /><br />The movie has the makings of a gothic horror film, but it gets beyond that genre by its seriousness and development.  The movie builds slowly and inexorably to itconclusion and most parts of the story contribute to the effectiveness of the whole.  The feeling of isolation and doom is inescapable, with a mental hospital on a remote island, a hurricane which cuts the Shutter Island off even further from the mainland, and the chilling, hidden natures of staff and inmates on the island.<br />The movie includes scenes of cliffs and danger on the island, pounding waves, wild rats, a mysterious lighthouse, and lost souls. A difficult and troubled individual, Daniels comes to challenge his understanding of himself in a radical way.  I found the confusion in sense of selfhood, in circumstances of isolation and helplessness, chilling.<br /><br />The movie is based upon a 2003 novel by Dennis Lahane called \\"Shutter Island\\" which I have not read. The acting is convincing throughout and the musical background is erie. The movie has received mixed reviews.  Scorsese's movies such as \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Gangs of New York\\" with their portrayal of violence, illusion, and rawness have always fascinated me. \\"Shutter Island\\" did so as well. The movie has attained a large success at the box office, and perhaps can be viewed and responded to on many levels.

Based on real life, the Tuohys of Tennessee find and nurture a homeless young black youth, Micahel Oher. They eventually adopt him and consider him a full-fledged member of their Christian family. They're also responsible for his becoming a multi-million dollar football star at Ole Miss.<br /><br />That's the heart of this story that will have you laughing one minute, and trying to choke back your tears the next.<br /><br />As the pistol packing, brassy Mother Lion, Leanne Tuohy, Sandra Bullock absolutely electrifies, giving the performance of a lifetime. Her Academy Award performance puts her firmly in the pantheon of movie greats. Like her legendary predecessors, Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh, Bullock has the magical spark that connects directly with the viewer and when she confronts a gang of thugs who threaten her newly adopted black son, Michael Oher, the hair on the back of your head tingles when Bullock gets right in their faces and spits\\": \\"You threaten my son, you threaten me!\\"  Looking fabulous with her new blonde do, wearing knock-out fashions and exuding electrifying charisma, Bullock brings us an unforgetabble heroine to love forever.<br /><br />Most of us can barely remember those actresses who've recently snared the Best Actress honor (quick, who was that French actress who won last year for \\"La Vie En Rose\\")  Sandra Bullock, however gives us a fiery, fabulous heroine that we'll be discussing and thinking about for years to come.<br /><br />This is hardly to say that Bullock is the only one who did great.  Hancock's entire cast--from the extras in the background, the school faculty, the athletes, the young performers in Michael's welfare housing projects--were all extraorinary.<br /><br />The Tuohy family became like people you'd love to have as neighbors: Tim McGraw is the handsome, genial head of the Touhy family and owns a chain of Taco Bell restaurants that make him a multi-millionaire. His two children played briilliantly by Lily Collins and the scene-stealing, impish Jae Head, enhanced this story-book family.<br /><br />The Blind Side should have won the Oscar for Best Picture but many of the big city movie critics hated it.  New York Magazine was especally notorious for its steady stream of sarcastic observations about Sandra Bullock and the movie itself.

B001LV5OOY|4.0|I recently bought this CD and was surprised to find that it won't play on any of my home's computers. The disc itself looks completely black and the disc drives won't read it. This prevents me from ripping the files to put on a Zune or iPod and doesn't allow me to burn a copy for my car.   The music is really enjoyable and is a bit of an '80s throwback, though I recommend downloading the MP3s through Amazon or iTunes if you want to have a portable means of listening to it.  UPDATE: It works on other computers that I've tried, just not my laptop.
B002NUULNG|5.0|When I saw that there was an updated version of the classic anime movie Ghost In The Shell, I knew that I had to have it.  I purchased the original version several years ago, and have been a fan of the series since it arrived here in the U.S.<br /><br />When the new Blu-ray arrived, I instantly put it into the player, and found that not a lot has been changed from the original, just certain scenes that lend themselves to the new technology.  The opening sequence is changed a bit, with much more detail of the Major.  Other scenes of note are helicopter scenes that benefit greatly from the addition of the high def graphics.<br /><br />The DVD has lots of extras on it, including the original version of the movie.  This looks better when played through my Blu-ray player than the original played through my standard DVD player.  All in all, even if you don't care for the updated version, you can still watch the original through this DVD, and you will get the extra features on the disc.<br /><br />This is the one movie that I can greatly recommend purchasing, even if you have the original DVD.
0061922315|5.0|\\"Mother India does not love all her children equally, it seems\\". Secret Daughter highlights the practice of preferring boys over girls, leading to infanticide or abandonment of baby girls.  The story immediately drew me in with an intense, visceral depiction of Usha's birth by her biological mother.  The story focuses on three memorable characters:  (1) Kavita, the biological mother, from a destitute, rural Indian village.  Her story is heartbreaking, and she suffers so much that it's sometimes unbearable to read, but she is incredibly strong, a resilient survivor. (2) Somer, the American adoptee mother, from Menlo Park, CA, a working mother and pediatrician who suffers in her own way through infertility and estrangement from her own family.  Finally (3) Asha, born as Usha, the daughter who is \\"saved\\" from an orphan's life of poverty and adopted by Somer and her Indian husband.  I found that while Somer was by far the easiest to relate to, she was often the hardest to be sympathetic towards.  Even the minor characters are fascinating.  I particularly enjoyed Sarla, Asha's Indian grandmother, who is a strong matriach figure and has significant influence on Asha.    The story explores many complex themes - identity, cross-cultural adoption, what makes a family, what does it mean to be a mother, a daughter, poverty and the growing split between rich and poor, working mother identity - and yet it is not heavy or off-putting.  India itself is another important character, the beauty and contradictions, the extremes of dire poverty and open-arms welcoming society.  Although I've never been to India, Somaya Gowda describes its sights, smells, sounds, and life there in such a way that I felt as if I had walked the streets, ate the food, and gone to weddings there.    The story is beautifully written.  I often found myself pausing to savor the choice of words, the phrasing, the wisdom in the words.  I don't often get so engrossed in a book that I couldn't put it down, but I finished Secret Daughter in two nights and had to force myself to put the book down to get some sleep.  The ending is not a Hollywood ending, and is very satisfying.  I highly recommend this book - read it before it is made into a movie!  I look forward to discussing this with my book club.
B000NVL9KG|4.0|As mentioned in several other reviews, there is marked distortion in the right channel during Tarkus (side 1 on the original vinyl).    Contrary to statements in these reviews, it is not from Shout Factory's mastering.  I listened closely to the original (late 1980's) CD mastering from Atlantic records and the distortion is there, too, albeit far less noticeable.  So, either the distortion is more noticeable due to a clearer mastering by Shout Factory or the master tape is deteriorating.   Either way, you can't blame Shout Factory.    Other than the distortion, this mastering sounds great, a definite improvement on the Atlantic CD mastering.  As for the music, it is just as incredible now as it was when it was first released.  This is one of ELP's best albums.
B00275EGWY|5.0|The Hurt Locker quite simply is one of the finest cinematic achievements in recent years. It recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director, along with four others, and deservingly so. It's made with a precision and craft that is unique and outstanding, and it's also very intense and entertaining.     The three main leads played by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty are all convincing as members of a bomb disposal team at the height of violence in the Iraq war. They move from mission to mission in dangerous situations where their individual personalities and the way they deal with the trauma of war come out. Renner is particularly impressive as a bomb defusing expert who has a certain recklessness and even addiction to what he does.     The directorial achievement by Kathryn Bigelow and the script by Mark Boal are no less impressive. There has been controversy over the realism in aspects of this movie, but to me it seemed completely believable. The suspenseful action scenes are done with complete clarity giving an amazing scope which heightens the dramatic effect. The stuff in between these sequences though are just as important, giving effective character development, like when Renner's character befriends an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs.     The film is must see. I've seen it twice and will definitely watch it many more times.  It works great as a drama, as a thriller, and as an action movie. Some have asked what the movie is really about. Well in a nutshell it's about the brutal reality of modern day war, and the truth that war can be a drug. It's not political and doesn't try to force some phony higher message. It's three men doing their job, and it's brilliant.
B000YD7S2Q|3.0|Lohengrin was an early Wagner opera based on early medieval sources. Pagan gods and black magic are pitted against the New Testament God and Christian magic, and the latter win out, thanks mainly to the fighting prowess of a mysterious swan knight, but not before a witch named Ortrud goads Elsa, the knight's innocent bride, into asking him who he is. That is all it takes for the knight to renounce his bride and the Brabantians (whose protector he has agreed to be), to reveal his origins, and to take the first swan boat back to Christendom.<br /><br />It is a slow-moving piece of music theater. I suspect the opera might have dragged even in 1850, when it premiered. I had hoped that the Bayreuth staging here by Werner Herzog, the film director of Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre: The Wrath of God, would provide some needed heft and action for non-German viewers. Alas, no. Perhaps Herzog was constrained by the requirements of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus or the wishes of the producer, Wagner's grandson and the keeper of the family flame, but in any event the actors in this production pose and change their positions very very slowly and the chorus rises and shines and moves about like the climax of a Bruckner symphony sounds. It is all very traditional.<br /><br />The videography does not help. There are numerous long shots, held forever, of the moon over waves, some painted and some manufactured by a wave machine, rocks, and a semi-finished medieval castle. There is not a single shot of the famous theater, the supposedly live audience, the orchestra, the conductor, or even a rising curtain. On the other hand, the music, though it appears dubbed, is performed well enough. Lohengrin is sung by lyric heldentenor Paul Frey, who had a short career at the top but looks the part. Cheryl Studer sings very well as Elsa. The other principals do their jobs. Costumes and sets are unexceptional.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Note: I did not purchase this edition, but rather this one with the plush Ponyo toy [[ASIN:B0031S4K5E Ponyo: (Two-Disc Special Edition + Plush Toy)]]<br /><br />We Saw the Ponyo movie last year during its limited cinema release. With my wife and I, who are in our mid-late 40's, we took our 2 sons who are in their mid 20's & neighbors who are refugees from Burma. Among them were 5 20+ yr olds, a 8yr old, 5yr old, and a baby who was 1yr old & all of us enjoyed this movie, so I am a bit perplexed by those who have claimed it is not suitable for young children.<br /><br />It is visually stimulating, the story is sweet, imaginative and it has a happy ending.<br /><br />After we finished watching it my wife promised the 8yr old girl that we would get her the DVD when it was released...she asked us over and over since then if it was available and is absolutly delighted now to have a copy of her own.<br /><br />Buy it, enjoy it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|When I started doing the 30 day shred I was not very active and not in great shape at all.  The first level 1 workout I did on this DVD killed me.  I couldn't barely walk for 2 days.  But I kept with it and I got to level 2 in just a couple of weeks.  It only took me about 3 weeks to start seeing differences and now I feel like I'm in the best shape I've ever been in.  The workout is 20 minutes composed of three 6 minute circuits the focus on strength training, cardio, and abs.  You will feel like you want to die about half way in but its only 20 minutes so you can make it all the way through.  Jillian is a great motivator, she really keeps you engaged in the workout and she reminds you why we are doing this.  The backup girls are great, especially Natalie.  They have a lot of personality and they sweat and struggle right with you.  I've been doing this DVD for 10 weeks now and I've just recently graduated to some more intense Jillian Michaels DVDs.  But I definitely still plan on using this one when I don't have time to do a full hour workout.  This DVD made me realize that I can be fit and I can be toned.  Its helped my self-esteem immensely and its helped me change my way of life.  I know how cheesey that sounds, but its the truth.  So if your not in great shape, just remember that after about a week this is going to get much easier and in just a few weeks you will start looking fit!
B0035J6TAI|3.0|\\"Scratch My Back\\" will doubtlessly go down as one of Peter Gabriel's most contentious albums. Known for thundering drums and uvula exposing vocal explosions, Gabriel evaded all expectations and instead released a mellow, all orchestral album. Reviews seem very mixed and even long time fans are divided on what to think about this puzzling release.<br /><br />First off, Gabriel has never recorded a cover album. Sometimes these serve as stop gap distractions while performers prepare new batches of original material (naysayers would probably like to think that such is the case here). Many such albums become throwaways. Instead, Gabriel claims that this motley collection of somewhat contemporary tunes represents his most personal endeavor to date. A deeply personal cover album? Gabriel's oeuvre, burgeoning with passionate political and social statements from his own pen, would seem a more likely fountain of personal expression than orchestral covers. In any case, there it is.<br /><br />Credit definitely goes to Gabriel for trying on new pants, so to say. \\"Scratch My Back\\" is completely unlike anything else the man has ever released. Taking his work as a whole, \\"So\\" arguably feels closer to \\"Foxtrot\\" than to this album. Here the Gabriel \\"wall of sound\\" has disappeared. Innovative cracking rhythms give way to flourishing strings. Vocals float in front of often sparse orchestral and piano arrangements. \\"Here Comes The Flood\\" and \\"Wallflower\\" approach such sparseness, but everything on \\"Scratch My Back\\" outdoes even these quiet ballads in this sense. Sparse, in fact, serves as an apt one word description of this album.<br /><br />Then there's the song selection. Gabriel definitely mined some of the best: Talking Heads, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, Radiohead, Randy Newman, David Bowie, etc. None of his interpretations outdo the originals. No one would replace Gabriel's version of \\"Listening Wind\\" on their copy of \\"Remain in Light,\\" for example. But that doesn't really say much. The original versions of these selections are so entrenched in our collective psyches that any cover faces an obstinate wall of inertia and presupposition. But that doesn't mean these are good covers, either.<br /><br />Some of the interpretations definitely work better than others. \\"Heroes\\" will definitely repulse some on a first listen. It will subsequently grow on some and off others. \\"Flume\\" soars with everything Gabriel has to offer. \\"The Power of the Heart\\" provides a decent alternate take to Lou Reed's love sonnet to his now wife, Laurie Anderson. \\"My Body is a Cage\\" drags along like carcasses on a Bruce Nauman carousel, as does \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out).\\" The rest of the album remains a little up in the air. Nonetheless, it delivers some genuine moving moments as well as some awkward moments. The bridge in \\"Philadelphia\\" contains some inchoate dissonant wailing. It's unpleasant. \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" falls a little flat, sounding less rich than Newman's 1968 arrangement. Also, Gabriel's voice seems a little unsteady and overly self-conscious at times. \\"Scratch My Back\\" is far from his best vocal performance. On the plus side, \\"The Book of Love,\\" a simple ditty, provides a memorable track, though some may wince at the borderline corny lyrics.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Scratch My Back\\" plays better in segments than as a whole. The full ride can get a little tiresome given some of the repetitive arrangements (silent and slow, rise to a crescendo, then silence to fade out). Nonetheless, the album does contain some memorable moments, but far fewer than most Gabriel albums offer.\\"Scratch My Back\\" is not for everyone, not even for all Gabriel fans. It's way off of the radar from his other work, is often slow and brooding, and provides challenging interpretations of some very familiar songs. But many will appreciate the starkness and find themselves spinning this one in certain moods. Maybe time will reveal whether or not this album turns out as Gabriel's only dud or as an unappreciated masterpiece. In the present tense, it has some fans scratching their heads.e.

B002C6K7N0|2.0|I was totally bummed after listening to this new album from Mega-Dave and co. I gave it a chance, over and over in fact. The fact remains that this is just sub-par output from a super-talented band.    I've been a fan of Megadeth since the early eighties when my bud down the street introduced me to them. Over the years they've had had their highs and lows, this is definitely a low-point.    The riffs are there, the soloing is scorching and show off Dave's and Chris' talent. The songs are fast--mostly, except for the seemingly obligatory ballad. But there's just something missing, oh yeah... good lryics and singing.    I don't know about Dave anymore, he seems utterly consumed with getting his point of view across to the point that he forgets he's supposed to be making thrash metal, not a monologue on religion and politics with heavy music in the background. This is really how this album comes across to me, him growling and talking while music plays. Whatever happened to \\"lyrics\\"?    Even the lyrics he has are obsessively \\"message-like\\" turning a potentially good song into nothing more than a sermon.    It does have some high points though, notice I did give it 2 stars.    The high points are as follows:    Track 1: Instrumental strikingly reminiscent of Into the lungs of hell, from the album, So far...so good...so what. Which a few of the songs (musically) on this album remind me of.    Track 2: This Day We Fight, Very cool old-school heavy sound, fist pumping metal, though still a generic Megadeth album opener, I'll take it.    Track 9: Headcrusher, Still generic, but cool.    Well thats really all the good stuff from this Mega-flop.    Overall it seems the \\"new\\" Megadeth sound, which is really just a re-vamp of the old, Peace sells-So Far so good-Rust in peace sound, was such a hit on The System has Failed come-back album that Dave decided to just record the same record over and over with United Abominations and the Endgame album. And each successive album suffered worse than the last.    He needs to re-focus on good, quality metal. Not just fast, heavy music with his same old message over-layed on top.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|Yet another adaptation of fantasy novel, \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" is pretty decent as mindless entertainment, but still a slight disappointment, considering the film is helmed by Chris Columbus, director of the first two installments of \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise. \\"Percy Jackson\\" is nice to look at (with Uma Thurman as campy snake-headed Medusa), but it lacks something that makes a truly thrilling adventure tale.    Gods and goddesses of Greek mythology really live. The film's story is set in today's America, where an ordinary high school boy Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), who is actually son of Poseidon, is accused of stealing the lightning bolt of Zeus (Sean Bean). Percy doesn't know anything about the theft. In fact, he didn't know anything about his lineage until he is attacked by a winged creature and is saved by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and mysterious teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan).    The setting is unique (I like Mick Jagger-ish Hades played by Steve Coogan), and the special effects are reasonable, but you may not find wisecracking Grover very funny. I haven't read the original books by Rick Riordan, but even so, I can see considerable changes have been done to the source material. The story and the character development both are weak and underwritten. So what does Percy really want to do, save the world or his mother? What is the point of stealing Zeus's lightning in the first place?     The two-hour film, of which script is unfocused at best, fails to build up the necessary tension that is essential to the storyline. The film has interesting fantasy elements - Zeus' warning on global-scale war, romance of Percy's mother, Percy's potential as a demigod - but none of them really rings true. \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" is a fairly enjoyable, but a little disappointing, adventure movie.
B000002LCB|5.0|I was so excited to finally find this soundtrack.  I love it!!  And it was a great price.  I will defintely be ordering again.
B0002WS3S2|5.0|First, this remaster is truly excellent, as is the Virgin remaster of \\"Angels' Egg\\". Do not be fooled by other label remasters - this is the one to get.    In my reviews of \\"Angels Egg\\" and \\"Flying Teapot\\" I wrote, \\"for those who have no idea what the band is about, it is a hippy/new age story with a great deal of Australian whimsey, set to a sound that is definitely psychedelic, but with true musical ability.\\"    Well, here the whimsey takes a back seat to the extraordinary musicianship. The first two (short) tracks might make you wonder - but then you have the fantastic synth drone (Tim Blake) and space whisper (Gilly Smyth) of \\"Magick Mother Invocation\\" that hypnotically draws you in and builds irresitably into the pull-along drive of \\"Master Builder\\". This is the track that really tells you what the album is about - soaring guitar by Steve Hillage, the perfectly-fitting jazz/rock stylings of Didier Malherbe, the propelling rhythm of Pierre Moerlen's drumming. The next track, \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\" builds in a not-dissimilar, but totally non-repetitive way, and is both exhilirating and soothing. \\"Side Two\\" (to use the old vinyl equivalent) opens with another whimsical (and really dispensable) short piece, but then the band stretches out beautifully with the space/rock jam \\"Isle of Everywhere\\" where Daevid Allens's glissando guitar (the greatest space instrument ever invented) and Blake's synths give way first to more exquisitite Malherbe sax, and finally truly inspired Hillage guitar. Another short interlude of odd talking lyrics (which is more than redeemed by the syncopation behind it) leads finally into \\"You Never Blow Your Trip Forever\\". Here the lyrics are prominent, but rather than silly, they actually are coherent and fit Allen's story (and lesson) perfectly, and the music which goes from gliss drone to almost metallic heavy riff, and then space synth with guitar that first plays along with Allen's vocal, then werns along in the background, once again propelled by Moerlen's drumming, is the perfect counterpoint. A bit lengthy chant closes the album, but is thorougly redeemed by Malherbe's flute accompanyment.    This is overall an incredible achievment, where psychedelia meets musicianship in a way that would never again be equalled. Not for pop-music enthusiasts, but for anyone who loves progressive music in the original, un-spoiled (and non-bombastic) sense of the word there is no album that I can give a higher recommendation to.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood is still a badass, even in old age, and Gran Torino (2008) proves it.  We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.<br /><br />His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.<br /><br />I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.<br /><br />If you want to see a very unique movie that can touch you in some ways, see this movie.  It's not overly complex.  It's very simple but very entertaining.  Highly recommended.e.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.

B001TH16DS|4.0|No real need to comment on the high-def first season.  It's swell.  However, it took me three times to get a copy of the first season that did not arrive with the bluray case shattered.  I finally settled on one that came just cracked, and not totally broken.  And the first season did not come with the pretty little slip cover, so it won't match season 2 and 3.      But if you don't let the minutiae bother you, you will without a doubt enjoy the content!
B003AYZBGQ|2.0|I'm a big fan of Micheal Lewis. Liar's Poker still rates as one of my all time faves and I thoroughly enjoyed Money Ball, Blindside and The New New Thing. This one falls a little short. More in line with Coach and Home Game. Some interesting insights but, like people who played high school sports for a demanding coach (Coach)  or raised kids (Home Game), much of it is not necessarily new news. And some of it it just fairly gross generalizations.    Lewis does humanize the story a bit more than the other best-sellers in this genre simply because he focuses on players other than the big names. If you are looking to get a better understanding into the financial meltdown and the players involved, then Too Big To Fail and On the Brink give better facts and a deeper understanding of events.     Wall Street greed, incompetence and what role it should play in our economy is another vein within The Big Short. While Lewis does a decent job of summarizing the position the street is currently in, he doesn't explore where we/they should go from here. Given that this is still one of the big unanswered questions from the meltdown, and one that is just now beginning to be debated in Washington, I would have liked to have seen more.     On the other hand, it is a quick, easy read.
0393072231|1.0|But it's not available in the format I would like. Where's the Kindle edition? I'll upgrade this review when and if I am able to read it.
0066620996|3.0|I bought this book because an organization I am involved with is using the G-to-G framework to focus its activities. Although the point of view is interesting, I think the contents of the book tend toward the superficial. They are indicative of an academic perspective lacking real world experience. The fact that a few years later some of these \\"great' companies are struggling or bankrupt further reduces any confidence in this particular paradigm.
0698116496|5.0|I was surprised by how easy it was to create my own story as I was reading it to my two year old back then. Today I read it to my almost one year old and to my surprise she laughed when the wife turned on the light to find out who was in the room with her. I never forgot my daughter's expression as she giggled out loud. This book is for all ages and it is sure to be a classic and a highly recommended book.
0553062182|5.0|Many people are prone to nervousness and embarrassment due to emotional over-reactivity. This book is one of the few that really addresses this issue and provides some valuable insights. As a psychotherapist, I have found that mindfulness also provides a valuable tool for helping shy people resolve the underlying emotional energy. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon.

I have one of these pads on my Domke F-2 bag and already knew it's a must with heavy equipment such as SLR/DSLR cameras and full size laptops.  This pad makes it much more comfortable to lug heavy stuff around.  The few dollars this costs is a minor investment in your shoulder!  Highly recommended.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|Live in Santa Monica '72 being a live album of Bowie and is a recording of his Ziggy Stardust Tour. Here we get great live renditions of Bowie classics such as \\"Changes\\", \\"Space Oddity\\" and ofcourse \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". Allmusic gave this live recording 5/5 in the reviews and I completely agree. The booklet is quite sparse with a few photos of Bowie from the time of the concert and a list of whom played what. 5/5.
B00337KM2S|4.0|For everyone who's ever spent a great deal of their working life on the road- you're going to love this movie.  I'm generally a Clooney fan anyway (what woman isn't?), but this role as a man that loves the isolated life and perks of living on the road and doesn't want to settle down, seems just made for him.<br /><br />I won't describe the story, since it's done so well throughout the other reviews. However, I will say that while I enjoyed it thoroughly, the firing parts can be a little rough to watch. I also would have liked many of the deleted scenes in the DVD \\"extras\\" (with the exception of one about a bizarre astronaut dream) to have been included in the movie to make the story and reactions of the characters come together better towards the end. In fact, there's a whole section of the story in these scenes about how Ryan manages his life after he's \\"grounded\\" in Omaha that makes these worth watching.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of other extras on the DVD. But, there is a good director/writer commentary version which is also well worth watching! Insights about how they used real recently laid off folks without scripts for the firing scenes, other improvisations and how they shot in the various locations add a lot of insight and appeal to an already good movie.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you've ever been a frequent user of a frequent flyer program, worked for a large corporatation or just plain like George Clooney - you're going to like this one, and the limited but good extras make it even better.

2839906171|5.0|This book uses a visual thinking process and layout to demonstrate what a business model is, business model patterns with real-life examples, and lots of support translating classic strategy views into the author's framework. I'd recommend this book highly to everyone that is interested in business strategy, innovation, and organizational design. The information is simple and immediately applicable. Its work both the time and the money - something I say about relatively few books.    The only complaint I have is the small font. This book was written for the younger generation. Us old guys need cheaters and still have to squint. Use a bigger font in the next version.
B003A9OVS0|5.0|A soft strings tune, coupled with pulsating, sampled brass stabs invite you enter the Plastic Beach, a superficial wonder-world created by the Gorillaz in their third studio album, Plastic Beach.    In their usual style, Gorillaz are back on the top of their game, playing the proverbial \\"rope-a-dope\\" with their catchy melodies and rhythms that have found their way onto the album, off the beaten-track.  I cannot help but expect one thing from these tunes, only to be surprised by the direction the music goes.  Despite their uncanny inability to go the easy route melodically and rhythmically, Gorillaz have created yet another album that hypnotically calls you in to listen.    Despite my better judgment, I have listened to this album three times tonight, with the clock now reading 2:47 a.m.  I have about four more songs before the album is completed and I can consider heading to bed.  This dream world of fake women, fast living, and consequence free actions is restful enough for now.    Musically, as somebody who has for some reason become entranced by each album released by the production group, I cannot help but notice how much more pop driven this album is in comparison to their previous releases.  Eighties inspired synth leads, softer hitting drums, simple rhythms repeating themselves intoxicatingly, all combined with live sound to create an image of life on the fictional island, Plastic Beach.  Walking down this shore takes no effort at all; the Gorillaz, similar to the world in which we live, have the ability to mesmerize us and lead us in the direction they please.  Despite the harmonic dissonance they frequently employ, the melodies seem surprisingly harmonic, leading you to become entranced in the music.  You will beg yourself to continue on the journey with them without asking \\"silly\\" questions.    Most impressive about this album, at least regarding the musical production, is how well the group has fused live sounds of the beach and society with synthesized sound.  Sometimes the live sounds invite you in, only to leave you to fend for your own with the harsh synthesized sounds on your own.  Other times, the two play together throughout the song; the sounds of the ocean coupled with the synthesized sounds paint for you the synthetic shores of Plastic Beach.    Digital music production has come a long way since its roots in the early 1900's.  Early digital composers would have found their world in the studio enough of a dream land; clippings of audio tape hanging from the ceiling like stalactites, entire buildings with huge machines meant to perform the most simple of tasks in today's production standards.  Those early composers seemed to be in ideological wars with each other, trying to prove that synthesized sound alone or live sound alone was the true way to view the emerging art of studio production.  The elektronische musik of the past, focusing strictly on the sonic attributes of synthesized sounds, surely has its legacy played out in this album.  Yet, the musique concrete concepts that invite us to play strictly with live, recorded sound has been added to the dream world created at Plastic Beach in ways that would make even Iannis Xenakis proud.  It is true, now, as evidenced by this album, that the creation of sonic cities can be created, entire worlds, emotions, and actions captured in sound.    Maybe it is time for the future producers, artists, and performers to learn the true power of sound.  Gone are the days where lyrics alone are the driving force to songs.  With a new emphasis on production, the future is in creating entire worlds through sound.  Entire worlds that can be brought to life through performance.  Entire worlds that can be brought to life, simply by pressing play on iTunes.  My vacation to Plastic Beach is done for now, until I decide to pack up and return for another investigation of the truly fake world, created by the Gorillaz.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Last night was Episode 1 of this miniseries.  I have been looking forward to its airing since I first heard about the project a year or two ago.  Over the years, I had read the Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge combat memoirs on which the miniseries has apparently been substantially based, and found both books very informative, sobering and enjoyable.  The other couple of books that are cited as sources I am not familiar with.    Born in 1952, I have always had a special interest in what my parents (and Ken Burns!) referred to as \\"the War.\\"  This has taken me -- and probably hundreds of thousands of baby boomer males! -- from consuming juvenile literature (e.g., Landmark Books) early in life about this or that aspect of WWII, to watching virtually all the major WWII movies and documentaries, and ultimately to reading a great deal about the war throughout my adult years.  So I have acquired solid familiary with many details about WWII ... although I do fall far short of being single-mindedly fascinated by it as a re-enactor perhaps would, plus it is not a formal part of my professional life, as it would be for a historian of WWII or a merchant selling WWII militaria.    Yet I am NOT a Stephen Ambrose-style World War II romantic as I once was -- Howard Zinn cured me of that!  I am simply drawn to the story of the world's upheavals around the middle of the last century, both in their epic scope and human scale.    So, that is my basis for commenting on this new miniseries -- or rather, the first episode.  Assuming that Ep. 1 is representative of the series in focus, style and overall quality, it's good stuff.  It will be nearly impossible to avoid comparing and constrasting The Pacific (TPac) with Band of Brothers (BofB), since both series were produced by the same team (Hanks, Spielberg et al.) and have many thematic similarities.    BofB has since become famous and was always beloved as a hymn of praise to the most admirable qualities of the U.S. American of the era --qualities which many claim they would like to see resurrected across a greater share of our current population.  It has been in a league of its own as a portrayal in depth of a small unit, and has become a symbol of the WWII citizen-soldier (\\"we all joined the military because we were attacked, and that's just what you did in those days, a guy in my neighborhood killed himself when the recruiter turned him down for health reasons,\\" etc.).  Perhaps TPac will do as much for the WWII citizen-Marine.      One of the features of Ep. 1 that I liked was a speech by historical figure Chesty Puller (played by Wm. Sadler, whom you'll recognize from the stuttering prisoner in Shawshank Redemption and a rogue military officer in The Rock).  Puller talks to a roomful of Marine NCOs not three months after Pearl Harbor about their special role as the backbone of the Marine Corps and that they will carry their young, less experienced men through the oceanic operational theater that Puller says the U.S. government has handed over to the Marines ... \\"Hitler and Mussolini are reserved for the Army, until they discover they can't kick their butts without our help,\\" that sort of talk.    I don't know if such a speech actually took place with Puller and the NCOs, or if the Pacific theater had yet been envisioned as the island-hopping project that Puller talks about in the speech.  What I liked was his description of the Marine NCO as a special figure in the culture of the Corps ... if that was NOT something that was set in place at the time, it does at least give the viewer something to hook into as to why and how Marines are not \\"soldiers.\\"  And that would be something of importance as a pillar for this series.    Another thematic basis for this series appears to be an examination of the feelings the Marines had for the Japanese.  The relationship between adversaries differed in Europe and the Pacific.  Collectively, the Japanese and U.S. American adveraries absolutely hated each otherfrom bases in race and ethnicity ... a few books in recent years have explored this.  I was impressed that some shoots of this theme appeared in Ep. 1.  That kind of hatred is not something that many U.S. American citizens and institutions of today will be comfortable looking at ... think of how the Ben Affleck movie Pearl Harbor paid virtually no attention to it.      In Ep. 1, though, the Japanese are called all sorts of ugly names ... but that's what I understand to have been so ... and U.S. Americans produced in the Japanese an equivalent level and type of disgust and hatred.  In one scene -- in its way as grueling as the scene in Saving Private Ryan in which the German soldier knifes the U.S. Army private in a hand-to-hand fight in a building -- a Japanese survivor of an intense skirmish pops out of the trees near a stream.  One or two scenes earlier, a wounded Japanese is assisted by a couple of Marines ... and all three or four of them die as the Japanese explodes a grenade he has hidden under his injured body.      The Japanese by the stream, then, is shot by U.S. Marines on the opposite bank but strides into the water, weaponless, howling insults (I presume) at the Marines.  They continue shooting at him, at first hitting him without killing him.  On the soundtrack, you can hear the Marines' hoots and catcalls -- and bitter laughter.  They are playing with this man who is culturally unfathomable to them, entertaining themselves as they do their best to excruciate him.      In duration and editing, the sequence was perfect, in that when the \\"entertainment\\" ended because one Marine shot the Japanese with a coup de grace, I as the viewer had been put in the shoes of the Marine characters in the sequence.  It felt delightfully transgressive at first -- the usual rules have been lifted! -- when deploying the power of personal weapons with impunity.  It felt progressively uncomfortable at having done so, however, even though men in the same uniform as the Japanese in the stream had done awful things to other men in U.S. Marine herringbone twill ... the \\"good guys.\\"    I liked the fact that the casting placed young-looking men in the various roles. This is now standard operating procedure -- except for departures like middle-aged Tom Hanks playing a Ranger captain, who would have actually been in his middle or late twenties at the most, in Saving Private Ryan.  Speaking of which, the scene of approaching the invasion beaches of Guadalcanal was basically an homage to the equivalent scenes in Ryan ... except there was no shooting from the beaches (the Japanese had not fortified the shore and had instead set up defenses inland). We see the vomiting and the kissing of crosses and so on.  You either like that kind of thing or you don't, I guess.  It's atmospheric, certainly.    Bad news about the series? ... that is, the episode?  Not too much comes to mind.  It looks like we are going to have more contact between the Marine characters and the home front than we saw between paratroopers and the folks at home in BofB.  Unless that \\"meanwhile, back 'Stateside\\" material is compelling, I can live without it.  I missed having boot camp sequences for the Robert Leckie character ... perhaps later in the series, when the Eugene Sledge character finally gets into uniform (he has a heart murmur in this one, and weeps because it will prevent him from enlisting in the Marines), we'll see some action with drill instructors and such.  I seem to recall that Sledge wrote good chapters about that in his book.      Also, I caught snatches of dialogue that seem contemporary, not 1940s ... for example, a once-bellicose captain flips out and cowers in a ditch and a passing Marine observes, \\"He's lost it.\\"  \\"To lose it\\" seems to me to be a recent coinage ... I think a WWII-era Marine would say, \\"He's snapping in for a survey,\\" according to William Manchester's famous WWII memoir.  I can't recall other passages, but there were at least 3-4 moments when I felt jarred by comments that didn't seem authentic to the era.  It would not seem to be difficult to ask a WWII vet how he would say such-and-such a line from the script, and revise accordingly.    I look forward to Ep. 2 and the series as a whole.  Depending on what kind of special features are part of the DVD package, I predict that unless Ep. 1 alone is good, and the rest of The Pacific is not, I will buy the miniseries DVD as a companion to the BofB boxed set that is on my shelf.
B003102JDM|1.0|this was one of the most horrid movies I have ever seen. I honestly feel like I have wasted my entire night.

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is a very talented writer and this book is further evidence of his talent. He has chosen to the tell the story of the sub-prime crisis through the eyes of the people who realized early what was going on and decided to short the market. Fair enough; very interesting perspective. I was hoping for a more comprehensive view, looking at the bankers, regulators, politicians and borrowers as well. Perhaps that is too much to ask, but that is required to create the definitive book on this sorry mess. Or I guess you can stitch together Too Big to Fail (Bankers), On the Brink (Treasury), Definitely Wasn't my Fault (politicians and borrowers), Still Not Sure What Happened, but not My Fault Either (Rating agencies) and add it to The Big Short and The Greatest Trade Ever (shorts) and make your own summary version.    Side note, IMHO giving the book low reviews because it is not available in Kindle is not helpful.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis's \\"The Big Short\\" tells a rather disturbing tale of some of the biggest profiteers of one of America's worst financial crisis, which we are likely still in the midst of.  The amazing thing cleverly illustrated by Lewis, is that while most of the brightest minds in America woke up to our shocking decline once it was too late, a small handful of speculators not only called it correctly, some became fantastically wealthy.  The question that nagged me throughout the book was how should I feel about people who just made a killing while most of us watched our retirements suffer alarming declines, and witnessed friends & family lose their jobs and houses?<br /><br />Greg Lippmann is credited with being the first to expose the weakness in the market around 2006.  He pitched the idea to hundreds of financial groups, but most seemed to invest in insurance policies to protect their exposure.<br /><br />P105:<br /><br />\\"A smaller number of people -more than 10, fewer than 20- made a straightforward bet against the entire multi-trillion dollar subprime mortgage market and, by extension, the global financial system.  The catastrophe was foreseeable, yet only a handful noticed.  Among them: Whitebox hedge fund, The Baupost Group hedge fund, Passport Capital hedge fund, Elm Ridge hedge fund, a gaggle of NY hedge funds, Elliott Associates, Cedar Hill Capital Partners, QVT Financial, and Philip Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners.  What most of these investors had in common was that they had heard, directly or indirectly, Greg Lippmann's argument.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Lewis is a fun and witty writer and his energy in The Big Short is very reminiscent of Liar's Poker, but I really found something morbid and unappealing about this subject.  Reading about Paulson's $15 billion killing in 2007 had a different feel than say Soros in the `80's & `90's, but maybe now I know how the English & Indonesians felt?  Our society is bred to believe that hard work and ingenuity are rewarded, but in this case there is a tangible human tragedy as a consequence of speculators earning a massive imbalance of wealth in relation to the rest of the population.<br /><br />All of the speculators Mr. Lewis uses as examples technically did the right thing and chose wisely.  Some were more sophisticated than others, but they all have one thing in common: they all made an obscene amount of money betting America would be brought down to its knees.  I am also even more disgusted now with the rating agencies that were super-slick in stamping AAA ratings on what was absolute garbage in hindsight.<br /><br />I found the book both fascinating and disturbing.  I think it is now clear to me that financial speculation that doesn't promote sustainable growth needs to be addressed and properly dealt with, and that adequate steps have not been taken.  Lewis definitely added a new layer to my awareness of the credit crisis, and covered some fresh ground beyond typical news.  I recommend the book if you want to gain a deeper understanding of the sucker punch that just hit most of us.a tangible human tragedy as a consequence of speculators earning a massive imbalance of wealth in relation to the rest of the population.

B001GXNBJW|5.0|This disc was truly enjoyable. The CD is packed with all great songs. I had heard some other stuff by the Black Keys but did not expect them to crete such an awesome record. I was on Amazon and they were offering this CD for three bucks so I was like, what the heck. THe Black Kes produce excellent blues music. The album contains some great electronic blues riffs on the guitar that compliment greatly the vocalist. All in all, if you are a blues fan this is a CD you should really consider hearing out.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Thanks to my x fiance, who owns this set and used to have regular Friends nights with her sister when we were together, I began to slowly develop an interest in the show. True I didn't join the ladies as often as I now wish I had, but what I did see still made me laugh. So I purchased a copy for myself with my new Best Buy card when I was at the store this last weekend searching for a cordless phone. The set of course contains all ten seasons in a largeish box. The box contains a series of small cardboard books, for lack of a better term, each page of which contains two disks, one on the front and one on the back. Of course the potential for damage to the disks is there but if you remove and insert them with reasonable care this can be minimized and/or avoided. I haven't had any problems at any rate, and as I'm totally blind and therefore had to make several attempts to find the first season this is a good thing. It took me a few minutes.    The show itself is funny and, in my opinion at least, much cleaner than what's considered commedy these days. Oh it has its share of sexual humor but it's clear that the creators made an effort to keep that within reasonable limits. And I suddenly find I can't get enough of the theme song, a tune which often used to annoy the hell out of me when the show would come on TV. It's funny how that sometimes happens. Needless to say so far I find it well worth the 200+ dollars I spent on it.
0762408480|5.0|This beautifully illustrated edition of the all time favorite Dickens story is perfect for children to read at the Christmas season. If the kids or grandkids in your life are too young to read, they will still certainly enjoy being read to and looking at the wonderful pictures. While shorter than the original, it maintains the complete gist of the story in the words we all love.
0385504225|5.0|This is a really great reading, exspecially when you are relaxing. also the speedy service of amonzon was great. I got my book in no time at all.
0345479092|3.0|The tone and writing style of this book did not appeal to me at all.  I am very science-oriented, and the facts and concrete suggestions were hard to find as much of the book was the author recounting specific stories or encouraging you to respect your baby.  It seemed like at least the first 1/3 of the book was her repeatedly telling you that the key to communicating with your baby is respecting him/her as an individual and explaining to them why you do things like bathe them. I am due  next month, so to be fair I haven't had any real world testing with this book, but this seems like it is not at all helpful.  I know babies like to hear you talk and your voice is soothing, but I don't think they are offended when you don't ask before picking them up or changing a diaper.  I loaned the book to my sister whose 6 week old is going through a major fussy period, and she found the book gives conflicting advice for helping the baby sleep.  I much preferred Happiest Baby on the Block and my sister prefers Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child (I haven't read this one yet).

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout. I am a intermediate exerciser 5x week. There are 3 circuit style workouts on this dvd.  Level 1, after 2 workouts was too easy so I am now going back and forth from level 2 to level 3. I love that each one is 20 minutes and she packs in a lot in that timeframe with no breaks. There's cardio,strenght training and ab work. I wish however each level had more workouts to mix it up a little,I have to rotate in some other dvds so it doesnt get boring, there's no way I could do just these 2 workouts for 30 days. All in all, a good addition to your workout library.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|We turned it off after 15 minutes.  It was so bad from the casting to the absolutely ridiculous dialog and acting.  I don't mind cursing, not at all - but lets say the first 15 minutes every other word was F this or F that - for no reason.<br />Plus the boys find out about the travesty...go to the barn to dig up their guns, clean them, cut their beards and hair and take sexy showers (yes it's true) and you would think this would take hours, yet the priest who delivered the news was sitting in the kitchen like he'd just gotten there....then they go to the Boston cops.  A litter of worse actors there has never been...<br /><br />Wow, I will watch terrible movies.  I mean any action or sci fi junk - I love.  But this was so bad it had to be turned off.  I'm thinking to slapping the guy at the rental store just for good measure.

0446567337|5.0|i found the book exicting, the end was nothing i imagined, this is not a regular love story the author has gave the story depth and emotion. you find a new meaning for love in this book. you felt anger, happiness, and most of all sadness. the book gave me a something to think about.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|At the time I bought \\"500 Days of Summer\\" from Amazon the price was $15 from amazon.com and $20 at the major stores (Best Buy, Wal-Mart, etc.).  After receiving it and giving it to the person I bought it for, the prices in store dropped to $10.  Although I was getting a film I thought was great when I saw it in theaters I paid more (I usually don't buy DVDs for over $10) than I could have if I just waited for the price to drop in stores.
B002HREKCI|5.0|this book gave a new look to death. many books i read don't change my opinion or stuck a emotion but this one did. this book was sad. you realize in this book that death is permanet and dosen't give you a second chance. you see that the little things can make caos. this is WOW, even though this is a book about hannah, this relates to clay also. when you read this book you feel yourself being untangle as the story does.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I LOVE it!  I was skeptical at first, but thought that for the price, it was worth a shot.  It is great and works on my perego pliko quite nicely.  I keep my keys, phone, a sippy cup and a 32 oz styrofoam cup in it.  I really wanted something that would be able to hold a 32 oz drink and it does just that.  Definitely worth the money!!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I have seen them all!  This is the most energetic, loving, inspirational Disney movie.  I took my children ages 3 and 4 and the both LOVED it.  Yes there are some scary parts but all Disney movies have a villain.  The music in this was GREAT.  I can not tell you how much I LOVE this movie.  It brings you back to being a child when Disney things made you get that excitement feeling.
0394721780|5.0|Book arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was in great condition. Good price too!
1932100660|5.0|By the time I completed the first two chapters of \\"The China Study,\\" I felt compelled to cut most animal products out of my diet. By the time I finished the book, my diet had completely changed for the better. I feel better, look better and have more energy than ever. I now own 3 copies of the book and will start giving them to friends and family. If you know someone who eats terribly and their diet is effecting their health, I recommend you get them this life changing, eye-opening book.
B00394DOE8|5.0|Having finished this book 2 weeks ago, I'm still thinking about it.  It's powerful beyond anything I've read in the last 5 years, and yet, it's written simply, it reads quickly.  No one needs a college degree to get through this one.    Based on this tale, which jives with news reports, the Soviets were the best thing to ever happen to Afghani women.  Many were empowered individuals under Soviet occupation.    It is a sad tale, to be sure, but Khaleed Hosseini found a way to end it on a more positive note, which would not necessarily be the case for most women in Afghanistan, especially under the Taliban.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|I expected a film called The Shooter to be about a shooting bloke, and it was! There is a lot of shooting going on, some rootin and tootin, and quite a bit of scootin.     Mark Wahlburg is ok, I like the guy, he isn't De Niro, but he is a solid, honest actor who brings his look of quizical confusion to many of his roles, and he does here as well. The plot of both the film, and that of the actual baddies, is over complicated, with the mantra \\"keep is simple stupid\\" so beloved (and quite rightly too) of military planners entirely absent, but it makes for a high octane ride.     Not \\"War and Peace\\", but still an enjoyable \\"beer and nuts\\" film for a weekend night.
0393075966|4.0|Dear Lefties, Joseph Stiglitz is clearly one of your own.  However in spite of my basic view, that government is evil and less government is better, I have reached a similar conclusion as Stiglitz, the invisible hand of the market needs some intervention from governments.  Stiglitz argues the markets need significant government intervention.  Our disagreement is a matter of degree.     The reason that Freefall is well worth reading is because he makes the most coherent arguments I have ever heard from anyone on the Left.  The book isn't about mathematical statistics.  It is largely a very readable logical framework for analyzing the recent crisis and the need for reforms.      Stiglitz's bias is clear, but for my compatriots on the right, if you believe the markets have functioned well in the recent past, you haven't been paying attention.  As a country, if we are going to have a meaningful dialogue about how to reform our system, Stiglitz's offers an analytical outline of the economy and financial markets superior to any that you will hear from an elected official, or any TV talking head. As an attempt to inform the public Freefall is a very important book.
1400049628|4.0|the thought that zombies might be real, or the fact that people actually believe this stuff.     They do, honest. You only have to look at some of the blogs and stuff to see that they do.     Mindless hulks shambling the earth. Thats what people who believe in zombies are. \\"Real\\" zombies dont actually exist. Hmm, perhaps I should have added a spoiler alert.     However, the fact that this book is so cleverly written is a testament to the ingenious nature of Mr Brooks's writing, seriously, its the funniest thing he has done since \\"Blazing Saddles\\", or possibly \\"Spaceballs\\", which personally, I found hilarious.     The irony, no perhaps more of a paradox, is that if people who believed in zombies were attacked by zombies intent in eating their brains, the poor zombies would not find enough sustainance to put on a small cracker. Hence you would think that it wouldn't be worth the effort on the part of the zombies to bother, which means that the people who believe in zombies wouldnt be bothered by them at all, and the zombies would have to spend their time chasing people who didnt believe in them to get a decent brain snack, but they couldnt because they dont actually exist. You could go mad thinking about it.     I think I might write a guide on \\"What do do if you find a dragon in your sock draw\\". Could be a big seller.     PS - Mr Brooks suggests the best way to survive a zombie attack is to build a 19th century prison at the North pole, and fill it with guns and food, so all in all, thats a good, common sense approach that suggests that come the zombocalypse, only Santa would survive. He might have to eat some elves though. Magic.
0307463745|5.0|I started a web design business over 10 years ago and have followed the success of Jason, David and those at 37signals along the way.  Much of what is in this book has been said over time in their blog called Signals vs. Noise. Even for those that have followed the blog over the years, this is a wonderful collection of material that is suited for business of all types.<br /><br />It is a quick read that is focused, concise and to the point. It has some great illustrations along the way to keep things even more interesting and is packed with insight on how they do things differently.<br /><br />This would be in the top 5 business books I would recommend for anyone new or old to business.
0792844890|5.0|Im no big Mel Brooks fan, by any means, and Im a harsh critic of crapness, but in these days of Scary Movie 12 and whatnot, the high quality spoof is hard to find.     Which makes it well worthwhile engaging your tachyon drive (oh spare me!) and warping (stop it!) back to 1987 and enjoying this very well done spoof, full of classic sci-fi rip offs, but done well. Even the obvious gags are delivered with fun, and Rick Moranis is a towering collossus of comedy in this, as the hilarously double entendre-ed \\"Dark Helmet\\". I often go for years without watching this, and then dig it out on VHS and watch it, and I always find it very good.     Whenever I see Bill Pullman, (he is always the President in things, well after that bloke who was in 6 Feet Under as the step dad, and Morgan Freeman if the President is black), I always think hehe Loooooone Star... great stuff.     PS - I had this idea for a film where Barack Obama gets entombed in concrete but I didnt want to set a president. Ho Ho. Now THATS humour.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Just love this movie... No sexual scenes in it besides kissing... Very Romantic!  I like romantic stories without all that Sexual stuff...This is my favorite movie with Sandra Bullock in it!!! and I've seen alot... The other one that has her playing that I like is \\" I Love Trouble \\"
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade has been a favorite of mine since Smooth Operator....her voice is like a soothing breeze that calms your nerves and relaxes you totally.  This album is a treat for the ears and your mood.  My husband who is not into music, loves this album and we are looking forward to seeing her in concert when she decides to tour.  I enjoy all types of music all the time, however, Sade is a special experiences for all your senses to savor and enjoy.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I watched this movie with my family and I was saddened and horrified by the state of industrial farming.  I want to buy this movie for everyone I know!  We really do vote with our grocery store purchases and we can change things, but it takes watching a movie like this, doing your homework, and be willing to face what you have been putting in your body.  Not to mention the corrupt organizations that WE support by buying food that come from feed lots and industrial farms.  Watch this movie... ESPECIALLY if you have kids.
B000089QEN|5.0|I'll be honest up front and tell you that I read Vanity Fair so long ago that I can't remember anything about it other than Becky Sharp. That's why when I started to watch this version, I really didn't know what to expect. The first scene seemed slow and I wasn't sure I wanted to watch more of it, but then I was intrigued by Dobbin. How can someone be so giving and faithful, just to be consistently unappreciated. I had to keep watching to see if anything good would happen to him. I kept an open mind toward Becky, until the end, when I was sure of my opinion, and then...I was left wondering again. She was amazing!<br /><br />I loved the twists and turns and I'm so glad that I had forgotten the plot so I was kept on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen to ___ or what was to become of ___. The two young boys, so different in their situations but equally sympathetic figures, just made me wish I could have been there to help.<br /><br />Others have given far better reviews than mine, but for those of us who just wanted to enjoy a good story, I would say this was well done. If you haven't read the book or seen it on video, you'll need to do that to fill in the blanks I left.  :)
0545123267|4.0|Note: I actually give this book 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />This book starts off like poetry, like breathing. Each page is a lyrical inhale, a lyrical exhale. Nothing has to happen - all that matters is Grace and Same, a girl and her world.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read, and yet, to call it romantic would be an understatement. Every word, every phrase, every paragraph was written with such love and care that to call it romantic would cheapen its beauty, its impact. It's just love, pure and simple, and yet somehow also oh so complicated.<br /><br />Grace and Same are one of the most intense and believable couples I have ever read. How they fell for each other, their immediate attraction, seems so real and makes so much sense to me. And their interactions with each other reinforce their intrinsic attraction over and over again. They are so different and yet so alike; they complement each other perfectly. They made me laugh, they almost made me cry, and they regularly made me hold my breath in anticipation, full of hope and desire that things would work out for them.<br /><br />They are both incredibly well-developed characters with incredibly well-developed, beautiful stories. The secondary characters are also full of life and history, and I felt almost as connected to them as I did to Sam and Grace. Isabel with her straightforward spunk, never whom you expect her to be; Trevor, so full of anger and yet also so full of hope; Rachel, with the bit of livelihood and humour she brings to an otherwise heart-wrenching story. Through Stiefvater's poetic cadence, they all became so alive, so important.<br /><br />This book ends the same way it begin - like poetry, like breathing. Your heart will be breaking while at the same time bursting with hope. And maybe even joy. I think at heart Maggie Stiefvater is really a poet. And it's hard not to get caught up in the beauty and tragedy of this book.
B002MJV75O|4.0|I will admit, I am a 22 year old male who like \\"smart\\" movies and TV shows, but I do have a soft spot for Teen Dramas. I purchased this show knowing nothing of the plot and found myself never being attached to the characters and find that dialog is that of a college professor. However, as with all TV shows, you need to keep in mind the time that the series came out and what was going on in the world when things happened. Dawson's Creek is a good fun show that is one of the first real Teen Dramas. Before One Tree Hill, Everwood, Roswell, there was one show that teens around the world stopped for an hour to watch, Dawson's Creek.
B00004R9A4|5.0|\\"Bedknobs and broomsticks\\" is a children's movie featuring Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson.<br /><br />The main character, Miss Price, is an apprentice witch in Britain during World War Two. Price searches for a magical spell she believes could help her country fight the Nazis. After various adventures, Price and her companions find themselves on the mysterious island of Naboombu, where the animals can talk and behave almost like humans, apparently after being enchanted by the vanished magician Astoroth.<br /><br />Miss Price realizes that the spell she's been looking for is engraved on a pentagram worn as a medallion by the lion king of the island. After even more crazy adventures, the travelling party returns home to Britain, where the Nazis have staged a landing. The spell of Astoroth is supposed to bring inanimate objects to life, and Price promptly tries it on the medieval armour at her castle. Will the spell work? Or is Albion doomed to suffer the perfidy of the Third Reich...?<br /><br />Well, how do *you* think the movie ends?<br /><br />I've only seen \\"Bedknobs and broomsticks\\" once. And yet, I grew up with the movie.<br /><br />How is that possible?<br /><br />The reason is simple. Two parts of the movie are animated. When I was a kid, the animated parts were released as separate cartoons, at least here in Sweden. Thus, you could buy the animated parts of \\"Bedknobs and broomsticks\\" without actually watching the rest.<br /><br />One of the cartoons, known in Sweden as \\"The Game of the Century\\", features a soccer game between two teams of animals. The animals are of course animated, while the human referee is a real actor (Tomlinson), interacting with the cartoon characters. And yes, it's hilariously funny! My father used to bring a movie projector to our elementary school and show all the kids both \\"The Game of the Century\\" and a \\"Speedy Gonzales\\" cartoon. We almost laughed ourselves to tears. I mean, the animals cheat, big time. The poor human referee is constantly swept aside by crazy, stampeding beasts. Is it soccer or is it ultimate fighting, I wonder? In the end, the team made up of \\"bad\\" animals (including the lion king) actually wins the game, at which point the badly mauled referee calls it off. There, the cartoon ends, with a mysterious castle shown in the background...<br /><br />When I saw the entire movie, I finally got the answer to a question that bothered me already as a kid: why did the bad guys win the game? It turns out that the cheating lion king eventually gets punished by the good humans arriving on his mysterious island. Well, he deserved it, if you ask me! ;-)<br /><br />I'm not sure how modern kids would react to \\"Bedknobs and broomsticks\\" as a whole. As I remember it, the film is very old fashioned. Small wonder. It was produced in 1971. It contains both regular dialogue and a couple of songs, dutifully sung by the main characters. This musical aspect never appealed to me, not even as a child. I found it boring. In short, this is as far away as you can possibly get from \\"Power Rangers\\" or \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\". Perhaps this movie is better as a nostalgia trip for great grandparents?<br /><br />However, I do remember that my best friend in elementary school thought the movie was cool, especially the fight against the Nazis. The movie is G-rated, but the youngest kids might find parts of it scary (the Nazis, the medieval knights, etc). It's a pity the soccer game isn't separately released anymore - it's excellent entertainment in its own right, and suitable for all ages.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to rate \\"Bedknobs and broomsticks\\", but I'll give it five stars for the wonderful animals of Naboombu. Loyal fans, we have a referee!!!beasts. Is it soccer or is it ultimate fighting, I wonder?

B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|This is a title to watch numerous times, having a deceptive simplicity......per other films of Miyazaki, it is poetic and is a celebration of life with all the contradictions left in. The Blu-ray I purchased does not allow me to access the extras......my firmware is current on the LG player I use.......anyone else having the same difficulty......??????
0385341008|1.0|Boring!  I keep waiting for this book to grab me. When I reached the end of the book, I felt cheated by the glowing reviews.  The epistolary style was a real turn off.  I found the letters trite and lacking in emotion.  Perhaps my history background affected my perspective, but I learned nothing new or interesting.  The characters were not well developed and the ending predictable.  This book was a total disappointment.

B0012GVKW8|5.0|We all know Predator is a great movie, but let's face it, the video quality is only as good as the original format.<br />Just Get the DVD or digital download instead of spending more on Blu-ray.
B002UD56I6|5.0|A must for all MJ fans.  Would have loved to attended this concert had he lived to provide it. Despite all the negativity of Michaels life, he was a brilliant performer. The way he looked in this video was a far cry from the horrible pictures seen on the tabloids. Rest in Peace Michael. I am so glad I have your videos and music to enjoy.
B001JV5B12|5.0|Not only does this movie combine modern-day technology with the folklore of vampires, but it does so REALLY WELL.<br />Also the lead actress is very hot.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|I loved this series when it first started on tv. Then they started with the reruns, jumping all over the place and like a lot of people I then really got LOST and lost interest. I have purchased all of the seasons to date and will get the ones to come. One of these days I will watch them in succession and hope to enjoy them once more.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Great acting and it makes you think.<br /><br />This movie is a fast-paced thrill ride that has fun with the idea of being able to see into the future.
B00337KM2S|5.0|First of, I applaud the brilliance of Jason Reitman who masterfully<br />directed and wrote this film. He is proof that creative genius does<br />sometimes run in families. This film has very adult sensibilities in<br />it's wit & humor, it's weighty & timely subject matter, it's showing of how<br />we tend to compartmentalize our lives and attempt to control things in a way<br />which we think can gaurd us from being hurt, but of course, in the end we<br />are only fooling ourselves. Bottomline is, we are all built to interact<br />and in those interactions, there's going to be joy and there's going to be pain.<br />Nobody gets out of here unscathed, but if we are smart and lucky and take the risk<br />of commiting ourselves to something or someone, then we stand to gain much more<br />than we can ever loose. Out of all of George Clooney's performances so far,<br />I like him in this one the best!---He nails it and you feel for him completely.<br />His performance is supported beautifully by that of Vera Farmiga, who seems to be<br />his perfect female counterpart in his clean, cut & dry, no regrets/no attachments<br />life philosophy...at least it seems that way. (That later twist threw me for a loop!)<br /><br />Anna Kendrick is great as the young over-achiever college grad who, in her way,<br />thinks she has her life and career all mapped out, but she too learns that just when<br />you think you have all the angles figured out, the game of life switches & shifts on you.<br />Jason Bateman is also great in his supporting role as George Clooney's and Anna Kendrick's<br />characters funny but very bottomline boss.<br />I also think it was brilliant of Jason Reitman to use people who have really<br />recently been fired from their jobs for no reason other than the economic downturn,<br />because it adds such depth and reality to their reactions when Clooney's<br />and Kendrick's characters do what it is that they do for a living,<br />which is flying from city to city and being the human resources \\"heavies\\" for<br />companies who don't even have the guts to fire their own otherwise loyal and<br />hardworking employees face to face. Many of these people reflect the scenarios<br />of what so many others in this situation have had to deal with....just heart-breaking stuff.<br />This is a great film and deserves all the accolades it's received this year.<br />It gets off some great messages without being preachy about it.<br />A good addition to your DVD collection if you like films with substance and heart.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Jimi's approach to guitar playing was so free and loose, yet so precise and dfficult to emulate. What this album is or isn't is not important. What is great about this release is that we get to keep hearing what Jimi was up to in the studio long after he left us. I hope his estate keeps more music coming, because it is better than anything else being released today.  Fly on!
B000LN7HUC|4.0|Really inexpensive, easy to maintain, packs light and easily. I have used lots of stoves over the years.  This little one delivers.  The windscreen is more of a stand for the cook pot.  Pack a bit of foil and that's not a big deal.  The handle works surprisingly well.  The simmer ring is ok as long as you are making soup.  Anything thicker (and even some soups) will wind up with hotspots.  The pan works well as a lid.  Its really not big enough for anything else.  Perfect for day trips where you just want some coffee or tea.  Even a hot meal.

B0034GK7DM|3.0|The cover of newcomer Easton Corbin's self-titled debut depicts a homespun image of the singer-songwriter strumming an acoustic while relaxing on a porch in a wicker rocking chair. It's an apt picture. The album strips away much of Nashville's contemporary bombast in favor of the relaxed country vibe of Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. The comparison is particularly close in the sunny satisfaction and road trip escape of \\"Roll With it,\\" the forthright statement of home-spun roots \\"A Little More Country Than That,\\" and multiple mentions of good times and simple pleasures. Corbin and his co-writers have pulled together a collection of love songs, both warm and broken-hearted, and link Chesney with Tom T. Hall by drawing a blue line from Memphis to Key West in \\"This Far From Memphis.\\" There's a moving lyric of imagined nostalgia in \\"Someday When I'm Old\\" and the second-chance glimpsed in \\"Let Alone You\\" is illustrated with sharply observed everyday details.<br /><br />A few of the songs are a bit close to their inspirations for comfort. \\"Don't Ask Me `Bout a Woman\\" rewrites the sentiment and mood of Brad Paisley's \\"Waitin' on a Woman,\\" and the sandy vacation of \\"A Lot to Learn About Livin'\\" is third-generation Jimmy Buffett by way of Kenny Chesney. Corbin's vocals are lightly drawled and producer Carson Chamblerlain counts out a variety of tempos that allow is singer to show off his emotional prowess as both a balladeer and mid-tempo honky-tonker. The album closes with the thoughtful \\"Leavin' a Lonely Town,\\" echoing the escapes and traps of Steve Earle's \\"Guitar Town\\" and Chris Knight's \\"Oil Patch Town.\\" The sound is Nashville clean, but it's not slickly artificial; it's sophisticated in the manner of George Strait and others able to hang on to their country roots even as they embrace modern studio production. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

B0029LHW68|5.0|This band is amazing. From their first album to their third album they have not disappointed. Their music is ever-changing, yet still stays true to who 30 Seconds to Mars are and what they and their music represent. I don't understand the reviews of people saying that they've sold out or turned too pop or commercial. Their music is like no others band's music that I've come across and they're definitely not a \\"commercial\\" band. Jared Leto writes songs with so much meaning and you can tell that he truly puts his heart and soul into each song. One of the things that I love most about 30 Seconds to Mars is that they don't conform just to please people or to fit into a certain genre of music. They make music because it's what they love to do and if they never sold another CD they'd still continue to make music. I love bands that aren't afraid to grow or take risks and 30 Seconds to Mars is definitely one of those bands. I highly recommend this CD, but if you're a close-minded individual then you might as well keep on moving.     \\"This is War\\" is a truly inspiring album that takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and once the ride is over you want to get right back on and experience it all over again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought that this was a really good video workout that was clear and easy to follow. It hasn't gotten boring to me yet. Jillian explains things well and the ladies in the back show the moderate way to do the exercise for beginners and the  full-speed-ahead way to perform the exercise; it is nice to have a person to focus on instead of trying to modify things on your own. I don't think starting out that it could be done everyday, my muscles needed to rest a day in between. I do really feel a \\"burn\\" (in a good way!)and think that for a video, it is an effective workout in 20 minutes. (No annoying music either!)
B000002BFL|2.0|I was never really a Springsteen fan until I heard his \\"Nebraska\\" album.  I was captivated by the eerie, gritty essence of the album and the blue collar storytelling. It became one of my most cherished albums.    When I read that The Ghost of Tom Joad was a sort a \\"sequel\\" to Nebraska, I enthusiastically picked up a copy.  Unfortunately it was a disappointment.      The Ghost of Tom Joad is a highly polished, full-studio album and as a result, it fails to recapture the folky, haunted feel of the lo-fi Nebraska album.  In addition, although the album has good storytelling and lyrical quality, there are few catchy melodies and little variety between songs. Halfway through the album it starts to get very monotonous.  The title track is the only song that really stands out.      I had high hopes for this album but ultimately found it to be mediocre and forgettable.  In my opinion, it does not hold a candle to Springsteen's outstanding \\"Nebraska\\".

0679422714|5.0|What an amazing read! I couldn't wait until this ego-maniacal evil character croaked! The 20th century saw some evil leaders, but I would have to give him the blue ribbon. Lenin, Stalin and Hitler had nothing on this tyrant combined! He used the country's blood and treasure as his own little fiefdom! He wanted the Japanese to invade China for his personal gain. Unbelievable stuff. Personally responsible for the lives of 70 million people and not during times of war! Some of them horrendously tortured, raped and beaten to death and they were the lucky ones. Some of his cadres that did manage to get out alive were either poisoned or died while trying to escape his tight fisted grip on everything that took place in this mess of a country during his reign. One has to wonder how much of his fetid evilness still reeks throughout this country.       This mess of an evil man wanted to rule the world and stopped at every nasty/evil trick to get his WMD. Make's me glad to see the U.S. leading the way! Can you imagine had Stalin or Mao had had their way?    While I obviously can't vouch for the claims of the two authors, they do however have a tome of references to go by. Read this book if you want to learn about the absolute evilness of one man. Read it for the historical significance (shame on Kissinger). Read it to get a better understanding of the East.    Mao was an egregious human being and members of the Obama administration revering him should seek psychiatric therapy stat!    Highly recommended!
B00328G4V6|4.0|What's not to be excited about here?  Two more essentials:  another true masterpiece of Jimi's in Valleys of Neptune, and a great lost tune of near-as-high quality in Ships Passing Through the Night.  Plus a funkier remake of Stone Free that arguably surpasses the original, and another big scoop of searing jams from Jimi Hendrix and friends....  One of the most fun being the early Ezy Rider jam Lullaby For the Summer.    Four stars relatively speaking, but with artists of such driven and ever-questing, ever-virtuosic muses as this (John Coltrane comes to mind, as well), every quality recording is priceless.  Sound quality here is excellent, and a certain consistency is achieved by the relatively small recording window of the majority of the tracks.  Mr. Bad Luck is the only piece that feels a bit out of place (and like a B-lister lyrically); the instrumental New Rising Sun from now-deleted Voodoo Soup might've fit better, though one can't really complain about another fully-finished unreleased song seeing daylight.    For those who posted about the Target bonus tracks addition, BLESS YOU.  I'm in your debt, your seeds have borne fruit.  Located a Target on the way home after reading this, and got my copy for the promised $ 9.95.  Especially special is that one of the bonus tracks is Trash Man from the old Midnight Lightning.  I've been hoping for that for some time, and here it is at last!    Too bad Trash Man isn't on the release proper, it's a highlight and I prefer it to the final official track Crying Blue Rain.    Great artwork, too ~ the watercolor scape is Jimi's.    Thanks for this release.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and one of the best period drama movies I have ever seen.  The attention to detail, costumes, and acting were all great.  Rupert Friend looks so much like the real Prince Albert, he could almost be his twin.  The actor who played Leopold I of the Belgians too was brilliantly cast and looks very much like the real Leopold.  I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to learn a little about the reign of Victoria and Albert and how they came to meet and marry and the first years of their life together.  You cant go wrong with this movie.  You'll want to watch again and again over the years.
0316069906|5.0|What? You want ME to read that book?     Nah! I don't need no stinkin' Vegetarian horror stories ...    Chances are, that - if you always, regularly or sometimes eat meat - you are right within the target group for this book ... but you are most likely not going to read it.     There are many reasons for that ... You do not want to spoil your appetite with new horror stories. After all, you know that if you look closely at how meat is made, you expect that you will not find much there that is pleasant.    But, what I found most interesting about the book, is, that - if you DO eat meat -  then you will find a lot of very useful information why you should at least avoid some kinds of meat (not because your heart bleeds because of animals suffering, but rather because you value your personal health)    So, you might find the book very interesting reading...

0393072231|3.0|Let me get the easy part of this out of the way first. Michael Lewis is a remarkably gifted writer, and I have often found his books impossible to put down. When I first read his debut at book authorship, Liar's Poker, I literally read it straight through. I was not alone in this, as Liar's Poker rightfully made Michael a very well-respected author and a very wealthy man. Moneyball, The Blind Side, and numerous other best-sellers built on that reputation. The long-awaited newest contribution from Michael Lewis, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, is 264 pages long, and I also read this in 24 hours. However, I doubt many others will feel the same. The book was compelling, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and nothing in the book modified my view that Michael Lewis is one of the most interesting writers of this era. I simply doubt that this book evoke the same response from the masses of people who will buy it. Perhaps I am wrong. So before I begin to disect the important parts of the book (its underlying messages, etc.), I will say that it was another hard-to-put-down book from Michael Lewis. Thumbs up, and all that stuff.<br /><br />So what did I really think of the book? Well, Lewis should be commended for writing a book on the 2008 financial crisis from the most unique perspective thus far. Rather than focus on the major characters that a plethora of other books have focused on (Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner, etc.), Lewis tells his story using some extremely obscure characters as his lead actors: A handful of hedge fund managers who made massive bets against the subprime industry (and by hedge fund managers, I am not referring to high profile, well-known hedgies; I am talking about very, very minor players). Readers will feel connected to the characters when they are done with the book, and a less gifted writer could have never pulled this off. It was a difficult task for Lewis as well, but he skillfully made the points he wanted to make and simultaneously told a story, all through a narrative of four or five unconnected characters of whom the public has never heard.<br /><br />What are these points Lewis wanted to make? I suppose the major tension of the book is the teeter-tottering between the greed/evil genius of the major Wall Street firms (on one hand), and then the utter stupidity and incompetence of Wall Street (on the other). It is a difficult balance to strike, and one reason it is difficult is because, well, one can not have it both ways. Lewis can not claim, as he astonishingly and explicitly does, that Goldman Sachs made AIG write credit default swaps on the subprime mortgage industry, guaranteeing AIG's demise and Goldman Sachs flourishing, but then on the other hand claim that the firms had no idea what they were doing, and were completely shell-shocked by what happened to their CDO's (the collateralized debt obligation instruments which served as the toxic assets you hear so much about). This inconsistency permeates the book, and tonight on 60 Minutes I heard Lewis repeat what his major thesis is: Wall Street did not know what they were doing. This is the correct thesis. But it is wholly imcompatible with the obscene Goldman Sachs conspiracy movement that has taken over the Oliver Stone mainframe of our society. Even a Michael Lewis fan like myself was taken aback by the audacity of this oft-repeated contradiction.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing message of the Lewis book is the conclusion he saved for the final chapter - the one I have heard him preaching for some time now on the media circuit. Lewis has been preaching since the days of Liar's Poker that the great sin of Wall Street was when all of the major firms went public (i.e. rather than function as closely-held partnerships, they sold shares to the public in the IPO market and now have no reason to ever check their evil inhibitions at the door). It is a rhetorically effective charge, but one that is not up for the most routine of examinations. The individuals most responsible for the massive money-losing operations of 2005-2007 were the largest shareholders in the firms. Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns saw his stock holdings decline from $1 billion of value to $50 million of value, directly under his watch. Richard Fuld was thrown to the lions as Lehman Brothers burned to the ground, but it burned up his $550 million of Lehman stock as well. The gentlemen running these firms were wealthy, and they were driven by a desire to get even wealthier, but it is absurd to postulate that the performance of these companies in the public stock markets were not important to them. It was all that was important to them. Are we really to believe that Wall Street would not have found more creative ways to raise capital in the capital markets if they were partnerships? Whether the firms were partnerships or public corporations, they lived off of balance sheet capital that they mostly raised in the debt markets. It was the bondholders who were on the verge of utter collapse in September of 2008. Why would that be different if they were partnerships? The most obvious refutation of Lewis's thesis is the question many are probably dying to point out to him after reading it: If being a public corporation corrupts the intentions of financial firms, why couldn't the same broad brush be used for all public corporations of all industries? If the removal of the partner capital from the company capital is a self-corrupting event, why should any corporation ever be allowed to go public? What exactly is the difference? Do not huge retail businesses, manufacturing firms, and technology outfits also use shareholder money to grow and operate? Does Lewis really want to advocate the abolition of public equity markets in America? It is absurd to even carry that argument through to its logical conclusion.<br /><br />I do not want readers to be confused. There are some stellar observations in Lewis's newest book. He gets inside some of the most confused and ridiculous financial transactions ever conducted in the history of civilization, and he does it with the precision of a surgeon. But Lewis does not use his 264-page book to even apply one word - not one single utterance - against the malignant government policies behind much of this malaise. He could easily counter that his book was not meant to be a comprehensive introspection of the financial crisis, and that would be a fair response. But readers hoping for a biog-picture analysis of this crisis will not get it here. They will see the worst of a very small number of Wall Street traders, and they will see a system that was clueless to keep this process from ballooning out of control (his section on the high seven-figure bond traders being regulated by the high five-figure ratings agency analysts is choice). The risk management processes of Wall Street broke down. The hubris of a select number of people grew to a point of perversity. Contrary to Lewis's assertion, the bulk of these CEO's and executives did lose their jobs (Citi, Merrill Lynch, UBS, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, etc.) all fired their Presidents and CEO's as their houses burned to the ground. But overall, the book has a ton of good to say about the crisis. Most notably, he demonstrates how \\"in an old-fashioned panic, perception creates its own reality\\" (a concept that I want to explore much further in the future). He summarizes in a single sentence the most important thing that can be said about Lehman Brothers (\\"the problem wasn't that Lehman had been allowed to fail; the problem was that Lehman had been allowed to succeed\\").<br /><br />I am truly glad that I read this book, and I do recommend it. However, as the pivotal work of evaluating the big picture of the crisis continues, the conclusion that Wall Street's transition to a shareholder-owned entity was at the heart of the matter is quite lacking. Unfortunately, both evil and incompetence exist in all kinds of business structures.ancial transactions ever conducted in the history of civilization, and he does it with the precision of a surgeon.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|There is 5 stars and there is with a particular cast and treatment of a classic,  greatness... in both craft and sensibilities. This is one of perhaps a 100 efforts since movie making started that truly deserves the word.  It is interesting to see different adaptations of Austen ... they often work or don't work because of casting as is the case with all movies. Although I have given this 5 stars most of that is Romola Garai.  The rest of the cast is too very good with Miss Fairfax's talkie cookie relative excellent I forget her real name. But Romola's humanity... add real faults in the character and her growth and Emma's core playfulness... youth too but in the end budding full adulthood are truly wonderful and put her in the company of the BBC heroines in Pride and Prejudice and too Kira K's work in the adaptation a few years ago which of course were both extremely good if different.  Emma's love interest.. his demeanor  and change to romantic affection hidden...  is extremely well done if under stated which seems perfect; they are well matched for her and his... discovery of her love beyond his long time older brother relationship.  Buy it for Romola's historic performance alone for this is now a classic... but,  there is more in the cast to love.   But yes, Ms Garai's acting is that good but more than that she is so perfectly cast that one forgets while watching how far we are from those times of the early 19th century. This is too, because the series takes its time and tells the book's whole story, so that this version of Jane Austen has none of that need to transpose ideas and scenes and her classic lines, that sometimes confuse and mar so often shorter movies made from not only Austin classics but other beloved books as well.   Here they move at a book's pace but every scene accomplishes a task... and that is one of the secrets of the success of this version of Austin and the mid 90s version of Pride and Prejudice.   By this slowing down and many episodes...one feel's the characters become people, they come alive and are understandable and are not two dimensional personalities out of a historical play but rather are people... the pace is perfect for the material and all without that offensive extremely annoying Hollywood habit of shocking of the audience to keep the dull's attention.  I was not aware of Ms Garai before this movie but I am now a fan... what a sweet happiness exudes from her spirit and so perfectly matched to Austen's sweet meddling young semi noble matriarch of a small village... who is thinking about other people's love and loneliness while forgetting for a time, her own.  As for those who say that Romola Garai is not &#34;elegant,&#34; please! Elegance comes from the soul, good manners and honesty. Not only is Ms Garai's spirit in tune with the story... and obviously... she has a depth of beauty that is rare, but unlike too many JA adaptations... she is wholly real. Mischievous, is a good word,  often happy and aware of her faults and willing to admit them even to Mr. Knightly, but too isolated with her father physically and culturally because of class which she is actually happy about... or rather she thinks she is.   We too see how integrated a prominent family was in a small village at that time straight from Austen's pen and her world without the retrojection of crass contemporary feminist politics that so demeans other versions of Austin, even the last very well done Pride and Prejudice, staring the ravishing Kira Knightly.   Emma is not played here as a cloth draped English early 19th century lifeless book character, rather she is a girl... at times and a young women at other moments who before your eyes, becomes a women with her first real deep understanding and wisdom... but whose elegant charms are most seen in her playful inner life, that is appealing for its humility: she laughs at herself very often and yet she too has an expected pride of class. These qualities too, one senses are a lovely inner part of the real Ms Garai.
0307460444|3.0|I received this cookbook and Cupcakes Galore for Christmas, and to be honest I use the other book more often. I've made two recipes from this book, the banana pecan cupcakes and the chocolate peanut butter ones, and they were both very good. A lot of the other recipes look good, but what stops me from using them is the huge yield. It's not unusual for one recipe to make 36 cupcakes and be nearly impossible to scale down to a portion more appropriate for someone who lives alone. In addition, a lot of the recipes are for cheesecake or muffins disguised as cupcakes. The last nearly half of the book is dedicated to decorating, often saying the same thing over and over (Here are three pages to show how to make a pig! Now here are three for a cow, doing the same thing but with white icing!) But like I said, I've only really tried two recipes and they really were very good, so I can't give this less than three stars, despite the book's flaws.<br /><br />EDIT: Made the orange vanilla bean cupcakes and they were delicious! Wish more of the book was actually recipes because they're really good.
0393072231|5.0|People look at the number of stars real readers give a book as a shorthand way to see if they want to read it. When people use the star system as a way to complain about Kindle availability, slow shipping, or what have you, it defeats the purpose and gives a misguided picture of a book's literary merit. There are other forums for complaints of this kind. In fact, the more people want to read a book, the more likely they will request it on Kindle. A bunch of one star ratings make people want to pass it by, which is almost what I did. Reviews not to the point of the book's content should not be allowed on this page.

Written almost two hundred years ago by a young woman nineteen years old, this parable captures with astounding clarity the problems that heartless science has visited upon the planet earth.

This book is not to be confused with many of its movie versions, some of which wholly invert Mary Shelley's themes.
B002UNMWAG|2.0|No spoilers in this review.  I was so excited to see this movie.  The first movie is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, I have it on Blue Ray & DVD.      The begenning of the movie is horrible, only about halfway it starts to get better.  The wife and I counted numerous plot holes, we kept saying (why did the characters do, or are doing that?).  The thing about the first movie is that it didn't mean to be funny, but it was.  This movie TRIES to be funny, and it just does not work.  My two favorite characters from the first movie are not in this movie, William Dafoes character and Rocco.  This would have been OK, but they try to replace them.  William Dafoe's character is a woman FBI agent with a horrible southern accent & tereible acting (she's hot though).  Rocco's replacement character is this rather unfunny \\"mexican\\" actor.  It just does not work.  They try to use the same formula with regards to action as the first movie and it just feels tacked on.  (Show the crime about to happen, show the result with all the dead bodies, have the detectives talk through the crime as it's happening in slow mo).    On the plus side, they do bring back other minor characters.  The 3 detectives, the bartender with terets (love him) and the guy who has the weapons cache.     Absolute worst part of the movie.  In thier first return hit the brothers talk about what plan of action to take.  The plan plays in slow mo with the brothers hair all slicked back, corny action and 70's style porn music.  I almost shed a tear after that part.    Final Verdict.  - 1 star for William Dafoe's character SNAFU  - 1 star for Rocco's character SNAFU  - 1 stay for unfunny, rushed, just plain bad script, plot holes, etc.    + 1 star because the main 3 characters were good (sort of).  + 1 star because plot does get better towards the end.

B000M4RG4C|4.0|In 1945, the Marines attack twelve thousand Japaneses protecting the twenty square kilometers of the sacred Iwo Jima island in a very violent battle. When they reach the Mount Suribachi and six soldiers raise their flag on the top, the picture become a symbol in a post Great Depression America. The government brings the three survivors to America to raise funds of war, bringing hope to desolated people, and making the three men heroes of war. However, the traumatized trio has difficulties to deal with the image build by their superiors, sharing the heroism with their mates.  Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. This movie tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. Some of the movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of war, and the effects war has on our returning soldiers. The story is realistic and very compelling by not glorifying war.

0446569895|5.0|I think that this is the first time that I laughed so hard by reading a book. I mean, it's like talking to Ozzy face to face because the way this book is written is just the way he speaks, with \\"sandwich\\" sentences and lots of the F word too... I didn't know anything about Black Sabbath history or even about Ozzy himself before I bought this book, I actually bought it because I like some of his songs and I think that he's so funny, although what is making him act \\"funny\\" is not funny at all.... Anyway, I had a blast reading this book and even now, like a month after I finished it, I keep laughing when I remember some of his stories. Needless to say, if you are an Ozzy fan, go for it!!

B001OQCV2E|3.0|2012 is a movie where all the heroes escape by the thinnest of plots...I mean margins. It's the old fashioned disaster movie where a handful of actors dodge impossible odds and impending doom always seems to be just a wee bit slower than the plane/car/small dog racing in front of the collapsing ground/raging fireball/crushing metal machinery. It's B-Movie dumb with 21'st century technology. It will kill off 2 and a half hours of your afternoon and few brain cells in the process.<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich obviously learned a lesson from the wretchedly awful 10,000 BC (I joked that the BC then stood for Bad Cinema), where wafer thin plots better have a lot of things going ka-boom if the audience is going to plop down ticket money. So this time, at almost every turn, you get a gloriously apocalyptic shot of disaster. Be it the raining of molten fireballs on Jellystone park or the collapse of California into the Pacific, the effects are incredible. 2012 is the best disaster porn since \\"Titanic,\\" and you don't have to wade through all those stuffy period dress. For that matter, the emotional baggage of millions of people dying before your very eyes.<br /><br />Really, if you had just watched a city of millions get washed off the globe, would you react with giggles and jokes? Because no-one here seems to be all that disturbed that major chunks of the populous have been wiped out. Hardly anyone seems to be capable of shedding tears, save for the President's daughter and the scientific superbrain. With the exception of John Cusak and Woody Harrelson, all the actors here are interchangeable, mere props set against the gloriously delicious mayhem that does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout 2012.<br /><br />So ignore the implausibility of it all and the sarcastic 2012 political subtext (only politicians and the wealthy will be worth having around post-apocalypse), and thrill to the destruction of the White House by Tsunami bearing battleship. It's lights, camera, faultline!

B002BWP4A6|5.0|Michael Haneke is arguably one of the finest directors in the world today. His works, like \\"Seven Continents,\\" \\"A House At the Lake,\\" and \\"The Piano Teacher\\" are quite troubling in may ways and in these works he often keenly captured the downside of the Postmodern Aesthetic, where often the world seems upside down.<br /><br />This work is different; rather than a post modern turn Haneke's work has an almost premodern, very austere, sensibility with it's portrayal of a nearly feudalistic German farming town the edge of of WWI. As is in his other works, particularly \\"A House on The Lake.\\" there is an increasing sense that something is not quite right in this bucolic setting.<br /><br />The town's wealthier people (a Baron, a Minister, a Doctor, and a landowning farmer)all have a profound sense of entitlement, fatalism and are generally not nice people. The farmers,a modern version of medieval serfs, seem slightly more light hearted, but there is an increasing sense of dis-ease surrounding them. The only decent major character is the local school teacher, who also acts as the omniscient narrator looking back from the future (the narrator, the moral weaknesses and the black and white photography reminded me a bit of American film noir). Also the narrator who was 31 in the picture and sounds at least in his mid sixties (a time of the great war(s) and unprecedented bloodshed in the not too distant future). Besides the teacher and, to a lesser degree the baron's wife, the only really decent and caring people are from elsewhere (e. g.; Eva the teacher's shy but direct love interest, and the Italian woman who is brought back from Italy bu the Baroness to take care of her emotionally scarred children- however the investigative police brought in to solve the mysteries had a mean, almost gestapo like approach to \\"law and order.\\"<br /><br />The plot is marked by a series of heinous crimes and mishaps, which symbolize both the the town's hypocrisy and the looming danger of \\"The Great War(s)\\"  ahead. There is definitely a lot of familial viscountess here: the doctor's incestuous relations of his daughter and sadistic treatment of his midwife, the mean spirited actions of the Baron towards his employees, his workers and his family, the punitive treatment of the somewhat hypocritical minister towards his children: for example his tying his young adolescent sons hands during the night to prevent any nervous degeneration through masturbation, which for Victorian age Europeans was often thought as the cause of many major maladies; as well as the white ribbons he forces his children to wear, like a scarlet letter, for their very minor moral transgressions.<br /><br />Finally I assert this movie is an allegory of the beginning of the Germanic quest for domination (and a microcosm of the then German national identity that carried out the \\"final solution) , which portends to atrocities, death, and destruction yet to afflict all Germans- including those in remote hamlets like this movie takes place. The children who face varying levels of blind brutality in 1913-1914 in this bucolic setting could very well play a major role in the Nazi induced horrors 25+ years later. And the sadism they are exposed too in their tiny town they could well have led too such sadism inflicted on the world by the German people.<br /><br />Although shot in a small setting, this is a big, and extremely though provoking, movie, and is definitely worth looking at twice due to the subtle nuances and the underlying thematic elements. As usual Haeneke, a little like Lars Von Trier (e. g.; his movie \\"Europa\\"),provides a disturbing message about the past, the present and the future.here is definitely a lot of familial viscountess here: the doctor's incestuous relations of his daughter and sadistic treatment of his midwife, the mean spirited actions of the Baron towards his employees, his workers and his family, the punitive treatment of the somewhat hypocritical minister towards his children: for example his tying his young adolescent sons hands during the night to prevent any nervous degeneration through masturbation, which for Victorian age Europeans was often thought as the cause of many major maladies; as well as the white ribbons he forces his children to wear, like a scarlet letter, for their very minor moral transgressions.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Up in the Air is an entertaining, sardonic, prescient, honest dramedy for grown-ups. It is also among the very best films of the year. It is basically Clooney's vehicle entirely; here he plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is constantly traveling around the country helping companies facilitate mass layoffs and artfully giving employees the bad news. He is sharp and experienced, and if not satisfied in life then subconsciously at peace with it. Enter in Vera Farmiga as his sexy and consistently interesting lover, and Anna Kendrick, as the new kid on the block hoping to revolutionize the \\"employee transition\\" process via online video conferencing. The three intersect with eachother in varied ways, each teaching the other deep life lessons in the guise of everyday circumstance and twists of fate. Jason Reitman directs lean, nuanced performances out of the actors, and gives the film a visual sheen congruent to the character's too-structured lives. The film is basically about major life themes of life, regret, love, personal responsibility, and in the subtle ways growing older influences your choices and carves out a path for you different than anything you anticipated. Clooney and Farmiga are as charming as any characters you're likely to see, and the film has undertones of sincerity that quickly make you invested in it and wanting everything to be tied up neatly in the end. Life, however, seldom turns out that way, but Up in the Air serves as a gentle reminder that no one is perfect, and that no one is ever really alone.
1594488843|4.0|The three poinst Pink makes are that intrinsic motivation is based on purpose, mastery and autonomy.  There are some great examples and he makes some great points. The book gets a bit redundant at the end. I think  there are other books about intrinsic motivation that are excellent as well such as Flow and Full Throttle, which I would recommend.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|This is what horror movies should be like and what vampire films in particular are most often NOT. For the majority of the film the supernatural aspects are understated, leaving the superb acting, writing, and direction to shine through. You almost forget you're watching a vampire film. At once disturbing and yet moving, fantastical yet realistic, Let the Right One In is a stark meditation on friendship, bullying, and yes, vampirism. The [[ASIN:1572304510 psychopathic]] brother bullies were well played, but the two lead parts carried the film.

0061711292|4.0|I couldn't help by shake my head and marvel after finishing The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Not only are the characters superb, the story is great and the writing uniquely insightful. Also, the novel is so cleverly and masterfully written. From the first pages you are taken in by its fugue-like structure. I've never read a book like it, where past and present fuse into one, as if the narrator is dipping in and out of time to present a perfectly cogent story not hindered by the rules of causality. Future events are casually revealed, descriptions are repeated as if musical motifs, and yet the plot moves inexorably to its inevitable conclusion. In the end you are left enriched by the lives of Miss Jean Brodie and her set, by their idiosyncrasies, failures, highs and lows. And it's short enough to read in a sitting or two, to boot!

6304936303|4.0|Willis has made this movie again and again: a wise-cracking detective/cop/some-such, seemingly headed straight for the bottom, stops the badguys at the last minute and with body count approaching the national debt. Oh, and partway through, a carefully engineered misunderstanding makes sure the cops are after him, too.<br /><br />The thing it, this recipe keeps working. It serves up action at (or just past) the limits of plausibility, with a few memorable stunts and bits of staging. Halle Barry's brief role near the beginning just sweetens the mix.<br /><br />The wise-cracking remains funny, the badguys are easy to hate, and the final redemption comes through as suitably redeeming. Oh, and the kid is cute, too, even if slightly scary as a knockoff of her father. Great for a rainy Saturday.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Don't read the spoilers for this film. If possible, don't read anything about it. Just watch it. I liked everything about this film: the premise, the script, the directing, the acting, the pace. Sam Rockwell does an amazing job. Every couple years a great indie SF film comes out, for example [[ASIN:B0007N1JC8 Primer]], and Moon is exactly that. Futuristic, yet plausible in a sick kind of way. One of the best of the year.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|I think Sam Rockwell is an excellent actor.  Not only is he about the only actor in this movie, he carries off multiple roles.<br /><br />I don't recommend knowing anything about this movie in advance -- especially don't watch the trailer!  It gives away too much in what is a movie with many twists and should actually keep you guessing.  It is fairly predictable if you watch the trailer, but, Rockwell's fine acting carries the movie.  Kevin Spacey has a voice only part in the movie.<br /><br />As you watch the movie -- and again, Rockwell's multiple roles -- you will forget that you are watching the performance of only ONE actor.  It's very easy to forget as he plays them so well.  Many may disagree, but I felt this performance was at least Academy Awards nomination worthy.  I believe Sam Rockwell is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.<br /><br />The DVD has some fine extras that enhances the movie experience overall, but don't watch them first.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|\\"Ro-bot. Ro-bot. Ro-bot. Rock. Robot Rock.\\" So begins over an hour of nonstop music of exactly that--a rock concert performed without a single acoustic instrument, only computers and digital processors controlled by two Frenchmen in robot costumes. Covering a good portion of their large catalogue, Daft Punk's Alive 2007 album is a greatest hits of sorts for the duo--the way it may be played at a party rather than on a radio; songs transition from one to the next with little silence and often without a track break, they have increased sample and phrase repetition as well as dedicated time to building instrumental arches (of pre-recorded samples), and from start to finish thousands of screaming fans in the background bring the live experience to your living room. On the whole it is a technosonic masterpiece--bringing together electronic music, electroacoustic music, looping altered in real time, and real time digital alteration of the fundamental characteristics of sound (timbre, frequency, amplitude, duration, and envelope), all rooted in prerecorded samples.    Though it is a complete work, the album is frontloaded. My favorite parts of the album are contained within the first five tracks, engrossing the listener through the first half hour in a very punchy and hook-based style. While there are certainly highlights over the next eight tracks there are also sections which seem to drag and let the listener become disengaged.      The first two tracks of the album work together to draw in the audience with pounding bass and a focus on (sampled) vocals, while utilizing some basic live computer manipulations to create the music in real time. The first track (\\"Robot Rock / Oh Yeah\\") evolves utilizing two words \\"Human\\" and \\"Robot,\\" as they are played in repeating sequence; indecipherable at first due to the sample being played at a very slow BPM rate, the word \\"Human\\" evolves as the track picks up speed over a minute. Drum and bass loops and a pitch slowly increasing in frequency and amplitude enter before evolving into a song closer to the original album version of \\"Robot Rock.\\"     On the second track (\\"Touch It / Technologic\\"), Daft Punk highlights the use of samples, sampling a sample of their own song used by Busta Rhymes. Busta Rhymes's \\"Touch It\\" samples Daft Punk's original \\"Technologic,\\" as Missy Elliot repeatedly sings, \\"Touch it. Bring it. Pay it. Watch it. Turn it. Leave It. Start. Format it\\"--the last line of the verse of \\"Technologic.\\" Having been a major success the year prior, \\"Touch It\\" receives a large crowd response and may work to include listeners which discovered the group through Busta Rhymes rather than vice versa. The sample is heavily and rapidly manipulated in real time, affecting the frequency and overall tonal quality before Daft Punk transitions from into \\"Technologic\\" for the remainder of the song.      Track three starts off rather simplistically, sampling the groups' well known \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" track for the first 2:46 before jumping into a blend with \\"Crescendolls.\\" \\"Cresendolls\\" utilizes an ascending digital keyboard sound with sampled vocal samples singing \\"Ya!\\" \\"Hey!\\" and \\"Hey ya!\\" The lyrics are simple, but the unified sampled yells of \\"Hey!\\" brings the crowd into the performance, as the crowd mimics the samples. A brief moment of odd transition and downtime begin the fourth track (\\"Too Long / Steam Machine\\") before the vocal and bass lines of \\"Too Long\\" kick in to bring up the tempo once more. The up-tempo pace is short-lived, as Daft Punk once again slows down the beats per minute drastically at the 1:31 mark. Over the next three minutes the tempo slowly builds again before breaking down at 4:36 to even slower than before. As if suddenly caught in viscous liquid, Daft Punk lets the music linger at a slow tempo before suddenly setting the listener and the crowd free at the 5:06 mark to the up-tempo phrase.      Track five is the highlight of the album, beginning with Daft Punk looping \\"Around the World\\" under repeated samples of a male voice whispering, \\"Machine.\\" At the 2:02 mark, \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" enters without a bass line. Thirty seconds later, \\"Around the World\\" is layered on top of the track for another thirty seconds before a strong bass punches in to mark the tempo and momentum of the song as the vocal sample endlessly repeats, \\"Around the World.\\"  The vocal line of \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" is then heavily manipulated using pitch-altered, syncopated clips to create a seemingly random but perfectly fitting section. In addition to changes in tempo, this song highlights the interesting use of loop layers--dropping out low end beats to make one focus on lyrics while taking a break from the punching bass or adding in the beat to once again drive the tempo.      With the highlight of the album coming less than halfway through, it is inevitably hard to keep up the almost euphoric mood. Beginning with track six, rather fittingly entitled \\"Burnin' / Too Long,\\" drawn out sections distract from the mood; the tempo is up and the overall Daft Punk sound remains, but compared to the hook and bass-driven sections before it, track six and some to follow may inspire the listener to make a break rather than continue on. Though very similar in sound, Daft Punk transitions into a slightly different style of electronic music which is smoother and less punchy overall. The one glaring exception to this style shift is track eight, \\"One More Time / Aerodynamic\\" which is much closer in style to the first five tracks.      Overall, Alive 2007 shows that Daft Punk has mastered live improvisation of computer music. Though much of the greatness of Alive 2007 was created prior to the performance in studio-made samples, the performance brings the music to life in a way the group's studio creations cannot. I highly recommend this album for any fan of technosonic music.

160094048X|4.0|I LOVED Vegan with a Vengeance and Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, so I was excited to get this book. Except for one minor critique in VwaV, the cookies and treats were perfect in every way. I used a Christmas gift certificate to purchase this.    I enjoyed the recipe for the healthy chocolate chip cookies. The dough tasted like regular cookie dough (for all you dough fanatics out there, like yours truly, that's awesome!) and the cookies were great. They weren't too sweet. They were great.    The chocolate chip chocolate oatmeal cookies weren't great. The dough was amazing, but the end result wasn't great. It was like eating dog treats. And for those who question my cooking skills, I tried making these twice, just in case I futzed up the first time, but I just think this is a doozie of a recipe. Oh well. There's plenty more recipes in this cookbook and I'll update my review when I try more (problem is, I'm trying to lose weight, so baking cookies is probably not going to help me fit into that Ginger Rogers-style dress I've been coveting!).

B0013NBBOW|4.0|Such a remarkable cult band, coming from the Canterburian scene: often in the vein of Hatfield and the North- as well as of the most experimental side concerning the versatile guitarist Steve Hillage (without regarding the interesting bassist Nick Greenwood-former Crazy World of A. Brown- and Dave stewart at his first turning point of his career as a keyboard player), this British line-up was important for the whole experimental scene in the UK...well not only for the long instrumental passages, but also regarding of the intelligent improvisation (do you remember the album \\"Rotter's club\\", by H.& the North?), Khan reached his peek of imagination and creativity as well, with \\"Space Shanty\\"...ok perhaps there are better albums within the Canterburian scene (witouth thinking of bands like Gong), but unlike these latter, here the features regarding the progressive rock style or the fusion rock music genre are much more present in comparison to their jazzy and psychedelic side...at the end the re-mastered version is well worth checking out at least for every prog listener and a must-have for all the Hillage's fans!
0393072231|1.0|I can't beleive there is no Kindle edition for this book available on the release date....but realistically I can believe it, but it stinks!!   Obviously this is a marketing plan or restriction by the Publisher W.W. Norton & Company.   I really enjoy Michael Lewis' work and was looking forward to downloading the book to my Kindle today and reading a few chapters before bedtime.  As a busy executive, I use my Kindle for all my reading #books, newspapers, magazines# and this situation with The Big Short is very disappointing.  I think from now on, if any book is not available on the release day in Kindle format I will Boycott and refuse to purchase the book at all...even if the Kindle version is released on a future date.  The Big Short is going to be the first one I Boycott.    I would suggest to the publisher and Amazon that a better strategy would be to simply put the Kindle edition at the same price as the hardback for the first month or two #or whatever seasoning period they want#, then lower the Kindle price later.  But make both editions available on the book release date.  I like getting the Kindle discount, but more importantly I use my Kindle to save time.    If other Kindle fans agree with me, please voice your opinion here and/or consider joining me with a boycott.      Thanks,  B. Dobson
B002LK3DUQ|3.0|Overall this was an OK movie. My husband and kids (age 6-13) liked it a lot. I liked parts of it. The beginning seemed like it was more for adults than kids. My husband and I had to explain it to our younger kids. The plot started to wear on me toward the end. It started to get pretty silly. But like I say, my kids loved it. I'm not sorry we bought it.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is so clean. No ugly wording or sexual scenes. I also thought the cinematography was beautiful and of very good quality. A movie all ages can watch. I have watched it several times and did not get tired of it, and that says alot for a movie produced today. It leaves with you a feeling of beauty and peace.  Renee Zellweger did an outstanding job protraying Beautrix Potter.   I am an artist, so naturally I enjoyed the drawing and painting scenes. Love those kind of movies.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD to help me lose about 40 pounds. I've done the exercises on and off for about a month. I recently did five days in a row and have to stop now for at least a day. I was really apprehensive about doing an exercise EVERY DAY with no resting period for your muscles but decided I would give it a shot since other people seemed to be able to do it. I am not someone who exercises regularly. Last night I developed painful shin splints. My calf muscles are very tight and I had a hard time walking last night. There is quite a lot of jumping and lunging involved. Also is hard on the knees.    This is definetly a workout that would help anyone lose some weight but I would caution anyone doing it that doesn't work out regularly. You might want to do it every other day.

B001F3FUK6|4.0|I´m a fan of this movie, but the BD isn´t that great. Video quality ain´t bad, but the photography of the film overall doesn´t make for a detailed Blu-ray experience, except in some external day time scenes. Audio on the other hand is excellent. Extras are the same of the 2-Disc DVD, so nothing new and the deleted scenes, unlike advertised on the back cover aren´t in HD. Overall I give this BD a 7/10.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|It isn't so much \\"an education\\" as it is a teenage girl's fantasy, and as such it doesn't go very far.  What was ostensibly Jenny's awakening pretty much becomes a period costume drama, capturing early 60s suburban London.  I thought Carey Mulligan was very good as Jenny but you found out little about the other characters, including her parents who seemed a bit too gullible for such prim and proper Brits.  Peter Sarsgaard adopts a disaffected attitude which seems to suit his character David, but not much to hang a hat on.<br /><br />There are many ways a story like this could have turned but in the end opts for a rather soft fall for young Jenny.  I would have thought a girl with her \\"smarts\\" wouldn't have been so easily taken either.  Palling around with David and his well-dressed friends would be good for a few kicks and set her above her classmates, but hard to imagine she was ready to throw her future away for this guy.  Molina and Thompson are little more than props in this movie.

I know better now, amazon first:)
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|Halloween never looked better than on this Blu-ray. Except for some softness in the picture in certain scenes where the background or some caracters look out of focus, the image is so sharp and detailed that is hard to believe this is a 1978 movie. And personally I don't care about the change in the color timing that caused a lot of debate on the internet forums. Sound is just ok, considering the source and the extras, while slim compared to other editions, are solid, like the commentary track and the featurette. I just wish the TV version was available through seamless branching. Anyway, I give this BD an overal score of 8/10.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Hard to fault this movie as it provides a very compelling portrait of the troops in Iraq, and with the use of hand-held 16 mm cameras certainly gives you the feeling of being there.  However, I found myself wondering why Bigelow chose to make this so exclusively a \\"boys' movie,\\" with no significant women characters and little feeling for the Iraqis except for the empathy Sgt. Will James felt for young \\"Beckham.\\"<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B00096S45I Gunner Palace]], The Hurt Locker is one for the soldiers serving in combat.  She takes you into their world, and makes you see Iraq through their eyes.  In this case, we follow a \\"bomb squad\\" as they defuse land mines around Baghdad and in one compelling scene venture into the desert where they come across some private contractors and soon find themselves under fire by insurgents.<br /><br />If you are looking for more in this \\"war movie\\" you will probably be disappointed as Bigelow chose to make this movie politically non-partisan, based more or less on Mark Boal's \\"embedded\\" stories from 2004, when he was a journalist in Iraq.  The movie lacks the inner struggle that is found in Chris Hedges' [[ASIN:1400034639 War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning]] which she references at the start of her movie with the phrase, \\"war is a drug.\\"
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana does it again with her saultry vocals and great music background.  Worth listening to over and over again.
B00013RC8O|3.0|I am not going to diminish this classic, however it is not as I remembered it back in the day when I saw it in the drive in in the 1970's... For some reason I thought it was going to be more along the lines of a \\"Smokey & the Bandit\\" movie with regards to the chases. You will have to remember that this movie is from the 1971 era and \\"Smokey & the Bandit\\" is in 1977. I did enjoy it to a point but was kinda slow for me in parts.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've spent the last 20 minutes reading through the 1-star reviews for Firefly on this website.  I was surprised to see so many people upset with the acting and the originality of the show, especially when these same people turned around and admitted to liking Star Wars and Battlestar.    Simply put, if you're a science fiction fan, you owe it to yourself to at least try this series, and the feature film based on it.  In a week's time, I watched all 14 series episodes and the movie and am now an official Browncoat (Firefly fan) for life.    The characters are all memorable and more importantly, likable.  Captain Malcolm Reynolds is an ex-Sergeant, who was on the losing end of a galactic civil war, and current captain of the smuggler ship Serenity.  His crew consists of a witty, but weak, pilot, a fun-loving mechanic, a mysterious Shepard, a fowl-mouthed muscle, a dedicated first-mate, and a brother and sister running from the Alliance (think Empire).    The basic structure of each show has the crew of the Serenity traveling around the galaxy from planet to planet, job to job, bad situation after bad situation.  It does borrow heavily from established Sci-Fi genre conventions, but it also adds its own twists to the formula, and every episode has several surprise moments that will make you smile or laugh out loud.  Joss Whedon creates an engaging universe complete with quirky characters, and he successfully combines Sci-Fi and Western genres.    To address the complaints I began this review with I have to admit the acting never really bothered me.  If you pay close attention it becomes obvious these were young actors who were still learning and proving themselves.  By the time Serenity came out I thought the acting was far superior to anything Star Wars ever produced.  Also, to call this show unoriginal and still admit to loving Battlestar, a show that is about robots vs. humans in a dystopian future, is a little absurd to me.  Everybody has their preferences, but mostof the negative reviews here seem to be a direct assault on the fans of Firefly, not the show itself.
0316044695|5.0|I have read several military books, all of which I have enjoyed (Shooter, Inside the Crosshairs, House to House, Marine Sniper, just to name a few). But this was by far the most interesting war book I have ever read, and I read the entire book within two days (not bad for a college student with multiple tests that week). The book was just captivating and simply hard to put down.     The first half of the book is somewhat a review for anyone familiar with SEAL training and Hell Week, but the writers found a way to make it very personal and interesting, tracing Mr. Luttrell's journey through BUD's. The writers take the reader on a first hand account of Class 226 and 228's training.     Slightly before midway through the book is when the writers begin the narration of Operation Red Wing, and I can honestly say I read the remaining 200+ pages nonstop. The account of that dreadful operation is simply amazing, and Mr. Luttrell's story got my heart racing at times, and had me tearing up in others. Just an amazing account of what happened and the men involved.     I can understand some reviews that say Mr. Luttrell uses the book as his soap-box against the \\"liberal media\\", and quite frankly the reviewers are correct. Although I agree with Mr. Luttrell to an extent on the issue, I did at times get a little frustrated hearing about the topic repeatedly.     But to be honest, this is such a minor detail in the book, and does not take away enough away from the books main purpose of telling the story of the brave men involved in Operation Red Wing and their heroics. Anyone who would give this book a one star rating for the political message in the book is out of their mind, and I truly believe that, because it is such a minor part of the book. Furthermore, anyone who claims the book is boring or written poorly, well I would love to hear some recommendations from you all, because it would have to be ONE HELL of an exciting book!    If you are interested in a story of modern warfare and the men who risk all conducting it, this is the book for you, I highly recommend it!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I looked up many record players that would quite satisfy me and from reading the reviews for this product, I knew it would do the trick. Fast Delivery and with a great sound, I was impressed. The directions were easy to follow, with a couple of troubles here and there but easy none the less. I had my doubts, but I came to grasps. I will revise this once, I can talk about durability and battery life, but as of now, the turntable works fantastic. As for the software, that necessarily on my mind, but it should probably work fine.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|Alice in Chains is capable of putting out better material and more hardcore than this release has to offer. This release is slightly disappointing.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Who doesn't remember with fondness the film, \\"Mary Poppins\\", It's almost a household name. What made this film so special was not only the cleaver casting of Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke; but the immortal soundtrack by the Sherman brothers. This 45th anniversary presentation of the film is as good as it gets. The visual quality is second to none and the sound just as it was in the cinema. It could have been shot today, that's how good this DVD is.   With the quality and care of the original filming, Mary is going to be around for many more generations to admire and love. Let's face it, there's a little bit of Mary in all of us. So step in time and step to the store and add it to your collection immediately.   Buy it!
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Clearly, he has learned so much since the last album, and in doing his other non-Blur related side projects (the chinese opera thing, the thing with the guys from clash... its all in here). This album has a more \\"oceanic\\" feel to it, the last one having more of a \\"post demon apolacalyse\\" feel.  That may not make a lot of sense if you aren't familiar with (or care about) the comic book mythology that goes with the band (its not necessary, like listening to an opera with no idea what the libretto says and no familiarity with the language its in) but if you are over 30... just listen to the music and enjoy.
1881273156|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a counselor. I/we ( my husband and I) found it to be enlightening. We passed it on to others who also enjoyed the book. Glad I purchased it!
0756405890|5.0|Short review: Well told story, pure and simple.    Longer review:  I read a lot of books.  I know, I know, a lot of other people do as well.  The genre I read is Sci-Fi/Fantasy.  For me, this covers a lot of things, from space opera to paranormal romance to epic fantasy and the young adult versions of these as well.  Despite my reading 4 or more books a week, I generally don't write reviews (as I generally don't like writing, period).  What I consider enjoyable, and what other people consider enjoyable, don't always mesh.  So believe me, when I write a review of a book (or anything else really) it has made a huge, lasting impression on me, either good or bad.    Pat Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind, is amazing.  The flow of the story, the way it comes across, just simply had me enthralled.  I have read other books which attempted to tell their story in a similar fashion, with the protagonist telling of his/her life.  It always seemed kind of gimmicky to me.  Actually, I had put off purchasing this book because of this.  Apparently, I just hadn't read the right story.  This is the way it should be done.  The characters in this book feel real to me because their actions and emotions are in tune with how I think they would act and feel.  Because of this, I invested emotions into these characters.    I won't go further into character depth, growth, or any of the other technical things which matter so much to some other reviewers.  I don't much care about those things.  This book was a great joy to read.  That is what matters to me.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|There are a number of great things going on with this disk. People will complain about animation style and how some of the stories are not technically canon. As someone who has read all the Halo books, I thoroughly enjoyed the disk. I could have done without Odd Man Out. Not really my style, but there were some interesting concepts in it. For me Origins I & II alone make this worth buying and the CGI for the Package was amazing!! I wish they would release movies like this.    My hope is there will be 30 - 60 minute movies released that follow Halo canon. A good start would be with some of the books that have been written. If you're a fan of Halo, you should be reading the books.
B0030B811Q|3.0|I admit I had slightly higher expectations for laughs, but it was a very Dawn of the Dead (original version) like movie. It had little to offer in the way of actual horror, but did a great job at spoofing the genre in the same way that the book \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" did complete with instructional narratives of the various \\"rules\\" to surviving the zombie apocalypse. A must see for hard core zombie fans, but I'm not sure everyone else would get much out of it.
1439148953|1.0|I should have known better when the cover boasts the author was \\"Twice Shortlisted for the Booker Prize\\". That is damning wth faint praise isn't it? Also, the many jacket reviews kept repeating the words \\"this is a quiet novel\\"...uh, YEAH. Quiet as in airless, boring, and shallow. Still waters do not run deep in this book. There were so many opportunities to explore the various story lines, culture/immigration issues, ethical tug of war issues, the city of NY in the early '50's......I kept waiting for one of them to click. The heroine was like a sleepwalker with her mouth hanging open. People told her what to do, and she complied in a sonombulent way. I was so desperate that when the Italian Tony love interest said his full name was Anthony Fiorelli I suppressed the urge to Google the name to see if he became a famous businessman or politician. ANYTHING to make this story bounce.     I agree with another review that this could have been a teen after- school special, NOT definitely compared to James Joyce!! What?
0670021652|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was also in great shape when i received it.
1932100660|5.0|This book along with The Engine 2 Diet changed my life.  After a dear friend of mine had a stroke at 36 years old, I decided that I needed to take a look at my own eating habits and health.  I picked up this book and The Engine 2 Diet.  After 28 days of following a vegan diet, I lost 15lbs, lowered my cholesterol 20pts, and my blood pressure 30pts.  I no longer have the mid-morning or mid-afternoon energy slumps like I used to when I ate dairy foods.  I can't tell you how much better I feel all day long because I do not eat animal protein or processed foods.  I know what you are thinking--how do you give up ice cream, steak, cheesecake?  It is easy once you realize how those foods make you feel right after eating them (tired, lethargic) and reminding yourself that consuming those foods can eventually lead to life-threatening diseases or even death.  Contrary to popular belief, I still enjoy food very much.  In fact, I think I may enjoy it now more than ever.  There are so many restaurants that cater to vegan diets and so many wonderful vegan cookbooks!! (The Conscious Cook, Skinny Bitch, The Engine 2 Diet, Quantum Wellness and so many more)    Stop making excuses for why you can't follow a vegan diet.  Trust me when I say that once you try it, you will feel so much better and your quality of life will improve so much that you won't even think about what you aren't eating...
B0002X314C|4.0|I listened to a few of John Legend's songs on Pandora internet radio.  I thought about downloading some to I tunes but decided to order the whole album.  I live in a small town with only a Wal-Mart and a grocery store, so limited exposure to other types of music, not just country.  Country is ok, but sometimes you want to hear about good things, not broken relationships.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Good design, good length, excellent quality, great price. If you need a cable that can take a beating though, get the braided cable, it will resist wear and tare better, for longer.
B000255LIY|3.0|When I was a kid, my high school put on a rendition of Henry V that I actually was pretty impressed with...until I happened to watch Kenneth Branagh's movie version and realized that my school's drama teacher had just lifted all the major elements straight out of that, and told his students to copy those actors' performances.  I never went to another school play after making the discovery.<br /><br />I have had a similar difficulty with Glen Close after watching this movie.  The O'Toole and Hepburn version is on my very short list of very fine movies, so it didn't take me long to discover that Close was just marking Katharine Hepburn's performance from beginning to end.  She did absolutely nothing original with the role.  I'm so disappointed in her!<br /><br />On the other hand, I must congratulate Patrick Stewart for creating a version of Henry II that is subtly but profoundly separate from Peter O'Toole's.  He's quite a different man actually: his words have different emphasis, his actions different motivations.  It must be very hard work to stay out of the shadow of such an excellent predecessor, as Close's failure demonstrates; but then again Stewart has had plenty of experience at this in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  I've never seen him in one of those roles, but will definitely try: I was that impressed with his work in The Lion In Winter.<br /><br />In the end I simply can't recommend this movie to others unless they have first seen the 1968 version so they will know what to be impressed with.  Also Stewart's and O'Toole's interpretations of Henry inform each other when experienced side by side, and together help round out a very complex fictional character.<br /><br />Oh, also this version is quite a lot better LOOKING than the 1968 one.  I'm thinking the costumers had actually been looking at some 12th century miniatures.  At least in terms of color.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This movie takes FOREVER to end. The near miss of every situation leaves me too frustrated. She doesn't speak up until the very end and frankly by then I don't give a ...... Extremely slow and I just don't think the movie shows enough previous history between the two leading up to me caring if they get back together or not. I haven't read the book, but feel it must be much more exciting. I fast forwarded the part at the end when she runs and runs and runs and runs...good grief!! It's almost comical.  The acting is good (thus 2 stars), the story is not.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|Midlake's Courage Of Others seeks to start a new religion. The music is bare-bones. Gone are the electronic touches of their previous music. There is very little drumming either. Just voice, (mostly) acoustic guitars and bass. There is an unsettling, neo-hippy underpinning to the whole aesthetic. There is really nothing to compare it to. Mount Erie is the nearest band I can think of. Also, Blue Oyster Cult's 'Don't Fear The Reaper'.    [DW]
B00288KNL8|1.0|I thought that this was a really weird movie. It was creepy, and reminded me of a bad dream that I couldn't wake up from. I almost left the theatre. I would recommend not buying this movie.
0441013597|5.0|Dune  Dune Chronicles Book One  By Frank Herbert  Non-Illustrated. 536 pp.  Ace, Chilton Book Company  (Ages 9 and Up)     By Justin Wang, HLW-3  Ms. H-C  2/16/10                 In the book Dune, Frank Herbert showcases his brilliant storytelling skills by narrating the story of Paul Atreides, son of the Duke of the planet Dune.  With Dune, Frank Herbert creates a sci-fi classic that will be remembered throughout the ages.   Herbert, a journalist, generally wrote short stories; however, he is best known for his sci-fi classics of the Dune saga.  Sadly, after he wrote Chapterhouse Dune, Frank Herbert died of a massive pulmonary embolism.  However, his death hasn't stopped Dune's success, and even after his death, Dune has left a huge impact on the science fiction community.   Dune isn't without its challenges; in fact Dune is a complicated and sometimes confusing book.  With the plethora of fictional words the book introduces, Dune is a book that is easy to get lost in.  However, readers who are not deterred by the daunting task of getting past the complicated plot and vocabulary, the reader will be pleasantly surprised.  The book's plot is engrossing and full of twists, and will keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat.  Besides the plot, the world of Dune is also wonderfully described, and the mysteries of the world awaken the inherent curiosity in the reader.   Personally, as a high school student, I found the book to be rather slow in the beginning, especially with the annoyance of annotations.  However, I decided to stick with the book, due to the fact that it fit the 500 page requirement perfectly, and I was blown away as a result. In fact, I ended up condensing all of my annotations into the first half so that I could read the rest of the book uninterrupted. Another nice thing about the book is that it appeals to fans of the fantasy genre too. Dune has overtones of fantasy that melds with fantasy lovers' preferences, resulting in a thoroughly enjoyableexperience.  In conclusion, the book Dune is a wonderful work of literary art, and will present an unforgettable story for any lover of literature.
031606792X|5.0|I just want to say that I love this book.  Contrary to some other people's opinions I like the fact the Bella and Edward has a baby together. Some people think that Meyer contradicted the story because vampires are not supposed to be able to have babies; however, Bella is not yet a vampire when she conceives.  In the previous books it only talks about two vampires not being able to conceive not a vampire and a human.     I don't want to spoil the story just incase someone is reading this review that has not read this book yet; therefore, all I am going to say is that I love the Happily Ever After of the book. I wouldn't change a thing.     On another note:  I hope the Meyer writes another book about the werewolves and the Cullen's bringing down the Volturi.     I can't wait to see the movie!!!!!!!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I like the video, and like the variations of the workout that they show for beginners. I do get a little bored with any video, but this one is more fast paced and not too long. It seems to do a good job keeping my attention.
0061766089|2.0|I'm not a good writer, so I'll keep this review informal.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book, but maybe because I'm a business literature junkie.<br /><br />Tim Brown, a self-admitted man of pictures, obviously has problems with words, and he didn't get any good help from the \\"editors\\". Brown should read his own advice about telling better stories and getting people excited about your idea.<br /><br />As he talks about using creative problem-solving skills to make better mops and to improve the airline checkpoint experience and to make kids brush their teeth more often, you gain a new appreciation for creative, open minded thinking, but you have no idea where to go from here.<br /><br />He does encourage companies to hire creative and out-of-the-box people and to give designers some space and some time (Think of  IBM's skunk works and Google 20%-free-time rule) but the he only practical application for individuals is to \\"notice the ordinary, and to think why manholes are round...\\" Come on.<br /><br />The book is certainly not boring. It was interesting to read, but it's like an average movie where you hope for that great catharsis which never comes...<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, he did give vivid examples in the cases of the Indian Aravind eye hospital and the cheap, disposable, irrigation systems they're using in developing countries. (Anyone could've come up with the Oral-B toothbrush idea. Sorry) but very little, if any, meaningful practical suggestions.<br /><br />This book brings too few specifics, too few examples, considering that non of us ever built a prototype. I want to know, for example, of what idea IDEO helped the TSA develop to increase understanding between their agents and the passengers, etc, etc, etc, etc,<br /><br />[To compare this book with another thinking-man's business book, Good to Great by Jim Collins doesn't have many stated practical suggestions, but he does provide you with an abundance of live, simple examples, which lets you expand on your own.<br /><br />I repeat, as an avid reader of business news and books, I understood most of what was not adequately explained, but this book clearly needs a rewrite - and I will buy the next version.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I was aware that our food industry is leading us down the path to disaster, but I didn't know how bad it was.  I've read things in books, but when you see it on the camera it makes it so much more real.    This movie touches on many problems in our food industry.  For example, genetically modified foods, how we may end up eating cloned animal meat if we don't speak up to congress and the FDA, how there are only a few companies controlling most of the food industry and how that power and money are influencing our government and railroading farmers, and of course, how inhumane these animals, and the workers who process them, are treated.      The most eye-opening things for me were: 1)if you feed cows grass for 5 days, they'll clean themselves of 80% of ecoli bacteria, but instead of doing that, industries \\"cleanse\\" our meat with AMMONIA, 2)policy makers and judges are not in bed with these corporations, they come straight from these companies to these very important political positions, 3)the USDA no longer has the power to shut down factories who repeatedly have tainted facilities, 4) corporations can now patent life and therefore can sue others for using/reusing their \\"seeds,\\" and will take farmers who don't use their seeds to court accusing them of this crime just to send a message, and/or to put this farmer out of business and in process these lawyer/companies are able to obtain EVERY BANK TRANSACTION that farmer has made in the past 10 years (I imagine the companies then go after the people with whom the poor farmer/seed cleaner has been in business).    What I found disappointing was the lack of information in this video, but it is a movie, not a mini-series.  As I said, \\"it touches\\" on these different issues, but there's much more to know - I guess the watcher should be smart enough to do more research and read some books.  I would've like have seen in this video, \\"why is corn so harmful to digest by animals AND humans? how can the stress these animals are in,especially before the slaughter, affect us? what happens to these small organic companies who get bought out by corporations but keep their \\"organic\\" identity? how exactly does a food become \\"genetically modified\\" and what may be the consequences to our health? how close are we (or are we already there) to having our food come from cloned animals? what other ways is the farmer, who's grass-feeding his beef, helping the environment/ecosystem?  are other countries running their food industry in the same way as us or does the US already control them too? how did Oprah win the fight against these monster food lawyers?    If nothing else, after seeing this video, I want to do MORE than just buy local and/or organic, I want to speak up and speak out against these monopolies and the politicians who support them - why aren't they considered monopolies!?! I like cheap stuff, predictability, and consistency just as much as the next person, but people have to use their head and ask, \\"at what cost?\\"  In this case, the cost is great - it's not just the environment, the animals, or our kids future, it's OUR LIVES at stake too - and that should appeal to even the most selfish individual.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I really love Jane Austen's books and I think BBC normally does an amazing job with the series. I have watched BBC's new versions of Emma and Sense and Sensibility and LOVED them. They are by far my favorite movies of the books. So I naturally thought Persuasion would be amazing too because BBC has been doing such a great job at updating their versions of the books. However, that is not the case. I found that this movies was way too short. I felt I had no idea what was happening. The story was jumping all over the place. I just don't understand why they didn't put the time into the movie and make it longer. We will watch a three, four, or even a six our movie/series because normally they are just that great!! What happened here?? I just don't know.
B000063DHK|5.0|Iron Maiden's first live album \\"Live After Death\\" was and remains by far the best of their live albums yet. It was released in 1985 after the highly successful and lengthy \\"World Slavery Tour\\" in support of the album \\"Powerslave\\". This live album sounds very good if you consider the year it was released and it passed the test of time easily as it remains a classic live album and Maiden's best in that genre. Only classics are included like \\"Run To The Hills\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" and \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". The tracks are from Maiden's first five albums, from \\"Iron Maiden\\" in 1980 up to \\"Powerslave\\" of 1984.Some of these songs never sounded better. The great thing about this remaster is that they included the 5 missing tracks that weren't included in the previous remaster due to do the length of the album which needed a second disc it now has and all now you can get the full album, and that's a great reason to get this album.<br /><br />The album starts out with Churchill's speech and never lets you go as Iron Maiden unlike many bands are terrific both live and in studio. Many songs on this album aren't on any other of their live albums like the 13 minutes epic \\"Rimes Of The Ancient Mariner\\". Add to that the fact that songs on this live album are mostly their best material and that the vocals, guitars, bass and drums all sound terrific. The lineup for this one was the classic lineup, consisting of bassist Steve Harris, vocalist Bruce Dickinson, guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith and drummer Nicko McBrain. Only classic songs as I mentioned, they play what I consider to be their best material on Live After Death.\\"Run To The Hills\\" sounds amazing here, it turned out to be possibly the best sounding track on the album. The energy of the band is great, they sound amazind and the result is simply wonderful.<br /><br />On \\"Live After Death\\" you get to hear Bruce Dickinson singing some of the Paul Di'Anno songs such as \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" and \\"Running Free\\" from their first self-titled album and \\"Wrathchild\\" from \\"Killers\\". He does those three songs pretty good but I believe that Paul does a better job on his songs and Bruce on his, but still its nice to hear and then compare and i really liked Bruce's version of \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". Plus I got to say the album's cover looks awesome, Maiden's mascot Eddie coming out of his grave is neat.Overall if you are a fan of Maiden you should already have this, if not its never too late. Its a must-have for the Maiden fan as he has to like this! I would recommend this live album instead of the 1990s one as that one is not that great and while it may not have better than sound than the more recent \\"Rock In Rio\\" it's a classic. This one is a classic and i give it the highest rating possible, five stars, definitely get this it's totally worth it!ed album and \\"Wrathchild\\" from \\"Killers\\". He does those three songs pretty good but I believe that Paul does a better job on his songs and Bruce on his, but still its nice to hear and then compare and i really liked Bruce's version of \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\".

This one is a classic and i give it the highest rating possible, five stars, definitely get this it's totally worth it!
B002RVZV9K|2.0|Because I don't care about the repercussions of negatively reviewing a popular movie: this film's organization was helter skelter and I feel as if I didnt learn anything more about the musicians featured creative processes, instead just rants about their obsession (the sound of the amplified guitar). Should have been more musician's stories, anecdotes, \\"remember when's\\", instead this flick was dressed up better than it was, much like the Edge's playing....(and what's up with Jack White's mini-me?)...Highlight of the film was a brief Meg White.<br /><br />Credit to Page and Jack White who between the 2 of them did get one thing right...in the end it all comes down to the blues; the blues (and its several style forms) is perfect, its agitated, anti-establishment, its sweaty and chauvinistic, its cathartic, its sex and violence, its free flowing-individualism is the basis of rock and American music in general. If I had to choose, I'd take 1 Lightning Hopkins record over the entire Led Zeppelin discography. Likewise, I would take one 5 minute performance clip of Son House doing his thing than this documentary.
B000I0QM04|4.0|It is always a pleasure to comment on a movie that is so entertaining.  From the outtakes in the Special Features, the actors looked to have had a great time during the filming.  The special effect are more enhanced in the Blu-ray format.  I have added this title to my special collection.  Bravo!
0307463745|1.0|I loved 37signals first book and picked up this one based on Tim Ferriss's tweet stating how good it was.  Well it's not that good at all.      Just read their first book and pass on this one!  You'll be glad you did!!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I absolutely love the Fringe TV show, and recommend this set to anyone who loves the show! I had no trouble navigating the menus. The set includes 7 discs of all the first season and bonus materials. The only thing I noticed that some people may not like, is that it plays from one episode to the next without going back to the menu, but it's easy to stop and restart if you need a break between episodes.
B001EYGOEM|1.0|I bought FEARLESS hoping Taylor Swift had gone to the next level.. but sadly, the cd is full of simple, teen-pop songs that really have no substance or timeless quality.  Let's all get real - Taylor is just another pop product that is today's flavor of the month... how can she be a \\"brilliant\\" songwriter when most of her lyrics feature lines like \\"I'm on the bleachers, you're on the dancefloor\\"... \\"he wore a grey sweatshrit to the prom\\", etc.  The fact that FEARLESS won a grammy for Album of the Year is an embarrassment to the entire music industry and a slap in the face to other talented country/pop artists, most notably Carrie Underwood (who is the total package: incredible voice, talent, power, grace, who sings about meaningful and emotionsl topics from \\"So Small\\" to the recent \\"Change\\" and Temporar Home\\").  Yes, I bought this cd like millions of others, but America is being duped into believing Taylor has talent, when in fact, she is really no different than Miley or Selena Gomez... a expertly calculated star appealing to young female fans.  The reason Taylor won't perform on the same stage (show) as Carrie Underwood is becaue she would be blown off the stage !!  One question: how can FEARLESS win Album of the Year when CARNIVAL RIDE did not... even though CR sold 3mm records, 5 #1 singles, and featuring an incredible variety of songs and styles all done perfectly.  This truly is a sad day in music but the real travesty is all those grammys cannot be taken back... go Team Underwood.

0307408833|4.0|I bought this book for a friend of mine's birthday. She's a vegan and has a passion for baking, so I thought it would be a good fit. But, as I left the store and was flipping through the pages, I suddenly got pangs of jealousy and even contemplated keeping the book for myself! But, I refrained, getting my own copy so my friend could enjoy more than a set of oven mitts for her birthday.    As someone with a sensitive stomach, this book was a long time coming for me. There's recipe after recipe for sweet and savory treats that I can actually eat without feeling like my body is trying to turn itself inside out. I love all the little stories behind each recipe and I'm a sucker for celebrity blurbs in cookbooks. Especially if it's Natalie Portman.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|True this album is a lot different than thier first and Demon Days, which I love, but this is truely an incredible album.  I didn't begin REALLY, REALLY enjoying this album until the 3rd or 4th time I listened to it, but I think that is the case with a lot of great albums. I bought the experience edition and the \\"making of Plastic Beach\\" DVD is pretty cool and the online extras r cool too.  What seems to be turning some off to this album is all the people he collaborates with but I think its what makes the album great.  When you watch the DVD and see all the work that went in and all the different people and instruments involved in this album, its truely amazing.  If you followed the other projects Damon Albarn worked on in between Demon Days and Plastic Beach, the sound he creates for this album makes complete sense.  It's hard to listen to other stuff after because it makes other music sound so simple and dull.  GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!    My Favorite Songs:  (Good Intro)  White Flag (Ridiculous Beat)  Rhinestone Eyes   Stylo  Empire Ants  Meloncholy Hill  Plastic Beach
B001F12J0C|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy was something my husband wanted but I figured I'd have to buy it one at a time.  I'm still pinching myself that I was able to get all three for the price I did.  Hands down best money I've ever spent.<br /><br />Each movie is its own masterpiece of action and suspense.  Unlike most sequels the movies just got better and better, and the Bourne Identity was outstanding to begin with.  The Bourne Ultimatum felt like a gift to fans from start to finish.<br /><br />We took three nights in a row and made watching a movie a night a date night.<br /><br />I look forward to the opportunity of doing this again.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|The movie, Kung-Fu Hustle, didn't strike me as something I would go and buy- but someone introduced me to the flick, and by the end of the first scene, I was hooked. Nothing is funnier than classic archetypes portrayed in the most animated way possible, over-the-top hyper-serious scenes that are peppered with the absurdity of the human need to be better than one's self. The characters, acted perfectly, are written to be likeable, bizarre, and even intrinsically identifiable. But the action, whether it be a gang slaughter at a police station, or a dance scene in the middle of a street, fits well with the wit of the play within the players. Had this been written as a non-comedy, I'd likely be horrified by every action- but as it is- it makes the idea of violence for violence sake a concept that only clowns and buffoons can master. Kung Fu Hustle is a film of martial arts mastery, high energy comedy, the twists of the human condition, and certainly a statement of the Haves and Have-Nots. Just a wild ride, escapism in its truest form.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I had seen this movie before at my one friends house and didn't really get a chance to pay attention to it, so i decided to buy it. I was suprised greatly at how great this movie really was. It was just remarkably scripted and the acting was extremely good, even when it was going over the top with it's dark humor (Like the cookies) and the out of this world violence. Really the only things I don't like about this movie is that it is drawn out in some places and the subtitles, not so much that it has them more like you have to be a speed reader to read it. The dvd itself arrived in great condition worked on three different dvd players. All in all it was a great movie and well worth what I paid for it. I recomend it to anyone who isn't faint of heart, enjoys a good story, and has a sick sense of humor.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|The product I ordered came to me on schedule and was exactly as   advertised.  I'm very happy with this transaction and would not hesitate to make a purchase through Amazon again.
B002QXIMY0|5.0|Luckily, I got this from the Amazon Marketplace cheaper then most stores and online vendors are selling it. I did not want to pay $27.99 for the reissue because I aready had the DVD. If you can find it for less I'd definately take it! The packaging is decent. I've seen better but it is cool and I always like digi packs. The bonus tracks are not great but as a completest I had to have them for my collection. The DVD is at least in 5.1 surround sound. Which is better then my original import copy of the DVD.     So, if you are a new fan and are not a collector or completest like msyself. I'd just get the regular version and enjoy the album for which is it amazing! If you are a collector. I'd suggest getting this reissue. Maybe you can ask for it for a gift for your birthday or Christmas. So, you don't have to spend the money again. Or use a gift card etc... You'll enjoy it. I did and I felt it was worth the money I paid for it.    Great album and I'm glad they reissued it. The remastering definately helped. I enjoy the new mix!
1400052173|1.0|In the very first chapter of this work, Henrietta Flacks and family members are quoted directly in settings and intimate conversations, but no sources are given. Without these substantiations it is fiction and cast doubt upon the credulity  of the rest of work.  And I so much looked forward to this material.
B00337KM2S|3.0|this was in interesting little film.it's basically about a guy(George Clooney)whose job requires him to live out of a suitcase for at least two thirds of the year.he flies around the country to different companies and tells people they been terminated from their positions with their company.basically he feels most at home on the road,so to speak.there's more to the story than that,but you'll have to watch the film if you want you know more.i thought the dialogue was clever and witty and the chemistry between the actors was good.and Clooney creates a sympathetic character.Jason Bateman really impressed with a small role.overall,i felt this was a breezy little film,with some serious moments.for me,Up in the Air is a 3.5/5
B001HN694K|4.0|I really enjoyed it!  There were all ages at the theater.  It was a very nicely put together combination of people and creatures. (I think you call it animatronics?)  While I remember the basic Alice story from years ago, I don't necessarily remember all the fine details to compare it to the original.<br /><br />The story begins with several businessmen discussing possible ventures when little Alice comes downstairs.  Daddy says, \\"Another nightmare?\\"  Alice affirms and daddy takes her back upstairs and tucks her back into bed after another dream of strange creatures with funny names.<br /><br />Fast forward 13 years.  Alice and Mom are traveling through the English Countryside.  Daddy has passed on to \\"the other side\\".  They are going to visit one of the business partners who also bought Daddy's share of the business.  Arriving at the partner's beautiful English country estate, Alice is paired up with their son Hamish and soon finds out that Hamish will ask for her hand.  Now, let me side step here for a minute.  Alice doesn't exactly seem all that thrilled with Hamish but he is breathing without assistance and the family has money.  Well-meaning relatives quickly point out, \\"Your face won't last forever,\\" which translates to \\"you had better grab some guy before you get ugly and nuts like Aunt xxxx.\\"<br /><br />While all this dialog business is going on, Alice keeps seeing a white rabbit in a topcoat with a stop watch. Hmmmm.  Finally, Hamish asks for Alice's hand in front of the whole gathering but she hesitates.  Thinking, \\"Do I REALLY wanna do this?\\" she spots the white rabbit again.  He is pointing to his stopwatch, indicating there is not much time left.  Alice excuses herself and runs off to follow the rabbit that no one sees but her.<br /><br />Alice soon falls down a hole. Down, down, down - landing in a locked circular room.  The key on the table isn't helping because it only unlocks a small doggie-sized door.  She finds some potion to drink that makes her small, and a cake to eat that makes her big.  You hear a male and female voice talking in the background saying, \\"You'd think she'd remember all this from the first time.\\"  She gets through the door and finds herself in a strange garden where a blue caterpillar is smoking a hooka pipe.  He is the \\"wisdom\\" guy.  As Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and other characters, there is discussion as to whether or not she is the RIGHT Alice.  A  mean-looking polar bear type creature chases her and her friends, as does a mean buzzard.  The mean creatures all belong to the Red Queen, as does the  \\"Jabberberrywalkie\\" (a dragon).  The Queen likes to behead anything and anyone who displeases her.  She has a frog beheaded for eating her fruit tart.  Every other word out of her mouth is \\"off with his/her head!\\"  (Fortunately, you don't see them beheaded.)<br /><br />Once upon a time, the land was beautiful, but the Red Queen, her warriors, and the mean creatures raged war and the dragon fried what was left of the land.  The \\"prophecy\\" was that Alice would return and slay the dragon, but this Alice is a peace-nic.<br /><br />We also meet the White Queen, who is the nice one.  Alice is actually supposed to steal this special sword, return it to the White Queen, become her Champion in the battle against the Red Queen, and then slay the dragon.  Oh, BTW, the Queens are sisters.<br /><br />I found the movie quite enjoyable.  Johnny Depp was absolutely wonderful, as always.  It amazes me how he made his character come alive!  He is very talented and was the real star of the movie.<br /><br />This is a nice story about facing fears, transformation, friendship, and about a young woman who is stronger than she thought she was.  There is also an underlying message to Alice that she is not a girl who has to take the first guy who comes along, especially when she has no special feelings for him.<br /><br />END OF REVIEW<br />_______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Do not read my last paragraph below unless you want to know if your children should see the show.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Is it for young children?

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I caught literally 20 seconds of this band on the Late Late Show, and the next morning got this album.  Beautiful music, interesting instruments, great lyrics, this band and cd has it all.  A bit of Irish folkiness, with a modern sound.  Fantastic rocking songs along with beautiful ballad type songs.  If you like James, Nizlopi, The Chieftains, Great Big Sea you will enjoy this.  My favorites are \\"Awake Your Soul\\" and \\"Roll Away Your Stone\\".  Fantastic to sing at the top of your lungs in the car.
0393072231|5.0|Mike Lewis has the gift for watching America and picking stories that are interesting to the public:  in the last ten years Moneyball (the effect of statistical analysis on baseball) and The Blind Side (Importance of Left Tackles in American Football and rescuing an impoverished athlete).  But his undying fame was Liars Poker, the story of Solomon Brothers Investment firm where he worked when 24 and made bonuses of about $200,000 without really understanding what he was doing.  Possibly the most interesting part of this book is the foreward where Lewis describes how he felt when writing Liars Poker Wall Street provided worthless value to the economy and it was just a matter of years before the market recognized this.  Unfortunately he was about 24 years too late.  Couple this with his closing lunch with John Gutfruend and you have a great bookend for closure.<br /><br />Now Lewis presents us with this bookend to Wall Street, how it universally missed the bad securities being issued backed by subprime securities destroying over $1 trillion in wealth.  And his vehicle for this exploration is not a complete rehash but rather documenting the very few people (he estimates fewer than 20) that recognized that market crash coming and profiting immensely, people like Michael Burry, a Stanford Medical student who left to manage his own Hedge Fund.  Actually there were many more than 20 people that knew this was coming.  I began giving speeches in 2004 on \\"The Coming Crash in Home Prices\\".  But these people he mentioned left conventional wisdom in believing that the subprime mortgages were worthless AND discovered the newly created tools to profit from them:  credit default swaps and the ABX index.  With the belief and knowledge these investors were rewarded handsomely whereas the rest of us suffered through a very downbeat market.  But they deserved it and in Lewis' upbeat writing style he conveys eloquently but simply how the decisions were made and how they profited beyond belief.<br /><br />There is one problem with this book.  The subject was just covered quite well in The Greatest Trade Ever by Gregory Zuckerman which was released in November 2009.  I've now read both books and there is an overlap.  Greatest Trade is a very fast read and tells the story well focusing on John Paulson.  This book doesn't delve on Paulson but does cover Michael Burry who was featured in the other book also.<br /><br />Since so many reviews seem to be more interested in giving their political view of this tragic occurence, I'm compelled to weigh in on this issue even though I know this will upset some politcally closed minds.  We must recognize if it was so easy to comprehend and solve we would have all profited in the manner these investors did rather than suffer through the last two years.  We wouldn't have had the meltdown that we had.  The smart people on Wall Street would not have overleveraged creating the steep downward ascent in destruction of wealth as we deleveraged.  Specifically, I'm startled how many people want to blame politicians and FNMA/FHLMC.  As a seller of $1 billion a year to these entities and some knowledge of their loss history as well as debating this issue with a former Vice Chairman of one of these entities who is a neighbor, it is shocking when you hear people talk of the subprime mortgages that FNMA/FHLMC owned.  Did they do some such targeted loans? Yes.  But half their losses came from their foray into Alt A loans.  Coupled with the drop in property value and low equity position (they were leveraged at an unsafe 30 to 1 ratio) their insolvency was guaranteed if there was a downturn.  Why were they not managing for this?  It wasn't politically motivated.  It was profit motivated.  Quasi-guaranteed by the govt. they could issue callable agencies, their drug of choice, and arbitrage this money into a higher yielding security which they did.  UNTIL the losses started.  With 3% equity/custion, the 30 to 1 leverage immediatelyworked against them.  Where were the regulators?  Where was management managing risk?  As the Vice Chairman said, the problem was property value drop.  Well, with much advance notice and concern, WHY WEREN'T YOU MANAGING FOR THIS?????<br /><br />With that as a background, let's approach the question of should there be a FNMA/FHLMC?  I believe there should be.  Exactly what do they do?  When they are not leveraging for earnings which BTW they started in the early 90s when loan volume dropped and they recognized they needed to do something else to \\"gin\\" earnings, they perform their intended function to make borrowing cheap for homeowners.  If there were no FNMA/FHLMC for the past two years 30 year mortgage rates for the last two years would not have been 4.25% to 5.25% but rather approximately 5.75% to 7.50%.  In addition there would have been a lot more balloon or adjustable rate loans.  Now, does America want this higher rate when an effective \\"NON-Profit\\" or govt. entity could maintain this function?  I think not and I think we need to recognize that the recovery would have been much slower if many people would not have had the availability of this lower cost money to buy homes and refinance to lower rates.  Enough with policy and now back to a conclusion.<br /><br />But Lewis' writing style makes this book and his credibility from having written Liars Poker and the unique perspective of having worked in the industry and left it will make this a big hit.  I strongly recommend this well written, important book.Where were the regulators?  Where was management managing risk?  As the Vice Chairman said, the problem was property value drop.

B000002I27|5.0|Many people will give credit to The Beatles for expanding the use of electronic music in new and exciting ways different from many other artists. And while this indeed may be the case, there are few bands - if any - that can match The Doors' mastery of electronic piano and organ. Whereas some bands use of electronic organs are only well known for certain songs, such as Procol Harem's use of the Hammond Organ in \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale,\\" Ray Manzarek's use of the electronic Rhodes Piano and signature Vox Continental organ is hauntingly unforgettable. This fact is no different in the album Strange Days, where Ray Manzarek's use of his electronic instruments, among other sounds, makes for a dark, melodious album that expands the repertoire of the band as well as the rock genre as a whole. Perhaps harkening to mid-1900s artists such as Karlheinz Stockhausen who combined elektronische musik with musique concrete, The Doors have numerous songs that sound much like the earliest electronic music of the 1900s.     When most people think of the birth of electronic rock, they usually think of the electric guitar. However, The Doors are largely defined by the music of the electronic pianos and organs. As they often didn't have a bass player, Ray Manzarek played a Rhodes Piano as a substitute, further adding to the electronic style of the band. Additionally, Ray Manzarek played the Vox Continental organ, which is the sound more closely associated with his music. Perhaps my favorite song of the album, \\"When The Music's Over\\", features the Vox Continental organ prominently, giving it the dark, bluesy tune associated with much of The Doors' work. Adding to the haunting melodies of the organ is the reverb of Jim Morrison's voice, giving the music the sort of spectral sound that attracted me to the music in the first place.            Though not as melodious as \\"When The Music's Over,\\" \\"Horse Latitudes\\" is certainly the darkest piece on the album Strange Days. Perhaps a nod to earlyelectronic music, no song emulates Karlheinz Stockhausen's mixture of elektronische musik and musique concrete better than \\"Horse Latitudes.\\" Though I do not know if this was intended by the band or not, it is apparent upon listening that this song greatly resembles the early electronic music of Karlheinz Stockhausen. With the crack of a whip, Jim's screaming voice, large gusts of wind, and bizarre electric piano, The Doors create a piece that develops like a crescendo into insanity. In my opinion, this is where The Doors truly stretched the limits of their music, and forever established themselves as psychedelic rock artists.            Though there may be other albums that feature more of Ray Manzarek's electronic organs and pianos, no album of The Doors expresses elements of early electronic music better than Strange Days. Using some of the early electronic pianos and organs, Ray Manzarek became a master of electronic keyboards to a degree that is still revered today. Employing techniques akin to those used by the early electronic musicians such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, The Doors defined themselves as perhaps the greatest artists to grace their genre. Thus, without the developments of early electronic music such as the Hammond Organ, elektronische musik, or musique concrete, there is no doubt in my mind that The Doors would not have reached the level of technological artistry that they were able to accomplish with this album.
B001GM28HO|2.0|Lady Gaga is just like every other pop star out there right now. She tries to be as weird as humanly possible and hopes that with the help of a whole lot of editing on the computer she can sell when all she really is, is a sell out. She goes so far to be different that she's just another wannabe playing dress up. As far as her music, Lady Gaga (I also hate the title she's given herself, it's so ridiculous) seems to have actual talent in the vocal area. Her downfall is that she relies completely on electronic editing to spice up every single one of her songs. You never hear this singer just sing. While some may say that the same is true for all singers nowadays, at least with other music artists you can still hear the basics of their voice and know how they sound and that they have true talent. With Lady Gaga you can only assume there is something buried beneath all of the metallic covering.    Oh, and in case anyone wanted to know, Lady Gaga's real name is beautiful and she should be using it but regardless here it is: Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.

0307271862|5.0|When I first ordered this, I did not notice it wasn't a Kurt Wallander book so I was disappointed when I received it, because I love Kurt Wallender, but gave it a try. It is a very global book taking place over a huge geographic area and over the space of over 130 years. There is a lot here! I decided to stop being impatient with the structure and just let it happen. Thus, as I neared the end, I was very sorry to see the book finish. The characters and the settings were all very vivid and there are several nail biting moments. As an American, it was nice to read without the American point of view or hardly anything to do with the Western world at all. Give this book a chance to unfold without second guessing the author and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I. I listened to the audio version, the reader is very gifted with accents, it really enhanced my enjoyment.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I'm currently running an AMD Phenom II X3 720 Black Edition. My case itself is NOT the best in cooling efficiency and I was running idle near 50C with the stock cooler that came with my CPU. With Prime95, the CPU would get past 70C and of course, the fail safe mechanism would kick in and shut down the PC. All this with NO overclocking.<br /><br />After much research, I happened upon the Cooler Master Hyper 212+. For the price and the reviews, this appeared to be the best buy for my money. Turns out, the reviews were correct. With the Hyper 212+, you get the following:<br /><br />- 120mm variable speed fan (pretty quiet at mid to low speeds, not bad at full)<br />- Heat sink with 4, count 'em 4, direct contact copper pipes. Oh, and this thing is pretty big.<br />- Small tube of thermal compound<br />- Mounting hardware<br />- Instructions (or at least, they resemble instructions)<br /><br />First off, as I state above, the heat sink is huge! You need to ensure you have a case that is at least 8\\" wide/tall for this thing to fit. As for instructions, you're best bet is to go to the Cooler Master website and watch the videos there because the printed instructions are not very clear on how to install the mounting hardware. You WILL have to remove the motherboard because the original mount must be removed. You then take the backplate and this will replace the one underneath your motherboard. You must ensure the insulation tape is against the back of the motherboard. Use the standoff screws and nuts to keep the backing plate in place.<br /><br />After that, the rest falls in place. It's just this first step that isn't very clear with the instructions. Also, depending on your motherboard, you'll want to ensure that the fan will fit and clear your memory if you have memory with tall heat sinks.<br /><br />Remember, do this with your board outside of the case because putting the retention plate/clip will require a screwdriver and because of the fins, you'll need as much clearance around the heat sink in order to ensure you can get the screws in correctly. Watch those fins too. They ARE sharp!<br /><br />Also, you need to fiddle with the retention plate/clip. The first time I tried to work with it, the only way it appeared that I could get the clip on only allowed me to mount the heat sink where the fan would be sucking the air up towards my power supply rather than to the back of my case.

0393072231|5.0|Based on reading Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and Moneyball, I wondered whether The Big Short would prove to be entertaining and informative.  If you've read some of Lewis' books, you might agree that the \\"entertaining\\" part would seem to be a reasonably safe bet.  It turns out, it is.  The Big Short is fast-paced, straightforward, conversational and salty--very much like his earlier works.  Indeed, if you didn't know Michael Lewis had written this book, you could probably guess it.  It is easy reading and very hard to put down.  In short (no pun), The Big Short doesn't disappoint in being entertaining.<br /><br />In a sense, this book is similar to Moneyball in that Lewis tells his story by following a host of characters that most of us have never heard of--people like Steve Eisman (the closest thing to a main character in the book), Vincent Daniel, Michael Burry, Greg Lippmann, Gene Park, Howie Hubler and others.<br /><br />How informative is the book?  Well, it may seem that Lewis has his work cut out for himself, since the events of the recent financial crisis are already well known.  More than that, lots of people have their minds made up concerning who the perps of the last few years are--banks and their aggressive managers, \\"shadow banks\\" and their even more aggressive managers, hedge funds, credit default swaps, mortgage brokers, the ratings agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed's monetary policy, various federal regulators, short sellers, politicians who over-pushed home ownership, a sensationalist media, the American public that overextending itself with excessive borrowing (or that lied in order to get home loans), housing speculators, etc.  The list goes on--and on.  Okay, so you already know this.  The defining aspect of this book, however, is that it asks (and answers) \\"Who knew?\\" about the impending financial crisis beforehand.  Who knew--before the financial crisis cracked open for everyone to see (and, perhaps, to panic) in the fall of 2008--that a silent crash in the bond market and real estate derivatives market was playing out?  Indeed, the good majority of this book addresses events that occurred before Lehman's failure in September of 2008.  In describing what led up to the darkest days of the crisis, Lewis does a good job helping the reader to see how the great financial storm developed.  All in all, this is an informative book.<br /><br />Interestingly, in the book's prologue, Salomon Brothers alumnus Lewis explains how, after he wrote Liar's Poker over 20 years ago, he figured he had seen the height of financial folly.  However, even he was surprised by the much larger losses suffered in the recent crisis compared to the 1980s, which seem almost like child's play now.<br /><br />For a taste of The Big Short, Steve Eisman was a blunt-spoken \\"specialty finance\\" research analyst at Oppenheimer and Co., originally in the 1990s, and he eventually helped train analyst Meredith Whitney, who most people associate with her string of negative reports on the banking industry, primarily from late 2007.  Giving a flavor of his style, Eisman claims that one of the best lines he wrote back in the early 1990s was, \\"The [XYZ] Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution--it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment.\\"  His own wife described him as being \\"not tactically rude--he's sincerely rude.\\"  Vinny Daniel worked as a junior accountant in the 1990s (and eventually worked for Eisman), and he found out how complicated (and risky) Wall Street firms were when he tried to audit them.  He was one of the early analysts to notice the high default rates on manufactured home loans, which led to Eisman writing a 1997 report critical of subprime originators.  Michael Burry (later Dr. Michael Burry) was, among other things, a bond market researcher in 2004 who studied Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, and who correctly assessed the impact of \\"teaser rates\\" and interest rate re-setson subprime loans.  In 2005, Burry wrote to his Scion Capital investors that, \\"Sometimes markets err big time.\\"  How right he would be.<br /><br />Greg Lippmann was a bond trader for Deutsche Bank, who discussed with Eisman ways to bet against the subprime mortgage market.  Before home prices declined, he noted, for example, that people whose homes appreciated 1 - 5% in value were four times more likely to default than those whose homes appreciated over 10%.  In other words, home prices didn't need to actually fall for problems to develop.  (Of course, home prices fell a lot.)  When Lippmann mentioned this to a Deutsche Bank colleague, he was called a Chicken Little.  To which, Lippmann retorted, \\"I'm short your house!\\"  He did this by buying credit default swaps on the BBB-rated tranches (slices) of subprime mortgage bonds.  If that's not a mouthful, read further in the book for a description of Goldman Sachs and \\"synthetic subprime mortgage bond-backed CDOs.\\"  Then there's the AIG Financial Products story, told through the story of Gene Park, who worked at AIG, and his volatile boss, Joe Cassano.<br /><br />Did I say this book is informative?  Here's a bit more:  Did you know that a pool of mortgages, each with a 615 FICO score, performs very differently (and better) than a pool of mortgages with half of the loans with a 550 FICO score and half with a 680 FICO score (for a 615 average)?  If you think about it, the 550/680 pool is apt to perform significantly worse, because more of the 550 FICO score loans develop problems.  Think about how that got gamed.<br /><br />There's more, but hopefully you've gotten the point.  This is a very interesting, entertaining and informative book that accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Chances are you'll enjoy it.

B0007O38XU|4.0|i thought the imaging is much better than it was on vhs and the price was great too. This movie is much better to have on dvd.
0061703257|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of seeing a movie based on a book before reading it, but this book doesn't disappoint if you've seen the movie. It's incredible twists and turns leave you turning the page till you reach the end. The ending causes you to turn back to the first page and read it again. I purchased this book 2 weeks ago, and I have already read it 2 times and working on the 3rd. It seems to get better and better the more you read it. A friend of mine has also been reading it along with me which has led to numerous nights of strictly talking about this book we like to call Shutter Nights. I would recommend this book to anyone. If you like to really think about what you're reading, and want a book that will leave you guessing til the end then this book is perfect for you. It's mind blowing plot lines and likable characters leave you coming back for more.

1400052173|5.0|This book is excellent on so many different levels.  It is the fascinating, true life story of a family living in an era gone by as well as a book that makes you stop and think about the moral dilemmas intrinsic to scientific advancements as well as the immorality of racism.  The author is obviously personally involved but a factual reporter.  She doesn't preach but leaves it to the reader to examine issues that we rarely think about.  I read this book in a day and couldn't put it down.
B001JNNDBA|2.0|Just a bit of math.  A blu-ray disc holds around 50 GB of data.  Movies that take advantage of the space are the ones that generally look better. This Donnie Darko Director's Cut puts both theatrical and Director's versions separately onto ONE disc, cutting the amount of space available for each in half. The result:  Neither cut looks better than a standard DVD. The image quality is soft to the point where film grain is barely even visible, and detail is poor, except in the occasional closeup.<br /><br />I didn't actually watch the Directors cut until I bought this version recently, and didnt understand what the hub-bub was about.  The sound mixing in the DC is downright awful in places where changes have been made.  Most of the sound changes involve fading out the (excellent) score by Michael Andrews and putting loud sound effects in their place.  Extra material in scenes adds some slight character padding that portrays Donnie in a somewhat less sinister light, which the removal of some of the music seems to want to suggest, too.  There's nothing wrong with that, but a big part of the film's charm is the mood it evokes, and the score is a big part of it. Cutting it down just makes the tone of the film even harder to get a hold of, if that's possible...<br /><br />The bonus disc contains a filmmakers journal, which will certainly interest film buffs, a documentary called 'they made do it too' about people who really liked the movie talking about how they liked the movie, and #1 fan: A Darkomentary (which I didn't watch).<br /><br />The Philosophy of Time Travel book that was included in the original DVD is sadly not included here.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the film, and even liked Kelly's Southland Tales (which was a good blu-ray, if not a great movie), but I can't recommend this release... it's just meh.<br /><br />If they re-release the theatrical cut as a standalone with a better transfer, I'm down.
0393072231|1.0|Yes, we kindle users certainly got \\"The Big Short\\" on this title.   It's really unfortunate.   Kindle users take note, the Publisher is W.W. Norton and this decision to not publish a kindle version highlights that greed is not limited to the banking industry.

0312330537|3.0|This book reminds me of another cinder block epic about a heroic white guy in an eastern country, that book being Shogun. Both were full of new discoveries, strange worlds, and various epiphanies about life and how others view it and live it. Additionally, both were heavy on clich&eacute;s, white heroes in foreign lands, and disappointing endings. Not coincidentally, Gregory David Roberts' massive roman &agrave; clef left me with the same mixed feelings I had for Clavell's door stop. Most of the less favorable reviews have harped on the same points: the book is far too long, Roberts' style can be painfully verbose, tedious, and sophomoric, and the character Lin becomes increasingly more unsavory and his exploits less believable to sustain the reader's interest.<br /><br />Specifically, Roberts rambles on so often and for so long that what are initially very observant and occasionally poignant passages, soon morph into tiresome philosophical ramblings that are reduced to fortune cookie pabulum due to their constant infusion in the text. Further, the main character Lin is a sympathetic hard-luck guy in the beginning, but by the midpoint of the story he has turned into a Hollywood action hero and Roberts/Lin is compelled to constantly remind us of how amazing his life story has been and how selfless, understanding, courageous, thoughtful, and thoroughly bad-ass he is. Even when he tries to play up his weaknesses; the self-doubt, the abandonment of his family, his addictions, etc., it's remarkably devoid of lessons learned. This is not a tale of redemption despite what Roberts intended, but rather an unending fish tale.<br /><br />Despite the faults, however, the story does read pretty well at times. He paints a vivid and enticing portrait of India, an even more remarkable job considering the parts of that country where much of the story takes place. As has been widely agreed upon, the first third of the book is very engaging. I would've loved this book if it had simply stopped after he set up his slum infirmary, but unfortunately, that's not even half way through. Make no mistake; he has indeed lived a stunning life. Merely reading the back cover will have your jaw drop a little. And yet, that's the problem. Roberts' ego and fascination with his own life refuse to yield to editing and that's where this book fails the reader. He cashes in the goodwill he spent several hundred pages cultivating and, by the end, I felt his character had long overstayed his visit and had now become a self-aggrandizing boor. What could've been something special and life-affirming ended up leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. I felt emotionally betrayed by the author. To spend so much time cultivating a beautiful flower only to piss on it is a huge waste.<br /><br />It's hard to recommend a book that is nearly a thousand pages long because the investment needed is so great. It's one thing to read a novel of a few hundred pages and find out you didn't care for it. It's quite another to spend hours and weeks and perhaps months trying to get through a book that doesn't have that much to say and could've easily said it with far fewer words.his slum infirmary, but unfortunately, that's not even half way through.

0738702994|5.0|I resonate strongly with Celtic and Arthurian or Welsh mythology, and this deck is full of images that touch me and speak to my soul.  I have to agree with one reviewer however that the deck's images of the Major Arcana have a stronger impact than the images of the cards of the Minor Arcana -- the latter seem a little too plain, not adequately inspired. I think the whole deck would have been stronger and more inspiring if particular characters or elements of Welsh myth had been chosen for the Minor Arcana too, not just the Major Arcana.   I enjoyed the extracts of Welsh mythology which do accompany the Major Arcana.  Unfortunately I didn't think the meanings that were provided for any of the cards, major or minor arcana, were up to the par of the imagery in terms of their psychological or mythical depth.  The interpretations/meanings were actually quite disappointing, more what you'd expect from a book such as an \\"Idiot's Guide to the Tarot.\\"  For a deeper, more profound interpretation of the cards, I'd go to Rachel Pollack's 78 Degrees of Wisdom.  However, whenever you have a deck with well-done,powerful images that move you and speak to your particular soul and your own personal mythology, like this deck does for me, you might actually find that the cards inspire you to come up with your own interpretation as you let the Tarot's magic work through you....
B002XMGGK6|4.0|I gave Law Abiding Citizen four stars because I thought the movie served its purpose as it entertained me for an hour an a half. Unlike other movies, I felt very indifferent  about it. I didn't have any desire to see it again but I didn't hate it. It just kind of happened.     Part of the problem is the characters in the film. You are meant to feel sympathy for the Gerard Butler character yet there's no real explanation as to how he became the monster that he is in the movie. His family gets killed but his actions resemble that of a sociopath who felt no remorse at all for his actions. Jamie Foxx's character is also flawed. He's not particularly likable and you don't get behind him like you would for another other protagonist. It was hard to believe I was watching an Oscar winning actor at times. The rest of the supporting cast are bland and I didn't feel much for them when they met their demise.      The plot is generic but well paced. I'm glad it didn't go two hours for I would definitely have lost interest if it had run much longer. The resolution is ok, but doesn't make too much sense. The movie is one big shot at the legal system but the resolution is not plausible in today's world.     I would not recommend purchasing this movie. It's worth one watch if you have nothing else to do and if you are a fan of Jamie Foxx or Gerard Butler, but you will not feel the need to see this movie again. Nothing in it really stands out that would make it an excellent movie and that is where it falters.

0316010669|5.0|When I was a young man there was late-night disc jockey in Chicago by the name of Sid McCoy who played a lot of Frank Sinatra recordings. He often referred to Sinatra as The Master Story Teller, because Frank's respect for the lyrics and his phrasing were so exquisite that he made you really feel the emotions the songwriter was attempting to convey.<br /><br />In my opinion, when it comes to non-fiction books, Malcolm Gladwell is The Master Story Teller. In \\"Blink\\" he uses his talent for conveying stories, studies, and arguments to help us understand a magical, mysterious thing called judgment.  And he asserts that judgment is important because it is what separates winners from losers.<br /><br />Early in the book Gladwell explains that \\"Blink\\" is concerned with the very smallest components of our everyday lives - the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress.<br /><br />He uses a phrase in psychology, thin-slicing, to explain that human beings are often capable of making sense of situations based on the thinnest slice of experience.<br /><br />Gladwell's primary goal for \\"Blink\\" is to accomplish three tasks: 1] To convince us that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as those made cautiously and deliberately. 2] Assist us in knowing when we should trust our instincts, and when we should be wary of them.  3] Convince us that our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.<br /><br />The book is replete with fascinating stories and studies that help Gladwell accomplish these tasks.  One that I found particularly enlightening, and should be read by every medical doctor, is a revelation about why some doctors are sued for malpractice and others aren't.  The answer has nothing to do with the medical skill or training of the physician, but everything to do with the doctor/patient relationships.<br /><br />It seems that patients don't sue doctors whom they like.  In fact, one patient cited chose to sue her internest, even after being informed that it was the radiologist who was potentially at fault.  Why?  Because she liked the radiologist, and didn't like the internist. I can relate to this because my wife could have sued a doctor for malpractice but chose not to because she liked him.<br /><br />Related to this is a study described in this book that utilized a mere 40 seconds of recorded conversations of surgeons talking with patients.  In these recordings the exact words spoken were filtered out, leaving just the intonation, pitch, and rhythm of the doctors voice but not the content of the conversation.  From this judges rated slices of the remaining garble for such qualities as warmth, hostility, dominance, and anxiousness.  From that alone it could be determined which surgeons got sued and which ones didn't.  Stunning.<br /><br />There is much more I'd like to share about \\"Blink\\" than space allows.  If this review captured your interest, by all means read the book.<br /><br />One last item:  Sid McCoy, who also gave the great singer Nancy Wilson the nickname, \\"The Baby\\" went on to become the executive producer of the hugely successful TV show,  \\"Soul Train.\\"seems that patients don't sue doctors whom they like.

0618477942|5.0|When I was in college a professor assigned the book \\"MAUS\\" for us to read.  I think it was the first graphic novel that I'd ever picked up out of a comic shop.  I didn't really know what to expect other than an easy A.  The A wasn't easy and MAUS changed my perceptions of what a comic book / graphic novel could be.  Our next assignment was Barefoot Gen; I knew by then that it wouldn't be a fluff book.    After that class I've always looked for graphic novels that really push the envelope.  Comic Books tend to have sameness to them, enjoyable but there is a stereotypical sameness.  People don't call them \\"men in tights\\" for no reason.  A recent Pod cast (I forgot who actually) mentioned Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic by Alison Bechdel affectionately so I picked it up.      \\"Fun Home\\" is an autobiography that centers on Alison's growing up and the issues within her family.  Her mother seems to have given up.  Alison's father is home obsessed; Better Homes & Gardens would blush.  Her siblings are present.  Everyone in the Bechdel family is doing their own thing; their worlds rarely cross except for breakfast.  At first the dark tone started to make me regret this purchase, but after a few pages it doesn't seem so dark.  I guess when your standard is depressing even the little flecks of humor.  But those flecks stick and \\"Fun Home\\" actually becomes a kind of sober, fun book.  I was equally impressed by the way that Alison discusses gay themes without coming across as preachy or titillating.  The storyline of sexual orientation is handled with respect and done well.  It's central to the book, but not in a butch-beat-to-the-head sort of way.    One of the great themes of \\"Fun Home\\" is the baton hand-off between two generations.  Alison Bechdel and her father are two distinct generations, but similar in ways only a father and daughter can be.  I think for this one point, \\"Fun Home\\" is a massive achievement and reaches a high standard in comic book storytelling.  It's a rarebook that will resonate with you for years to come, truly deserving a place on your shelf.    For anyone unfamiliar with graphic novels, \\"Fun Home\\" is a great starting out point.  A very accessible book, Bechdel's autobiography will dispel all stereotypes that you may have of the medium and maybe people.  When done well, the mix of art and prose can give you an experience that no painting or novel can.  \\"Fun Home\\" is done very well.
1577314808|5.0|This is one of the most profound well-written books I've ever read. However, I'm having difficulty writing a review without feeling I am doing the author and you an injustice.  It's a little like trying to summarize a beautiful poem.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way I can convey the essence of this work is by sharing some of the many interesting points Eckhart Tolle makes in \\"The Power of Now.\\"<br /><br />Early on he states that you are not your thoughts.  It is not so much that you use your mind wrongly...you usually don't use it at all.  It uses you.  He insists that the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is to learn to dis-identify from your mind.<br /><br />Tolle explains that you are not the possessing entity - the thinker.  Knowing this enables you to observe the entity.  The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of intelligence becomes activated.  That's when you are in touch with the real you.<br /><br />He urges you to start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can.  That is what he means by \\"watching the thinker.\\"<br /><br />He says the mind itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool.  Dysfunction sets in when you seek yourself in it and mistake it for who you are.<br /><br />Now we get to \\"The Now.\\" ...  He points out that the present moment is all you ever have.  There never is a time when your life is not \\"this moment.\\"  So the only place where true change can occur and where the past can be dissolved is the Now.  Furthermore, it is impossible to have a problem when your attention is fully in the Now.<br /><br />Tolle goes on to offer compelling, valuable insights on worry, happiness, forgiveness, and the importance of conscious breathing.<br /><br />The profundity and value of this book will probably make you want to reread it often to fully absorb, appreciate, and use the amazing power of Now.
B001UW58YK|4.0|Video and sound quality was amazing. You really do have to watch this with surround sound. I don't have the best sound system (just one of those HTIB's (home-theater in a box)), but it was still awesome nontheless. Also, invest in a HDMI cable (I found one here on Amazon for less than $5) and the difference it makes is worth more than the $5+shipping.     As far as the concert itself, the song selection was pretty good. There were a few times though that he was talking a bit too much and he somewhat lost my attention. Overall, a decent show.
0307460444|2.0|I purchased this cookbook with high expectations and am now left utterly deflated.  After following the devil's food recipe exactly, I was left with a cupcake that fell apart and would not come out of the cupcake liner.  After rereading the recipe, I noticed that there was not a spot with a high altitude adjustment recommendation.  Living at 6000 feet, such a recommendation would have been helpful and would likely have saved my cupcakes.  I find it appalling that Ms. Stewart does not have a high altitude recommendation for ANY recipe in the cookbook--even my Betty Crocker cookbook has general adjustment suggestions, but nary a one in Ms. Stewart's.  Totally disappointed in the book, the cupcakes are pretty though.
0393072231|1.0|One of the most mediocre books i've read in a long time. And I thought Liar's Poker was spectacular.
0307588335|5.0|I am only through Charter 5, but have to say that this book is far more educational and interesting than Alan Greenspan's Age of Turbulence.  You can feel from the tone of the book Larry McDonald's passion and desire to share his knowledge and experience with the general public so that we won't make similar mistakes again in the future, and also his willingness to reveal facts and honest views.  I am also very impressed with the depth of his knowledge over the situations, and it's very easy to follow.     A friend (successful equity trader) I respect told me that this book might be the first book that reveals some insightful insider information since Liar's Poker.  Although I haven't read Liar's Poker myself yet, I am so glad that I picked up this book- it definitely beat my expectations, and now it makes a lot more sense as to why things happened the way they did.
B001P3SA94|1.0|I was delighted with the early arrival then schedule of this DVD. However I didn't enjoy it at all. I was hoping to here the original songs of Etta James and the acting wasn't that good either, which made for a boring movie.

B00328G4V6|4.0|jimi hendrix,s valleys of neptune is an interesting and fairly decent release.the first time i heard it i thought well...it,s okay.but the more i listen to it the more i like it.valleys of neptune,s tracks have a different sound than anything the jimi hendrix experience did bettween 1967 and 1968.most of the tracks on this cd jimi hendrix recorded bettween 1969 and 1970.during late 1969 and the early months of 1970 jimi hendrix began recording what he wanted to be another double album [after his first master piece double album;electric lady land in 1968] that was to be titled ;first rays of the new rising sun. however sadly during the recording of first rays  jimi died before the album was completed and for many years after his death some of the tracks from the rays session would be released on various albums with various titles.until 1997 with the first remastering of jimi,s catalog.the 1997 remasters still sound great to me but the 2010 remasters are equally great.  a few of the tracks on valleys of neptune were recorded by the experience line up and were the last recordings with experience bassist noel redding before he left and billy cox was brought in to play bass.for me the best tracks on valleys are;red house,valleys of neptune,crying blue rain,hear my train a comin,sunshine of your love,lover man,bleeding heart and mr badluck. as a hendrix fan i like it.if you want a good demonstration of what a versatile songwriter and and guitar master jimi hendrix was this album shows these two traits off well!
B0031OCY2E|4.0|... that mega-corporations are not on YOUR side. Their purpose is to \\"redistribute wealth\\", from your wallet to their coffers, and not so freely to share-holders as to upper-level management. An alternative moral might be that the folk who manage mega-corporations are just as likely to be megalomaniacs and/or sociopaths as anybody else... as any elected politician, for instance... and just as likely NOT to be as smart as they think they are. Specifically, the tale told in the film \\"The Informant\\" exposes the arrogant greed and criminal indifference to the public of a very real, very large American corporation, Archer Daniels Midland, the giant of producers of corn products. The fate of one rather bizarre real-life character ... Mark Whitacre, played to the hilt by Matt Damon... should not completely distract the viewer from noting that ADM was proven guilty of price-fixing, illegal accounting practices, and other forms of \\"gouging the public\\", for which enormous fines were imposed and several executives sentenced to brief prison terms. Now, fining a corporation that is publicly \\"owned\\" by stockholders could be considered self-abuse, no better than an insidious form of taxation since you can be sure that the fine will be recouped from the public through the private industry form of taxation called \\"higher prices\\". So, however you write the script, it IS obvious that ADM and other mega-corporations consider themselves above the law, and operate accordingly whenever they can.<br /><br />But meanwhile, back at the mansion... back at the \\"entertainment\\", that is ... this Mark Whitacre is a very weird dude. He's legendary as the \\"highest ranking corporate whistle-blower\\" in American business history. You can read about him on wikipedia. His real-life story is so well known that I can't consider telling it as \\"spoiling\\" the movie ending. In both real life and in this film, Whitacre cooperates with the FBI in gathering evidence of ADM's price-fixing, over the course of several years. Whitacre's motives are another matter, and that's where the film becomes \\"art\\" rather than documentary. In real life, ADM fights back, with the outcome that Whitacre's own fiscal malfeasance is revealed. Whitacre ends up \\"in hot water\\".<br /><br />The film Whitacre is either unfathomably foolish or mentally imbalanced. Matt Damon plays him as the former slowly evolving toward the latter. At first the man seems strangely naive for someone in such a position. He describes himself as a scientist befuddled by the 'culture' of management. He certainly appears well-meaning, a sweet family man out of his depth among hard-headed bosses, a manatee swimming with sharks. Rugged Matt Damon deliberately gained some thirty pounds of suet for the role, and he walks/talks/stands like a podgy nerd. This sympathetic man of integrity, however, slowly lies himself into trouble. In fact, he can't control his mouth. Is he a pathological liar? Or is he so sure of his own charm and plausibility that he can't be bothered to distinguish between truth and lies? The film script raises the possibility that he suffers from a \\"bipolar\\" disorder, but that's utterly unconvincing, given Damon's portrayal. Damon's Whitacre shows none of the diagnostic signs of being bipolar. His affect and his actions would be more characteristic of a sociopathic personality disorder, for which pharmaceutical psychiatry has no effective treatment. In any case, he's not a guy to be trusted. Mild and disarmingly boyish as he is, he's actually a crook, as greedy and egocentric as any mobster but operating within the culture of corporate capitalism. It's not ethical standards that separate the ADM portrayed in this film from the usual Hollywood crime syndicate; it's the size of the operation. One might well ask whether \\"Hollywood\\" is presenting a fair picture of corporate America or a prejudicial distortion. In fact, one ought to ask that question, I think. But perhaps, as usual, I will be chided for trying tofind something meaningful in a mere entertainment.<br /><br />Damon's portrayal of Whitacre is the entertainment here, the whole point of \\"The Informant\\". The film is not as funny, in my opinion, as the promotion claims. It starts slowly; the first half-hour could fairly be called dull. Then, as Whitacre's 'identity' starts to tangle and snag like snarled fishing line, the story becomes perversely fascinating. You started by feeling anxiously protective of that fresh-faced babe-in-the-woods, and you slowly come to realize that you've been \\"had\\" by him, bamboozled, conned just as badly as the FBI agents who trusted him. By the end of the film, it's only his loyal, gullible wife who believes in him.<br /><br />The real Mark Whitacre is the subject of ongoing controversy in the USA, with some people maintaining that he was a genuine hero who got a bad rap from the big bad government, while others regard him as another example of the corruption of wealth. Hey, I get to avoid a \\"spoiler\\" after all, by not choosing which image the film portrays!meaningful in a mere entertainment.

B003A9OVS0|4.0|Plastic Beach is a Good album.  It is a different album than Demon Days in that it's not as rock heavy.  This album is full of synths and harder pounding beats.  This album doesn't include an \\"O' Green World\\", my favorite Gorillaz song, but that's fine as there are many stand out songs.  I like that the rappers are respectful with no swears and they stay on Topic with the Album Theme which is well Water, Islands, Ships, etc.      My fav's:    \\"Welcome To Plastic Beach\\"  is a nice smooth jam that has Snoop Dogg who I was surprised and happy to hear.  The music has a nice sound all around form the Sythed \\"Oooohh just like that\\" to the Horns and Bass.    \\"White Flag\\" is a fun song.  It starts with a in my mind a World Beat sound, maybe Arabic sounding mixed with some drums from Brazil or something and then the beat changes and Bashy whom I've never heard of jumps in and starts rapping.  Sounds Good to me.    \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" has 2D(Damon) sounding like I love him.  That kind of monotone sleepy voice.  Once again this song is Synth heavy which sounds great.     \\"Stylo\\" is a PERFECT song! Mos Def is my favorite rapper with a nice little verse that he repeats, 2D sounds great and Bobby Womack sounds Badass!  There isn't anything bad about this song.    \\"Super Fast Jellyfish\\" is another Fun song.  De La Soul for the Win!  Great versus and the beat is nice.  The chorus is really cool as well.  Great song!  \\"Don't Waste time...\\"    \\"Empire Ants\\" is more synth again.  Very Good sounding song here.  It starts slow and then about the middle 2D the instruments/sounds pick up a bit and Yukimi Nagano starts to sing.  She sound good.  This song is superb.  Really chill.    \\"Some Kind of Nature\\" is another song that I REALLY like.  Never heard of him but Lou Reed sounds great in this song.  I love the lyrics also.  \\"Some Kind of Nature, Some Kind of Soul, Some Kind of Mixture, Some Kind of Goal......\\".  2D is awesome again, you can hear more emotion from him in this one.  Good Songall around.  This is my, \\"Stuck in my head\\" song but in a great way.    \\"On Melancholy Hill\\" has 2D with that monotone voice against a nice sounding synth track that sounds like it was made for the theme of the album.  I don't know the name of the instrument but I've heard it before in island songs from maybe the late 80's early 90's.      \\"Broken\\" has an eerie slow sound to it with that Organ sound mixed with a shock of electricity.  It's a good song.    \\"Sweepstakes\\" is my favorite rapper again and it's a track that I was expecting to hear.  I thought Mos Def would only be on Stylo and didn't expect to see him again. Mos Def sounds good on this even more so when he does the sing songy part of the song. I love the drums in this one and it's cool when the band picks up.    \\"Plastic Beach\\", the title track and sounds good.  Not much to say here but I do like the track.    \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" has Bobby Womack back this time he still sounds soulful like in \\"Stylo\\" but it's more toned down.  It has an eerie sound I'm going to have to go check out Bobby Womack.  I'm super impressed by him.      \\"Pirate Jet\\" is an interesting one.  I love the over powering synth in this one and the vocals if I had to visualize it kind sound like 2D is singing with a group of brainwashed Zombies and I love me some Zombies!    In Conclusion, buy it!  It doesn't have any filler material you see most albums these days.  While I do like Demon Days better I am happy with my purchase. With Demon Days it was a 1 time listen and I was hooked and with songs like \\"O' Green World\\", \\"Kids With Guns\\", \\"Feel Good Inc.\\", \\"Last Living Souls\\", \\"Dirty Harry\\", the epic \\"El Manana\\", \\"November has come\\" well damn the Majority of the disc it was super easy to love.  That's a hard disc to beat not only by Gorillaz but by anything/anyone and it's one I've been playing since I bought it day 1. With Plastic Beach it took me a twice over to catch the very essence of this one.  There are some tracks I will get stuck in my head and say \\"Ohh I feel like hearing that,\\" but it doesn't captivate me like Demon Days did.  It's a Solid album though with majority of the songs being good.  Who knows maybe after even more listens I may fall in love with it like I am with Demon Days.  Plastic Beach also left me wanting more.  I remember hearing back when Demon Days was out that it would just be a trilogy.  I sure hope not.  I want more Gorillaz!
B000000JO3|5.0|I'll never forget picking up Minor Threat at the old music store in the mall that isn't there anymore. This was before online shopping, or really before the internet was in anyone's home. I'd heard of them while some musician was namedropping on TV.  In those young, broke, early teenage years it was a big deal to drop fifteen bucks on something I'd never heard. I forget who claimed them as an influence, but it must have made an impression. I took the plunge. Little did I know I was leaving the store with music that would change my tastes across the board and attitude towards life.     On first listen nothing really stood out.  It was fast, mean, dirty.  The production threw me off (years later it seems awesome).  Much like the only other \\"real\\" punk I owned, I kept listening.  I read the lyrics.  I didn't give up on it. I wanted to understand. Within 2-3 months I was doing my best to learn every song on guitar and could sing you every word.     For me, much like many of you, this was a welcome flare in the dark.  There were other people out there like me. Others were unsure of the world. There are/were other kids nervous about life and the future.      Sure there are a lot of bands who address life's bumps, but most don't do what Minor Threat did.  They sang about self awareness.  Minor Threat talked about how doing drugs will mess up your life.  How relationships can turn into co-dependence.   They did it fast, they did it mean, and they did it honest.  They never claimed to have all the answers, but encouraged you to question things around you.  On top of that they never came across as preachy.    This collection was at the beginning of my \\"punk\\" experience.  I'm glad I found it when I did.  It helped turn me from a Sid Vicious wanna be into someone who wanted more out of life than sex, drugs, and bragging rights. The music pointed me in the right direction if you like. It kept me away from others who bought into typical teenage rebellion, and maybe kept me from their fate.

B000028U0Y|5.0|This must rate as not just a Johnny Cash milesone in live recording, but one of the greatest live albums of all time.  The voice, the sincerity, the choice of material, the atmosphere, it's all here.  Top tracks, well all of them, however with Dark As A Dungeon, his voice is so strong and true it's impossible to put into words.  Cocaine Blues is a dyamite of a song and finally Greystone Chapel leaves the inmates with a glimer of hope.  Essential for anyone who loves modern music.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|I have always loved this movie. No discussion possible.  But... this DVD is about as bad as it gets: it is a FAKE wide-screen reproduction, meaning that on a wide-screen TV you get black bars all around the image. Yes, you can zoom in, using your TV's zoom function bad that means that are blowing up the pixels even further (already pixels are expanded to show regular DVDs on high-res screens, zooming makes it even worse.  Anamorphic wide-screen has been available in the DVD definition from the get go. This technique gives best wide-screen reproduction on full-screen AND wide-screen TV sets.
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk's album, \\"Discovery,\\" explores many concepts in electronic music. Some general electronic music techniques that are very apparent in the album include: sampling, generation electronic sounds, use of filters (low pass/high pass/band pass), vocoding, and altering the pitch and speed of sounds. Looking at the album from a historical perspective, it is easy to see the influences of both Musique concrete and Elektronische Musik.     Through the perspective of Musique Concrete, one of the works that most clearly parallels this album is Pierre Henry's \\"Psyché Rock.\\" For both, sampling is used heavily in order to create a very prominent chord progression resulting in a very catchy tune. Sampling is a big part of Musique Concrete, and Daft Punk samples many of their sounds in this album. This allows for elements of sound not traditionally thought of as \\"musical\\" in their works. This idea was originally pioneered by Pierre Schaeffer. The samples which Daft Punk uses are modified in many ways, some of which include: reversing, distorting, and changing the pitch/speed.    When looking at the album from the perspective of Elektronische Musik, the best example to compare it to is Karlheinz Stockhausen's \\"Gesang der Jünglinge.\\" In Stockhausen's composition he uses a mix of both sampled sounds, in this case young boys' voices, and computer generated sounds such as sine waves and click tracks. This album can best be described as a combination of sampled sounds and electronically generated sounds, as Stockhausen had done. \\"Discovery\\" can best be described as a mix of the ideologies of Musique Conrete and Elektronische Musik.     Looking at specific songs allows for a better look into the specific techniques Daft Punk uses:    In the song \\"One More Time,\\" Daft Punk makes heavy use of vocoding, also known as Auto-Tune. Many other songs on the album also make use of vocoding, including \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.\\" In both of these songs, the words themselves become the rhythm through the use of various filters and changing duration of the sounds. This allows the songs to sound very syncopated at certain points, contributing to the musicality of the song.     In \\"Aerodynamic,\\" a heavily processed guitar solo takes prominence. This is building off of Musique Concrete's idea of modifying samples in order to give a new sound: in this case a blazing fast guitar solo. The solo would be difficult to play on a regular electric guitar; part of the appeal of electronic music is to be able to hear sounds that would be difficult, if not impossible, to play on a real instrument.     It is very apparent in the live versions of songs from \\"Discovery\\" is that the concerts are part of the musical experience. From the robotic outfits they wear on stage to the aurora of the concert, all the components are meant to add to the musical nature of the performance. Daft Punk's live performances are also captivating in that they are remixes of their songs. This gives their live performances a new musical experience. This shows that not only is Daft Punk a duo of great recording artists, but live performers as well.     Looking at the album from a non-technical perspective, the tunes are catchy and easy to dance to. If electronic music is your thing, this album won't steer you wrong.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I'm a huge Emmylou Harris fan and after hearing samples of the songs on her album I new I had to add this one to my collection. I'm also happy that I was able to get it from Amazon in a timely manner.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|There's no need to rehash the specifics of each album's sound, as so many reviewers below have done such an excellent, thorough job of that.    I just want to address the ridiculous assertion that the \\"Editorial Review\\" makes about the first five albums' stereo mixes.    The review implies that the original stereo mixes were just carelessly slapped together. \\"Stereo mixes, particularly for the first five albums, did not include as much critical listening from George Martin, and almost none from the Fab Four.\\" It goes on to assert that \\"stereo in early 60's England was not broadcast over the air, and the format was largely the preserve of the hi-fi snob.\\"     I got news for ya. *HI-FI* was also the preserve of the hi-fi snob. Hi-fi can be mono just as well as it can be stereo, and hi-fi *mono* wasn't being broadcast over the air, either. To say that the Beatles paid little attention to stereo because their fans were mainly listening on cheap, low-fi record players and tiny AM radio speakers is to say the band cared little for sound quality. \\"Ah, mono's good enough for the little f***ers, George. Do what you want with the stereo.\\"    Besides, stereo had already taken root in the U.S., a much larger market. Why would the group not care about the quality of sound for American consumers?    \\"Ironically - this box set is the best The Beatles have ever sounded.\\" There's nothing ironic about it at all. A great deal of loving care was put into making the mono discs sound clear and spacious, without the dullness of the original CD issues. The remasters sound far superior to the original vinyl, too, especially because they're free of pops, clicks, surface noise and inner-groove distortion.    Whatever the Beatles and George Martin did or did not intend at the time is irrelevant now. No one, but no one, except maybe the people in the studio during the actual recording (and probably not even them) have ever had the opportunity to hear these albums with such startling clarity. The band and their producer could not have envisioned the state of recording arts 45 years into the future. This is sound for today, not 1965. The mono box sounds amazing. Enjoy it until we finally get all of the albums released in 5.1.

1577314808|4.0|Eckhart Tolle's \\"Power of Now\\" really touched a chord in me, I must say! It reminded me once again of the \\"eternal freshness\\" of the present moment.     In our infancy we experienced the world around us with curiosity, everything seemed new, each moment was intensely felt, for good or for bad. Getting older, we form our world views. We nourish ideas about everything, and we judge everything, filter every experience through our beliefs. Beliefs are useful tools of the mind, of \\"ego consciousness\\", the topmost level of our Self dealing and manipulating directly with physical reality. If our beliefs grow rigid and form a closed system, we live in the prison of our minds, in fact, the only real prison there ever is: If you believe something to be true, you will experience it as true. Your belief will not only structure your impressions of the world around you, it will structure your expression of self! Beliefs form reality, they are self-evident to you (or else you would not believe in them, certainly).    Tolle's \\"Power of Now\\" may serve as an eye-opener here, but I recommend his books, DVDs aso. only to the spiritually mature because Tolle does make mistakes in his deductions! According to Tolle's narrations, he was a highly anxious and deeply depressed person to his 29th year when he experienced a psychic transformation practically overnight: His old fearful, destructive self got wiped out and was replaced with a new more open self. Since Tolle experienced this transformation so intensely as a re-birth, he draw the (false) conclusion that ego consciousness is a bad thing per se, which is absolutely not true and may even be misleading to the readers!     I have read almost all of Jane Robert's Seth-books, and Seth goes into the workings of consciousness, especially ego consciousness, in depth, explaining things much more conclusive, and I want to advise every reader who is looking for in-depth answers to consult the Seth material!    According to Seth, the inner selfmay \\"wipe out\\" and replace a highly dysfunctional \\"ego\\" when it does no longer serve the higher purposes of the total personality, and this is obviously what happened to Eckhart Tolle or Byron Katie. This is a very radical change, and - as far as I am concerned - it does not prevent you from falling into future traps of false or limited beliefs! In one of Tolle's recordings I even heard him say that the outside world \\"obscures God\\", as if it were a realm to be shunted aside to see God \\"unobscured\\"! You will not find God outside of his manifestations, though, because the world formed out of what God is! If our limited beliefs blind us to God or All-That-Is, creating \\"evil\\" through fear and misunderstanding, we will not get very far when trying to \\"see through\\" to an \\"unobscured God\\", obviously!    We need to expand our beliefs to be open to know Ourselves, then we will know God! Practising living in the Now is a very good way of achieving this task, but beware! You will meet your beliefs everywhere! The \\"trick\\" is to unmask them, to see them as BELIEFS and hence dis-identify from them. Any idea that feels good is good. Ideas and opinions that make you feel bad, are bad or \\"wrong\\". Your feelings will serve as signposts. If you feel bad, you can tell yourself that something with your world view is \\"wrong\\", and this idea in itself can help loosen a rigid or destructive world view.    In the past, especially in the 1970ies, attempts have been made to wipe out \\"dysfunctional egos\\" through the use of drugs. Now, this was a very grave mistake! For once, the idea of such an attempt itself comes from a highly destructive and negative view of the ego. And furthermore, the freshly born ego is well aware that its existence is based on its predecessor's death! This knowledge alone is the cause of a deep suspiciousness towards the world and fear of annihilation, naturally!    We, in our totality, using the power and knowledge of the inner self - a power and knowledge that is in our hands! -, are in command of our beliefs! We do not need to succumb to a negative world view! All we need to do is seize the sceptre and use our abilities!

B002ONC9NC|4.0|One added, perhaps overlooked, aspect of this fine film is David's character arc.  By the end of the film, he is less the suave, predatory male than a rather sad pathetic character, who had managed to project enough charisma to impress an intelligent but inexperienced young woman.  He needed to see himself as she must have seen him until the truth came out.      I also imagine Jenny's disillusionment once David's glossy exterior wears off and she begins to see what's underneath.  Until then, she'd been complicit in David's charade but blind to his essential weakness.
B00008G9JO|5.0|For a band named after an agriculturist, Jethro Tull's music has often fit their moniker. 1978's \\"Heavy Horses\\" is the last album in the Tull catalog that is almost always universally approved of by music critics (and we know they're always right, right?); i.e. it's often ranked as a great Tull album, and the last to get consistent kindness from the critics (even \\"Crest of a Knave\\" is knocked because it inappropriately won a Grammy in the heavy metal category - get over it already).<br />And \\"Heavy Horses\\" is indeed a masterful piece of work, and the last Jethro Tull record to feature one of their most memorable lineups in fine shape (the next album, \\"Stormwatch\\" would see ailing bassist John Glascock only appearing on three songs, and by 1980, only frontman/songwriter Ian Anderson and guitarist Martin Barre remained).<br />Loosely themed as a bit of a wake for pastoral imagery in the age of machinery, both the music, lyrics, and performances fit the \\"concept\\" to a T, or to an A, as Anderson's lyrics are quite often baffling, but somehow always poignant and moving, and his vocal performance on the album is one of his absolute best. Tull's signature acoustic guitars, mandolins, and of course the trusty flute, lilt across the album flawlessly, and the electric guitars, basses, and Barriemore Barlow's concise, often furious drumming are welcome as well, and never outweigh or distract from the more earthy elements. The nine-minute title track, unedited, is one of the band's greatest pieces, and the presence of the classic 'No Lullaby,' the intriguing 'Rover,' and the somehow-catchy 'Moths' are music for pleasure, even when jarring.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade, as always is at her best with the release of Soldier of Love.  If you as a reader of this review is absolutely new to the sounds of Sade, I say you can't lose and you may want to purchase some of her earlier releases such as \\"The Best of Sade\\" and \\"Lovers Rock\\".  For those who have listen to Sade's music in the pass, I say, \\"It's Sade!\\"
B002ZG97RE|3.0|\\"Green Zone\\" stars Matt Damon as Warrant Officer Roy Miller, leader a battalion in 2003 Iraq charged with finding the elusive \\"weapons of mass destruction.\\"  However, every time they are given intelligence, it turns out to be wrong.  Extremely wrong.  Toilet factory wrong.  Miller starts to question his superiors about the source of the intel, which raises some hackles, but also attracts the interest of the CIA bureau chief in Baghdad, Martin Brown (played by Brendan Gleeson).  Miller's frustration mounts when his team is sent to what turns out to be a playground; however, his luck turns when a local resident approaches the team and informs them about a meeting of high-level Iraqis just down the street.  Miller is skeptical but decides to investigate, and his team stumbles upon the number two man in Saddam Hussein's toppled government.  Unfortunately, not everyone in the allied forces is pleased, and Miller finds himself not knowing who to trust and at the center of a confusing web of intelligence.<br /><br />At this point, quite a few movies have been made about the Iraqi war, all focusing on slightly different aspects of the war and with different political slants and agendas.  The best of these movies (Stop-Loss, The Hurt Locker) have taken on very specific aspects of the war and informed the public.  \\"Green Zone\\" attempts to take on a broader and more controversial issue - whether we should have been there in the first place and whether the intelligence that led us into Iraq was good.  Unfortunately, the plot details regarding that issue are fictionalized.  So what is the purpose?  The movie cannot illuminate for us whether we should have engaged in this war, so it serves only to add fuel (fictionalized fuel!) to the fire for those who have argued that the war was started under false pretences.<br /><br />Of course, war movies have long served as entertainment, and \\"Green Zone\\" was brought to us by the same team (Damon and director Paul Greengrass) who made \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" so one might expect a smashing good thriller.  As such, \\"Green Zone\\" is fairly well done.  There are some exciting segments where Miller slowly realizes what is happening as well as a few decent action scenes.  However, it's a much noisier and chaotic and therefore less enjoyable film than any of the Bourne series, and it never develops the tension those movies instill.  Also, let's face it - the superior Oscar-winning \\"The Hurt Locker\\" elevated the war genre; \\"Green Zone\\" feels surprisingly old-fashioned and pointless in contrast.  \\"Green Zone\\" is ultimately a decent, above average thriller but don't expect much else.y\\" and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" so one might expect a smashing good thriller.

0061703257|5.0|WOW!!  This book is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />I had no idea what the book was about when I picked it up - only that it had been made into a movie.  So a few days ago, I had started and put down two other books, and then picked this one up.  I didn't have high hopes, because I just was in a reading funk - and it grabbed me right away!  I didn't get much reading done yesterday, but today, I just kept on going until I finished it.<br /><br />In a nutshell- Teddy, a U.S. Marshall, lands on Shutter Island to help track down a patient who has escaped from the hospital there - a hospital for the criminally insane.  He and his partner quickly realize that they are being lied to at every turn, and are determined to solve the mystery of the hospital, as well as the missing woman.  At the same time, Teddy must also face some demons of his own past.<br /><br />Lots of intrigue, a great mystery, and fascinating characters and setting - this book is a gripping page-turner.
0393072231|5.0|the spoiled brat idiot reviewers who gave it 1-star because it's not on Kindle made me mad. I saw Lewis' 60 minutes interview and I have a basic understanding of what this book is about to the point of reading it. This book can't be 1-star bad.    Yes, I submit that this review is NOT HELPFUL and have no problem with it being called as such. However, before you do, I do intend to purchase the book and to post a better review than this.
0393072231|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for the last year, even before the book had been announced.  I knew the book would be coming, because Michael Lewis is the perfect author for this subject.  Even with all the analysis and commentary of the financial meltdown since then, nobody could possibly break it all down better than the author of Liar's Poker.  After seeing his 60 Minutes interview last night, it confirmed that this book would be THE essential reading on the crisis.  Normally, I would not review a book before reading it, but a Michael Lewis book is guaranteed to be outstanding, and I wanted to balance out all the erroneous one-star reviews from all the kindle idiots who can't find the customer service link to complain about having to read an actual book.
1416550550|4.0|What a luscious tale.  The pacing is great and I loved how it deftly swung from turn of the 20th century England, to Australia and England in the 1970's and back to the current day bouncing off three generations of women not the mention lovely fairy tales woven throughout, oh, and magic gardens and mysteries complete with snarling bad guys lurking around corners.  This might sound fanciful but there was enough reality to hold the story in place.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|It is hard to imagine anybody buying this DVD without having seen the original \\"Cranford\\" beforehand. And on that understanding, how one receives this sequel film is totally dependent on one's attitude towards the first. The original \\"Cranford\\" is a classic period English small town morality play. It is superbly performed by a galaxy of solid - even great - British actors who are all so relaxed and at home in their roles that it all seems totally real and convincing. Behaviour standards, class attitudes, subtleties of language depending who is addressing who, the sets, camera work and directing are all faultless. The transformation of Judy Dench, the awful impact of thoughtless gossip, the almost unbelievable naivete of some of the characters... it all adds up to a perfect little work of art. The sequel, Return to Cranford, is pretty well what you'd expect. The Dench character cannot transform again, the gossips are recognized and so you anticipate their effect, the hand is dealt from the same deck, but the trumps have already been played. In other words, it is much the same, but not quite as satisfying. There are a few new twists - nicely developed. The producers and screenplay writers work hard to get fresh dynamics into the mix, possible by the progress of the railway (approaching modernity and changing mores) and the actors all do as well as before although the stars from the first film seem at times just a little jaded, and it is possible to wonder why a few from the first weren't brought back - where did they go, and why? Having said that, note that I rated this with four stars - but I'd give the first film five. If you loved \\"Cranford\\" you'll certainly enjoy \\"Return to Cranford\\", but don't expect it to be better.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|In the long line of disaster movies made by Hollywood in general, and Roland Emmerich in particular, two things remain common.  First, the special effects get better with each successive movie.  Second, the scientific plausibility of the disaster remains the same, and that is minimal.  2012 came out in 2009 and is about the unraveling of a natural disaster triggered by changes in the Sun's solar flares.  The earth's crust supposedly heats up and liquefies, which causes massive earthquakes and volcanoes and a shifting of the continents.  The movie attempts to bring some scientific logic to the disaster, but if you know anything about geology or physics, it falls flat.  The main characters are a family that escapes this disaster and manages to get themselves onto a big ship built by the Chinese to ferry humanity's survivors.  Their escape is totally ludicrous, one hair-raising scene after another makes the entire story unbelievable.  So all told, an OK popcorn flick, but don't bother buying this DVD.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|As a devout Potter head, I am sad to say that this movie was pretty bad. The only reason I bought it was b/c I want to own the entire series.   In sum, nothing happens in this movie, the events are not even close to events in the book, and don't get me started on the important aspects which were left out. Don't purchase unless you need to own the entire series.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This is not a review of the film, but the Blu-ray. If you buy this you know how good the movie is.    This is a 1 disc set and comes with both the original and the directors cut.     There are also a wealth of extras on the disc including many audio commentaries and documentaries.    There are no deleted scenes as they are included in the directors cut version.    For 7.99 I do not think you can go wrong with buying this on Blu-ray. Its only 1 disc, but there is a lot there.
1439153663|3.0|I have to admit I did not get very far in this book, maybe a third in. The reason for that is that there are lots of story lines to follow, and although they each give a unique view of what happened it made for difficult reading. I had to stop.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie is fantastic, but this is a review of the Blu-ray set.    You get 4 discs here even though 2 of them really matter.    Disc 1 has the movie and a bunch of shorts.    Disc 2 has a bunch of documentaries and games    Disc 3 has the movie on dvd    Disc 4 has your digital copy    There is a lot here but the only ones that matter are the first 2 discs.     There is a ton of stuff on those 2 discs, so be prepared to be entertained for quite some time.    Something I have to mention and I have read it is an issue. I bought a [[ASIN:B001UQ6F5M LG BD 390 Network Blu-ray Disc Player]] and the blu-ray disc takes almost 3 minutes to load. At first I thought it was some sort of defect, but its a known issue with this movie a ton of players.

0812973992|1.0|This was, by far, not the worst book I've ever read, but it comes close. All the \\"tricky\\" devices the author uses, like 1rst person, present tense, etc. are all ineffective. The author doesn't choose to let the reader in on on what he's getting at, until much later in the book. As a reader I felt manipulated and disrespected, having to plow through so much bad writing to reach the conclusion that there wasn't much substance to begin with. Any writing book will tell you to avoid the devices this author uses constantly. My question is: Just because the author has been published before, does he not have a content editor?<br /><br />The characters are not interesting, maintly because of the writing style. There is nothing to draw the reader in from the first paragraph.<br /><br />I find it quite amazing that this book would become a best seller, or even that a publisher would look twice at this manuscript.
B00328G4V6|5.0|It's interesting how a Hendrix fan can listen to this and know what era of his career it's from.  Many of these archival releases are evolutions of the Jimi still hammering out an unfinished track.  Mr. Bad Luck became Look Over Yonder.  Crying Blue Rain is a workup of what would become Gettin' My Brothers Shoes Together  which would become Hear My Train A Comin'.  And that track is here, the superior electric version previously released on Warner Bros.  posthumous Midnight Lightning.  This isn't a collection of outtakes.   This is the latest Jimi Hendrix album, work from a man who is done too soon.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I've purchased no fewer than 5 Linksys Wireless Routers in the last 3 or 4 years. After a few months of use, they would stop working about ever 36 to 72 hours. The solution is to unplug them, count to 30, then plug them back in. This is not a useful solution. I then read the fine print in their manuals and they said \\"Unplug this device at night when you go to bed\\" (or something similar). Clearing linksys wireless routers are not intended for full time use.    So I talked with a friend, and he suggested I install a Switch along with a Wireless Access Point from Cisco (the parent company of Linksys). Their equipment is commercial quality, more expensive, but it works.    So I picked up this product along with a Cisco 10/100/1000 8 port switch and connected the switch to the Cable Modem, and the Wireless Access Point (this product) to the switch. Turn them on and they've been running for several months now 24x7 with zero down time.    The range of this product is, so far, the best I've seen.  The connection is consistent and can handle all 5 of our in-house PCs and numerous hand-held devices without any issues at all.    It is expensive, but it works, whereas the Linksys \\"home wireless routers\\" tend to get over heated after a few months of use and have to be power-cycled every 2 to 4 days. For me, I prefer to turn it on and leave it on 24x7.    Great product.
B00337KM2S|5.0|I loved watching this movie and timing can't be more perfect!  With the unemployment number hitting two digits, I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this movie.  The emotional upheaval of being told that your service was no longer needed was right on the dot!  It was very clever of Jason Reitman to incorporate real people who were actually laid off along with actors in this movie.  The pain on their faces mirrored mine when I was told that I was no longer \\"part of the new regime.\\"  This, after 20 years of my life with the company!  It brought back a lot of memory and certainly fun to watch, now that my heart no longer ached.<br /><br />This movie has a great script and a great acting all around.  It correctly points out that we should re-evaluate our Life's goal every now and then.  The ending was bit cliche I thought, but since it was George Clooney, I forgive him.  This movie doesn't just deal with firing of people, but also deals with relationships (or lack thereof.)  I thought it was very insightful.  Loved watching every minute of this movie!
B002VECM4A|4.0|Having taught in all manner of inner city alternative (including unwed mothers) and special needs classrooms I was surprised at how accurate the classroom, teacher and student portrayals were in this movie. In particular the behaviors, language and interactions both between students and with staff, were fairly spot on. Also, having written IEPs that included home visits I found similar situations where a TV was the guardian and institutional supplied income was a manipulated and important financial source for families. The only student demographic that was not represented but comprises a large percentage of this population are the high testing and low performance students (as opposed to the low testing, low performance students shown in the movie) that I've encountered. This large population is street smart and surprisingly mature in ways that they find standard textbook academics as simply too boring and not immediately relevant so they pursue risky behaviors that result in them being removed from the traditional classroom. It would have added to this movie to see those s's as well.
1883010039|5.0|As a beginning weaver, I find the book very informative. Each of the techniques described are approached from different directions, allowing you to determine what works best for you. Not only are the how's given by the why's also, so there is a complete understanding of the entire process. It also includes a clear trouble shooting guide, that I have found helpful.
1584282584|4.0|Although the use of a flash is a virtual necessity at most weddings, often the photographer does not have the requisite knowledge or experience to get the most out of their equipment.  This book provides a good foundation in the use of on-camera flash and describes, in detail, advanced techniques that can significantly improve the quality of the final products.  I have been shooting professionally for five years, but have never attempted to photograph a wedding (until my daughter asked me to photograph hers).  I found this book to be very useful in providing me with basic information relating to evaluating the existing light, choosing the proper equipment, achieving proper exposure, mastering the technical aspects of flash photography, and applying the best techniques to achieve quality results. I gave the book four stars because there is a bit of repetition and the list price is somewhat high for a work that is essentially an overview of the subject.  However, if the final images turn out the way I hope and the techniques prove themselves to be sound, I reserve the right to add another star to the rating.
B000068TPN|5.0|I just had the pleasure of hosting Joe Galloway at LSU for a class titled The Media and The Military.  The class viewed both this movie and The Hurt Locker (both based on experiences of journalists who covered the military).  Galloway, the UPI correspondent, who was with Col. Hal Moore and the 7th Calvary during the Ia Drang battles received a Bronze Star with V for his valor in assisting in getting wounded soldiers to helicopters while under enemy fire.  So, Galloway lived it, co-wrote the book with Col. Moore on which the movie was based and kept an eye on the production of the movie.  He says that the movie is 75% accurate and 25% Hollywood, which he believes is the reverse of normal for Hollywood.  The students liked how personal the movie was.  We saw the reality of the taxis delivering telegrams to the families back home.  Joe said that he and Col. Moore decided when writing the book that they wanted two elements not common in most war accounts:  the impact of war on families and some humanization of the enemy.  Galloway and Moore made several trips back to Vietnam and met with the Vietcong generals who had opposed American troops in the Ia Drang Valley.  Unlike The Hurt Locker, the names of the real soldiers were used, and a few of them, including Moore and Galloway, are still living. This is an important piece of American history that should be viewed by anyone who remembers the Vietnam War era and especially those who are too young to remember.
B0013NAP2G|5.0|A truly great concert DVD. Mariah sounds and looks great in this comeback performance. You can see that she really gives her all to put on a good show for her fans. The production values (dancers, band, back-up singers, lighting and staging) are excellent. One small complaint is that in editing out footage, most of song \\"I Wish You Knew\\" was cut. The extras (behind-the-scenes footage and the funny, self-deprecating \\"Lovers & Haters\\" feature directed by Spike Lee) are impressive as well.

B000MV9026|3.0|I specifically ordered this movie for my niece in college as a valentine's day gift. It was to be a study break movie. I  chose this company because it said new, sealed package, as from the factory. This is not what I received! The package was inserted in the mailer with the broken seal end inserted in the envelope mailer first. So when you opened the package, it appeared new and the seal appeared unbroken. This is not what the product claim was and not what I ordered. The price was good, and I am familiar with the movie, but I ordered a new copy! I did not have time to return it and order another copy, so I kept it, but I will never order from this vendor again! Why try to be deceptive, and think you can fool the consumer, as if I would not notice the way it was packaged? Bah! Humbug! Shame on you!
0783225881|5.0|Field Of Dreams is about baseball; but baseball is just a metaphor for something bigger. It's about an Iowa farmer named Ray who hears a voice that tells him, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" He knows the Voice wants him to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield; which, oddly enough, he's willing to do because he thinks it will keep him from ending up like his dad - a man that \\"never did one spontaneous thing in his life.\\" But he thinks the field is for \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson - one of the infamous eight \\"Black Sox\\" that were barred from baseball for life in 1920 - so he will come and play baseball again... which he does, but that's not the reason for the field.<br /><br />Later, Ray gets a second message that tells him, \\"Ease his pain,\\" which sends him off on a road trip to pick up Terence Mann - really J. D. Salinger, author of Catcher In The Rye, according to Shoeless Joe, the book on which the film is based - and a small town doctor named Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham. Kevin Costner plays Ray, Amy Madigan plays his wife Annie, Ray Liotta play Shoeless Joe, James Earl Jones plays Terence Mann, and Burt Lancaster plays Moonlight Graham. Together they find their dreams on a baseball diamond in the middle of an Iowa cornfield. But, as wonderful as all this is, that is still not why Ray was told to build the field.<br /><br />At the climax of the film, Ray has to make a choice between selling his farm in order to keep from being foreclosed on, and risking everything in order to keep the baseball diamond. At that point, Terence Mann makes a little speech about what is best about America, and how baseball has marked the time throughout the years and helped keep us on track. Both he and Ray's daughter, Karin (played by Gaby Hoffmann), tell Ray that if he keeps the baseball diamond, people will come and pay to see it, and that will save the farm.<br /><br />But what is the baseball diamond, really? Several times, people ask, \\"Is this Heaven?\\" and Ray answers, \\"No, it's Iowa,\\" which is a funny line; but the truth is, it really IS Heaven, because it's the place where dreams come true, as Ray's dad later points out. Heaven has set down on a farm in Iowa in the form of a baseball diamond in order to redeem and heal some broken lives. Isn't that what God does? Isn't that what He did with the Tabernacle in the wilderness, with the Temple in Israel, and with Jesus in Judea? And isn't that what He's going to do one day with the New Jerusalem? He's going to set Heaven down on earth and all His people's dreams are going to come true.<br /><br />The heart of Field Of Dreams is Ray's relationship with his dad. He builds the baseball diamond because he's afraid of becoming like his dad. Ray and his dad didn't get along growing up: they both loved baseball, but they pulled for different teams; when Ray went off to college, he picked the one furthest away from his dad; he even told his dad he could never respect him because his hero was a criminal - Shoeless Joe. I was stupid like that once. I said and did stupid things to my dad because we didn't get along and I didn't want to end up like him. I think MOST guys feel this way, which is why this film speaks to so many of us in the place where they have our deepest pain.<br /><br />When the Voice says \\"Ease his pain,\\" at first, Ray thinks he's talking about Terence Mann, which is why he went off to find him; and near the end of the film, when he sees his dad (played by Dwier Brown) as a young man, he says, \\"It was you,\\" thinking that it was HIS pain he was supposed to ease. But Shoeless Joe corrects him in one of the most poignant moments in the film: \\"No, Ray, it was you.\\" All this was done to ease Ray's pain.<br /><br />There's a valuable lesson here. Earlier, Shoeless Joe invites Terence Mann to go back with him and the other ballplayers to find out what's beyond the corn. Ray gets miffed because he thinks HE'S the one that should go back. After all, he built the baseball diamond,and it's his cornfield the players are living in. So he questions Shoeless Joe, asking point blank, \\"What's in it for me?\\" and Shoeless responds, \\"Is that why you did this, Ray - for you?\\" Of course, it wasn't. But he's starting to feel entitled. That's when he realizes what this whole experience has really been about.<br /><br />In the process of easing others' pain, he has eased his own. That is the nature of giving and self-sacrifice: \\"Whoever loses his life for me will find it.\\" (Matthew 16:25) Whatever we lose on earth we will find in Heaven. Oh, if only we would learn this lesson in America today - it would change everything! Ray risks everything to help others, and in the process, gains everything.<br /><br />Throughout history, and around the world today, people are risking everything for others, and in the process, they're finding themselves and their dreams. George Mueller, William Wilberforce, Mother Theresa, people who went to New Orleans to help rebuild, people who have gone to Haiti to help there... the list is endless. These are people who either built or are building orphanages, hospitals, schools, houses, churches, sports programs, arts programs, you name it... so that others can come and find their dreams. That was once the mantra of America: if you build it, they will come. It's even written in so many words on the Stature of Liberty. Do we still believe it?<br /><br />There is one thing that lasts, and that is really what this movie is about: the Kingdom of Heaven. When Christ left earth and walked back into Heaven, He turned to his team and said, \\"If you build it, they will come.\\" Build what? His Kingdom. It's not a kingdom of bricks and mortar, nor even a kingdom of baseballs and bats: it's a kingdom of relationships. Only relationships last. That's why we're here.<br /><br />If you ask most middle Americans what they're building, they'll say, \\"A family.\\" But is that about Christ and His Kingdom, or is that about you? Most people see their family as an extension of themselves; but your family is really just your team. What are you and your team building? If most of us were honest, we'd have to answer, \\"A kingdom of self,\\" because that is what most of us are living for. Self doesn't satisfy, which is why everyone that comes to the end of themselves ends up at the throne of Christ with broken dreams, asking Him to fix them. It's not our broken dreams that Christ needs to fix, it's our broken relationships, beginning with HIm. He will give us new, better dreams, and it is those NEW dreams that will ease our pain.<br /><br />If we start living for Him instead of ourselves, and if we start building His Kingdom instead of our own, we will find our field of dreams. What physical talents and spiritual gifts have you been given? That is a clue as to what you should be building. Your work, whatever it is, can be a field of dreams for someone else, and, in the process, a way for your dreams to come true and your pain to be eased. It's a simple answer that has existed for two thousand years.<br /><br />What is the Voice telling you to build right now? If you build it, He will come. He will most definitely come.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithin.

031606792X|5.0|I bought this as a gift and they loved the book and I love how easy it was to get.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It's not like you were worried it might be a substandard Blu-ray release with poor video or audio quality, not in a big-budget effects-heavy J.J. Abrams movie made recently.  They were planning the Blu-ray during filming, you know it.<br /><br />The bonus stuff is pretty good too -- Abrams is always fun to watch behind the scenes because he looks like how we, the fans, would probably be on the set, occasionally so overwhelmed by how freaking cool it is to be there and how cool is everything going on, that the enthusiasm is infectious.
0393072231|1.0|I had interest to read this book amid the current hype but having to wait for it due to publishers ignorance warrants a one star review.  Publishers need to listen to the market place.  The demand is relevant now vs later, why not capture rather than let it die down.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is a struggling writer trying to eek out a living.  He has a mortgage to pay and kids to put through school just like anyone else. Why punish him for something that is beyond his control?  All of the one-star reviews will likely scare off potential buyers, and the book will end up as a big flop leaving Michael Lewis broker than broke.  And all because a bunch of fat-cat Kindle owners are upset that they can't read the book on their high-tech gadget device.  People need to come to their senses and think about starting a collection for Michael Lewis so he can at least make a few bucks off his book.  Come on, people! Get real!!
0312944926|2.0|Ahhh, painful!   I engulfed Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\". I expected this one to be just as good.  However, three chapters into it, I wanted to jump into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this book is annoying. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: \\"ok, I get it, move the hell on!\\".   Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his \\"The Lost Symbol\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\", and the \\"Da Vinci Code\\". This one literally p****d me off.
B002ZDOXM6|2.0|For a hardcore fan - or someone who just happens to own every song done by the group - this will prove as useful as a screen door on a submarine as they already have all the songs.  It would be only for the PDF features or just the sake of having it in their collection that they may pick it up.  Perhaps if a remix, video version, interview or a \\"behind the scenes\\" track or two were included then that may have some pull but alas, this is pretty much a no-frills quick-buck product.  Now for someone who may have liked only what they heard on the radio but would not buy the albums or for someone who may be new to hearing the group's music, well then this would be ideal.
B002VECM6S|2.0|I remember looking forward to this movie and being utterly disappointed on the way out and the reasons are many.  The story had potential, but the director chose to turn this into a made for Lifetime Channel Tv movie. All directors manipulate the audience to an extent, but the Blind Side does not allow the audience to think at all.  We clearly know who is a big bad meanie and we clearly know who the saints with halos are.  And there are no in betweens.  And can anyone honestly say there was anything in this \\"film\\" that could not be anticipated from the trailer?  I would venture that anyone, after seeing the 60 second preview could probably describe the entire film.  There was nothing in the screenplay that could not be predicted.  How can such a predictable film be remotely considered for top picture?    The portrayal of the sport of football itself was half baked(I was really looking forward to some insight into the sport of football in this movie, but my little sister seems to know more about the sport than the director does).  The coach of the OTHER team was a devil and all his players were little demons.  Michael's team were the good guy underdogs that you MUST root for unless you are a communist.  And Michael shoving his meanie nemesis all the way down the field and over the fence?  Why was this scene necessary?  If someone were to actually do that (and they never did or will), they would be ejected and suspended.  And even if it were to happen, a total brawl would ensue on the field.  Was the director trying to get a laugh?  That would be the way I would expect to see football portrayed on an episode of I-Carly, not in an Oscar nominated film.    And at the end of the film, do we really understand who Michael Oher is?  All we get is a caricatured sketch of him.  The film was all about Leigh Ann, and not Michael.  Some have argued the focus of the film is about Leigh Ann's good deed, and that is all good and fine, but I would like a bit more depth to Michael'scharacter.  That was who I came to the movie to see.  And I am not totally willing to coronate Leigh Ann and her husband as total saints yet either; I believe that there was more to the NCAA investigation than we were led to believe.  But once again, the director was unwilling to let the audience think here.  The audience was clearly TOLD the NCAA was the big meanie.  All black and white and no grey is the EASY way out.    Finally, I do not believe Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her performance in this film (or any other film she has been in for that matter).  Her performance was pretty much exactly what you would expect; very little subtlety or nuance.  She was pretty much happy, mad, and sad everywhere the script told her.  Not a bad performance, but if one saw all the other female leads that were nominated, Bullock's performance was easily at the bottom of the bunch.  Heck, even a few that WEREN'T nominated were better.  Amy Adams, for instance, turned in a FAR superior performance in Julie and Julia.  I guess if Taylor Swift can get a Grammy for album of the year, we really can't be surprised if the Academy hands out an undeserving award or two.
0141442468|5.0|I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I agree w/ some of the other posters in that I'm shocked at all the negative reviews.  I've been a fan of his for 30 years and applaud that he continues to take chances.  One thing about this album, you have to listen to it multiple times to really appreciate it.  His versions of \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" and \\"Book of Love\\" are haunting.  Completely different songs as he's interpreted them.  And now I'm eagerly awaiting the same strings treatment of his own songs, which is apparently planned.
0425188809|5.0|Started off innocent enough with a man finding a dog while out on a hike. Doesn't last very long though as Koontz then proceeds to drag you inside his world of monstrocities. A brilliantly conceived tale, the book follows the lives of two genetically altered animals. One is warm and fuzzy, the other a programmed killing machine. Funny thing was, I began caring more for the \\"evil\\" being by the end of the book. Kudos to Koontz for a fantastic read.
2839906171|5.0|Great book.  Very easy to read, insightful text and inspiring images, much more fun than a regular and expected book about business.  Great tools and methodologies to make it happen.  I'm about to make good use of it in my own initiatives.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|i ordered this movie because i heard other ppl talking about it.. it wasn't all that.. i thought it was something else.. a more scary movie.. it was okay.. wouldn't watch it twice.. then my co worker told me he researched the movie.. and it was never proven to be true.. it seemed to be thought.. but.. it was a okay movie.. and i didn't like the way it ended...u are left to wonder..
B001HN694K|5.0|I saw this film today and plan on buying the DVD as I don't believe that the film will fall flat in 2D as Avatar will.  I forget that I was watching a 3D film and became entangle in the film. The people I was with felt the same way.  We found the movie to be a fun romp through Alice-Land (Wonderland can't be recaptured and shouldn't be) with Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. Anne Hathaway made an exceptionally ditzy, White Queen, and Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar were both wonderful in their roles.<br />I have long ago learned that books don't translate well to movies and expectations of readers differ, so I never go to a movie expecting to watch the book...so to speak.  This makes for a fun and interesting movie experience.  This movie was no different. This isn't your \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" Book anymore kids.  It's inventive and takes the twist that Alice has grown up, forgotten her previous experience and returns to Wonderland with no knowledge of her previous trip as a child.  It's an amazing fantasy film the might not suit a younger crowd, but the adults in the movie theater loved it. Don't let the Disney tag fool you, because it's not a typical Disney film with head cut off floating in the Red Queens Moat.<br />Don't go to this movie expecting to see the \\"Alice and Wonderland\\" Book...you'll be disappointed.  Go expecting an adventure and enjoy it. I think that most people with Cats will also enjoy the Cheshire Cat...it might remind them of their own Cat's antics.<br />An altogether amazing film.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|this movie came in about 2-3 days.. very good service, excellent movie.. i waited for a month for this movie to come out.. and as soon as i saw it was for sale.. i jumped on it.. we watched it as soon as it got here.. this is a mystery, suspenseful movie.. i recommend..it was worth the wait
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Comebacks are rare, and returns from 15-year hiatuses are even more so. Throw in the death of a lead singer, a new record label and other personnel changes, and it stopped being fair long ago. Guns N' Roses had a hard enough time with only half those problems. Yet guitarist / singer Jerry Cantrell and '90s rock monster Alice in Chains just couldn't be bothered with the mire, doom and gloom unless they were writing about it. Black Gives Way to Blue is more than a reunion with Mike Inez and Sean Kinney to produce a return to form. It's also one of the best rock albums of 2009.    To replace a vocalist as tuneful and iconic as Layne Staley has been impossible. Bands influenced by AiC, as diverse as Life of Agony, Staind, Godsmack, Days of the New and a never-ending list have all had competent vocalists that have been jeered at by critics as Staley-derivativea. The only person who could even hope to get away with comparisons was Jerry Cantrell himself, and he sang on half of AiC's original material anyway. Well, his golden touch adds a glow of authenticity to the new record. \\"Check My Brain\\" feels like it came right off of Dirt or 1995's self-titled album, and \\"Your Decision\\" and \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\" recall the band's softer EPs Sap and Jar of Flies. Then you have tunes like the jagged, angularly melodic opener \\"All Secrets Known,\\" the elephantine, foot-stomping opening grove of \\"A Looking in View\\" and the piano-tinged quiet exit of a title track, \\"Black Gives Way to Blue.\\"    The haunting, tortured vocals of William DuVall are a spooky echo of Staley, as if the deceased front-man's spirit is being channeled through the songs themselves, but it could also just be the ghost-like nature of AiC's trademarked minor key voice harmonies. Cantrell and DuVall coexist and bring the tunes to life.    Never quite an alternative grunge band like the groups they were lumped in with by radio stations over a decade ago, Alice in Chains spew their triumphant new work from speakerswith crunch and doom metal fury. Just listen to the f-bombing tunnel-chewing groove of \\"Last of My Kind\\" and step out of the way as this reanimated corpse barrels through.

B001R7IHA0|4.0|Keith Urban is addicted to defiance. He's defied expectations (he's an Australian singing American heartland country-pop with a perfect twang), defied a downward slump (2006's Love, Pain, and the Whole Crazy Thing was a downbeat disappointment that no one thought he'd recover from), and defied critics of his popularity (he employs enough banjos, steel guitars and virtuoso soloing chops to justify himself as a \\"real musician\\").    His latest album is titled Defying Gravity. And defy he certainly does. Lead single \\"Sweet Thing\\" exemplifies the standard Keith Urban hit, with an upbeat chorus and plenty of firecracker guitar-work, this time employing a chiming effect that recalls late '80s U2. Is it groundbreaking? No, just another feel-good tune that Urban can notch into his belt. But it's distinctly him, and positive enough to indicate he's gotten over his unfortunate previous album.    Opener \\"Kiss a Girl\\" has the same country / rock / pop mile-wide-smile mid-tempo groove of \\"Sweet Thing,\\" and spacey, heartfelt ballads like \\"If Ever I Could Love\\" and \\"Til Summer Comes Around\\" round out the album. Urban still throws in a few licks that showcase his Grammy-winning guitar prowess, and a couple of well-timed falsettos prove he's no vocal slouch, either. All in all an admirable, if not re-inventive, return to form.    It's March. Roll down the window, crank \\"Hit the Ground Runnin'\\" and kick off the better weather.
0143115014|5.0|Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez have written what is undoubtedly the definitive guide to perfumes.  Thorough, informative, well written and inviting, these two have charted the domain of fine scents and have left a detailed map of it.  With artistic finesse and scientific knowledge, they offer up reviews of some 1,800 perfumes.  Sometimes favorable (\\"a masterpiece,\\" \\"luscious and utterly wonderful,\\" etc.), sometimes not (\\"utterly unremarkable,\\" \\"vile, cheap,\\" etc.), their starred reviews (scale: 5 stars, masterpiece, 1 star, avoid) provide readers with valuable insights into an array of products.  Readers will especially appreciate the delightful and useful appendices to the book -- \\"Glossary of Materials and Terms,\\" \\"Top Ten Lists,\\" \\"Index of Star Ratings,\\" and an \\"Index of Brands.\\"  The volume also contains some splendid and thoughtful preliminary essays to introduce readers to everything from tips on how to appreciate scents to the chemistry and art of perfume.  In short, this a perfect book for browsing, marking up, and then venturing off to a fine department store with a friend to spend an enchanting afternoon sampling the magic of scents.

I have never seen any one compilation of prehistorey that is as comprehensive as this.  Additionally, the subject matter is presented in such a manner that it can be used for professional research and for the lay reader.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I was initially critical of this due to the track lengths, obviously contrived to have a double LP with one 20 minute (approximately) piece taking up each LP side.  I am also prejudiced against extremely long pieces especially ones stringing 2 or more songs together into a longer one for no good reason.  However, from that I found this to be exceptionally well executed and exceptionally good.  The way to approach this is to just pick 1 of the 4 (any 1) and don’t try to digest the entire thing in its entirely in one listen.  You may find yourself wanting to repeat the one you have just listened to instead of picking another, as there is a lot going on and a surprising lack of repetition in the songs.  Yes remains one of the very few that can really shine on the very long pieces, and shockingly they can perform them flawlessly on their live recordings such as the Keys To Ascension releases.
0061438294|5.0|It's very clear why people like this book. It's well-written and clear, and offers some great tips and ideas for reading people.

Mr. Navarro is skilled at giving readers effective body language tools, while Dr. Lieberman's book has a more sophisticated,psychological approach, and his strategie are mindblowing. BUT I have my own problems with him having written it, as I wrote in my review of \\"You Can Read Anyone.\\"     If you want body language basics then Mr. Navarro's book or \\"The Definitive Book of Body Langauge\\" are both winners.

0060899220|5.0|At age 14 I started working in the restaurant industry. Looking for a job I was hoping to get lucky and maybe land a dishwashing gig. But the back of the house was short handed and needed someone on the line. At the time I didn't even know what a line cook even was but it was the launch of the first career in my life as a cook. I spent 5 years as a line cook and managed to work my way up to kitchen management, doing inventory and ordering, hiring and firing when I was a still a sniveling 17 year old. I came to a cross road when I was 19 and seriously considering a culinary school or apprenticeship and get serious. But I took another path and got an education and jobs working with computers, networks and the like. I decided that my chances of success as an aspiring chef might be limited. And honestly the road was going to be a harder one then I wanted to go down, I wanted a life, I wanted weekends and nights free. So even though I loved food I departed from that scene.<br /><br />Kitchen Confidential brought back a flood of memories for me and is so remeniscent of many of my own experiences. Anthony has a gift, the narrative way he tells the story brings you in. You can almost smell and taste the things he talks about. You can't help but laugh out loud and think how insanely true the life of a cook really is! His utter candor about the difficulty in becoming a career cook or chef isn't over dramatic or overstated in any way. It's an honest, entertaining, page turning book!

0786838655|5.0|For those searching for a good read with a hint of the adventure and magic they found in the Harry Potter books, the Percy Jackson series may fill the bill.    Percy Jackson, a troubled youth, always the child to cause uncalculated problems in school, finds himself kicked out of one more school at the end of his sixth year.  Strange things have always happened around Percy and he invariably finds himself in the middle of them, but never on this grand a scale.    As the summer break begins Percy discovers his real father is none other than Poseidon and that he is himself a demigod or half-blood; his best friend is a satyr (think goat) and summer camp is filled with other children of the gods.  As if that wasn't enough, gods and monsters have found their way from Mount Olympus and worse, the Underworld, and after consulting with the Oracle, Percy agrees to go on a quest to find Zeus's stolen master lightning bolt.    These are adventures to rival those of Odysseus, but in a much lighter vein.  (It's doubtful you'll find questions about Percy on your Classic Literature exams!)  And as fantastic as it all sounds, somehow Rick Riordan makes it work.  This is a delightful series!  [[ASIN:1423121708 The Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book One: Lightning Thief Deluxe Edition]]

0393072231|4.0|First, I'm a big Lewis fan.  Like many, my first exposure to Lewis was Liar's Poker; although, I've read several other Lewis books, his columns in the now defunct Portfolio, and occasional writings on Bloomberg.  The Big Short isn't really a Liar's Poker experience.    I enjoyed the book, and it's a quick read.  It's just that a couple of Lewis's main characters--Burry of Scion and Lippman of Deutsche--were previously covered in another book, The Greatest Trade Ever.  As a result of The Big Short being released comparatively late, some of Lewis's thunder has been stolen, so-to-speak.    Regardless, the story is well written and if I had no experience with sub-prime, structured finance products, etc., I would have enjoyed it more.  For the most part, I found myself grinding through the pages covering Burry.  Ok, sits in his darkened office, listens to heavy metal, pouring over documents, investment from Gotham Partners, at odds with investors, Goldman not valuing CDS fairly, brink of collapse, etc.  There's really little insight to add to this character if you've read The Greatest Trade Ever.  In some ways, the same can be said for Lippman.    I did enjoy reading about Eisman of Front Point and his crew.    Bottom line, if you've read The Greatest Trade Ever and you're a huge Lewis fan, you'll likely enjoy the book, but you'll be familiar with the tale.  Otherwise, there are probably other titles on your \\"To Read\\" list where your time may be better spent.    Of course, if you haven't read The Greatest Trade Ever, The Big Short should be rewarding.

0307271862|2.0|This book started out quite good with the murders in the remote hamlet, and I even thought San's journey in America was fairly interesting.  But the second half of the book really went off the rails.      We are constantly being hit by outrageous coincidences (such as Roslin randomly meeting one person in a billion in China with some association to the murders.)  Then we are subjected to two aging student radicals blathering on about their thoughts on Mao's legacy.  Then we move on to an absurd sub-plot about a plan for China to colonise Africa.    Worst of all, nothing that anyone ever does in this book makes any sense.  Why hide information from the police for no reason?  Why show that photograph around?      This is the first I've read from Henning Mankell, which I picked since I enjoyed the Wallander TV series.  But I won't be rushing out to buy the continuing adventures of Judge Birgitta Roslin...
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is by far the best movie version of the Jane Austen classic. Very true to the book and perfectly cast! I was, as always very pleased with the prompt service of Amazon. I don't trust anyone but them with my movie purchases.

B002WCLG3O|5.0|I am a huge Halo fan and I pre-ordered this so I would get it quickly. I'm glad I bought it. If you are a fan of the books and deep immersion in the Halo Universe then this is a must have item.<br /><br />That being said, I am not a fan of Anime at all. I did, however, enjoy this one. A couple of the stories are very good and the art is well done. The others are good fun, but the one episode with the over-the-top story and art starring Spartan 1337 is horrible. You have to take this one as what it is - a spoof episode.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Blu Ray and I hope some more stuff is done in the medium.
B001TZQITM|5.0|This case is just about as perfect as they come for the smaller sized camcorder. The interior is a bright yellow/orange (making it easy to see what is inside) with an interior sling to cradle the camcorder. There is just enough room under the sling to store some of the miscellany associated with the device. Three small exterior pockets will hold the rest. The bag is waterproof and sits upright on a firm base. The quality of construction is solid, this bag will most likely outlast your camcorder!    A perfect little bag to hold a smaller sized camcorder.
0765356139|4.0|The Well of Ascension, book two in Sanderson's Mistborn series, is a good follow-up to Mistborn: The Final Empire, though it suffers some from the common failing of fantasy sequels, namely that it has to rely much more exclusively on plot, rather than worldbuilding, to move the story forward.  This is to be expected somewhat, and Sanderson does a good job of not revealing all about his world in the first book (the prophecy, the kandra and so forth get more detail here).  Still, much of any \\"first\\" in a series is about detailing the world itself, the cultures, the history, and any systems of magic/supernatural abilities that exist.  If you're like me, you find these things fascinating and it makes the first book of a series one of the best, regardless of series length.  Eventually, however, such things become known to the reader, much as the system of magic, the city of Luthadel, and the history and cultures of the Final Empire are known to anyone picking up this sequel.  This, then, leads to more reliance on the plot moving forward and, while there are some very good moments in this book, the plot sometimes moves a little too slow.  For the most part, however, this is a rewarding read.  Much like the first in the series, this really picks up the pace in its final third and rewards the reader for following along with the more everyday interactions of the characters that occur prior to the unfolding of major events.  And, much like the first in the series, Sanderson reveals many plot/character twists to make his story interesting and worth following to its conclusion.
0393072231|1.0|Wake up publisher,  apparently you are still trying to sell cd's and vhs to your customers as well,  adapt or else.....
1906694176|5.0|I thought that the first book in this series the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was a mediocre serial killer mystery, the second book \\"the Girl who played with Fire\\" a heart stopping/edge of your chair action thriller, and \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" a better written version of The Firm\\". Together all three parts add up to make a top-notch trilogy. Stieg Larsson stays true to his character. At this time there is no cure for autism, and Salander, the central female character remains a unique blend of brain, brawn and social ineptitude. In the Girl Who kicked the Hornest Nest we find Salander in the hospital recovering from the severe injuries she received at the end of book two. Certainly down but never to be counted out, she fights back this time with more brain-power, then brawn. Until the last few pages......<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is an excellent journalist who will follow a story with the tenacity of a dog with a bone, he is oblivious to the impact he has on the opposite sex, and makes a better friend than lover.<br /><br />Many of the wonderful character from book two such as Detectives Bublanski and Modig are back. Berger takes a job as an administrator at a large newspaper and finds she has a stalker on her trail. We are also introduced to a secret organization within the security branch who will do anything to make sure that their illegal actions are not revealed.<br /><br />During the last 100 we are taken to court, where Salander with the help of her friends will try and defend herself against the trumped up charges against her, and try to keep herself out of a psychiatric ward.<br /><br />I had been a little concerned that perhaps this third book would have a lot of loose ends which obviously now cannot be tied up. Not the case. Not to give anything away, but those looking for poetic justice will not be disappointed. The last page actually brought tears to my eyes, as in my opinion the author got it so right. Even though I thought book one the weak link, I suggest reading them as close together as you can, so that you do not forget any of the characters. Highly recommendedeading them as close together as you can, so that you do not forget any of the characters. Highly recommended
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is really an excellent series. The imaginative setting and the excellent dialogue and scripting make this probably my favorite series. It's just a shame that it only lasted a single season.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Yes, 'Disintegration' rightfully gets all the attention. It's a masterpiece in its own right. And maybe 'Wish', unfortunately, was released as the official follow-up to it, making it unfairly \\"forgotten\\" by the public. However, I think it's truly up there with their best works. The only thing I would change about it is I would replace the filler \\"Cut\\" with the beautiful \\"The Big Hand\\". \\"Cut\\" just isn't a strong song at all in my opinion. Maybe I'll make my own version of it with \\"The Big Hand\\" replacing \\"Cut\\". :-)    An almost perfect record, IMHO. I love it.

B003063HK6|5.0|The original album rates a solid 5+ in my book, being the quintessential synth pop record of its era, and to this day an unsurpassed recording, making it a definite desert island disc.  Now we have here, in this latest 2010 Japanese SHM pressing with 9 bonus tracks, the penultimate release to date.  Aside from having been nicely remastered, the addition of several single versions, 6 on CD for the first time, makes this an essential purchase, despite the currently high price tag of over 50 bucks.  \\"Clean Clean\\" in particular is a treat, being a longer, more rocksteady take.  Based on the insert with what appears to be individual numbering, this could be a limited release.  If so, any Buggles fan will want to snap it up.    Who, besides the aforementioned fan, will want this?  Certainly, it is a unique sound, having been made in the late 70's, at the time it came across very futuristic, but not in a cheesy way, and now stands as a pop masterpiece having techno sounds that would take another one to two decades to be woven into mainstream offerings with any reliable competence.  True, the new wave era provided innumerable entries into the world of electronic pop, but the Buggles don't belong to new wave any more than to disco or punk or reggae, and not always rock, neither, although the later album, [[ASIN:B0033QEUGI Adventures in Modern Recording]] would venture more into progressive rock territory.  I guess what I'm getting at is that you may like this if you care for any of the aforementioned styles, or none of them!  There are other, cheaper editions for sale here, with samples to listen to [[ASIN:B0000257O9 Age of Plastic (+3 Bonus Tracks)]].  To me, it still sounds fresh after all these years (30?!?), due in equal measures to the inventive songwriting, and the inate production skills of the members, to be evidenced in subsequent years particulary by the many projects benefiting from Trevor Horn's musical sensibilities.
B0000017CA|5.0|I didn't hear this band until 2000, most likely because it took them a while to establish a fan base outside of Louisiana.  Holy crap this album is heavy.  Not since the Melvins Bullhead or Crowbar's entire catalog has something so devastatingly heavy been created.  Fuzzy, chunky, downtuned grungy guitars, mind-blowing vocals, and suicidally depressing lyrical subject matter.  The lead singer Dax's voice reminds me of a cross between Type O Negative's singer, Danzig, and Carcass's frontman.  The opening track, \\"The Blue\\" is a small piece of stoner rock heaven and most of the songs afterward follow suit.  The only soft tracks are \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\" and \\"The Bones of Babydolls\\"  which I didn't care for too much, they were just distracting. Now, along to a couple of the tracks that stand out, in my opinion.  \\"Tranquilized\\" is probably the most accessible song on here, a cool groove metal track that slows to a sludgy crawl in the end.  \\"Cheap Vodka\\" is an up-tempo hardcore song, and \\"Jezebel\\" opens with a blast-beat assault before turning into an awesome thrash song.   \\"Dr. Seuss is Dead\\" is an extremely  heavy, overly distorted doom metal song reminiscent of some of the Melvins' early work only drawn out to a much greater length, its transition from really slow to fairly fast  then back to slow is phenomenal.    \\"Dope Fiend\\" is my favorite track, a 90's-grunge sounding opening riff then a sludgy pitch-harmonic middle part, finally a cool thrash breakdown before going back to the grunge riff to end the song.  If you get depressed easily, don't even go near this CD.  Go buy Marilyn Manson's latest pile of recycled Hot Topic doo-doo.  If you like heavy, heavy metal this is a must-buy.  Recommended for fans of Sepultura, Pantera, Crowbar or any extreme 90's metal act.

0596522347|2.0|What I hoped this book would do is to elaborate in detail how to create a terrific presentation. The book didn't deliver for me.     On page 11 there is a wonderful detailed diagram that is a cross between a Mind Map and a Venn diagram called \\"Presentation Ecosystem\\" that illustrates what I believe to be wrong with the book.    In the center of the diagram is a large circle containing the text, \\"Presentation Ecosystem\\". Around this largest circle there are three smaller circles titled Message, Delivery, and Visual Story. Each of these three smaller circles are  connected to four smaller circles by a line. Each of the smallest circles have text points associated to them. For example the larger Message circle is connected by a line to a smaller circle called Audience. There are four points associated with the smallest circle Audience. One of the four points is, \\"Scope Content\\".    The diagram is very thought provoking but the point \\"Scope Content\\" isn't defined. The reader is left to reach their own conclusions as to what that or any of the other points means, refers too, or explains how one is to \\"Scope Content\\". While the diagram presents many things worthy of consideration it is only tangentially connected to the following page that discusses the time and focus a good presentation requires.     I look for things I can take away from a book and apply to my own situation. In this book I really didn't get any specific take aways just fuzzy considerations.     Cliff Atkinson's \\"Beyond Bullet Points\\" book is a much better choice for those seeking a specific approach i.e. details to making a better PowerPoint presentation. This book is much more sizzle than steak.

0802130208|5.0|So sad that so many readers don't like this book because the main character is obnoxious. He is indeed. He's disgusting and pathetic and at best, a sad case. The term, I believe, is \\"antihero.\\" However, the story is complex. The antihero manages to connect an astonishing number of disparate, unique characters...and they are not all pathetic and \\"bad.\\" In fact, at least two, Gus Levy and Burma Jones, ultimately do some good under difficult circumstances and are rewarded for it.  I find this book a delicious immersion in a richly-populated world with brilliantly rendered dialects. And why is it funny? For that clichéd old reason: ya gotta laugh to keep from crying - because the book is also about poverty and prejudice and ignorance and all sorts of unpleasant things other than a fat guy who masturbates.  But if you don't think farts are funny (even Montaigne did, by the way, so don't feel superior about it) and are easily offended by anything \\"icky,\\" don't bother with this book. Farts and other evidence of our animal nature are funny - it's far better to laugh at them than to pretend they don't exist. As do Ignatius J. Reilly \\"types,\\" though usually without the fictional character's excess of eloquence. Perhaps it's precisely the eloquence which makes Ignatius tolerable and even hilarious.
0142410373|1.0|Read about Roald Dahl's life, his upbringing, the kind of folk stories that appealed to him, the kind of stories he wrote for adults and you'll get a picture of why Matilda is written as it is. The author grew up in abusive English boarding schools, and that comes through loud and clear. But since when is vengeance and spiteful retaliation something to encourage in children? Ok, so this book shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I can see some kids getting the idea from Matilda, that it's ok to play nasty pranks on parents or teachers they think are being mean to them. Dahl's emotional baggage comes through clearly in this book.     I think it's ironic that Dahl, speaking through Matilda, criticizes the works of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as being too serious for children, and not having any humor in them. Matilda is all humor, using absurd comic situations, to teach kids that it's ok to anonymously exact justice using whatever means necessary. Lewis openly teaches about self-sacrifice for others, forgiveness, and redemption. Tolkien teaches on the folly of greed, selfishness, and pride, and the virtues of unity, courage, and humility. And Lewis and Tolkien often make use of humor in their writings. What is Dahl teaching?
B0039UTDFG|2.0|Oprah might be better than Sigourney Weaver, but why can't they just leave the guru of nature documentaries to the job.  Why does this have to be one of those things where it is just here in the U.S. that we can't let something be good and leave it at that?  Oprah is good at making my mom cry doing shows that are the TV equivalent of People magazine updates (well, mostly), and balancing out with useful outreach fundraisers, etc.  BBC does it right.  Discovery Channel tries too hard yet again
B0010X745K|5.0|Wow, Wow, and Wow...... This was something, as King always makes and writes good suspense movies and books. This one took us for a good thriller ride. There are good lessons to learn from this movie as well, I don't know what was in the mist and I don't want to give the movie away with talking about what I saw. You will have to view the movie yourself to see what it is all about. All I know is that you will enjoy the movie... get ready for some suspense and screams.... Enjoy!
B0031OCY2E|2.0|I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. I know Matt Damon is a great actor and I have seen him do a lot better. This was not what I expected and I found it very dull and anyone could have played the parts.  Sorry I bought it and it left a lot out. Boring sums it up
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Wow, I just finished watching this film a few days ago, and I am utterly disappointed. It is really disappointing when I'm watching a film, and the entire time I'm imagining how I would approach the material to make a better film. When you find yourself doing that, then you know there's something wrong with what you're watching. Was it worth the view? Yes, only once. I must admit that I was impressed with most of the special effects, and that is the only reason I kept the movie rather than return it back to the store. Everything else, though, failed miserably for me. For one thing, some great actors delivered some of their poorest work here. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are usually very likable and talented actors, but in this film, their little daughter exceeded their acting skills, crying when it was appropriate to cry and feeling scared when it was appropriate to get scared. All we get from them is wide-eyed wonder when they see their home get destroyed. When the movie ended, a few things entered my mind to justify for the piece of crap I just saw. I began to tell myself that the filmmakers intended for the story to be so unrealistic so they wouldn't freak out half of our population. If a more dark and realistic picture would have been made, perhaps there would have been severe consequences. 2012 is a film not meant to be taken seriously. In fact, it made it seem so comical, that I doubt anyone will believe the end of the world is at hand any longer.     I will say, this movie is filled with flaws; it is, overall, crap. However, it does have some very impressive visuals that can be enhanced and fully appreciated on blu-ray, and it does have some intense scenes that, despite their absurdity, will get you involved. I suggest you see it before you buy it. I, personally do not regret buying it because I purchased it on blu-ray, and felt it really elevated the experience and made it worthwhile for me. If I had gotten it on dvd, I would have returned it right away.
0316044938|3.0|It started out very well, it grabbed my attention and started pulling me in and then it just seemed to fizzle out. I was very disappointed with the last quarter of the book.
0393072231|5.0|In order to offset the \\"REVIEWS\\" that Amazon allows I give this unread book by Mr. Lewis five stars. If Amazon allows bogus 1 star reviews, here's one for a great writer. I own the new Kindle but I am not associating with the disgusting behavior of the Kindle community.  AMAZON YOUR RATING SYSTEM IS LOSING CREDIBILITY!
0393072231|4.0|I love Michael Lewis, and have read all his books.  This book is terrific, I just wish his publisher had not tried to punish people with Kindles.  That is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.
B000FSME1A|5.0|My husband had this movie once before, and someone borrowed it, never to be seen again. He was very surprised with his new copy. I loved the service as I was kept informed by shipping notices, and speedy delivery. I definately give a 5***** plus rating, and will be buying again. Thanks once again for such positive service.
006190628X|5.0|Expected something different, based on the movie trailers, and was surprised to find a twisted, fascinating and profoundly sad tale of love.  Probably won't see the movie, but it was well worth the read.  Like following bread crumbs through a dark forest.  Loved it, but then it is Dennis Lehane.
0307463745|5.0|Do yourself a favor and spend a few hours of your time and read REWORK cover to cover.  It's not long, the essays are short and straight to the point.  The advice may seem obvious but you'll have many \\"ah-ha\\" moments throughout the book as the gentlemen from 37Signals can really make a point.  And because it's such a short read, don't hesitate to purchase the $9.99 Kindle copy to read on your iPhone to save yourself a few bucks and if you don't, pass the book on to a friend and do them a favor.  I read the book on my Kindle DX and the images render wonderfully (which there are plenty of, and they're all quite clever and fit in well with the book).
B002T9H2ME|5.0|While at the video store, I pulled up my Amazon iPhone app and read reviews for movies that were on the shelf - but that I had not heard of.  I wanted something that was not mainstream - but would surprise me.  I came across Moon and then read these reviews.  The rating was higher than a lot of other films and the reviews here seemed very favorable...  So I gave \\"Moon\\" a shot (pun intended).  It was GREAT.  Thank you Amazon reviewers for giving this film its due credit. Because of you, I was able to enjoy it too.
006112429X|2.0|It is a rare event for me not to finish a book--particularly when I'm facing into a long day of plane travel. Though Shriver's writing is incandescent, and the tragedy potentially gripping,  I listen to the narrator describe herself running through one STOP SIGN after another, apparently caring so little for her own well-being or that of her daughter that she uses her brain only to create excuses. Ultimately I simply didn't want to hear another word from her.  I wanted to be written into the book as the next-door neighbor that called Child Protective Services and got ALL of them some help.
B001TODCII|4.0|\\"Taken\\" is a well made action flick and also a fantasy of revenge and redemption, starring Liam Neeson as retired CIA operative Bryan Mills. It's the kind of role that Harrison Ford might have done well with 10 or 15 years ago. Neeson is very good, but he doesn't have Ford's humor, and the script is mostly humorless, too.    Mills's ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen, Jean Grey in the X-Men franchise), dumped him ostensibly because Mills's CIA work kept him away from home, but she then managed to marry some very rich guy. Mills lives in L.A. to be closer to their teen-aged daughter, Kim.    Mills gets his chance to prove his worth -- when everyone else seems worthless -- when Kim, on a trip to Paris with a girlfriend, Amanda, is kidnapped by an Albanian gang that targets young, attractive Western women and, we learn, forces them into prostitution and sexual slavery. Mills tells the kidnappers on the telephone, \\"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.\\"    Through the rest of the movie, Mills makes good on his promise.    Along the way, the flick shamelessly panders to American prejudices. I dunno; maybe other people share the same prejudices. The Albanian bad guys seem to be Muslims. The French may be civilized, but they are useless, unprincipled, and corrupt. The most repulsive bad guy is an old, rich, corpulent, lascivious Arab sheik. Another really bad guy is an American businessman. He tells Mills not to take things personally, because selling Kim to the highest bidder was just business. (Maybe this is supposed to sound like when a health insurance companycuts off coverage to a customer who's gotten sick; that's just business, too. Nothing personal.) Mills doesn't reply but shoots the businessman dead.  Mills doesn't negotiate or hesitate; he's a pure man of action. He tortures. He kills. He shows no mercy. In one key scene, a bad guy holds a knife to a hostage's throat. He starts to say, \\"We can nego--\\", but Mills shoots him in the head.    There's nothing erotic in this PG-13 flick, but there are strong sexual themes. Much is made of the fact that Kim is a virgin. Mills at first refuses permission for Kim to go to Europe, which he sees as dangerous and corrupting, but he eventually gives in to the lies and manipulations of his ex-wife, Lenore.  Even before the kidnappers show up, we learn he was right to be wary. Kim's friend, Amanda, sees the trip as a sexual adventure for the two of them and nothing at all like the harmless trip to visit Paris museums that Kim and Lenore had described to Mills. This is not spelled out, but Lenore, like Amanda, probably saw the trip as a chance for Kim gain sexual experience. After the kidnapping, Kim's virginity saves her. It makes her a valuable commodity unlike the experienced and hence disposable Amanda. At a subsequent auction of abducted women, Kim is offered as the last and most valuable item because of her \\"certified purity.\\" Mills's race to save Kim sometimes seems like a race to save her virginity as much as her life. Make of this what you will.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Not even good enough to use as a leveler for uneven furniture. I am amazed at the hypocrisy of a guy who has become a millionare claiming to expose the hypocrisy of millionares.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|In the era when MTV still gave a crap about not pandering to the lowest common denominator with its programming, there was \\"Daria\\".<br /><br />The irony is, \\"Daria\\" was spun off from the ridiculous, but admittedly amusing, \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" series. Where that show gleefully wallowed in the stupid and moronic, \\"Daria\\" went in the opposite direction. Using her sarcasm, commentary, and general cynicism, the show showed that one could be intelligent and blunt but still be entertaining. In its way, the show dealt with the usual crap of being a teen without being preachy, moralistic, or boring. And it assumed that the audience was smart. Which MTV obviously no longer does.<br /><br />Admittedly, I am not in the demographic for this show (30s), but a smart show is a smart show, and I have waited for this series for ages. It is long past time this series is finally being released. Maybe it will make some remember when MTV was relevant, socially aware, and treated young people like thinking beings and not Barbie and Ken dolls for reality TV crap. I think - if one like smart shows with an edge - one would love \\"Daria\\", regardless of age. (Ironically, I think the character of Daria, if she existed naturally, would have plenty to say about the state of the channel today that she originated from. And none of it good! LOL!)<br /><br />On the downside, I am 99.999% sure there will be music deletions and substitutions, the dreaded \\"rights issues\\". While I do wish that would be left intact, I guess I could see where it would be cost prohibitive, and this series is too good to sit in a vault because of it. Which is why I still give this DVD set five stars regardless of that issue. So, I will live with the music changes. But complain. Daria would be pleased!<br /><br />In short, if you like animation, wit, fun, intelligence, and snark (of which there is plenty!), let \\"Daria\\" entertain you! You'll feel smarter for it.<br /><br />Edited to add, as I have answered another review viathe comment link, and it may not be readily seen: Daria the Musical episode *is* included on this DVD set, making it, as advertised, the \\"complete\\" series! Its production number was 301; however, MTV used \\"Through A Lens Darkly\\" as the Season 3 premiere years ago, and the DVD order is the same way. Daria The Musical is episode #7 in Season 3, as it was when it originally aired. And it is the one episode retaining its original end music over the alter egos/credits.<br /><br />Also, regrettably, \\"Is It College Yet\\" is again the edited version, but from another account here in the discussion thread regarding this set, MTV tried for the unedited version, but the master of the audio and video could not be located to synchronize, so the edited version it is. There is also the belief that copyright played a role in using the edited version, as well. However, one episode in the grand scheme of things is not bad!
B000007U6V|4.0|Autobahn is a seminal classic, living beyond our lifetimes in both the \\"electronic\\" genre, & in music as a whole.  A few comments about the CD:<br />The remastering repro is excellent.  The original Vertigo vinyl LP of Autobahn was banded into 7 separate but continuous sections; would have liked to see that here on the CD.  Would be interesting for CD players with random track-order scramblers.<br />The 4 other selections are also vintage Kraftwerk, but I would have appreciated at least a few others to fill up the disc, maybe from the frustratingly hard-to-round up Kraftwerk \\"1 & 2\\" or from \\"Ralf & Florian\\".  Total time of this Autobahn disk 43 minutes.<br />The music is 7-star quality; these observations dock my disk rating to 4 stars.
B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|Yes, it would have been great if Criterion released this blu-ray, fully restored and remastered in all its glory.  But this StudioCanal blu-ray does not deserve the wild condemnations it's received.  It certainly looks better on my blu-ray player than the Criterion DVD (now out of print).  And the most important Criterion extra--Chris Marker's documentary AK, about the making of Ran--is included on StudioCanal's disc too.    I saw the recently remastered print of Ran earlier this year in the theater, and this blu-ray is a fine approximation of what I saw.  My hunch is that the problems people have with this transfer are related to original film materials that just may not be in pristine condition, even with the latest remastering.  StudioCanal may have compounded the problems with a less-than-consistently-stellar digitalization, but, again, this is the best way to see Ran out of all the existing home video versions.  The biggest problem is that some scenes look fantasticly vivid and sharp, while others are soft.  But that was true of the print I saw in the theater.    About the film: its power remains undiminished, 25 years later.  Harold Bloom once said he thought this film and Kurosawa's \\"Throne of Blood\\" were the best Shakespeare adaptations on film.  An opinion open to debate, to be sure, but he's on to something.  Certainly Lear's descent into madness has rarely been as  viscerally and shatteringly conveyed.  This is late-stage Kurosawa, where the graveness of tone and deliberation of pacing add a layer of richness and depth to the expected visual splendor.  And Toru Takemitsu's haunting score (consciously recalling Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, and its intertwining of East-West musical styles) is surely one of the great film scores of all time and adds immeasurably to the film's power.      To sum up: could have been better, but a dramatic improvement is probably not likely until the film gets a proper restoration.  Let's be grateful for this perfectly fineblu-ray, especially when attractively discounted by amazon.

1439170045|5.0|For me, what makes this book very special is that somehow the author has managed to tell this story from Alice's view. This sets it apart from other books on the subject.    Alice is a woman in her early fifties who discovers she has alzheimers disease. She is very smart and has a husband and a family and the story tells about her experiences with them, as she falls more and more victim to the disease.      Because this story is told from Alice's view and experiences, I have gained some insight into what is going on with a couple of my aging relatives and how I can better deal with them in a loving, constructive way.     Even if you have no experience with Alzheimers disease, this is still very interesting reading.  I read this book in one sitting.    I will not get into the specifics.  For me, I enjoy the surprises that come along while reading a book.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|So if it is simply amazing why only four stars?  I guess that is because of the conundrum surrounding the Beatles re-releases.  The the music is amazingly, almost insidiously brilliant is beyond doubt.  The sheer amount of songs on all of these albums that are recognizable is beyond doubt.  The Beatles influence on modern music cannot, in my estimation, be underrated.  All of the albums have remarkable musical strengths.  In this mono re-release my standout three would be Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt Peppers.  So the downside.  The downside...  Nothing to do with the actual music, but rather, the apparent greed of the label. For the vast majority of the Beatles albums sound better on the mono release.  The latter albums sound better in stereo, and, the mono version does not contain the later releases that were stereo only (Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, Let it Be, also the videos).  So you have three choices:  1) Buy the mono, and if you want the latter albums, buy them separately. Considering the mono version is more expensive to start with this is a frustrating option.  2) Buy the stereo version. You get all the albums, and thus some sense of completeness, with this method. But not all, or even the majority are in their optimal format.  3) Buy both. Maybe the only way to make sure you get your preferred version of each album. The obvious annoyance, is cost. And who really wants to buy two boxed sets for completeness sake, apart from those like me who want both optimal and completeness. It does annoy me that to get this I needed to have so much space taken up, but, such is life.    Comparatively, my review is not as good, nor anywhere as extensive as many of the others here, that is obvious, but as a mainly metal fan I still have to admit to this bands genius and believe most collections are replete without at least one of these re-releases. It's just a shame about the purchasing options..  If you do a review of many of the 4 star reviews you will see a lot of comments along the same line.  I also want to be absolutely clear here.  My review is based on this is a product.  Not just the music.  I wish I could have separate reviews for them both but I cannot - in fact it would be very handy for the Amazon system to have review sections with something along the lines of Music/Packaging/etc with the overall rating out of that being used as the main score.  I also wish there was some way to have a review of both albums combined in the amazon system but that is not possible.  As per my stereo boxed set review, it is a shame that the releases have come out like this, but I have to recommend the stereo boxed set over this mono as a product, especially if you only wish to own one of the boxed sets for whatever reason you have, although  if you are a completist or a purist (I may be both to my wallets distress) then buy both.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|The movie is fantastic I have seen it before I just wanted my own copy. I purchased it from moviesonsale and I would not recomend them. They said it was used in new condition, well it has some glitches where the digital stop and does nothing for about 15 seconds then continues. If they sell like new that should mean like new without glitches in it. No fault of AMAZON it was MOVIESONSALE.
0393072231|5.0|I just read through all the reviews. 35 of 41 one-star reviews were to punish Amazon for not making the book available on Kindle at the time of their review.  They haven't read the book and don't intend to until it's on Kindle--but that's not going to stop them from punishing Michael Lewis to get back at Amazon.  I suppose Amazon should have two rating systems--one for what the author actually wrote, and a second to tally the numbers of those expressing disapproval for the book not being available on Kindle.     The Big Short is a wonderful read, well-written and informative.  Lewis is a storyteller who roots his understanding of human activity in humans rather than in larger \\"processes\\".  There's nothing wrong with observing the latter, but without humans there would be no economics, financial markets, etc.  Nature doesn't provide for them, people do, and people have stories.  They make decisions. They do intelligent things, selfish things and nutty things. These things are the threads woven into the larger tapestry.  Lewis doesn't tell the WHOLE story of the financial meltdown, but he identifies many of the key players and how their decisions made a difference to the Big Short.  He names Names. His prose, as always, is clear, witty and informative.  The Big Short filled in many gaps in my understanding of how smart people can make a lot of money without really knowing (or caring) about how their industry actually works or what the consequences of their decisions might be.  Makes you wonder.

B002UZXJA6|3.0|We love Celtic woman's other albums and bought this just because it was another one from them. We were disappointed with this album. It sounds more like pop music than the other albums. They departed from the pure vocal sound of their other albums, both in song choice and vocal style. There are two or three good songs on it.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|Yeah i said it, you probabaly think so too. The album was just a little too far out there for me, i enjoyed some of it. If your into the whole electronica/keyboard/experimental stuff this cd is it, if your expecting something like demon days, think again. The whole album made me feel like i was waiting for something to begin. Most of the songs on here feel like they dont actually start til 2 minutes into the song. Too busy messing around with the keyboard, the beats are enjoyable, but to an extent. I'm not saying this is a terrible cd, but its not great. Save your money and time, dont buy the whole album. Songs i would recommend: \\"Welcome to the world of the plastic beach\\", \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\",\\"Somekind of Nature\\", \\"On Melancholy Hill\\", and \\"Pirate Jet\\"
0307266303|5.0|If you're a runner, or have ever been a runner, you'll love the book,\\"Born to Run.\\" The author, Christopher McDougall, begins the journey in Mexico inspired by the Tarahumara, a tribe living in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, that live, eat and drink like they have for centuries. These people run endlessly, for fun and (most intriguing) in sandals! McDougall argues that these, largely unknown, people may be the best runners in the world and they have NO HEALTH ISSUES!    But the Tarahumara are not the only runners in this book and it doesn't take place only in Mexico. There are crazy stories about people that love running above all else, that drink wildly before insanely long runs, and run in climates and on terrain that few would ever consider. All of this is told as the story is woven into and out of nightlong races of incredible distances with unbelievable athletes often in dangerous areas.    Also interesting, McDougall explores the idea that humans are born to run, literally! He claims that running is a part of who we are, and in fact, at the core of our existence. He evaluates why our ancestors outlived the Neanderthals, and why today's expensive running shoes actually increase a runner's probability of getting hurt. It's a great read... fun, entertaining and interesting.     [...]
0439023483|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can't put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment. Written along the lines of Stephen King's THE LONG WALK or Orwell's 1984 (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, romance, scripted realism and survival that you shouldn't miss.<br /><br />Set in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the whys, how's or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin. Each year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It's kind of like survivor but instead of being voted off you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss's younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Oddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can't end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.<br /><br />This is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you've finished. Cheers!aragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|We have the Peg Perego UNO style stroller which came with 1 cup holder that goes on the side of the stroller.  Our stroller is pretty wide for a single rider stroller so it made it difficult when going through doors or small aisles with the cup holder.  Putting the stroller in and out of the car finally broke the plastic cup holder leaving us with nothing.  I bought this item hoping it would be the solution and YES YES YES.  It was worth it.  I can keep my keys zipped up in the pocket along with my chapstick,my son's snack bag, and 2 drinks.  I was worried it would shake all over the place but it doesn't.  It stays in one place and doesn't rock back and forth.  I can also keep it attached to the stroller and fold it up.  It doesn't need to be removed each time which is great so it doesn't get lost!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!

B00003CWPL|1.0|I thought I would sit back and enjoy a cult classic,as everyone claims this movie is, one Saturday afternoon. Instead I was punished with this worthless movie. The lead Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) does a wonderful job of playing a nervous misfit. Other than him the other actors/actress's are awful and/or over the top. If Lynch's goal was to make the viewer feel sick,bored and numb then he passed with flying colors.
B001224V14|5.0|I don't have the entire album, I just bought a couple of songs from this MP3 album. I would like to say holy cow to the music video for Erotica. The song, really good. The music video, I guess it's alright. The songs that I bought from this album were Erotica, Deeper and Deeper, and Bad Girl. I love Rain a lot but I didn't buy it from this album. I got it from Something To Remember.  I really love Deeper and Deeper the best. Bad Girl is a good, sad love song.     Madonna is a really great artist and a lot of people think she's something other than great, which I find dumb but it's people's opinions. Sure she shows skin and stuff but I don't care. She might've gotten political in her American Life CD, but I could really care less about what people say. This album is one of her many great works and I know she'll keep making more great music. Heck she is in her early 50's and she is STILL bad ass. What I'm trying to say is, SHE'S THE QUEEN. She can practically do whatever she wants. Whether people like what she does or not, it doesn't matter. She can make great music, and she can put on great tours.     Buy this MP3 album or her physical album of Erotica. You can't go wrong with it.

0061537969|5.0|This book was the first in a VERY long time that has gripped me from page 1.  Told by a dog, it's filled with the fun loving ridiculousness you would expect your 4 pawed friends to think about.  But it also takes us down a journey of heartbreak, depression, and turmoil.<br /><br />It teaches us to endure and to never stop dreaming.  It makes points that we could all do better to try to understand and adopt, philosophies that many of us have probably never contemplated.  But it's in no way written in a ridiculous proverb form.<br /><br />Enzo the dog (named after Ferrari's father) has spent his life watching TV, movies, and most importantly to he and his semi-pro race driver father, car races.  Even when the story gets deep, Enzo never seems to lose his fun.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book as soon as you possibly can!
0385737947|4.0|Good story. Some phrases were overused, such as \\"he/she rolled his/her eyes\\".  Some of the dialogue was a bit corny. But the story was interesting enough to keep my interest and desire to see what happens.  I would recommend the book, just don't expect a classic work of writing.
B00394DOE8|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.  Page-turner is absolutely the way to describe it. You will be pushing for the women to finally get out of their situation and hoping that the husband will fall sooner than later. The quiet sorrow that the main characters experience is so real that you'll be right there with them trying to grasp on to whatever shred of dignity and self they have left.  One of the best books I've ever read. The author just does an unparalleled job of describing everything so well that the sensations can almost be personally felt.

B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This is my favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre. I didn't know either of the main actors when I first watched this on PBS, but this adaptation inspired me to look them up and get to know their work. I received this item as a birthday present and watched it already half a dozen times in the first week I owned it. I have no problems with the quality of the video/audio in general. However, I'm only giving this item a 3 star review (though I'd like to give it higher) because it does not have subtitles (which I sometimes need when watching with other people in the house, where the background noise can drown out the dialogue). It offers a closed captioning option, but you need to use your T.V. control for that, and the closed-captions appear very clunky and intrusive onscreen. I'm not sure if that's particular to my T.V. or the closed-captioning itself.     Also, I was hoping there would be some special features: behind the scenes, cast & crew interviews, deleted scenes, or perhaps even a presentation on Charlotte Bronte's work and her heroines. But sadly, this particular product does not include those. There is also an option to access \\"extra material\\" via your computer, which is not accessible when watching the DVDs on a regular DVD player. However, even on my computer, when I access the \\"CD-ROM\\" option, there's nothing there, except a note saying \\"copy & paste\\" the Masterpiece Theater url into your browser for bonus material. Yet, I couldn't find bonus material in the Masterpiece Theater website specifically for Jane Eyre. It leaves me to wonder why that option is in the DVD.    So in summary: Wonderful movie to have and watch at home. If you don't need subtitles or aren't bothered/distracted by closed-captions, then my review doesn't matter. Technically speaking, there's not much offered beyond the series itself, which to me is surprising given this is a very recent film production. I noticed it has become almost standard these days to include bonus features in DVD versions of films & television shows. I was hoping that such an epic undertaking as this Jane Eyre production would have had some nice background material to accompany it. It would certainly make this product more valuable to have.    If they re-released this product with interesting bonus material, I'd most likely buy that version too.
0307386856|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

B0035G9ABG|4.0|The Gorillaz have always been a mash up of sorts: At once they are four cartoon characters that make up the band, while simultaneously existing as collaboration between real life beings Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. This mixture of synthetic and concrete elements also correlates to the mixture of analog and digital instrumentation heard in their music. While much of the Gorillaz is fantasy, one thing that remains true: the music they create is real.  Their third studio album, Plastic Beach begins fittingly: with an ethereal, ambient beach sound-scape with birds (even the Gorillaz love bird noises!) and the ocean setting the mood. The texture slowly shifts into a low rhythm, with a short verse from none other than Snoop Dogg starting off the album right. If this weren't enough of an indication this isn't your standard pop album, the track segues into a collaboration with the Lebanese National Orchestra, a mixture of live instrumentation with wet synth patches that swell and surge like the sea they are meant to represent. Finally, four songs deep in the album, we hear the Gorillaz fearless leader Damon Albarn's familiar drawl over a beat anchored by classical guitar, but focusing on squeaks and pops evoking children's toys, not at all dissimilar to the MICE piece Sxueak. Strong synthesizer patches shoulder and support the track, as a nearly unintelligible vocal sample engages in a call and response with Albarn.  The albums memorable single, Stylo is up next. It features a driving bass line, as well as guest appearances from Mos Def and Bobby Womack. The song is unrelenting in its build: a modular synth line leads in to Bobby Womack's powerful verse, which evokes a feeling of struggle and despair, but feels strangely resolved over the rhythm. The video, while not explicitly within the piece, falls right in line with the feeling of the piece, as it depicts a seemingly endless car chase and shootout. Mos Def's vocal comes in distorted, as if he is shouting through a loudspeaker, which only adds to the texture of the song.   The collaborations continue throughout the album. Hip hop veterans De La Soul steal the show on Superfast Jellyfish, which begins with a 70's microwave-breakfast ad sample, and transitioning into a funky groove with shimmering synth lines augmented by clean guitar chords and chimes. The textures are continually thrown at you throughout the song, with ascending and descending lines evoking sirens, all the while adding urgency to the song. The line \\"don't waste time\\" seems to drive this point home.   The next song deviates much from the digital feel of the past songs, as it features only piano and guitar instrumentation, albeit with heavy amounts of reverb and delay. Albarn's vocals are front and center here on Empire Ants, which features electronic group Little Dragon. The album picks right back up with Glitter Freeze, which features a wildly distorted and farty bass line, complete with laser beam synth lines and a reverb drenched drum track. The spoken vocal track is heavily affected and almost scares the listener with its propaganda-like delivery.   The album continues with a guest spot from none other than Lou Reed, whose laid back delivery is set against a happy melodic line and Albarn's detracted vocals. The album picks up steam from here, finishing out strongly, with highlights including On Melancholy Hill (the second single), and Sweepstakes, again featuring Mos Def. One of the final highlights is the title track itself, which features Paul Simonon and Mick Jones, both veterans of another Damon Albarn project called The Good the Bad and the Queen. The song is the epitome of the Gorillaz: a perfect medley of analog and electronic instrumentation. It starts with a live bass and guitar track, but in no time at all there are upwards of four synth lines adding textures and melodies that soar, bubble, and pop within the mix. The lyrics seem to echo the feeling of the song, with the chorus being \\"A Casio on a plastic beach\\", which, when you think about it, is the perfect summary of the Gorillaz sound.

The ideas presented are not only refreshing, but inspirational. Some of the ideas are common sense, but it seems like a lot of companies lack that these days.<br /><br />This book doesn't use big vocabulary or daunting business terms; it is written like a conversation with a friend: simple and elegant. If you ever wanted to start your own business, this book may provide the confidence to get the ball rolling. For everyone else, give a copy to management at work.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|With THE LOST SYMBOL, Dan Brown does what he does best:  he entertains us, he teaches us something, and he makes us THINK.  If a book can do just one of these things, then the book has done its job.  If it can do all three things, then it becomes a story to be remembered, ruminated over, and discussed, long after the reading is done.  THE LOST SYMBOL is just such a book.  Is THE LOST SYMBOL \\"Dan Brown formulaic?\\"  Absolutely.  But it is also a thrilling, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat page turner that will keep you reading late into the night, your heart pounding in your chest, gasping at the possibilities.<br /><br />In THE LOST SYMBOL, world renowned symbologist Robert Langdon is back, and this time his adventures take us to the heart of our nation, Washington DC.  Robert's dearest friend is missing, and only Robert and his unique knowledge can save him.  Robert must plunge into the world of our nation's founders, ancient history, and the iconic symbols of Masonry to solve an age old legend.  Can he do it in time?  Can Robert save his friend?  And perhaps the world?<br /><br />I like Dan Brown's writing style; it suits me.  Short, sound-bite chapters with lots of action crammed in, keep the reader submerged in the story, not wanting to put THE LOST SYMBOL down.  In this day and age of over programmed lives, this style also lets me read in short bursts, during five minute breaks, and still feel like I have made progress.  These bursts of excitement also ensure that I return as soon as possible to read more.<br /><br />Additionally, I enjoy the history lessons that are enmeshed in Dan Brown books.  I always learn something, and THE LOST SYMBOL certainly makes you look at things - both ordinary and famous, both historical and modern - in a whole new light.  After reading THE LOST SYMBOL, I, for one, would love to spend time in Washington DC, examining our national monuments and wandering the halls of the Smithsonian.  I don't know how much of what Dan Brown writes is true, how much is fiction, and how much is old information put together in new ways, but I don't care.  THE LOST SYMBOL makes me want to do the research and find out.<br /><br />For an exciting roller coaster of a thriller, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE LOST SYMBOL.  It will leave you breathless and curious, which is a winning combination.<br /><br />As a side note, the premise of this story surprisingly reminds me of another book, from another decade in a completely different genre.  I think readers of A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Robert A. Heinlein will find THE LOST SYMBOL strangely familiar.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved this book.  IMO is Dan Brown's best yet.  It was a deeper, more thought provoking work then any of his others.
0307463745|3.0|If you paid full price for this book, you'd feel cheated given that it is 1/3 blank pages, 1/3 full page illustrations and 1/3 actual content. The content itself was done more succinctly by Nike, ie: \\"Just Do It.\\" To that the authors would add, \\"it worked for us.\\" I actually thought that the book was somewhat inspiring (hence my 3-star review), but there wasn't anything in it that hasn't been said on the author's blog, so for anyone who follows 37 Signals, you aren't getting anything new.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The sophomore album from the cartoon-character-headlined band Gorillaz is a solid mixture of computer created music and \\"real\\" instruments. Furthermore, Gorillaz is able to incorporate many different genres into the album while still maintaining a harmonious flow throughout the album, each song working individually while also contributing to the whole.   Gorillaz are naturally able to draw upon many genres due to the backgrounds of all the artists involved. Blur's Damon Albarn and the dj Danger Mouse work together to bring their rock and electronic music influences together that are apparent in most of the tracks. The two then bring in additional artists to create an array of styles throughout the album. For example, De La Soul's inclusion in the hit single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" Songs \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"November Has Come\\" also have strong hip hop influences. \\"All Alone\\" features British rapper Roots Manuva and Martina Topley-Bird, who has gained prominence in the trip hop scene. Other noticeable styles include a Franz Ferdinand style guitar rhythm in White Light, also mixed with an electronic compilation of music. Demon Days ends the album on a reggae note with a strong influence of the genre's rhythm.   Gorillaz are able to create such unorthodox beats and sounds while also using fairly orthodox instruments. Working in tandem with the digitally produced sounds of Danger Mouse come the sounds of cellos, violins, pianos, and both electronic and acoustic guitars. Most songs on the album, especially in the beginning and on the ones with hip hop elements, feature heavy bass beats produced either by computer or by a bass guitar.    Although not uncommon, the Gorillaz use two other interested effects in their sophomore album. The use of choirs appears in at least two songs, especially in the single \\"Dirty Harry\\". Also, spoken word is a common trait in electronic music. But the inclusion of famous actor Dennis Hopper as a narrator to a mythical story told over computerized beats and an acoustic guitar rhythm provides \\"Fire Coming Out of Monkey's Head\\" with a certain uniqueness. The story seems to come to an end, only to have a dreamy, angelic epilogue come in the form of the next song, \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\". In fact, the whole album seem to have a dark ambiance until this point, where it seems to be coming towards a resolution of the entire album. Whether this escape from the melancholy can be wholly interpreted as a happy ending is certainly a personal opinion, my opinion being that it is strictly an ending and an escape with happiness being void.   It's interesting to see many people attempting to put the Gorillaz Demon Days into a genre. Some label it as alternative rock, electronica, or even dance. For me, dance elements are rare. Electronica and alternative rock seem to cover most of the album's personality, with the small inclusion of other elements such as hip hop. What's apparent is that the brain children of the Gorillaz, Danger Mouse and Damon Albarn, have incorporated their styles and the styles of guest artists to create something that seems to streamline into a story. With all the different elements synthesized to work together, it's difficult to think of the album in terms of genres. Instead, it's best just to take it in as a total listening experience.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|My only disappointment was that I thought this was the last season - looks like I'm gonna have to do this again next year.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|As much as I love Sade, I have to be objective and say that I was dissapointed with this album.  The first four songs are strong but the rest of the album is only average (by her standards).  That's not to say these other songs aren't any good, it's just that they all seem to have a similar tempo/mood and they end up just blending into one another with no real stand-out tracks.  A couple more catchy, up tempo songs, preferably with drums instead of a drum machine, would have made for a stronger, more balanced album that measures up to her earlier work.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|As a fan of both the book and the 1995 BBC version, I have to say this was a wonderful effort by both the cast and director.   The 1995 version is faithful to the novel, but then again, it had 5 hours to tell the story.  Time restrictions on this film of course lead to the omission of various scenes and characters but the director gives you enough to understand the story fully.    Visually, it's a beautiful piece of film. The sets were awe inspiring. And that sunset scene at the end--oh my, was so glorious.  Macfadyen is simply breathtaking as Mr. Darcy. He is easy on the eyes. One thing I loved is that he seemed to really show, by way of his mannerisms, Mr. Darcy's awkwardness and insecurities. When he grabs Elizabeth's hand, that first instant of skin to skin contact, his reaction is heartwarming. In another instance, when he enters the room and surprises Elizabeth, the way he just played with his gloves was amazing and it really gave you insight as to what Mr. Darcy was feeling at the moment. Colin Firth was exceptional as Mr. Darcy but Macfadyen gave him a good run for his money.    Kiera did a nice job as Elizabeth. A wonderful effort on her part.    All in all, the film was a fine effort. I thoroughly enjoyed it and although I prefer the 1995 version (because of its wholeness and Mr. Colin Firth), the film is a visual stunner, and worth seeing.

B001HN694K|3.0|Alice in Wonderland (Tim Burton, 2010)<br /><br />I just looked back over the spreadsheet, after sorting by director and year. With the inclusion of Alice in Wonderland, I have seen, reviewed, and rated ten Tim Burton-directed films. (Two others, Batman Returns and Mars Attacks!, I've seen, but don't remember enough about to rate. I plan to go back and rewatch them eventually.) I was initially kind of surprised at the average rating, which is pretty low, but when it comes right down to it, the best \\"Tim Burton\\" movie ever made was not actually directed by Burton (Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas, on which Burton served as a producer). And his recent outings have fared pretty miserably with me, with the exception of The Corpse Bride. I don't think it's a case, as was hypothesized on The Rotten Tomatoes Show, of the public (in this case, me) getting tired of Burton's same old visual tricks. No, when I look a little further into this, I see a pattern, and the Corpse Bride exception noted above may have already tipped you off to it: in every case but one on my spreadsheet, the higher-rated movies are Burton originals, and the lower-rated movies are adaptations. (The sole exception is Burton's first Batman film.) And in that regard, Alice in Wonderland is my favorite Burton adaptation since that first Batman movie over twenty years ago, but I still don't think it measures up to Burton classics like Beetlejuice and Ed Wood.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland gives us, in essence, a sequel to the story we're all used to from countless other films based on Carroll; in this one, Alice (Skin's Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and believes her childhood trip to Wonderland was a dream. On the verge of becoming engaged to Hamish (Kinky Boots' Leo Bill), Alice, who has ever strained against Victorian conformity, runs off following a hare in a waistcoat. Then down the rabbit hole, &c., &c., and back to the world that she believes to be in her dreams. She hooks up with the usual suspects, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and is told of her true destiny: the kingdom is dying under the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her pet enforcer, the Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee). The Hatter and his rebel pals want to see the White Queen (Brokeback Mountain's Anne Hathaway) reinstalled on the throne, and it has been foretold that only Alice can defeat the jabberwocky in battle. But first, she has to get the Vorpal Sword, which is in the possession of the Red Queen...<br /><br />what a cast Burton assembled for this spectacle. Aside form the abovementioned, Marton Csokas, Timothy Spall, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, and Imelda Staunton, among many others. And the casting is right in line with Burton's oft-mentioned, sometimes-criticized method of filmmaking, which is \\"throw as much spectacle at the screen as possible and have the audience hang on for the ride.\\" Too often, the spectacle is used as a cover for the boringness of the plot, the entire lack of plot, or Burton's odd inability to actually present a compelling case for the adaptation/remake/what-have-you in question. After seeing early reviews for Alice in Wonderland, I expected the same sort of thing here, but I didn't get it; there's actually more of a plot to this than there was to Burton's pale, boring Sweeney Todd, and that plot is more coherent than it was in his confusing, silly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Which pretty much by default makes it his best adaptation in the past decade. (I refuse to watch Big Fish; every bad actor gets one good film, and Ewan MacGregor, who is a terrible actor, got his with Little Voice.) Still, many of the criticisms levelled at the movie are well warranted. Wasikowska is a stunning lass, to be sure, but her portrayal of Alice is rather wooden. (And, much to the disappointment of quite a few people in my party, she spends a great deal of time falling out of her clothing, but never gets naked.) In reflection, though, it should be no surprise that Depp and Carter steal the show; the two of them have been thick as thieves with Burton for years now. Who's going to be allowed to yank the spotlight away? Which makes the wooden-ness of Wasikowska's portrayal a minor thing, really; think of this as an ensemble piece and it will be less noticeable. The spectacle is in place, Depp and Carter are in fine form, and there are many, many worse ways to spend a couple of hours in a darkened theater.<br /><br />Which would be a perfect place to end this review, but I feel compelled to mention that if you're looking for a visual-spectacle version of Alice where acting is less important than visuals, it's been done before, and better, and is available through your DVD-by-mail rental subscription, whichever one you may have (I know Netflix, BBO, and GreenCine all have copies)--Alice, Jan Svankmajer's superlative 1988 film. I haven't seen it recently enough to be able to point out specific places where Burton's film parallels it, but I remember enough of it, in that vague sort of way, to see how Burton is at least aware of Svankmajer's film and is paying homage to it with some of his choices here. If you saw Burton's film and were less than impressed, see Svankmajer's. Or even if you loved Burton's film, see Svankmajer's. ***no surprise that Depp and Carter steal the show; the two of them have been thick as thieves with Burton for years now.

0743435729|4.0|Like On Basilisk Station before it, David Weber has produced a very engaging piece of fiction I thoroughly enjoyed. I'd also like to point out that Baen's free library has made me a customer. Having read these two books has inspired me to finish the series, which currently stands at ten entries.     Since the series is based on her, the reader must know that Honor Harrington will survive any inevitable conflict, but the question is the degree of her triumph. While this does mark the series as pulp of a sort, and something of a potential soap opera, Mr. Weber isn't being excessively overt just yet in this second entry. This time, Honor heads a squadron in her shiny new Star Knight class heavy cruiser, to secure a treaty with Grayson, a moderate settlement of fairly religious zealots. But there was a schism in the past, and even more devout crazies were expelled before a civil war could annihilate everyone.     Grayson citizens believe women are second-class citizens, cause of the first and second Fall of Man, so the fact Honor is a woman captain is an anathema to them. The conflict here is several levels deep, as Haven is obviously involved with the deposed faction in order to secure its own interests in the system. Against prejudice, Haven, and a particularly incompetent political envoy, Honor is expected to rise above.     The only real problem I have is that the series is named after her, so predictably, she'll come out on top. What fun would it be if she didn't? But in this case, it's not the conclusion but the path that's important. It's fairly obvious after this excursion David will need to up the ante, and that doesn't bode well for our poor captain. But I still look forward to reading the third book in the series.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Man on Wire (James Marsh, 2008)<br /><br />I've been reading commentary about Man on Wire in the weeks since I watched it, and what most surprises me is the number of people who don't get it. It seems obvious to me, because it's a very basic thing; unlike most documentaries, which make no apology for being documentaries, Man on Wire is structured like a suspense film. It's a documentary that doesn't play like a documentary, and there seems to be no recognition of this among those who don't get it. (Of course, that may mean Marsh did his job all too well; the people who don't get it may have actually thought they were watching a suspense film, in which case, it is awfully slow.) If they do get it, and still don't like the movie, well, more power to them. I can understand that. It just depresses me when something so different is treated like something that's the same.<br /><br />Man on Wire is the story of French tightrope walker Phillipe Petit's greatest achievement: tightrope walking between the still-under-construction Twin Towers in the early 1970s. For some reason, I always assumed that this had been sanctioned, so I was fascinated by the planning it took to do all this (a good chunk of the middle third of the movie reminded me of a number of bank heist films I've seen over the years). Necessarily, a lot of the description of how the thing was pulled off required a lot of re-enactment, and I've read where that turned some people off. But really, did you want even more head shots of people sitting around and talking? We already got a lot of those. Besides, there's a studied (and, I'm sure, conscious) cheesiness to the re-enactment scenes that put me in mind of Spike Jonze's video for the Beastie Boys song \\"Sabotage\\", and that can never be a bad thing. Fake mustaches!<br /><br />No, it isn't an actual suspense film. It's still a movie that's going to go at the speed of documentary (and I mean actual documentary here, rather than the recent flood of \\"agitprop masquerading as documentary\\", viz. Michael Moore or The Company or other such silliness). And yet it doesn't feel quite right to call it \\"documentary\\" in the same vein as something like Winged Migration or Hoop Dreams. If Hitchcock had made a documentary, it might look like this, and that is about the highest praise I can think of to heap on this movie's back. ****viz. Michael Moore or The Company or other such silliness). And yet it doesn't feel quite right to call it \\"documentary\\" in the same vein as something like Winged Migration or Hoop Dreams.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|I like all three guys, and all three bands they are most famously known with.  While the obvious climax of a documentary about three guitarists is a jam session, I think it's a mistake to head in that direction.  I read here of guys who bemoan more music, less talk.  I also read about how this was a poor combination of guitar players.  While I may personally prefer a trifecta consisting of John McLaughlin, Lee Rinaldo, and Thor, the combo given in \\"It May Get Loud\\" made perfect sense to me.  In a way, it's really the story of how Page's legacy splits into two directions generations later.<br /><br />How do I know this?  It's on their faces when they get together, talk shop, and trade riffs.  Jimmy Page's roots are in the Delta blues, which were born from Slave songs and prison work chants.  Jack White talked about that same raw soul that one hears in Son House, which led to Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf.  All Page's heroes as well.  The Edge, from a Brian Eno era, seems removed from it all.  Not in a bad way, but you can definitely see his blank expression when the other two go into it.  But the Edge is basically a logical progression of Page's electronic experimentation with the echoplex, theramin, bowed guitar, leslie speakers and recording studio tricks.  Jack White is the raw, soulful, bluesy side of Page's playing in Zeppelin and the Yardbirds.  When White is banging away at his guitar, you can definitely see how much more Page digs it.<br /><br />The documentary tries to make this correlation, but not outwardly.  I think it gives enough \\"scrapbook\\" moments from each guy and each band to keep everyone happy.  For those cantankerous reviewers who grumble that there's not enough Jimmy Page and who in the world are those two other guys....careful....your age may be showing.<br /><br />Besides, for any true lover of Jimmy Page's playing, I can't see why they won't love the other two blokes.
B00012L786|3.0|Pickup on South Street (Samuel Fuller, 1953)<br /><br />Samuel Fuller, who died in 1997, was mostly considered a B-movie hack director during his lifetime. Since passing away, he has undergone something of a revival, and a large whack of critics (most of whom, one thinks, should know better) are holding Fuller's movies up as neglected gems. The two that have gotten the most press in this regard are 1963's desperately silly Shock Corridor (which I reviewed back in 2008) and 1953's Pickup on South Street. While the latter is a far better movie than the former, it is still a B movie, shot through with implausibilities and plot holes. It doesn't stand up to such noir highlights as Sunset Blvd., Double Indemnity, or Ace in the Hole.<br /><br />Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) is a pickpocket, a three-time loser who Detective Winoki (Milburn Stone) is desperate to put away for life. He's only been out of the joint a week when he picks the purse of a lovely young thing, Candy (Jean Peters) on the subway. Her wallet contains microfilm that she believes contains the formula for a patent her boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) is delivering to a rival company. It's actually government secrets being smuggled to Russia. There are a lot of levels of deception going on in this game, which hamstrings Winoki. It seems there was love at first sight between Skip and Candy, and Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), the captain who keeps Winoki on a leash, is under pressure from some government types to get McCoy to lead them to the communists at the top of the pyramid that has Candy and Joey at its bottom.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie by a country mile is Thelma Ritter, who plays a fence named Moe Williams, and who landed an Oscar nomination for it. (It was her fourth Best Supporting Actress nomination in a row, and she would garner two more, in 1960 and 1963; she never won.) Moe Williams is the character around whom the single scene in the movie turns that shows what this could have been, had Fuller been willing to stretch his wings a little (or to turn his script over to a Wilder or a Tourneur); Fuller has been going along in his pulp-fiction style for about two thirds of the movie, all plot and no characterization (including the ludicrous love-at-first-sight bit, which is the main reason I'm giving it such a low rating), and then suddenly Moe Williams and Joey are talking in Moe's apartment, and Thelma Ritter delivers a soliloquy. It's entirely out of place in the movie. And it's perfect noir; think about William Holden's opening narration in Sunset Blvd. I don't know for sure, but I'd guess it's the scene that got Ritter her Oscar nomination (that year, anyway). If Fuller had directed the entire film with that deft a touch, he might be remembered as something other than a hack by anyone other than a small cadre of critics today. The problem is, Sam Fuller really was that hack. If he wasn't, all we ever got are glimpses of what could have been, at least among the films most revered by those critics. ***tretch his wings a little (or to turn his script over to a Wilder or a Tourneur); Fuller has been going along in his pulp-fiction style for about two thirds of the movie, all plot and no characterization (including the ludicrous love-at-first-sight bit, which is the main reason I'm giving it such a low rating), and then suddenly Moe Williams and Joey are talking in Moe's apartment, and Thelma Ritter delivers a soliloquy.

B000CNESU8|3.0|Network (Sidney Lumet, 1976)<br /><br />For the first hour or so of Network, I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about. Yes, Lumet and Chayefsky have turned out to be prophetic, and that may explain the movie's continuing status, but not the contemporary praise (it was nominated for ten Oscars, and won four). The first hour is a decent movie, watchable if slow. But then, somehow, Lumet gets under your skin, and the more things go over the top, the more believable they become. It's a tricky line to walk, but Lumet (who was coming off the equally absurd, and even better, Dog Day Afternoon) does it with aplomb. The movie has flaws, no doubt about it, but Lumet takes the stew he's cooked up in the first hour and dishes  it up rather nicely.<br /><br />The center of the story is Howard Beale (Peter Finch, awarded the first posthumous Oscar in history for Best Actor here), an old anchorman who's about to be pulled off the air for bad ratings. The movie opens with him announcing that he's going to kill himself on the air the next evening to get some ratings. Max Schumacher (William Holden), his handler, is partially responsible; the two had held a booze-fueled session the night before when the idea was kicked around. I guess Max didn't figure Howard was taking him seriously. In any case, Max now has to run interference between Howard and Max's own boss, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), who wants to can the entire news crowd; the whole department is bleeding money. Enter Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), a dramatic-series type who thinks she's got the solution both to Howard's insanity and Frank's problems with the ratings; she turns the nightly news show into a spectacle, with Howard as its centerpiece, billing him as the Mad Genius and letting him rant in front of a live studio audience. Meanwhile, she's put in charge of the news department, and when Diana starts an affair with Max, the whole thing has the feeling of a consolation prize. While we're at it, you can add in a whole slew of cameos (Ned Beatty famously said \\"never turn down a role; I worked one day on Network and got an Oscar nomination for it!\\" Indeed).<br /><br />The part of this that works the best is the relationship between Max and Diana, with added bits of Max's wife (Beatrice Straight, who won an Oscar as well) as she finds out about the relationship and gives a stirring speech about how she's not going to give her husband up without a fight. (It might have worked better delivered to Diana, certainly, but it works well enough as is to have gotten her the gold). Once we get into the Mad Genius bit, that part of the story also really takes off, but it fragments soon after as we start to see some of Diana's other projects (it all ties in later, but feels almost like an afterthought). Still, it's fun, and watched today, almost eerie in its accuracy. Also worth noting for an early, uncredited performance by Lance Henriksen and the first (also uncredited) screen appearance of Tim Robbins. ***le slew of cameos (Ned Beatty famously said \\"never turn down a role; I worked one day on Network and got an Oscar nomination for it!\\" Indeed).

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I bought the SB900 because I needed a reliable flash for weddings as well as for general indoor use.  This flash is great! It's powerful, easy to program, and overall is very user friendly.  It even communicates with Canon flashes! It has improved features compared to the SB800 and I haven't looked back since buying.  I would definetely recommend using an external battery pack. This allows you to take advantage of quicker recycle times, and also avoids the auto-shut off feature if your batteries overheat.

Summer is often seen as a time of whiling away the days with your friends and doing all sorts of fun things. That is, when you're an adult and looking back through nostalgic glasses. Kinney remembers what summer was really like, and gives us a faceful of it through the adventures of Greg, Rowley, and their families. While there are a few things I wish would have been tweaked (we need more Fregley!), this has been my favorite book of the series to date. Long live Greg Heffley! ****
0393072231|1.0|I heard the review on NPR and came to purchase the book.  I have some physical limitations that make it difficult to hold a physical book, so I've read eBooks for the last two years.  Unfortunately, the publisher is keeping me from reading this one.  I'm sure by the time they get around to publishing an electronic version something else will have caught my attention.  Oh well, another lost sale, and another one-star review.    For those who do not understand why we do this, the publishers do not listen to petitions, phone calls, letters, emails, or faxes.  All we've got left is to hit them where it hurts - the pocketbook.  It's not a perfect method, but if the publishers even bothered to acknowledge their readers in the recent Amazon/publishers debacle we wouldn't feel so ignored, forced to make our voices heard any way we can.

B00168OIOE|5.0|THIS  MOVIE  GREAT  TO OWN  ON BLUE-RAY  I RECOMMED  TO OWN
0440178002|5.0|This will be one of the 5 books I require my kids to read.  And that's not just because of the insight and  gained by reading it  Its just that good, not to be missed in this or any lifetime.    The story is an amazing tale that elucidates through situations the ideology of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Reading this book as an adult...it wasn't that great at all, especially the ending was very disappointing.    Reading this book if I were in elementary school, I would have loved it. So I gave the 4 stars for the children reading this book as that is who it is intended for.
0312944098|5.0|Jeffrey Archer was one of my favorite authors before this book, and this may be his best.  I have given all my friends a double your money back guarantee on this book (which I do very rarely) and no one has yet collected.  I would also recommend reading his book A Prison Diary (about his time in prison), from which you can see several characters emerge into his work of fiction.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I loved how this book is the point of view of the son of a Nazi Commander. The innocence and naivete of the character makes you fall in love with him no matter who his parents are. Some people find it hard to believe the little boy could be so ignorant of the goings on in his house and the \\"other side of the fence\\" but I disagree. He was kept out of his father's office \\"at all times with no exceptions\\" and was told to leave the room when the boss shows up. Even when he talks with his sister she only tells them they dont like the people on the other side of the fence bc they are jewish.    The ending is great, although on one side is very sad, the irony of it takes a jab at the father for his position and what he would order done.
0805091742|5.0|Gawande provides an excellent understanding of how checklists are being used in various industries and how they can be applied to healthcare.  What I learned from this book is how checklists provide a framework for communication among members of a project team.  As suggested by the title, this is an advocacy book, but Gawande provides a balanced presentation with limitations as well as advantages.  I would recommend this book to anyone who manages complex tasks requiring cooperation among multiple people.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked this book. It can not be compared to Harry Potter they are different stories. If you go into it thinking it will be as good as the Harry Potter series you may be disappointed.    I thought it was great and the premise so unique..as far as I've seen. The children of the Gods are among us and have some of the powers of their diety parent. Percy Jackson is special however because his father is Poseidon. This is very rare since Hades, Zeus and Poseidon made a pack to not father mortal children(however they have not kept their pack).
0307271862|1.0|Mixing history and mystery is wonderful when deftly done. This is just an inaccurate political lecture on China and its future mixed in with a disappointing mystery, improbable plot twists, and ridiculous characters.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I had this cd before but lost it. So I purchased another one, and I still love it! Loving the new Sade as well, Soldier of Love!!
0393072231|2.0|I enjoyed reading Liar's Poker too, even though it was rather a basic book due to Lewis's short tenure with the firm before leaving and writing a kiss-tell book.  But, his new book points to the ones he wants to string up more than anyone else: those at Goldman who created the synthetic CDO's.  Yes, they are a tops on the hit list to string up, but Michael, the ones who have brought this country down over the past many decades are called The Fed.  As the saying goes these days: End The Fed.
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise is a feel good romantic movie (aka \\"Chic Flick\\")that really delivers.  I started watching it when there was nothing else to do and it quickly grew on me.  The characters are impulsive but believable.  The acting is crisp and straghtforward, and the entire experience was well worth the time I spent watching it.    Two young people, an American man and a French woman, meet on the train and agree to get off together for one romantic night in Vienna.  Things seem to go their way as they make their way around town without speaking German.  They eventually fall in love and agree to meet in six months time at the train station where they depart.    The viewer is caught up in the whirlwind romance that unfolds on the screen.  The couple appears carefree at first, but deeper emotions emerge as they realize their only night together may be the last time they see each other.  By the end of the movie the viewer is hoping that the director would fast forward six months to see if they do indeed return to their prearranged meeting spot.  The film does not do this but the hope remains.  At the very end the director returns to the various locations the couple visited to show how empty those places are now that our couple is gone.    This was one of the most charming films I've seen in recent months and the film deserves to win some kind of award.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|CATS has been one of my favorite musicals.  I'm glad to have my own copy so I can hear the great songs and see the wonderful costumes any time I wish.
B00328G4V6|4.0|There are so many posthumous Hendrix recordings out there it borderlines on blasphemy. The novice Hendrix listener might not \\"experience\\" Jimi Hendrix for what he really was...one, if not the greatest, rock guitarists of all time. For those who are just getting into what Hendrix was about, this album is NOT for you. Grab \\"Are You Experienced\\", \\"Axis Bold As Love\\" and   Electric Ladyland\\". Trust me, those albums will BLOW YOUR MIND! \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\" however, is an album for the truly devoted Hendrix fan. What I like most about this album is it's rawness. It's like being in the studio with Hendrix while he's just having fun and jamming. And who wouldn't want to buy THAT ticket? The sound quality is superb, and the basic tracks haven't been ruined like some other posthumous releases, like on \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Midnight Lightning\\", where random studio musicians actually OVERDUBBED over the original tracks. (Alan Douglas...you should be ashamed of yourself.) On this album however, I'm glad this has been released, and I do not feel like it's a rip-off to make money. There is quality stuff here.    Track By Track:  1.) Stone Free - Basicly an alternate version of the original. I prefer the original, but this is a fun and interesting listen.    2.) Valleys Of Neptune - I'm not a fan of this song, and I doubt it would ever have been released  on an actual Hendrix approved album. If so, it would have been MUCH more orchestrated, perhaps like 1983 (A Merman I Should Turn To Be) from Electric Ladyland. Still, it's great hearing Hendrix' in his writing process.    3.) Bleeding Heart - I LOVE THIS VERSION. It's the best studio version I've heard. The version from \\"War Heroes\\" just didn't have the bite and rawness that this classic blues tune deserves. Hendrix kicks into this version hard and heavy from the start. Fantastic guitar work here, and a great variation on the original vocal approach.    4.) Hear My Train A Comin' - Most Hendrix fans will tell you Hendrix' 12 string acoustic version is the best, and they would be correct...but this electric version is really nice also. I have a version from a live LP called \\"The Jimi Hendrix Concerts\\" that I feel is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but this is a great listen as well, and once again the guitar playing is other-worldly.    5.) Mr. Bad Luck - There was another version of this song called \\"Look Over Yonder\\". I'm not a fan of this song or either version. This is not Hendrix' best song writing by a long shot, but still...it's Jimi Hendrix on guitar.    6.) Sunshine Of Your Love - Hendrix was a major Clapton fan and he did this song instrumentally with The Experience many times live, and it was a staple of his live shows. It's finally nice to hear a studio jam of this song. It has become my favorite version, and the guitar playing is VERY NICE!    7.) Lover Man - Again, a song Hendrix performed live many times. This studio take is nothing short of amazing, and is a fresh approach to the song. Again, it has become my favorite version.    8.) Ships Passing In The Night - This is actually a slowed down bluesy version of \\"Night Bird Flying\\", but only a true Hendrix head would hear that. Again...this has become my favorite version of \\"Night Bird Flying\\". Why it's called \\"Ships Passing In The Night\\" on the album is beyond me. I'm hoping they didn't change the name to make it seem like a new song. It isn't, but it IS a totally different approach to the way \\"Night Bird Flying\\" was eventually released.      9.) Fire - Nice alternate version, and GREAT drumming, but the original is much better.    10.) Red House - I have a plethora of \\"Red House\\" live versions, and they all bring something unique to the table. This alternate studio version is very nice also, with some great blues licks of course, but with no real new surprises. The major problem with this version is that the final verse is faded out, without any \\"I know her sister will!\\" lyric at all. Highly anti-climatic to say the least.    11.) Lullaby For Summer - Once again I am baffled why this song is named \\"Lullaby For Summer\\" on this album. It's basicly a jam based off the opening riff to \\"Ezy Rider\\", with some very cool hook riffs thrown in the middle section. The thing is...IT ABSOLUTELY ROCKS! \\"Ezy Rider\\" was never one of my favorite Hendrix songs, but I am BLOWN AWAY by this instrumental jam version! I can't praise it enough.    12.) Crying Blue Rain - A VERY nice bluesy jam. I love the guitar tone. The only drawback with this track is that I believe it loses it's \\"blues mood\\" when the band speeds it up towards the end. But still...just wonderful guitar playing.    Bonus Tracks:    13.) Trash Man - This is actually the instrumental \\"Midnight\\" sped up just a bit. Great licks and a nice version...but the original has much more feel in my opinion.    14.) Slower Version - A nice instrumental jam. However, the sound quality doesn't seem to match the rest of the album, and the guitar tone seems very overdriven. Still, Hendrix' guitar playing shines brightly on this track.    There will probably be more posthumous releases to follow, but who knows if there will EVER be another Jimi Hendrix CD release of unreleased material as strong as this one. So to me, it's like Christmas came early. I hope this review helps in your decision to purchase this CD. If you already own the Hendrix classics, and you are like me and CRAVE to hear more, then I HIGHLY recommend you buy this album TODAY!

0385720920|5.0|If you don't come prepared for Choke, it will definitely drop your jaw. Chuck Palahniuk is not afraid to throw every disgusting and disturbing thought you've ever tried to supress right back at you.     When I started this book, I came in with my critics hat on. I thought, \\"A sex addict? Really Chuck? Maybe you're just trying to shock us some more so we won't notice that this book doesn't measure up to Fight Club.\\" But the shocking nature of this book was necessary, and completely effective. In my opinion, it was just as good as Fight Club, if not better.     The main character is a guy with mommy issues and a sex addiction who creates heroes by having fake choking attacks in the middle of crowded restaurants. He takes you through past and present to discover a sad and surprising reality. I can honestly say that it's the only book I've ever read that made me want to throw up, but still kept me reading.
045122499X|4.0|Do not expect to find high literature here. But expect to be very entertained. Ken Follet's sequel to the tighter and more cared for [[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth]] is an endless medieval soap-opera.<br /><br />Set on the backdrop of the English cathedral city of Kingsbridge in the early 14th century the heroes have to avoid poverty and starvation, weather an ongoing war and survive both the ever-returning plague and their cruel overlords. Fortunes are made and lost, love is reciprocated or shunted, offspring is fathered by strange bedfellows. Life and death are intermingled - but life always finds a way to go on. Even in those harsh times.<br /><br />This is a long book. It could use a heavier-handed editing but I doubt it would make much of a difference. Sure, there are themes that keep repeating (the greedy and ever scheming monks of the priory make underhanded attempts to steal, bring down or even kill the independent Caris again and again; Merthin the prodigy builder having to fight the self-serving conservative establishment to implement his innovative designs; the villainous Ralph in an insatiable vengeance-trip against a peasant boy who once broke his nose). After the third time you go through the same story-arcs you grow a bit tired of it. And yet you cannot stop reading on.<br /><br />Is there a happy end? Well, I shall not spoil it for anyone. However, whether there is one or not, brace yourself for a long journey. You shall enjoy it too.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.
6305882592|5.0|I stumbled across this movie when I was in high school. I was watching a movie on TV, and when it was over, Harold and Maude came on. It instantly caught my attention with the dark humor of Harold's fake suicide attempts, so I kept watching. Now, this movie is one of my favorites. It's witty and charming, but in a dark way. Harold, a young misfit who isn't sure what he is looking for in life, meets and befriends Maude, an eccentric but aging free-spirit. Maude shows Harold how to look at the world in a different light, and the two become friends, and eventually lovers. This movie is sad, funny, quirky, and charming in a way no other movie is. Watch it!
0393072231|1.0|I went to go buy this book after hearing the author twice today in the media. What a waste of all that time publicizing it since it isn't in fact, actually available. It'll come out on Kindle or it won't exist. Sad for Mr. Lewis.
0375851569|5.0|Since we didn't have any Dr. Suess in our library so far, we figured this would be a good start.  Our 21 month old son loves them.  Entertaining for parents too.  Nice set of the classics.
0764207407|4.0|I love Jane Austen. A couple summers ago, I set out to read all of her books in one summer - even those I had read before (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). Even after realizing that many of her characters and stories are similar, I still loved her. I love the way she writes with wit and intelligence. And I really enjoy how everyone who deserves to be happy in the end does indeed end up happy.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility, for those of you who haven't ever read it or seen one of the many film versions, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne who are both alike in passion, except that Marianne is all passion and impulsivity on the outside (sensibility) and Elinor is all composure and caution on the outside (sense). The story tells of secret love, not so secret love, lost fortunes and selfishness, and deep sisterly love. This story, even more than Pride and Prejudice, makes me wish I had a sister or two.<br /><br />This insight edition is different from other more \\"academic\\" versions of classic works, because rather than pages and pages of footnotes instructing the reader as to the socio-historical background of the book.... Well, it's like the editors are reading the book with you. Occasionally there are informative footnotes which tell you what a \\"Barouche\\" is (a four-wheeled carriage pulled by 2 horses that seated four people), or tells you about \\"Harley Street\\" (a street in London populated chiefly by medical professionals). But there are also 6 other types of footnotes that occur throughout the book - usually as an \\"aside\\" on the edge of the page - including notes about Jane Austen's life and how a part of the story relates to it, references to S&S in film and television, themes related to faith, and notes on characters that the editors dislike throughout the story.<br /><br />While at first, I thought that this tongue-in-cheek note system was a little distracting, as I went onward, I began to enjoy the voices of these women. It was kind of like I was reading the book with a friend or with a book club. So that as I read about something really horrible that Fanny said to John or Lucy said to Elinor and thought, \\"UGH! I think Fanny is such a jerk!\\" there was the comment by my \\"friends\\" in the margin saying the same thing.<br /><br />This version of Sense and Sensibility does not add anything new to the text that Jane Austen wrote, and thus the story of course is great. The Insight Edition does add some contemporary fun to the novel however, and it is likely you would also enjoy taking these friends with you on the journey through 19th century England.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen? 4.5 out of 5<br />The Insight Edition? 3.5 out of 5
B0019N8P2W|4.0|this series is waaayyy overdue. and the only reason why i'm giving it the 4 instead of 5 stars is because the music/soundtrack is possibly edited. i bought a bootleg complete series awhile ago but it doens't have a proper menu and skips intros/outros. all politics aside, daria should be on adult swim.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|After waiting with bated breath for the return of Sade,I am sooooo disappointed. This album sounds like any other Sade album you've ever heard, just with fewer great songs. Soldier of Love remains the catchiest, but it's certainly not her best work. I'm a true Sade fan, but this effort is \\"sleepy\\" music.

B00000ILDF|2.0|I'll start with something positive as it is not a film without good qualities.  It's stylish, atmospheric and very well acted. The score is good, particulary at the end...and the conclusion of Ripley's story is powerfully moving. As a film in it's own right it would not be half bad.    As a sequel, though, it is a bitter disappointment. All the good qualities above can not make up for the fact that everything that was so brilliant about Alien and Aliens has been callously disregarded. The biggest weak point is the poor characterisation. Almost all the new characters are poorly defined, unlikeable and practically indistinguishable from one another. To boot, the characters that we did care about - the survivors from Aliens - are casually disposed of before even the opening titles have finished. It's a bleak and brutal start, which was no doubt the intent, but it was too much. The film never recovers.    The tension that made the first two films so compelling is gone. The shock of Hicks and Newt dying lingers throughout the entire story, distracting you from the plot and making it hard to care about anything else that happens. You just don't get that nail-biting terror when the people being hunted mean nothing to you.    I'll give it a star for the ending and one for the acting. But I can't forgive the writers for making me feel more like I've been punched in the guts than entertained.

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|When I first learned that Gorillaz was coming out with a new record I was suprised, its been five years since Demon Days which was okay. I enjoy their first album more but after pre-ordering this CD/DVD I watched the video \\"Stylo\\" and was amped for this album. With guest vocals from Mos Def, Snoop Dogg, De La Soul, and Bobby Womack (havent heard from Bobby since Quentin Tarintino's Jackie Brown soundtrack). I listened to the whole album when I got it, kept an open mind with undivided attention the Orchestrial Intro is impressive then flows into the second track. The first six tracks I dug, the other half was alright I had to listen to the last half a few times to try and grasp the concept of each song. \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" was very well put together, it reminds me of a classic Nate King Cole song like \\"Unforgettable\\" it has an old school vibe to it.  The DVD of The Making of Plastic Beach was very good its about forty mins. long but its admiring to see how much work the creators of Gorillaz put into the music, concept of Plastic Beach, and showing the orchestra playing bits and pieces throughout the album tracks. The artwork for the album is great as always, unique and quirky each band member looks like they've experienced allot in the world of Plastic Beach. Telling by the music video \\"Stylo\\" were in for stories about Russel, Noodles (now a robot?), Murdoc, in two or at least one more video for Plastic Beach. All in all I really liked this album, it lags here and there but its rare to enjoy every song in one album especially when the bands music evolves differently in every album.

Because this bestselling book isn't available on Kindle--the way I prefer to read my books--it's an unsatisfactory product to me.

B000P0J09C|5.0|I have to say that there is no war movie like Full Metal Jacket. I haven't seen every war movie, so it's safe to say that other war movies share similar themes and there are many movies that depict combat, friendships, and desensitization .  But man, Full Metal Jacket has many classic scenes, scenes that can not be duplicated in any other movie.  How many other movies feature a forty seven boot camp plot, soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse theme song over charred landscapes, or feature Surfin' Bird over combat and a team filming soldiers?  That's right, none.  These are few of the many memorable scenes that fill the unique Full Metal Jacket, further delivered by the one of a kind directing from Stanley Kubrick.  It's a surprisingly ambiguous and war movie, especially compared to Platoon (frequently compared to Jacket) which is a much more emotionally driven drama, than Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Sure, Full Metal Jacket may not be as emotionally powerful as Saving Private Ryan of Grave of the Fireflies.  As a matter of fact, the emotional factor seems to be lacking in Full Metal Jacket, especially compared to other movies.  The suicide of Private Pyle has no hint of music that wants us to feel sorry for him (even though we do).  The death of Private Cowboy is surprisingly cold and lacks emotional resonance.  But really, that's part of the reason why Full Metal Jacket stands out among war movies.  It's not an entirely mean-hearted movie by any stretch (though I'm not surprised if this gets criticism for being racist), as there is humanity and goodness within the movie. But when it comes to war movies, there aren't many other war films that have most, if not all, their sentimentality drained as Full Metal Jacket does.<br /><br />As everybody and their mother knows, Full Metal Jacket is divided into two parts.  The first 47 minutes stars actual drill instructor Lee Ermey (according to the box.  I forgot his real name) pitting grunts through basic training.  After the first half, Full Metal Jacket turns into a wild second half, which almost feels more like set pieces and situations than one plot.  However, I find the second half to be just as memorable and compelling, and the set pieces are linked together quite well.  It flows, even though there not much of a strict running plot.  Quite frankly, it works that way.  Not every situation in life is like a story, and Full Metal Jacket is refreshing because of that.  This movie never feels like a story, and quite frankly, I like it that way.<br /><br />The end result makes for a good two hours of war captured on film that you won't find anywhere else.  The first half goes through training, while the multiple sequenced second half goes through a fight with a sniper, some time with a sadistic door gunner, The Battle of Hue, and even some time with sleazy Vietnamese prostitutes (Me love you long time originated from this movie, I think).  All of this is presented with more flair and creativity than your usual war movie, and the movie is surprisingly funny at times.  The dialogue is incredibly quotable and funny.  I know Ermey's dialogue is supposed to be cruel, but good lord, these quotes are just hilarious.  \\"Five foot nine I didn't know they stacked _____ that high!\\" is just one of the many lines that are CLASSIC.  The chants he makes the soldiers shout are extremely catchy, for some reason.  No, classic even. Seriously.  Even beyond this, the quotes and moments in this movie stick in your head.  \\"A Day Without Blood is Like a Day Without Sunshine\\" has to be the coolest line ever spoken in a war movie.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is the characters, who are much more fun and memorable than your average war movie.  As another reviewer put it, the young men portrayed here are fun, cool, somewhat dangerous, and motivated in some way or another. Everybody knows about R. Lee Ermey's performance (cool fact: Ermey plays Sarge from Toy Story), Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Private Pyle, Adam Baldwin as the nihilistic machine gunner who goes off into crazy fits of shooting, and Matthew Modine as the protagonist.  They are all funny, somewhat crazy, have personality, and are entertaining to watch.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's directing makes Full Metal Jacket unique as well.  Kubrick is known for making sure every shot was perfect in his eyes, and I think it shows here.  He was a master at the camera.  For example, the end of the movie, featuring gut-wrenching slow motion details on gunshot wounds, featuring blood splattering like slow motion water, are among nothing else I've seen in a war movie.  It's not the slow motion that's unique, it's just the whole way it's constructed.  I also like the soundtrack, both Vivian Kubrick's score and the soundtrack featuring rock and pop artists.  The lack of soundtrack helps as well, making the movie seem even more unique.  Some of the scenes are enhanced further by music, but for the most part, the minimal amount works well.  The pop songs conjures up moods rather well, in the way rock and pop songs proved effective in movies like Dazed and Confused, Pulp Fiction, and Trainspotting.<br /><br />My interpretation of the film may be different from yours, and there are a lot of different interpretations that can said about the scenes, as there are many themes in this movie further established by some ambiguous scenes that actually are open to some interpretation.  The first half, in my opinion, is fairly easy to understand, about how war is not for the weak or dependent.  Self esteem seems to be in play when it comes to reaction to boot camp training.  Some of the soldiers have enough self esteem to harden up, but others, such as the ill-fated Private Pyle, do not.  Private Pyle's breakdown and eventual suicide is an interesting theme for me, being one who has seen plenty of bullying thanks to exposure of some lame Vocational class I took (though that class was filled with plenty of socially adapt people, so we weren't all lonely misfits.  As a matter of fact, many of us were not).  Pyle, unlike the other troops, were socially and mentally slow, which makes it hard for him to gain self esteem.  With no escape from a system that chips away at your comfort zone and dependency on others to make you happy, it's no wonder he turned inward and went crazy.  That may have been his only comfort zone, but it sure was a lot more devastating than helpful.<br /><br />As for the second half?  The goofy Surfin' Bird certainly makes the ridiculous act of having a camera team shooting soldiers seem stupid and insulting to the soldiers involved.  We meet many characters that represent many sides of war, and plenty of situations as well.  Even better, aside from the lame scenes regarding Vietnamese woman, all of scenes are watchable and interesting.  We see the difference between how we are all much more ignorant about something we have never done before, how some people apparently get a thrill of killing foreigners, and the Jungian thing. It almost seems like this movie is about the perception of war, as we get a million different views from different people at once.  A nihilistic view from Animal, a racist view from Eightball, a individualistic side from Joker, and a natural urge to kill from people like Rafterman. At least that's my interpretation.  For now, at least.<br /><br />In short, Full Metal Jacket is definitely a unique war movie.  While it will never truly lift your spirits up, the boot camp section, it's set pieces after the boot camp sequence, the performances and characters, and it's dehumanizing themes all contribute to making this movie an exceptional war movie.  That's why this movie truly deserves to crack top spots in polls for great war films.as the nihilistic machine gunner who goes off into crazy fits of shooting, and Matthew Modine as the protagonist.  They are all funny, somewhat crazy, have personality, and are entertaining to watch.    Stanley Kubrick's directing makes Full Metal Jacket unique as well.  Kubrick is known for making sure every shot was perfect in his eyes, and I think it shows here.  He was a master at the camera.  For example, the end of the movie, featuring gut-wrenching slow motion details on gunshot wounds, featuring blood splattering like slow motion water, are among nothing else I've seen in a war movie.  It's not the slow motion that's unique, it's just the whole way it's constructed.  I also like the soundtrack, both Vivian Kubrick's score and the soundtrack featuring rock and pop artists.  The lack of soundtrack helps as well, making the movie seem even more unique.  Some of the scenes are enhanced further by music, but for the most part, the minimal amount works well.  The pop songs conjures up moods rather well, in the way rock and pop songs proved effective in movies like Dazed and Confused, Pulp Fiction, and Trainspotting.    My interpretation of the film may be different from yours, and there are a lot of different interpretations that can said about the scenes, as there are many themes in this movie further established by some ambiguous scenes that actually are open to some interpretation.  The first half, in my opinion, is fairly easy to understand, about how war is not for the weak or dependent.  Self esteem seems to be in play when it comes to reaction to boot camp training.  Some of the soldiers have enough self esteem to harden up, but others, such as the ill-fated Private Pyle, do not.  Private Pyle's breakdown and eventual suicide is an interesting theme for me, being one who has seen plenty of bullying thanks to exposure of some lame Vocational class I took (though that class was filled with plenty of socially adapt people, so we weren't all lonely misfits.  Asa matter of fact, many of us were not).  Pyle, unlike the other troops, were socially and mentally slow, which makes it hard for him to gain self esteem.  With no escape from a system that chips away at your comfort zone and dependency on others to make you happy, it's no wonder he turned inward and went crazy.  That may have been his only comfort zone, but it sure was a lot more devastating than helpful.    As for the second half?  The goofy Surfin' Bird certainly makes the ridiculous act of having a camera team shooting soldiers seem stupid and insulting to the soldiers involved.  We meet many characters that represent many sides of war, and plenty of situations as well.  Even better, aside from the lame scenes regarding Vietnamese woman, all of scenes are watchable and interesting.  We see the difference between how we are all much more ignorant about something we have never done before, how some people apparently get a thrill of killing foreigners, and the Jungian thing. It almost seems like this movie is about the perception of war, as we get a million different views from different people at once.  A nihilistic view from Animal, a racist view from Eightball, a individualistic side from Joker, and a natural urge to kill from people like Rafterman. At least that's my interpretation.  For now, at least.    In short, Full Metal Jacket is definitely a unique war movie.  While it will never truly lift your spirits up, the boot camp section, it's set pieces after the boot camp sequence, the performances and characters, and it's dehumanizing themes all contribute to making this movie an exceptional war movie.  That's why this movie truly deserves to crack top spots in polls for great war films.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ever heard of \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\"? Well, you'll might recognize it when you see the movie, \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space,\\" a film that's considered by many to be the worst B-movie of all time (though the films by Uwe Boll might change that). It happens when in one shot it's day, but then in the next shot, it's night. It also happens when the shadow of a boom mike is clearly visible in one scene. This may not be acceptable to the general public, but a certain director from the 50's named Ed Wood found it to be a likable philosophy. And he followed it when he created \\"Plan 9\\" and other films, which are some of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />I'm going to be honest right now: I have never seen ANY of Ed Wood's films. I've never had a chance to watch any of his cult classics, but I always hear about how laughably bad they are. With so many plot holes, visible goofs, and wooden acting, they can only have been made by an eccentric fellow like Ed Wood. Before I saw Tim Burton's \\"Ed Wood,\\" I didn't know if I would enjoy it as much as I did while watching it. I didn't know if it was going to be an effective comedy, or if I would admire Ed for his passion for creating films of his own. Well, I saw the movie straight through, and I found it to be an effective biography. It shows a lot of sympathy towards Ed when he's struggling to create and finish his films, but at the same time, shows off his odd personality and weird imagination that a majority of people would never connect with. The film itself is shot in beautiful black and white, and the recreations of Ed's sets (as well as 50's Hollywood) seem completely accurate. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are believable and memorable as Ed Wood and Belo Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, George Steele, and everyone else in the film give brilliant performances. The humor may not make you fall on the floor laughing, but I still think it's pretty sharp. As a fan of Tim Burton, I have taken a liking of this movie pretty fast. Maybe it'll grow on me some more after repeated viewing, but for now, I will say that it is one of Burton's greatest, as well as Johnny Depp's.<br /><br />Grade: Apretty fast. Maybe it'll grow on me some more after repeated viewing, but for now, I will say that it is one of Burton's greatest, as well as Johnny Depp's.    Grade: A
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I keep looking at the reviews and some compare Plastic Beach to demon days. You just cant do it, its different. But this album is equally as good. I cant stand when artists sit on the same material forever. Good change, there is demon days and there is Plastic Beach, two different worlds.
0670034711|5.0|Very nice story about a woman seeking some kind of self discovery and definition in whatever way she can.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and ordered it , after reading it as a library book, as I will definitely read it again and lend it to friends.  Its not about being religious but being spiritually aware!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay so let me give you a bit of history on me. Last January I started working out very regularly. I started doing the Dance it Off Prevention DVD. That is broken down into four 10 minute routines, I started with two of those and worked my way up from there. By month three I was working out for almost an hour a day (30 minutes of the DVD and 25 minutes on my stair stepper). By July I had lost 15 of the 20 pounds I wanted to lose. It was a slow process, but I felt good about it. Like a moron I gained back 10 pounds after I stopped working out around September.     So about 2 1/2 weeks ago I started doing 30 Day Shred, thinking a 20 minute work out would ease me back into regular exercise. Well let's just say Jillian isn't the type of trainer to ease you into anything and I love her for it! It's true the workouts are only 20 minutes, but I've never worked out so hard in my life! I'm currently on level 2 and it's a KILLER! I'm planning on moving on to level 3 sometime next week, not because I've mastered anything simply because I want to. Jillian is awesome! She doesn't candy coat anything, basically she tells you to get off your lazy a**! Her style may not be for everyone, but I really like it. Over the years I've tried different DVDs and I'm often annoyed with the trainer by the end. For instance I can't stand Denise Austin, she's so sugar sweet she gives me a toothache. So Jillian's quit whining attitude suites me well.     After 2 1/2 weeks I've lost 7 pounds, something that literally took me months last year, I've accomplished in a matter of days with a 20 minute workout. I'm planning on putting in my 30 days and moving on to another Jillian DVD, either Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism or The Last Chance Workout, I haven't decided yet, but I'm so very excited after the results I've achieved from Shred. I can't sing this workouts praises enough...Jillian ROCKS!!!!!

B0000041DF|3.0|THE CD WAS A LITTLE BIT DIRTY AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF SKIPPING BETWEEN TRACKS AND SOME STATIC NOISE. I HAD TO CLEAN IT THOROUGHLY TWICE. IT PLAYS OK NOW EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL SKIPPING. I TESTED IT IN 3 DIFFERENT CD PLAYERS.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|*SPOILER ALERTS*<br /><br />I know a lot of people were wondering what James Cameron was up to after \\"Titanic.\\"  Considering that most of his films have been huge successes both from a box office standpoint as well as from a critical standpoint, I was wondering what he was doing.  Aside from the television show, \\"Dark Angel,\\" and a few other small projects, I was also curious about when he was going to get back to making a movie.  It took James Cameron over 11 years to make \\"Avatar.\\"  And thank God it took him as long as it did.<br /><br />Avatar may well be the most visually stunning film ever made up to this point in time.  If you aren't completely enthralled by the colors and visual effects of the planet, Pandora, then perhaps you had your 3-D glasses on backwards!<br /><br />James Cameron has pretty much had the same theme running throughout the course of nearly every one of his films: nature vs. technology.  His films beg the viewer to ask the question, \\"Technology is a wonderful thing, but if man, himself as evolved so little, what good is it?\\"<br /><br />Gene Roddenberry had similar themes running throughout the course of Star Trek.  What happens when technology out-distances man's wisdom?  What happens when technology causes man to forget what is really important in life?  Better yet, what happens when man believes the technological advancement is the stick that measures evolutionary advancement?<br /><br />For many years, man has believed that he can conquer nature.  The Native Americans, as well as other tribal people, found a way to live WITH nature.  For many years, including today, many people believe that we are more advanced than people were several thousand years ago.  Scientists are already proving that this is not the case.<br /><br />We learn in Avatar that we have pretty much used up the resources of planet Earth.  Earth is briefly described as a barren wasteland.  On the planet, Pandora, the military under the authority of an undisclosed company (James Cameron invariably uses a \\"company\\" which pretty much represents exploitation in his films) is attempting to acquire a rare mineral worth millions of dollars.  The problem is the indigenous people, the Na'vi, are unwilling to part with it, or give their land away so that the company can get it.<br /><br />Enter Jake Sully who is a bitter marine who has lost the use of his legs.  Eager to prove that he can still function as a marine, as well as avenge his brother's death, he enters the Avatar program.  The program provides Na'vi bodies to be used by their respective \\"pilots.\\"  The mind is downloaded into the Na'vi bodies.  Jake's avatar is given a specific mission: to infiltrate a tribe of the Na'vi, learn about them, and find a way to exploit them.  At first Jake is eager to undertake the mission, and joyful to find that he now inhabits a body that can walk and run in ways that even his fully functional body can't begin to achieve.<br /><br />Here, the story takes on similar themes as films like \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"The Last Samurai.\\"  Jake quickly finds himself becoming more enamored with the Na'vi and their culture.  The Na'vi, although a bit suspicious of him, ask Neytiri to teach Jake their ways.  She shows him how everything on the planet is interconnected; the plants, the animals, everything.  The Na'vi have long braids which gives them the ability to \\"plug in\\" to animals or plants for the purpose of communication.  But it is more than simple communication.  It's a bond.  And this is where the idea of interconnection is truly demonstrated.<br /><br />Eventually Jake falls in love with Neytiri, but also with the way of life of the Na'vi.  It can be argued that Jake has never truly lived until now, even when his body was whole and functioning.  He finds a wonderment in everything that the Na'vi do, and he realizes that he must now do everything in his power to protect it.<br /><br />The characters of this film are pretty much all first-rate.  Sam Worthington does a terrific job as Jake Sully.  He is able to subtley show the changes in Jake, and how his mind and being shift from an unquestioning military thinking to one whose eyes have opened.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana is simply brilliant as Neytiri.  She is able to tap into the love and devotion that Neytiri possesses for her people, the animals, the plants, and all life on Pandora.  She is a warrior, with a a warrior's spirit, but she has a softness that Jake is able to tap into.  One can't help but feel her pain when she feels betrayed.<br /><br />Supporting characters such as Sigourney Weaver's, Dr. Grace Augustine, give excellent performances.  Dr. Augustine knows the Na'vi people, and she's at first upset that Jake (a jarhead) is now in the Avatar program.<br /><br />The only performance of the film that I felt was over-the-top, was that of Colonel Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang.  We understand that this is a military commander who doesn't give a damn about the Na'vi and is only interested in wiping them out.  We understand that he's bitter and angry regarding the wounds he received from them.  But sometimes, subtley is much more effective than outward bravado.  Quaritch comes off as stereotypical of so many similar characters that we've seen in the past.  The dialogue written for him could have been vastly improved.  One can't help but think, \\"I've heard this before.\\"  Perhaps a quiet rage would have been a more effective way to go.  We understand he is a \\"gung ho\\" commander.  Subtle demonstrations would have made him more effective and less laughable.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the visual effects.  I understand that Cameron didn't feel that his film was ready to be made until he saw Golem in Lord of the Rings.  He knew he was undertaking something tremendous, and he succeeds beyond measure.  He envisions a planet that easily rivals the Star Wars planets created by George Lucas.  To my mind, he surpasses Lucas.  He not only is able to create a planet with incredible landscapes, floating mountains, and bright Fluorescent colors, but he gives everything amazing detail.  I venture you could watch this film five or six times, and catch something you didn't see before.  There is that much for a person to take in.  James Cameron also spent some time in Hawaii attempting to learn the behavior patterns of the plants and animals; to give him an idea of how they would act, react, and interact within the environment.<br /><br />Avatar pretty much has it all.  It is a far deeper movie than one might expect.  I feel that we can learn a lot about ourselves through watching this film.  Avatar speaks to the simplicity of life.  Jake finds that he cannot deny that for a people who \\"seem\\" far more primitive, they are happy.  Masters have stated, \\"life is, in fact, very simple.  It is WE who make it complex.\\"<br /><br />Avatar is a film that you can't forget.  It seems to resonate within the fabric of our very souls.  It invites us to question how we live, and how we interact with everything and everyone around us.  And we wonder why our planet is in such dire straits.  We wonder how we got to where we are, and why we pay little or no attention to what we are doing to everything around us.  We can learn from those of the past.  We have forgotten that we must work with nature, not against her.  We have forgotten that everything and everyone is connected.  What we do to one, affects another.<br /><br />Henry David Thoreau stated, \\"Where there is one, there is a majority of one.

B002S0OBN2|3.0|After reading many reviews, either very positive, or very negative, I have to say I am still on the fence with this one.  Again, like many other posters, I am a huge fan of ALW.  How he created the original Phantom, along others like Joseph and Evita, amazes me, and I believe he is truly brilliant.  However, I feel like the characters have changed; they are not anything like the original characters, who were endearing, even little-seen Meg. I feel such empathy for the Phantom, and you can feel the sexuality charged between The Phantom and Christine, especially in Point of No Return, from the original.  But in this one, and perhaps I need to listen to it more, and maybe even see it, I don't get that feeling at all.  I agree with one poster who thought the lyrics were rather simplistic--\\"custard and mustard\\"--is this ALW?  Meg has turned into an obnoxious you-know-what, and I do have a very difficult time believing Christine, with her now debt-ridden husband (also hard for me to believe) would go from the Paris Opera House to a Coney Island freak show.  And the fact about Gustave's parantage--where did that come from?  Anway, I do not think I will have the entire soundtrack memorized 20 years from now, as I do the original, although, there are some very good songs, like \\"Til I hear You Sing,\\" and again, as some posters mentioned, the electric guitars are WAY out of place here, and \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" is not a song meant for the Phantom and a child--it's for the Phantom and his lover, Christine.  The reviews I have read on this have been very helpful, and I find it interesting that the reviews on amazon.com.uk are much more positive than the American ones.  Who says Americans are not discerning?
0545123267|5.0|The story in this book is told by the two main characters' point of view, Sam and Grace. Grace is in love with the wolf that saved her from being eaten alive by other wolves when she was little. Every winter she looks for her wolf's yellow eyes outside in the woods, watching her, protecting her. Sam keeps himself hidden in the woods watching Grace from a distance wishing he could be with her. But, when a group of hunters causes Sam to become human the meeting between the two of them is inevitable. Soon they become attached by an inexplicable love to each other. They spend their time together getting to know each other and trying to keep Sam from turning back to a wolf by making him warm and protecting him from the low temperatures, signs of a cold winter.     What it's amazing about this story is that you could feel a sense of loss since maybe this was Sam's last time being human and you could really feel what this meant for both of them, they are finally together but, at the same time it coul be their last time with each other.    Another thing I liked about this book was the description everytime Sam was shivering and struggling to stay human whe he was exposed to the cold for a long time, and the things Grace did to keep him warm, by her side. You could really feel the sadness and the desperation that the characters felt in each of these situations.    All in all, this book exceeded my expectations. With that being said, I can't wait for Linger to come out!!!
B002XMGGK6|2.0|Law Abiding Citizen is a movie that has an interesting premise, but it's execution (pun intended) is ultimately unsatisfying.   Ambition-driven D.A. vs. Revenge-driven grieving widower/father- neither character is portrayed with enough sympathetic characteristics to make the viewer care about what happens to them. The movie quickly devolves into a waiting game for the next high tech killing to occur.     Jamie Fox's talent is wasted here, and Gerard Butler is just simply a waste- he has one expression/emotion throughout the whole movie.     Don't waste your time or money.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|First, I am a HUGE fan of the original Phantom of the Opera. I had huge expectations for this musical and this recording has surpassed them!<br /><br />I just finished listening to this wonderfull recoring of the new Phantom sequel and all I can say is WOW!! What a powerful and emotional story. The music is great as well. All of the tracks are just as great as the original Phantom's music. The major stand out numbers are:<br />The Coney Island Waltz<br />'Til I Hear You Sing<br />Look With Your Heart<br />Beneath A Moonless Sky<br />The Beauty Underneath<br />Why Does She Love Me?<br />Devil Take the Hindmost<br />Love Never Dies<br />Please Miss Giry, I want to go back...<br /><br />I cannot wait until this show comes to New York so I can see it.<br />If you are a huge Phantom fan then you need to get this recoring.
B00275EGX8|5.0|While I think there were more praiseworthy movies for the best movie of the year, this is still a must see.  While it's non-political which may disappoint some, there are some insights into human nature that make it a powerful movie.  Additionally it appropriately examines the difficulties of the Iraqi war.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Got this watch based on the Seiko reputation.  It shipped fairly quickly, and was exactly what I was looking for style wise.      Unfortunately, it ran fast.  And I don't mean just a little fast.  It gained approximately 1 hour in 12 hours.  I couldn't even pretend to wear it.  I contacted Seiko's customer service, and they provided me with a shipping label to send it in for repair.  It's been gone about two weeks now, and I have no idea when it will be back.    I'll amend this review if Seiko makes it right, but right now I'm wishing I had gone with the Casio.    Update:  After nearly a month, I got the watch back.  So far it seems to be working fine.  Based on the customer service, I upgraded this purchase from 1 to 3 stars.  The watch is nice, but it is frustrating to have to send a brand new item in for repair.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An absolute MUST see!  Definitely gave me a new perspective on what I choose to eat.
0452284392|2.0|The whole could be condensed to a 20 page leaflet and still gets it point across very clearly. However, the author inserts too much irrelevant or repetitive stuff to fill the pages.<br /><br />The author also makes such a big deal about his own research... which shows some level of ignorance and/or narcissism. Because he seems to know almost nothing about the historical development in the relevant areas. To me, he (and his students and postdocs) were reinventing some common wheels and relabel them with their names. Readers may be misled by the book's narrative. He should have known the works by Yule and others, and he would feel how ignorant he is.<br /><br />The central stuff (power law) is valuable, but the author wants to make it (his work) look like Newton's apple in human history. The author, rather than presenting the ideas in a concise unbiased way, spend much effort to tell their personal stories (such as his group memebers' names, what jokes they made, what they said, did, how smart they are, what kind of clothes he wore when he talked to one member, ...stuff that I DO NOT care about).  I am surprised how can he not mention/emphasize Mandelbrot's work which is fairly recent and the author's work is really a small but practical application of the broader Mandelbrot's work.<br /><br />The author taps in social and economic areas. I am surprised that he had no clue that there were more advanced knowledge/theories/models that have much more insight than his. For example, Pareto's work.<br /><br />I am also surprised at his ignorance about scale-free network studies (with a long history) in biology. See Nielsen's research more than 50 years ago; see Geoffrey West, Brown, etc.'s work more recently. They are all better than the author of this book.<br /><br />Now, the book is pretty cheap, so it's okay to buy and read it. But be warned, you dont need to read every page, just go through it quickly... it is almost repeating the same idea over and over. It's a good book in some sense, but shallow and too much self-promotion.<br /><br />One word: ignorance can make one feel boasted, and \\"scare-free\\". Reinventing wheels and relabelling them is either ignorance or unethical. I hope it is the former.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|I never was a huge fan of the Bee Gees until about 4 years ago. We were living in France at the time and we had located a new and used CD store where I purchased my first Bee Gee's CD.(Love Songs)I now have purchased 3 more CD's with The Ultimate being the most recent. Honestly, I don't know why anyone couldn't enjoy a Bee Gee's song now and then; you can't help but smile while listening to them, and they make for great driving music: no chance of falling asleep at the wheel!
B0035G1K7S|5.0|Being a fan of The White Stripes, I expected this documentary to be outstanding already. But while watching it, I can only describe it as an epic rock-doc. Emmett Malloy brings that power of Jack and Meg at an all time high, with concert footage, interviews, traveling, and a deeper look into what makes The White Stripes a true savior of garage rock. It also makes Canada look seventeen times better too!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|loved this book!  I read this book in about 4 days which is really fast for me.  It kept me wondering up until the last few pages how the story was going to turn out.
0316017922|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is well written and very thought provoking.  Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society.  Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion.  My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high \\"social\\" intelligence = success.  The \\"luck\\" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook.  Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely.  This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions).  Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W. Bush -- does anyone think that he would have been president if not for Daddy Bush and the family and life circumstances he was born into?!
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is a great family movie filled with drama, warmth and humor! Sandra Bullock gives a super performance! Good casting.
B0024FAG5I|5.0|It's been noted, in a review of this very film,  that all the great westerns seem to be written by people who have never set foot in America. Simon Moore delivers a script that is simple, maybe even a bit shallow, but one that rings true with mythic storytelling in a larger-than-life contest with fronteir legends.*<br /><br />This is decidedly non-traditional in film style, with Sam Raimi at his best, and cinematography that should do well with the Blu Ray treatment. This film has my favorite Russell Crowe character, a solid turn from DiCaprio, great scene chewing from Hackman, and it made me actually like Sharon Stone, who manages to keep up with Eastwood's ghost and turn out a performance that really surprised me. The rest of the cast is stellar.<br /><br />If you want a serious, character-driven Western like Unforgiven, this is movie will very much disappoint. This flick is, however, one of the best Western-style adrenaline rides, up there with The Good, The Bad, The Weird. IT has a quirky sense of humor, fun characters, a solid (if simple) story, and a beautiful combination of directing & editing.<br /><br />*While all the characters are fictional, their personalities are classic frontier mythos, blown up way out of proportion, even further than Leone managed to do.

0393072231|1.0|Michael Lewis has gained notoriety through two genres: 1) his caustic critique of Wall Street excesses (\\"Liar's Poker\\") and 2) his hero-making profiles of relative unknowns (\\"The Blind Side\\" and \\"Moneyball\\"). Lewis would have us believe that \\"The Big Short\\" reflects the former. Unfortunately, it better qualifies as the latter. For in \\"The Big Short,\\" the heroes of the narrative are not admirable people, but rather the ultimate in greedy opportunists.         The protagonists of Lewis's book are among the few wily minds in this country who managed to foresee the subprime crisis and the carnage it left in its wake. But instead of sounding the alarm to help government regulators engage in damage limitation, these men either kept silent or alerted only select investors in the interest of exploiting the crisis for their (considerable) gain.        Lewis fancies himself a critic of Wall Street abuses and thus would no doubt balk at the suggestion that he is treating his protagonists as heroes a la Billy Beane (\\"Moneyball\\"). Yet, the author dedicates considerable text to humanizing these individuals.  For instance, Lewis examines the nature-and-nurture sources behind their prescient, financial genius (see Burry's Asperger's and glass eye) and describes in detail the uphill battle these men face as naysayers denounce their predictions and short-selling strategy regarding the subprime market.     As a result of Lewis's portraits, the reader finds him/herself almost sympathetic to these sleazeballs and thus perversely rooting for the collapse of the subprime mortgage bond market just so these \\"visionaries\\" can be vindicated.      And for this reason, Lewis should be ashamed of writing a book that elevates from relative obscurity and mythologizes a bunch of vultures who feasted on the carnage of our financial system. (Though he claims to be dismayed that Gordon Gekko and his greedy bond brokers of Liar's Poker inspired a new generation of Wall St recruits????)      A man with Lewis's knowlege of financial markets could have written any sort of book about the free-falling economy that has cost so many so dearly.  He certainly is not lacking in opinions on the subject. (You cannot turn on the tv or radio these days without seeing or hearing the man). But the author chose to write this PARTICULAR book.... one that included sensational, colorful characters, however unsavory-- the kind that drives more book sales than the typical financial fare in stores at present.       So to my mind, Mr. Lewis has sacrificed his credibility as a reputable critic of Wall Street abuses on the altar of publishing profits. And consequently, he is every bit as mercenary as the subjects he profiles.   (And should you doubt his greed, know that Lewis himself chose a delayed release on Kindle to inflate his profit margins).
B002VECM4A|4.0|Set in Harlem in 1987, \\"Precious: Based on the Novel `Push` By Sapphire\\" takes us to a world that most of us will be fortunate enough never to have to experience first hand - one where troubled adults produce even more troubled offspring, where individuals, ignored and abandoned by the society at large, struggle to survive in a self-perpetuating cycle of hopelessness and despair.  Just by the mere act of taking us to this world, the movie at least forces us to acknowledge its existence.  Whether or not we choose to do something about it is a whole other matter.<br /><br />This harrowing drama, adapted by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, focuses on Claireese `Precious` Jones, an introverted, inarticulate and overweight 16-year-old victim of incest who is already pregnant with her second child from the father who regularly rapes her.  Though filled with dreams of a better life, Precious is caught in a vortex of misery from which there appears to be no escape: grinding poverty, a mother who abuses her (physically, sexually, psychologically), a school system that is failing her, and peers who harass and torment her on a regular basis (though she is certainly streetwise and physically imposing enough to give back as good as she gets).  Small wonder, then, that the youngster has no friends and zero sense of self-worth.  Only in voiceover recitation is Precious able to articulate her innermost thoughts and feelings and, even then, those reflections are strictly limited to the vocabulary and reference-points familiar to her from the harshly circumscribed environment in which she lives.  Yet, those reflections are no less heartfelt and sincere for that.  Even the dreams she has for her own life - of becoming a world-famous singer and dancer - are fueled by the cliches of the pop culture world that surrounds her and, hence, are in no way realistic or achievable for a girl in her situation.<br /><br />The small glimmers of realistic hope that do find their way into Precious' life come in the form of a remedial reading program she enrolls in after her pregnancy forces her to leave her current school, and the caring and compassionate teacher who is the first to unlock some of the potential trapped deep inside the young girl's damaged psyche.  Precious is convinced that no one loves her - worse, that, since every form of love that has come her way up to this point in her life has been hurtful and damaging, that love itself must, by definition, be hurtful and damaging as well.<br /><br />Directed with unhurried restraint by Lee Daniels, \\"Precious\\" is a showcase for some amazing female performers who, in the short time we spend with them, make an indelible mark on our spirits and hearts.  Paula Patton is very good as the attractive lesbian teacher who reaches out a hand of friendship to the troubled girl, as is a de-glamorized Mariah Carey playing Precious' social worker, Ms. Weiss.  But it is Gabourey Sidibe, in her film debut as Precious, and comedienne Mo'Nique (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this role), as the monstrous mother from hell, who create unforgettable portraits - the first, of a girl who holds everything she feels inside herself almost to the point of emotional implosion, and the second, of a woman who can`t react to the world around her except through an uncontrollable paroxysm of anger and rage.<br /><br />The movie occasionally interrupts the grim narrative with fantasy sequences that reflect Precious' desires to escape from reality - including, most bizarrely, one in which she imagines herself as a character in the Sophia Loren movie \\"Two Women,\\" of all things.  Random but definitely interesting.<br /><br />Uncompromising in its realism, yet still daring to hope, \\"Precious\\" the movie perfectly reflects Precious the person.f a remedial reading program she enrolls in after her pregnancy forces her to leave her current school, and the caring and compassionate teacher who is the first to unlock some of the potential trapped deep inside the young girl's damaged psyche.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling was one of those books that everyone told me to read, and I said \\"Yea, I will\\" but never got around to it. When I saw it in the library, the cover sucked me in and I knew I couldn't put it off any longer. Let me tell you, I so wish I read this one earlier!    Gracelings are people who are born with graces. Their graces can be something as simple as cooking or climbing trees well, to easily killing with your bare hands. Gracelings are identified by their eyes, each eye a different color. Katsa, are protagonist, is a graceling. I loved Katsa, it's hard not to. She is a strong girl, a fighter. Through the story, Katsa struggles with what her grace is and fears for what she is capable of. She discovers along the way there is more to her grace than she first thought. It was great watching her progress in this story. Cashore truly shows her talent in her character's development.     And then there was Po. In all honesty, I thought there was no way I would find a guy named Po sexy. All I thought about when I first heard Po was a tellytubby. Man was I wrong! Po is incredebly sexy. He is a fellow graceling to Katsa, but from a different one of the seven kingdoms. He treated Katsa like an equal and admitted when Katsa was better at something than him. What's not to love about that? Po is definitely going to be one of the guys I will think about again.     The chemistry between Katsa and Po is perfect. They go from friends, to infatuation, and finally to love. I loved how playful and flirty they were with each other. There were a few love scenes between them, but they were very tastefully done. I also loved the fact that Katsa stuck to her feeling that she did not want to get married and have kids, even when she fell for Po. It would have just been out of character for her to change her mind on that part.    Bitterblue was a character that was really enjoyable, which was surprising to me since she didn't show up until after the middle of the story. She was such a strong little girl that my heart broke for. I loved watching as Katsa got closer to her. She went from seeing Bitterblue as her duty, to truly caring for the little girl.    While I loved this story, there were a few parts I wished were a little better. There were some parts that seemed to drag a little too long for me, especially when Katsa and Bitterblue were in the mountains. It also seemed like some problems would come up, and then they would be taken care of too quickly. I also would have enjoyed a little more back story, especially on the story behind the council. It makes sense to me now why there is a prequel. But these things did not stand in the way of me enjoying the story.     Graceling was a great debut filled with beautiful writing and spot on character development. This story captivates you a sucks you into a different world mixed with the perfect dose of fantasy and romance. I can't wait to read the prequel, Fire, and to see what Ms. Cashore comes out with next.
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a delight to read.  With a nod to the translator, Reg Keeland, the pages flow together seamlessly and create an absorbing and fresh style that demands your attention.  The characters are remarkable, the plot is suspenseful, and after it's over, you find yourself incapable to stop yourself from reading the first few pages of the sequel that is included with the book.<br /><br />Larsson's writing is humble, a refreshing break from other best selling authors.  The style is straightforward, but Larsson's control of description transports you to a distant world, which doesn't seem that far from reality.  The treatment of corporate corruption, sexual assault, and prejudice all combine together, creating a sense of morality that encompasses every aspect of modern day culture without sounding preachy.<br /><br />For me, this story is an encouraging sign for readers: fiction can be entertaining and brilliant.  This one should stay on the charts for years to come.
0385737424|5.0|I absolutely LOVED When You Reach Me.    It was recommended to me by my mother who had bought it for the daughter of a friend.  She went out and bought her own copy, loaned me hers, and now I have gotten my own.  I actually read it twice in a row because I enjoyed it so much and wanted to see what clues I may have missed.  This book is so beautiful in the writing and the way the story unfolds, I couldn't put it down.  I was transported back to the 70's (and I wasn't even born until the 80's!).  Highly recommended for all ages.  Wonderful!

B0031RAOVY|4.0|I saw the original Japanese version a long time ago, which is pretty awesome. And I think this US remake did a pretty good job. With a touching story like this, I guess it's hard to go wrong. I especially appreciate the director and the cast for not having made it too sentimental. For those nippers out there, you can't miss it. Hachi is so adorable and dignified, although it pains me in the end because I wished the dog hadn't done what it did. But dogs are dogs,they have their own mind, which makes them so precious. As an animal lover myself, I hope everyone who has a dog can just treat it the way it deserves. Of the animal kingdom, human included, dogs are definitely a better being.
B001G7SS9G|3.0|It was an ok movie. The book was a lot better though. I was expecting a little bit more out of the ultimate collecters edition. All it came with were a booklet with pictures, flashcards of cities that had been destroyed, the 3 disc edition of the movie and this weird hologram thing. The movie wasn't very good so i'll give this a 3 because it really wasn't what i expected the movie and the ultimate collectors set to be.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|Oprah?  Seriouly?  What are her credentials for this?  Attenborough has a Natural Sciences degree from Cambridge and has been creating nature documentaries for over 50 years.  He also happens to be a brilliant speaker who actually understands what he's talking about, having written dozens of book on the subjects about which he speaks when he narrates films such as Planet Earth, Blue Planet, and Life.  Discovery decided to redub Planet Earth with Sigourney Weaver and now is embarking upon similar folly by having Oprah butcher Life.  I won't watch it on Discovery and I won't buy this junk DVD.  I'll be waiting until I can get the real version, just like I did with Planet Earth.  I can't understand this desire to unnecessarily replace the great with the awful.  (I'm American, not British, by the way - this is about quality, not nationality).

B0026P3G12|5.0|WOW, First Paul Potts and now Susan Boyle - Who else is hiding their talent under a bushel?  Susan Boyle has the purest voice, crystal clear and beautiful, as she sings the  songs on her first album \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". I particularly loved the emotion that infuses \\"Wild Horses\\", the first song on the album. She then follows with \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"You'll See\\" a haunting song that echoes her life before her fame.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art\\" grace the center of the album followed by two songs that surely come from the heart: \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" and \\"Proud\\".  This is the album that has been on my stereo since the day I bought it from Amazon. It is amazing!

B001TH16DS|5.0|In the early 70's I used to run home after school after the bus dropped us off out in the country and race up to the house to watch Star Trek at 4 p.m. every day.  Star Trek made a huge impression on me growing up on a farm in the midwest.  It started my love for techlogy and computers.  I believe it's a big reason I'm in the computer industry today.<br /><br />Well getting on to the review.  I recently picked up a PS3 to use as a blu ray player and gaming console.  My first TV episode blu ray purchase was Star Trek:  The Original Series - Season 1.  On a big screen TV these episodes look simply amazing.  I have an Apple TV and have downloaded the remastered episodes from Apple and these look noticably better to me.  Like other reviewers said, the colors and picture quality is amazing.  I started out with one of my favorite episodes \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\".  This looks better than any movie I've seen from the 60's and 70's.  It's a great but tragic story too.  Sally Kellerman and Gary Lockwood are excellent guest stars.  I wish they would have figured out a way to bring them back in other episodes or movies.<br /><br />The Billy Blackburn home movies are a hoot.  It's really great to see the behind the scenes stuff.  You'll notice that Leonard Nimoy is deadly serious most of the time even when off camera.  Blackburn says he rarely got out of character.  Plus there is some other surprises with Blackburn that I won't spoil.<br /><br />If you're a SciFi lover or just a lover of good writing and television.  I would add this to your collection without hesitation.  I hope they do a similiar restoration to the \\"Twilight Zone\\" series and \\"The Next Generation\\".

0061922315|5.0|\\"Secret Daughter\\" is simply remarkable...a novel that keeps its readers emotionally invested in 5 characters. In addition, Gowda's elan in descriptions of places and feelings makes the journey quite compelling. But, the best part of the book is the nuanced stuff: the soul-deadening impact of long periods of marriage, culture crises for Indians lost in America, and the hope & strength of people who have sacrificed so much. I highly recommend this novel. As someone who has read over 20 Indian books, I can state that \\"Secret Daughter\\" and Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" are my two favorite novels of the genre. They stay with you for quite some time.

1607060825|4.0|This book is mainly a collection of comic book covers done by Frank Cho throughout most of his career. It starts off with Marvel covers that feature a lot of his work with Captain Marvel(Carol Danvers), but has a little bit of everything from the Avengers and other titles. The later art is mostly from his work on She-Ra and some Liberty Meadows, though not as much as you might think, given his long career with that series. Throughout the book he supplements it with some sketches, released or unreleased.<br /><br />The art is amazing, but the meat of it is it's mostly eye candy for fans of Cho's work. If you're not a fan, most of this book will probably go unappreciated and you might be better off buying individual comics with his work instead. And as good as this book is, it's probably more satisfying to visit a comic convention and get some sketches and other items from Frank personally, as it is from any artist you like.

B000007MVD|5.0|To say I heard the Beatles perform live at the Hollywood Bowl would be something of a misstatement inasmuch as what I heard for the most part were their adolescent-girl fans screaming. (I mostly remember John Lennon doing a little impromptu shuffle dance during one or two numbers, and I recall my regrets that real music fans couldn't hear much over all the girly shrieking.) The screaming also rendered H'wood Bowl recordings as virtually unlistenable, in my opinion, also because the band's tempos and synchrony were thrown off by their inability to hear themselves through the din. Those were the days before the wireless in-ear monitors that rock performers now routinely wear on stage, especially in outdoor venues.    \\"Live at the BBC\\" therefore comes as a most pleasant surprise because it marks the first opportunity I've ever found as a lifelong fan to really hear the Beatles perform live and in spontaneous real time. Unlike video clips from \\"Ed Sullivan\\" or \\"Hard Day's Night\\" or their carefully polished early studio recordings released after multiple takes, this extensive compilation reveals how tight and versatile they were as a live act, and how they still were maturing as performers during the earlier years of their unprecedented fame. The band members' physically youthful vocal chords of those early, break-out years also are showcased here, before the wear and tear of countless more live performances and excessive smoking or whatever took just a little off the choir-boy quality off their voices. Which is not to say they didn't ever growl and wail to hard-core rocking perfection during their in-studio BBC gigs. And the inventive, unrestrained drumming comes off really well, too.    I'm sure glad I have this important piece of musical history in my CD collection, even if I will only listen rarely, when I'm in the mood for classic \\"roots\\" rock and heart-swelling nostalgia.
0385737947|4.0|The story line is great! I couldn't put the book down until I was finished. Unlike a lot of reviewers I did like the ending. It left me wanting more. My only two complaints are that (1) Chuck probably wont be a bigger factor in the series and (2) Teresa probably will.

0810988232|5.0|I am a long time fan of both Brian and Wendy Froud, and have been enjoying my \\"Faeries' Oracle\\" for 10 years now.  \\"The Heart of Faerie Oracle\\" is a collaboration between Brian and Wendy, and is easily every bit as stunning as Brian's first deck.     There are 65 named cards in this deck (along with 3 unnamed cards), and it includes a lovely hard bound book (137 pages) featuring antique style pictures of each card along with a description on beautiful parchment-like paper.      The faeries are divided into categories:    The Faerie Queens  The Queens' Consorts  The Archetypes  Sprites  The Ladies  Tricksters  The Journey    There are also a couple of example layouts to use, an interview with Brian and Wendy Froud, and then several blank pages to use as notes.    You can somewhat pick up on the energy of the card by looking at the picture, but I found much deeper meaning for each faerie by reading the description in the book.  Of course, this can slow you down on doing readings for others until you have read what each and every card means, but I have found that even in the short time I've had this deck, my readings have been accurate, powerful, and extremely helpful (even when I've had to peek at the book).      I have also found, unlike almost every other deck I've worked with, that once I've read the story behind each card, it's easy to remember it - so I don't have to keep looking it up.      The faerie themselves are absolutely beautiful, showing all aspects of the faerie, both light and dark.    The Heart of Faerie Oracle is not a rainbows and sunshine deck. It embraces both the light and dark aspects of these beings, who in turn embrace us, both light and dark.  I have found this deck to be one of the powerful oracles I've worked with to date, and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in discovering  more about the world of the faerie, or those who already walk comfortably in the realm.
0393072231|1.0|Where is the Kindle version?  I am not going to be bullied into buying a hardcover copy.  Mr. Lewis and his publisher can either provide a kindle version or forget about making any money from me.  Why did Amazon, who sold me the Kindle, agree to sell the hard copy without a Kindle option?  Shouldn't they show appreciation for the customers who invested in Kindle by insisting that publishers they distribute make a Kindle format available as a condition of providing distribution services?

I don't appreciate that she stands around half the workout, which is absolutely what she does. She sits there and hollers at you that you aren't working hard enough ... while she is standing there watching her \\"2 best girls\\".    I also don't appreciate her repeating time after time that it is a 20 minute workout, when it is 27 minutes.    I guess her type of motivation doesn't particularly work with me. I get mad when I think someone is not straight with me, and to keep repeating that a 27 minute workout is a 20 minute workout ... I don't appreciate it.

B00005JLK1|2.0|Another failure in the long line of Dark Castle Horror remakes following the (arguable) success of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. GHOST SHIP  pits a salvage crew against a ship full of vengeful ghosts that seek to drive out the evil spirit that has tied them to the vessel. This tiresome take on the Old Dark House motif drags forward as the characters wander aimlessly through the ship's dark corridors with no rewarding suspense or bloodshed. An unforgettable opening sequence in which an entire dance floor of passengers is bisected by one of the ship's suspension cables promises fast-paced action and gore that never arrives. Instead, the audience is bludgeoned by one safe PG-13 death after another, hits that are not softened by the poor computerized FX or make-up work. The characters can only be judged from most annoying to least annoying, none of whom draw the least bit of sympathy or support as they are lined up only to be knocked down. Beck's heavy metal soundtrack and music video styling suggests that the film was geared directly towards turning a quick teen buck in its theatrical run, with no intent on creating a lasting effect on the viewer. This is garbage mainstream Horror at its worst.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000002U82|4.0|The Dark Side of the Moon is Pink Floyd's ninth album and I think we can consider it as a  single extended piece rather than, a collection of lyrics.  Even though this is a concept album, a number of the cuts can stand on their own.  I'm thirty six years old, I've always heard about this Pink Floyd's album but I had never listened to it, one day I was looking at the television and saw a Pink Floyd Tribute and I decided that I had to own one of the best-selling records of all times.    There are people out there, I was one of them, who have never heard the album. If you're one of them, you owe it to yourself to borrow a copy from someone and give it a spin.
B002VECM4A|5.0|If you wanna watch a hardcore drama movie...this is it!! this is the one, PRECIOUS is a very hardcore drama movie that depending on what you're expecting will even moved you, surprised you or shocked you cause to be honest with you all, I was all 3, what I expected was the opposite of irony cause when you think that the movie is gonna go in one direction it goes the other. Realistic in many ways but very shifting in others. Mo'nique & Mariah Carey's characters  really departure from the usual roles they played on the big screen,no wonder Mo'nique won an oscar for this one cause it's totally the opposite she's been doing on the big screen. Mariah Carey comeback into Ms. Weiss character is a bit of a shocker cause is very opposite to her too.<br />I was talking about it to a co-worker of mine about Mo'nique's character in the movie & he was shocked, cause he's a huge fan of hers & said to me \\"Mo'nique the comedian playing such a dramatic role?, Impossible!!\\"<br />I've watched the movie 3 times now & will keep on cause it's very touching, down to earth hardcore drama, & it makes you think & realize that in fact there are lots of PRECIOUS girls out there.

B0035J6TAI|2.0|I have been a Peter Gabriel fan since I purchased my first record album ever in 1967 ... \\"From Genesis to Revelation.\\"  Last week I read that Peter was not going to attend the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction for Genesis because, \\"...it was like going back to high school.\\"  And he has moved on, or something like that.  With \\"Scratch My Back\\" he has moved on to a nursing home.  I'm not a musician, so I am not really sure what makes this disc so incredibly boring, but to me every song sounds nearly the same.  Are they all in the same key?  Not sure.  Same timbre?  Could be.  Perhaps it's that what makes Peter Gabriel such an amazing artist for me is the music he writes.  So I can partially blame it on his poor choice of artists and songs for which he will presumably get like treatment.  Bottom line is this.  I read the reviews and was skeptical.  But I always think the price of the disc is worth it if there is just one song I can listen to over and over.  Sorry, but not this time. Wish I had better news.

B002YOKVU4|2.0|I am a huge fan of this movie. I've seen it dozens of times, and was so excited when it was released on blu-ray. In terms of the quality of the movie, it's a terrific movie with great performances. I highly recommend it. The only problem I had with this blu-ray is that there are numerous sound effects missing from the audio track. Maybe I had it on a wrong setting or the blu ray i purchased is the only one having this problem, but if the blu-ray is in fact missing audio elements from the original cut, I find it very disappointing. I'm not sure if Criterion Collection plan on re-releasing a blu-ray version of this movie, but If they do, hopefully all the audio will will be included in tact. Bottom line: I'm fairly irritated I spent the money on an incomplete transfer.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|The MacManus brothers have been in deep hiding with their father, Il Duce in the quiet valleys of Ireland, far removed from their former vigilante lives. When word comes that a beloved priest has been killed by sinister forces from deep within the mob, the brothers return to Boston to mount a violent and bloody crusade to bring justice to those responsible. With a new partner in crime Romeo and FBI operative Eunice hot on their trail. The story soon opens up into a deeper plot about past sins coming back to haunt their characters. \\"All Saints Day\\" continues the duologue slick, trigger happy style of the first movie with rapid fire gun play and snapfire duologue that is throughly entertaining. The gun play here is even more stylized, and it makes for some very entertaining action packed scenes that should please everyone who loved the first movie. Most of the old cast has returned, and then there is the new cast, who bring some entertaining acting chops with them, mostly in the form of comic relief. This is a very entertaining and decently written movie. Highly recommended.

B0031MA7RA|5.0|I heard the author on a broadcast of NPR's \\"Fresh Air\\" with Terri Garr and was so intrigued with the conversation that I looked up the book on Amazon.  I got it at a great price.    This is one amazing story for anyone who has had the misfortune of being close to someone who has had a stroke, for stroke victims, and medical professionals.     It is a very unique perspective from the stroke victim.  We are usually told about strokes in very analytical terms... this personlizes the experience.    GP's should make this a must read!    You will be drawn into and fascinated by this book. The spiritual aspects are most surprising!    Please read... highly recommended.

0385335989|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like Drums of Autumn after reading the reviews here, but I loved it.  I thought it was just as good as the 1st and 3rd book and way better than Dragonfly in Amber.  I found myself reading about Claire and Jamie and enjoying it, but wanting to skim through to get to Brianna.  I really enjoyed reading about Brianna and fell in love with her character!  I also enjoyed Brianna and Roger when together, but I did not enjoy just reading about Roger.  I love to read about Jamie and can't seem to get enough of him, but Roger bores me and those 10 or so chapters telling his story were so boring to me!  I actually skipped the part where he was on the ship and read a few chapters ahead and then went back and read it....although I should have just skipped it because I missed nothing at all.  I was also a little bored with all the indian stuff.  I wished Ian would not have stayed with them and became one of them.  I really wanted to see Ian and Lizzy fall in love...oh well.  Besides those few boring parts though I loved everything else.  I loved Brianna getting to meet Jamie!  I can't wait for book five!<br /><br />Spoiler:  I also really loved that she surprised us with the baby...and the rape.  I had forgotten all about Brianna even running into Bonnett and seeing the ring until she said the baby isn't Roger's...and then preceeded to tell Claire what happened to her.  What a surprise!  Even though I was not happy about it...it was definately a shocker!

I paid $9.99 and was worth its dollars.<br /><br />If you found my words helpful to you in making your decision please vote on it. Thanks and pleasant viewing.

1439102937|1.0|This book is horrible. The characters lack depth, there is no flow in transition, and the storying just drags on. I bought this book at an airport and thought that since \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was good, that this book had to be good too. It was a fail attempt to replicate Sex and the City. You can't identify with any of the characters, they are petty, vain, boring, and childish.

0307463745|3.0|For nearly every business rule you know, the authors (Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson) have crafted a contrarian view. It's hard to argue with the authors' success at 37signals so their advice is worth listening to. Much of their advice is aimed at start ups but could be applied (selectively) elsewhere. Am not sure how much of what they believe can be applied to bigger businesses, though.    Some of the more memorable pieces of advice:    -- Create products you would use, not ones you think people need.  -- Don't create a business plan. The world changes too quickly.  -- Do everything you can to not use others' money. It only ruins everything for all sorts of reasons.  -- Keep things leaner than lean. (If you think you need to hire someone, do the job yourself first, then decide.)  -- Don't write down what customers tell you. That way you'll only remember the ideas that are repeated. (The theory is that if you listen to every idea you won't ever create a product or service.)  -- There's no imperative to grow -- as long as you can create something that creates a profit.  -- Hire great writers. (My favorite for obvious reasons.)    The authors are big fans of running a lean, very lean, operation. Extra bodies and resources only add complexity.    The book's a quick read but something you can refer back to often which is probably a good idea.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|LAW ABIDING CITIZEN<br /><br />STARRING: Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, Leslie Bibb, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Regina Hall, Michael Irby and Viola Davis<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Kurt Wimmer<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: F. Gary Gray<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 16 October 2009<br /><br />I don't know exactly what I was expecting Law Abiding Citizen to be like; but I know I wasn't expecting Saw meets The Punisher! It's a thriller more than an action or horror picture, but it embodies similar elements of both these genres.<br /><br />You need to ensure that when you take your seat, you are completely ready, because when the movie starts, it starts! I'm not sure whether it was due to editing for time or if it was the filmmaker's direct intention, but we get the wind knocked out of us from the get-go. While I was not a fan of this method for this particular film, I can see how most will appreciate it a great deal.<br /><br />We meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and his family for about three seconds before they are attacked by two intruders. Clyde witnesses his wife and daughter being butchered and brutalized in front of his very eyes, before being left for dead himself. I'll admit it was very shocking, but we don't even get to know the characters at all before they are slain; so for the rest of the film we have no sense of who they were. Two or three minutes more with them would have been sufficient for me.<br /><br />We move forward and learn Clyde has survived and that the assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), has been appointed to his case. Nick is rushed and impatient with Clyde when he does not agree to the plea-bargain that Nick has been ordered by the DA to make; one of the killers will testify against his partner for a lessoned prison sentence. Nick believes this deal is better than no deal, as due to a loop-hole, both killers could walk. Nick informs him that it's too late to negotiate; the deal has gone through and that's just the way the system works.  Clyde is devastated but there is nothing he can do. Or is there?<br /><br />10 years go by and Nick has had a successful career and now has a daughter of his own. We have no idea what Clyde has been up to; until the execution of one of the killers goes horribly wrong. When the other killer winds up brutally murdered, all evidence points directly to Clyde.<br /><br />It's clear that Clyde expected to be arrested because after these two sadistic, well planned killings (which I will not describe in detail), we know he is smarter than anyone else in the film.<br /><br />Once arrested, he outsmarts Nick in a very well written and acted scene and that's just the first of many similar amazing moments. More people start dying; all linked to Clyde's case. But Clyde is locked up. Can he really be responsible? Yes he can. We learn along with everyone else in the film, that Clyde is not your every day guy.<br /><br />He has a past similar to that of Rambo. In one particular scene, Nick interviews someone that Clyde worked with in the past. The man flat out tells Nick, \\"If he wants you dead... you're dead.\\"<br /><br />On top of all that, Clyde's spent the last decade familiarizing himself with the law and the supposed justice system. Eventually he is in a place to bargain with the city and Nick is forced to act as a liaison between Clyde and Philadelphia. Clyde gets under Nick's skin by asking for ridiculous favors in exchange for some self-incriminating information. He is exposing how corrupt the system actually is.<br /><br />One of the great things about a film like Law Abiding Citizen is that you are entertained visually by the action sequences, but at the same time this is a film that really makes you think. You can't help but ask yourself what you would do if you were in Clyde's shoes and this happened to you.<br /><br />I didn't feel like Jamie Foxx really brought his full potential to this film like I have seen himdo in others. On the other hand, he's such an extraordinary actor that perhaps this role was just too simple for him.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is an amazing actor. He has a wide range of roles he can play. From his barbarian of a character in 300 to his romantic side in P.S., I Love You; Butler has shown us his vast range of talent.  In this film you believe him in every scene and he and Foxx make a good match for each other.<br /><br />Some of the things Clyde pulls off are a little far-fetched; but the film was beautifully written and directed, and is full of twists and turns that you will never see coming. The movie races forward like a bullet tearing through flesh and we are along for the ride, loving every minute of it.ust too simple for him.     Gerard Butler is an amazing actor.

While searching we came across Fringe. Skeptical because of some of the lame comments, we still decided to give it a try. This series is absolutely amazing and deserves its place with anything five star rated. You will not be let down by this show. Incredible casting and fantastic story-lines leaving you wanting more, as Lost does. Do not pass up this show. You will not regret it.
0764207407|5.0|[[ASIN:0764207407 Sense and Sensibility (Insight Editions)]], a classic fiction novel written by Jane Austen and published almost 200 years ago, is still an extremely popular story today. Bethany House Publishers recently released the \\"Insight Edition\\" which includes footnotes of trivia, notes, and inspiration to help readers understand more background to this story. It is important to note that the story has not been changed in any way. Some of these notes are historical, that expand on life in England in the 1800s; others are facts about Jane Austen that coincide with the story; still others are themes of faith, or comments on the characters or plot.<br /><br />This was my second reading of Sense and Sensibility and I definitely enjoyed reading the extra tidbits included in this version. The culture of the 1800s is very different from current culture and there were many times that the notes gave me a greater understanding of various situations.<br /><br />I recommend this version to all Jane Austen fans, you will probably have new insights after reading this book. And to those of you who have not yet become Jane Austen fan, give this book a try, it's a timeless story.

0307389839|3.0|If Murakami had never written another novel after writing 'Norwegian Wood' he would have been a great writer.... Alas he did. Not that his other novels are bad as such. Some are even good. Others are mediocre. And his most recent novels seem to have been copies of other novels he wrote before. And as if he realized by himself that his recent novels are all much too similar to each other he has started to write semi autobiographical books, about the poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway or, now, about running.  These are not badly written, after all he is a good writer and a perceptive man. But much is missing. I had been looking forward, as an avid runner myself, to read the reflections of someone more perceptive than me, someone who might have another take on running than myself. Instead, I found a mixture of semi-baked philosophical thought and cliche observations. Yes, it sometimes rains when you run. And, yes, running a Marathon requires some self discipline. And, yes, stretching helps. And Mizuno shoes are good running shoes...  The book is a quick and nice read and I cannot claim that I disliked reading it. But afterwards there was nothing left. Popcorn for the mind.
9113020730|5.0|The final installment in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is a book I wanted so badly I ordered it from amazon.uk, and wanted to prolong so badly I read it slowly, savoring each page.  The compelling story of Mikael Blomquist and Lisbeth Salander concludes with this satisfactory resolution, but the knowledge that Larsson's premature death precluded further examination into corruption in high places makes reading the final page a bitter/sweet experience.  The three hefty novels really tell one story, but the focus is weighted more heavily on different characters in each instance.  This final one does make for a bit more technical and political investigation than the previous two, but the fact that Larsson was himself an investigative reporter only adds to the immediacy of the material.  Highly recommended (but be sure to read the first two if you haven't already done so).
B002QQ8HAG|2.0|I suppose if you want a real life look into the putting together of a fashion magazine this might be the movie for you.  If you also happen to love film though, be warned, this documentary is like watching paint dry.  There is nothing glamorous about putting together Vogue magazine. The endless meetings involved are mind numbing. If I am going to watch fashion, I would prefer watching the raw creativity of the project runway entrants who are actually trying to create something. If Anna W was really the inspiration for Meryl Streep's character in the DEVIL WEARS PRADA, you would never know it from this film. She is drab and colorless. If you are expecting an interesting personality like Karl Lagerfeld (from his documentary), abandon all hope!

0307269981|4.0|To follow the style of the original title of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I think this book should have been named \\"A Woman Who Hates Men Who Hate Women.\\" Too convoluted? Yes, but oh so true to the story!<br /><br />On the surface, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is about sex trafficking and prostitution in Sweden and high-ranking men who abuse underage girls. But, just like the first novel, it's not quite that simple - the story gradually morphs into a tale of sexual prejudice, abuse of power, and governmental conspiracy. And even more, this book is about Lisbeth Salander, her past, her roots and the events in her life that made her who she is - a violent vigilante who hates men who hate women.<br /><br />It is a great book, much more so in the second half than in the first. We get to know and understand Salander much better, her personal story is painful and at the same time inspiring, her violent crusade against abusers is compelling.<br /><br />However, as much as this book is a page-turner, the flaws can't be overlooked. The novel has a slow start - too many pages are dedicated to exploring everyone's sexual preferences/histories/partners/encounters, \\"testing\\" of Salander's newly acquired breast implants, etc. This part should have been trimmed down. Do I really need to know that Erika prefers doing IT with two men? Don't think so. The other thing that is even more apparent in this book is that Larsson has a habit of repeating himself, narrating the same events several times by multiple characters. Editing should have taken care of it. And my final qualm, this novel just seems a little incomplete, there are some loose ends left and it definitely lacks an epilogue that would tie the story together.<br /><br />Regardless of the flaws, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is a worthy sequel and I think fans of the first book will enjoy the second just the same. I did and am now anxiously awaiting the release of \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.\\"

1558908382|5.0|Gross Pointe Blank: 8 out of 10: This movie is full of small miracles. For one thing, Dan Ackroyd is funny. Let that sink in a bit. When was the last time Dan Ackroyd made you laugh? Now I confess I am the perfect target market for this movie. I am in the age range where I think the soundtrack is cool and the eighties were a pretty good time. Nowadays of course many people look back on the eighties with rose-colored glasses. Back when teens could be teens without ending up on MSNBC. Back before cell phones let parents track our movements and school security consisted of a bald vice principle with an attitude problem.    The movie is well cast with John Cusack as a professional hit man going to his 10 year high school reunion and Minnie Driver as the girl he left behind. A great supporting cast includes Alan Arkin as a therapist unhappy with a killer for a client (Years before the Sopranos or Analyze This) . The aforementioned Dan Aykroyd as a competing hit man and Joan Cusack as the secretary that both cares and is insane.    The story is very silly and over the top, yet Gross Pointe Blank somehow manages to keep the tone just right throughout the proceedings. Existential silliness adds to the fun rather than distracts. Moreover, did I mention a really good soundtrack.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Like Miyazaki's other great movies, Ponyo is a vivid and refreshing story.  The characters are delightful, energetic, and personnable.  The story, which is a play on the Little Mermaid, is a wonderful modern take on a classic tale...with Ponyo as the obvious representation of the mermaid.    The animation is just as clear, vibrant, and smooth, as one could expect from a Miyazaki/Ghibli production.  One could watch it multiple times and still find something new hidden among the beautiful art.  The English voices are provided by acting talents such as Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Betty White, and many more...    All-in-all, it is another instant classic from the brilliant Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli and should find a home in anyone's collection...animation fan, or, just a fan of great story telling.  The environmental theme is present and contributes to one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. I know not everyone will enjoy it as much as I have, but, I strongly recommend watching it atleast once.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I love that Disney is getting back to the animated musical.  This one is really just lovely to look at and listen to.  I don't think it will rise above Little Mermaid but it is still really good and great for families.  It has some stuff that is a but scary but so does Snow White.  Just know your young kids threshold and nightmare level from creepy looking things :)<br />[[ASIN:B0019HBVFQ Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set]]

0393072231|1.0|With 2 Kindles in the family, it is most annoying not to be able to get a Kindle version of a book.  I've tried several times to get a current book and am surprised to not be able to get it.  It's annoying.  We're avid readers and frequent travelers so truly love the convenience of the Kindle.  However, Amazon wants to force us to drag two heavy books on our trips.  Why not think of your customers for a change rather than your bottom line as so many companies do today! I will not buy the hardcover version.
0393072231|4.0|I've been reading a lot about the financial crisis of late and people can debate Michael Lewis' interpretation of things (that seems more political than anything) but the man has written another hard-to-put-down book.  By far the most readable of the books about the subprime loan debacle I've read.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I took my 3 year old to it on her birthday and it wasn't scary to her.  I thought it may be because of all the dark scary parts but she loved it.  She is still talking about it.  I am going to buy it for her today!  I get sick of all the controversy! I think it is great that it shows an inter-racial couple and a beautiful black princess!  She is  good role model because she talks about how hard work gets you the things you want in life!  I love it!  It's more than just finding a prince to take care of us.  I think it had a good message.  I was pleased.  Why are people so mad because the prince wasn't black?  Give me a break!  It was great to see some diversity in relationships!  (as all other princesses have found princes of their own race...OLD!) Thank God we have a princess movie that's not from the dark ages!  haha.  Plus, it is JUST A KIDS MOVIE and my daughter LOVED it!  I can't wait to give it to her and watch it again with her!

B0035V35PI|5.0|Ok, do you like ninja's? I sure do. Do you like anime styled live action flicks? I do.  Do you like movie that push the envelope of what we love seeing in a movie? At this point why wouldn't you.  Andy and Lana Wachowski know there stuff, and have a assembled an awesome crew.  This movie is balls to the wall great, if your like me, and you've always thought martial art flicks should be even more EXTEME and go even further with ninja's melding into the shadows (ala Ninja Scroll, and Naruto), and moving faster and kicking more ass than ever before.  Then this is your movie.    I've loved the Wachowski's since The Matrix Trilogy, loved 'em through V for Vendetta, Speed Racer, and now this, these guys are hardcore fans of sci-fi, anime, martial arts, and all things awesome, and they bring that to the screen.  You have to see this movie, blood-splattering good time :)

B0007SMD3W|4.0|Can't say that I've really wanted to explore Genesis albums. Some months back I checked out \\"Prog\\" magazine's reader poll on the greatest prog albums of all time and noticed that Genesis were very prominent in that. In the past I've tended to avoid prog music, but recently I've been exploring it a little. Thought I'd start with Genesis at their start.          Bought the 2005 release of this, which has a bonus disc and Peter Gabriel's original liner notes. The sound quality is very good. Sometimes you get that faux stereo soundscape which albums at this time had, but it's not as annoying as in earlier Beatles albums. Both speakers do fill out. My bonus disc doesn't have the interviews on it which this particular version has, I think.        Musically, the songs are pleasant and pretty. Occasionally they're a little more rock. You get proggy instruments like violins and horns as well as brass instruments, piano and acoustic guitar. Thought I may have brought a new observation to the discussion of this album, but it's already been said...you can hear a Bee Gees influence on some of the tracks here. The other liner notes on the album acknowledge this fact (i.e. not the Peter Gabriel notes). The album itself is of the \\"concept\\" variety...biblical references etc. Not being a huge one for pouring over the lyrics and mythology of albums, I can't say how strong the concept is, but you do notice thematic coherence.       Initially I was planning on giving this album 4/5, but on second listen I marked down many songs which I liked...ones that hadn't really seemed particularly noteworthy on first listen. In other words, the album grew on me second time around, and I'd say it definitely has repeat listen value.      The best song (on second listen):      Am I very wrong? - piano and harpsichord intro, followed by pleasant singing. Nice and cool piano melody at the start. Acoustic guitar, nice horn and backing singing. Some 'sticky' percussion, if I can read my notes properly here.      Next best songs (on second listen):      In the wilderness - piano, violins, cello (?), pretty melody/chorus. Gets more rock with the drum later. Piano outro.    One day - acoustic guitar, violins, then gets stronger. A hooky, melodic song, in a Broadway musical kind of way (uplifting chorus etc.). Piano, nice brass, cello and backing vocals.    Window - piano, acoustic guitar, pretty horn, pleasant singing and a nice chorus. Pretty violins, backing vocals. A pretty, pleasant song.      Best of the rest (on second listen):      In the beginning - spacey synthesiser intro, then bassy track (double bass?) with acoustic guitar. Piano, poetic lyrics, electric lead guitar, wide stereo type vocals which are catchy.    The serpent - instrumental preamble (bongos, acoustic guitar then electric guitar) then a theologically 'interesting' story covering, in part, how women are \\"the vessel of Satan's hold\\". 'Sticky' percussion, backing vocals.    In hiding - nice acoustic guitar strumming and singing. Piano, pleasant singing and violins. Backing vocals have that touch of the Bee Gees I mentioned earlier. Pleasant chorus.       The rest:      Where the sour turns to sweet - found the lyrics to the album opener sappy but parts of it are pretty enough. Simple intro - a vocal invitation (found that lyric daggy), finger clicks, brass, piano, then strings (violins) and choral singing.    Fireside song - prelude, then pleasant music. Acoustic guitar, violins, nice vocals but more sappy lyrics. Harmonies.    The conquerer - the intro carries the melody from the previous track (\\"In the wilderness\\") goes into something new. Piano...a little bit funky and rock. Acoustic guitar. Tambourine, nce backing vocals.    In limbo - harpsichord and piano at the start, then the piano becomes stronger. Good horn, acoustic guitar note plucking, tambourine. Backing vocals, hand claps.    Silent sun - piano, sort of 1960s pop harmonising a la the Bee Gees. Violins, acoustic guitar.    A place to call my own - quiet piano and vocal song. Violins, horns, backing vocals.       Selected bonus tracks:      A winters tale - nice track...touch of the Righteous Brothers to it.    She is beautiful - another nice track.    Patricia - an instrumental version of \\"Am I very wrong?\\"    One-eyed hound - has Hendrix type licks on it. Cool backing vocals. Good song.        Recommendations from around this time:      Cream - Wheels of fire  Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention - Freak out!  The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground  Bee Gees - (I don't know any of their studio albums...try something from before this Genesis release).
B002VPE1AW|3.0|and...<br /><br />...as emotionally flat as a pancake.<br /><br />After seeing the trailers and featurettes I took the trouble to see Avatar in a theater, to see the effects to best advantage. I'm glad I did. I agree with most of the hype about this movie's ground-breaking technology, effects and visual beauty.<br /><br />I even sincerely recommend that everyone see it at least once, and see it for what it is: a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />But a GOOD movie is not only images and sound-bytes, special effects and artwork: it is an orchestration of many components to produce an exciting and satisfying whole. It must appeal to our emotions, move us, touch our heartstrings. Avatar does NOT. At least, not mine. The only scene that came close was Sigourney Weaver's departure.<br /><br />The best I can do is demonstrate by comparison:  though they all relied heavily on CGI and special effects, \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Stardust\\" are all moving, exiting and satisfying films - not to mention \\"Snow White\\", \\"Fantasia\\" and \\"Mulan\\" - which is why I own most of them.<br /><br />Though I will probably see Avatar at least once more, I doubt I'll ever buy it.
B000Y179KO|2.0|As much as you would like, this isn't The Eagles we have all listened to for years. Without Don Felders singing, writing and guitar talents, this is a terrible attempt by Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and Don Henley to sound good. This isn't The Eagles, just a few of the old,and I mean OLD, original members or the band trying to be The Eagles again. How Sad.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|I am a huge fan of this opera. I have been listening to this version for over 20 years and have never tired of it.

After 20 years I am still exploring its riches.  Don't miss it!
B00003CXB4|3.0|Ok I feel sorry for the generation that grows up thinking \\"Morning Report\\" is a Lion King song. How dare they throw an extra song in the best movie of all time.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|THE PACIFIC, a ten episode HBO series just begun, promises to be much more than many expected.  It is, of course, the true story of the battle for the Pacific theater from December 8, 1941 on and features the Marine Corps battles against the Japanese for this important stage of World War II.  The writers and directors and actors take great pains to show both sides of the conflict: there is the expected use of expletives and pejoratives against the Japanese, but at the same time there is meaningful time spent with the frightened and sorrowful looks in the eyes of the Marines who are killing the Japanese 'like a turkey shoot' - especially in one scene where the lone surviving Japanese soldier (Yoshi Ando) stands against the marines, wounded and crying until out of pity a Marine shoots to kill him, releasing him from the tragedy of war.  It is a purgative moment.<br /><br />The banks of Australia make for good backgrounds as the Marines land on Guadalcanal and the fighting that follows is played with suspense and then horror.  But all along the progress of the film we are introduced to the personalities of these young kids who were fighting for their homeland.  One image that will remain in the viewer's mind throughout this series is the set of maps of the world behind the de-briefing officer: all of Europe on the Atlantic side  of America is colored red with the Nazi swastika symbol while the Pacific side is covered with the advancing red and yellow fag of the Japanese.  America looks very small in the middle and makes us remember why the country felt so attacked during that particular war.  it is a sobering memory.<br /><br />THE PACIFIC  has a cast of mostly unknown actors (except for star Jon Seda) but with the faces of men like Joshua Biton,  Joseph Mazzelo, Toby Leonard Moore, Jon Bernthal, Tom Budge, James Badge Dale, Ashton Homes and Jacob Pitts among many others theses actors will likely join the ranks of those who played n the similar European front in BAND OF BROTHERS.  From all indication this will be a very heady series and one that will burn in the minds of viewers for a long time. Grady Harp, March 10m all indication this will be a very heady series and one that will burn in the minds of viewers for a long time. Grady Harp, March 10

Matthew Humphreys should win a Razzie too as the stupidest secretary in the world. He is so stupid that after the sex thing between his boss and Ali Larter - he can even reveal info to Larter. Doesn't the stupid sec listen to office gossip! Bosses, don't employ such stupid secretaries. Even the police are so stupid. However Obsessed should win awards for clothes and stilltoes.

0393072231|1.0|Why no Kindle version? Does the publisher seriously think that all of us with Kindle's are going to run out and buy the hardcover? Even 10% of us? I suggest 0%, but maybe that's just me. I'm a big fan of Lewis and would \\"almost surely\\" buy the book day 1 for the Kindle. Now, though, this kind of pisses me off and I'm waiting to buy and may never.
B000002J0N|5.0|Crosby, Stills and Nash's 1977 album (CSN) is a masterpiece of musicianship, lyrics, and overall production. There are so many songs on this album that shine, and each member contributes in a big way. This album has a certain mood and tone about it-yet it's so artistic and exploratory. Every song is outstanding, but the ones that I enjoy the most are SHADOW CAPTAIN, CARRIED AWAY, ANYTHING AT ALL, CATHEDRAL, JUST A SONG BEFORE I GO, and COLD RAIN. The song, ANYTHING AT ALL is a natural tranquilizer, I swear!!! After a long day at work, play this song, and you will feel relaxed. CATHEDRAL is very interesting and deep, with great piano work. Whenever I hear this song, I think of a cloudy, dreary day. What I like the most about this album is the deep lyrics, as well as the guys not being afraid to be so mellow at times. Of course, the year was 1977, and this album has that 70's mellower sound. CSN comes up big, and is a classic album by a classic trio. Get it, and you won't be disappointed. 10/10

B000001F84|5.0|No fan of RUSH can be without this album.  Its filled with superlative muscianship, complex melodies, changing time signitures, minor keys, pushing of modes, meters, beats, and creative genius.  Rush did exactly what the record company didn't want and followed their creative passions instead of simply making music that's more easily catagorized, labeled and radio friendly.  Its quite an achievment and showcases the mastery of this great band.  It was a breakout album for them and for progressive music.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br /><br />\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\"<br /><br />He didn't say any more, but in considering the life of a certain individual who goes by the name of Roman Polanski, I'm inclined to reserve judgment. Let the courts decide his fate. Why is a raven like a writing desk? Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.<br /><br />As for his oeuvre, that's another matter. I will judge that until the cows come home. And my judgment is this: Chinatown is a great film by a great director, Roman Polanski; with a great script by Robert Towne; and a great actor, Jack Nicholson; a great actress, Faye Dunaway; and a pivotal performance by another great director, John Huston.<br /><br />Chinatown is kind of a roman &agrave; clef, if you will, where Noah Cross, played by director John Huston, stands in for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power director William Mulholland (1855-1935), the man who created modern Los Angeles out of a desert by adding water and stirring.<br /><br />---------<br />Noah Cross: Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.<br />=====================<br /><br />Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye who usually handles divorce cases. When the wife of the director of the water department comes in he tells her that if she loves him, it might be better not to know. Later, when the real Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes in he starts to realize that there is a lot more to the case than meets the eye. He wants to help the real Mrs. Mulwray but senses that she is hiding something. Is she ever. Gittes sticks his nose into other peoples business and almost gets it cut off for his trouble, but he can't stop until he gets to the gritty truth.<br /><br />If Humphrey Bogart's detective in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (directed, by the way, by John Huston) was the prototype, then Jake Gittes was the updated, post-modern version. Where Bogart lacked the classic leading man good looks, Nicholson took it even further, with a receding hairline and a face somewhere between Mickey Mouse and the wolf in a Tex Avery cartoon. He is crass and crude, but buried deep within there is the desire to do the righteous thing. The whole genre of film noir is updated in \\"Chinatown.\\" Instead of a case involving a fabulous jewel, the stuff from which dreams are woven, we have instead a case involving water, and the crime and corruption it took to deliver that water to Los Angeles. Water, Power, Hollywood--the real stuff from which dreams are woven!<br /><br />Nicholson was born to play Private Investigator Jake Gittes. Or rather, Robert Towne wrote the role with Nicholson in mind. He was a friend of Jack's, and modeled Jake's dialogue after Nicholson's distinctive mode of speech.<br /><br />The story goes that Producer Robert Evans wanted Towne to do a screenplay based on The Great Gatsby, but Towne didn't want to take on F. Scott Fitzgerald. I know the feeling. Though he was offered $175,000 to do the Gatsby script, he said that for only $25,000 he'd do an original script based on something a Los Angeles police officer had told him when asked what he used to do while working in Chinatown:<br /><br />\\"As little as possible.\\"<br /><br />The cop explained that since they couldn't speak Chinese, they couldn't decipher what was really going on, and therefore couldn't tell if their actions were preventing crime, or helping the criminals commit a crime under the color of the law. So they did as little as possible.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Chinatown,\\" the film, the idea of Chinatown as a place or situation where the standard moral compass is no help to navigation runs like a Chinese wall. The film is really about Los Angeles--and why it is called Chinatown might seem like an enigma--but after watching ityou'll know exactly what is meant.<br /><br />The film might seem slow paced in parts, as layer after layer of the puzzle is slowly peeled away, but it is tightly written by Robert Towne, nothing is wasted, and even when nothing much happens, the tension is being ratcheted up. Take for instance a scene in the Hall of Records where Gittes encounters an officious petty pimple faced bureaucrat. Or the scene where Gittes visits the office of the director of the water department and annoys the secretary. The tension continually builds. It is all so very Hitchcockian.<br /><br />And speaking of Alfred, Polanski pulls a Hitchcock by appearing in the film himself. I won't blow his cover, but no doubt the role was a way for Polanski and Nicholson to blow off some steam. The relations between director and star--as well as between the director and the screenwriter, and the director and the leading lady--were notoriously contentious. Polanski even smashed Jack's portable TV with a mop as he was fed up with Jack always stalling his scenes so he could watch L.A. Lakers games.<br /><br />--------<br />Noah Cross: I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.<br />=============<br /><br />Though all the aspects of \\"Chinatown\\" were top notch, a final 'note' on the soundtrack is in order, pun intended. Parts of the score reminded me of \\"The Planet of The Apes\\" where percussion punctuates the mounting tension. But in a good way. Other parts used Jazz and Pop songs from the era (mid to late 30's, early 40's) to give a feel for the period. Sometimes the tunes were echoed by the actors, like when Jake Gittes is waiting in the Water and Power Department office, annoying the secretary by humming and singing said songs. The best moments though are the beautiful trumpet solos that were played by Hollywood studio veteran Uan Rasey.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown\\" was Roman Polanski's last American film before he fled the country, so far never to return--unless he is extradited.<br /><br />-----------<br />Jake Gittes: You're dumber than you think I think you are.<br />===============<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FVQLRA The Pianist]] (2002) Directed by Roman Polanski<br />[[ASIN:B00008YLV7 Bitter Moon]] (1992) Directed by Roman Polanski<br />[[ASIN:0790732262 The Witches of Eastwick]] (1987) Jack Nicholson was Daryl Van Horne<br />[[ASIN:B0000696I5 Barfly]] (1987) Faye Dunaway was Wanda Wilcox<br />[[ASIN:B00005J6RD Mommie Dearest]] (1981) Faye Dunaway was Joan Crawford<br />[[ASIN:B00000K0DP Carnal Knowledge]] (1971) Jack Nicholson was Jonathan<br />[[ASIN:B00002VWE0 Five Easy Pieces]] (1970) Jack Nicholson was Robert Eroica Dupea<br />[[ASIN:B00018D3YQ Myra Breckinridge]] (1970) John Huston was Buck Loner<br />[[ASIN:B000059POY Candy]] (1968) John Huston was Dr. Arnold Dunlap<br />[[ASIN:B00000ING1 Bonnie and Clyde]] (1967) Faye Dunaway was Bonnie Parker<br /><br />--------<br />Walsh: Forget it, Jake.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Don't make the mistake of thinking Serenity is as good as Firefly, because it isn't.  It's as good as it can be, I guess, after what the Fox network executives put the cast and crew of Firefly through. But the sad truth is that once a show is canceled, even if it gets resurrected at a later date, things can never be quite the same. Even if the same crew returns, the same writers, the same cast - something will always be missing. Something intangible. The sometimes magical interaction among those involved gets tarnished, somehow. Maybe it's the sense of betrayal that causes the dynamic to shift, ever so slightly. A show like Firefly comes along just once, if that, in an actor's lifetime.  If Firefly transcended itself to art, then Serenity is it's perfect foil. And it drives home what the Fox network stole away from each and every one of us. At any rate, you should buy this movie and enjoy it, if only to support Universal for giving the Firefly people a much deserved second chance. Or not. After all, what do I know?
1423113497|3.0|This was an exciting read, the characters were great (I ADORED Grover, the klutzy but earnest satyr) and my seven-year-old loved it to pieces. BUT I found myself rolling my eyes a lot as I was caught up short by the holes in the fabric of the story and Riordan's manipulation of his characters.<br /><br />Specifically, Mr. Riordan makes it clear that these kids are smart. They're smart enough to figure out that there's a spy in the demigod summer camp, for example, and Our Hero, Percy Jackson, spends the length of the book wondering who that spy is. But though he's fed increasingly clear clues as to the identity of that spy, he never stops to figure it out--he just continues to wonder. Moreover, when he and his companions have completed their mission and returned to camp, the question of the spy's identity and role in Grover almost meeting an untimely end are completely forgotten. Time drags by and no one so much as mentions the spy or is the least concerned that they might still be a threat--which, of course, they are. Since I'd figured it out long, long before (because of the numerous unsubtle hints), this was more than a little frustrating. Most frustrating of all was the way Riordan literarily forces the reader to look away by simply not addressing the subject.<br /><br />The nature and powers of gods and other supernaturals are also vague and inconsistent. Sometimes characters knew things in detail that they had no reason to know and other times things took place right out in front of mortals and gods alike that the gods seemed to take no notice of despite the fact that Percy's movements were supposedly of dire import. I was continually wondering, \\"Well, if they know THIS how can they possibly NOT know THAT?\\" The characters seemed to know what the writer needed them to know, and not know what he needed them NOT to know regardless of the situation. It made me doubt that Riordan had a clear picture of the powers and nature of his supernatural characters.<br /><br />I also found the end of the book disappointing emotionally. Percy's mom, who is married to this nasty piece of work for reasons that become clear, finally has every reason to leave the buffoon. Riordan makes a big point of the idea that though Percy could take care of this for his mom through supernatural means, she shows courage by electing to do it herself. But in the end, she offs the guy (off-stage at that), employing the same supernatural device that Percy was going to use, thus sidestepping the issue of personal courage entirely. And I have to ask if the punishment fit the crime.<br /><br />Without divulging too much, there's also a logistical problem in Riordan's solution with regard to Percy's step-father. The mom does him in using a device that would have had the same deadly effect on everyone in the room. We know he was playing poker when he, er, folded, and poker is not a solitary pursuit. But there's no mention of the other guys at the poker table.<br /><br />I will buy the rest of the books for my daughter, 'cause like I said, they're fun to read with lots of cliff-hangers, and I love the kid characters. I've also heard from several readers that the series improves with regard to Puppet Master Syndrome. I hope those readers are right and Mr. Riordan has come up with plots that don't require so much manipulation of the characters AND the reader.d of the book disappointing emotionally. Percy's mom, who is married to this nasty piece of work for reasons that become clear, finally has every reason to leave the buffoon. Riordan makes a big point of the idea that though Percy could take care of this for his mom through supernatural means, she shows courage by electing to do it herself. But in the end, she offs the guy (off-stage at that), employing the same supernatural device that Percy was going to use, thus sidestepping the issue of personal courage entirely. And I have to ask if the punishment fit the crime.     Without divulging too much, there's also a logistical problem in Riordan's solution with regard to Percy's step-father. The mom does him in using a device that would have had the same deadly effect on everyone in the room. We know he was playing poker when he, er, folded, and poker is not a solitary pursuit. But there's no mention of the other guys at the poker table.     I will buy the rest of the books for my daughter, 'cause like I said, they're fun to read with lots of cliff-hangers, and I love the kid characters. I've also heard from several readers that the series improves with regard to Puppet Master Syndrome. I hope those readers are right and Mr. Riordan has come up with plots that don't require so much manipulation of the characters AND the reader.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|We love this movie. I think we have watched the whole movie three times. Then we go back to favorite parts and start over again. When we wear it out, we'll buy another!
0393072231|1.0|It is ironic that the author of The New New Thing is contracted with a publisher that will not allow his book to be published using modern technology.  What a shame.  Lewis is a great writer, but his Amazon ratings will be dragged down by the absurd decision of his publisher to try to protect a 13th century technology.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Ignore the Amazon.com review if you want to know details of plot and character - the reviewer apparently didn't actually watch it and has certainly never read the book.     However, do buy the DVD - it's a wonderful and surprisingly faithful adaptation. Romola Garai is (apparently) not to everyone's taste but to me she's a wonderful Emma - she perfectly captures the willfulness, self-centeredness, but deeply good heart of Austen's most human and modern heroine.  As Mr. Knightley, Jonny Lee Miller is subtle, deep, and, yes, I couldn't write about an Austen hero without adding 'dreamy.' I'd never heard of him before this but am quickly catching up on all his work - he is a superb actor, profoundly different in each role he plays and absolutely wonderful in this one.  Almost all the secondary actors are pitch-perfect -  particularly John Knightley (an oft-overlooked character played here marvelously), both Eltons, Miss Bates and of course Michael Gambon as an anxious, fussy Mr. Woodhouse.  Gorgeous sets, mostly beautifully lit (I wish they'd used softer lighting for the ball at the Crown - the harshness detracted from an otherwise magical scene) -- all the accoutrements of grand country home, luxurious gardens, rich costumes and careful props you'd expect from a top-drawer BBC production.     Of course it doesn't literally follow the words in the book - it brings them to life, shows emotions and thoughts rather than tells them, and is perfectly faithful to Austen's spirit, her nuanced analysis of the class system, and of course to the evolution of the central love story.

B0000640VO|3.0|It's all about what Jean-Pierre Jeunet likes and dislikes. He's turned himself into a mediocre-looking girl with big impressive eyes and quite sexy lips, who looks better with that particular hairdo, to express some of his phantasies. Imagine same movie with Amelie replaced by Amello. Amelie is kind of a petit voleur, a con artist of little things mistakenly called love? This could easily be mistaken for a TV serial, or a music video, void of music. The movie is so confusing, yet Amelie's heart pumps so hard and it shows, even to the least aware, as if the rest of the movie does not matter, suddenly it becomes obvious - she's in love. Sketches of an artist scattered on the floor across a 7 bedroom apartment, including the bathroom and the basement storage cell. Why not shatter the movie into a thousand and one pieces (just like those torn-apart photos) and try selling as individual posters perhaps? Would probably make a great photography album called: \\"Delicious. Lost. Amelie\\". \\"Delicatessen\\" was great; \\"The City of Lost Children\\" was not so great to creepy, even slightly pedophilic; \\"Amelie\\" is a waste of time for a great deal of the not necessarily unintelligent people. For those who will be searching for a matching music for this music video, I can suggest, try \\"Enigma\\" or something like that; perhaps you can create a youtube masterpiece by adding music to this movi(e)deo sans musique. It does feel like a short music video after all the patiently watching thing is over. Yet those, who are under influence of some substance, could as well enjoy it even without music... Reading one-star reviews before purchasing a movie sure helps a lot in most cases. I think I'm gonna (try to) sell it (back) on Amazon.com. No... but wait, there was one good delicatessenique scene... the fuque in de toilettes, you know what i mean...
B002UNMWAG|1.0|I went into this one assuming that it couldn't possibly be worse than the pile of waste that was the original.  Well, I stand corrected.  If you are looking for legendarily brainless action with the most ridiculous plot ever, just watch the first one and don't ever, under any circumstance, waste your time with this.  This deserves 0 stars while the first one could warrant 1.  This director is trash, watch the documentary about him and the original film to see how much of a complete doucher he is.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Very pleased with the service and how fast it arrived.  I live overseas and this came within ten days.  I will definitely order from this company again.
B0027WNRVI|5.0|I have a small collection of movies on Blu Ray maybe 75 and this one by far has some of the best surround sound and AUDIO PERIOD In a Blu Ray yet.  I thought T2 was the best until this.   I don't typically review movies but this picture Is remarkable and the sound amazing.  If your wondering to buy the blu Ray copy If you already own It I can tell you, you will see a big difference between upconversion and this!  I got lucky and got the Import for a decent price but I hear the American release Is just as good. This Is spectacular though.  And what a great film, sure to become a classic.
B0035V35PI|4.0|This movie is bloody, violent and action packed. Not for the faint of heart. I'm so glad I saw it in the theater but can't wait to watch it again at home. One of the best ninja movies out today....
B000002KXV|4.0|I heard about this album from its inclusion on the Vatican's list of favorite pop albums (a comment on the video for \\"New Frontier\\" on YouTube mentions this too).  I knew Donald Fagen was from Steely Dan and I've always liked their song \\"Hey 19\\" so I thought I'd give this a spin.  From reading some of the other comments on here, this seems to be a real audiophile's album, so of course I bought the CD instead of the download (anyway the download doesn't give you any discount over purchasing the individual songs).  Well now I've played the CD in my car, and just as another reviewer has said, I do have to turn up the volume a notch.  But still it sounds good.  Also just like another reviewer has said, turns out that I do know the song \\"I.G.Y.\\" all this time and I didn't realize it!  Not bad huh for someone who was only 8 years old when this came out.
B001EN71DG|3.0|Movies are great.  Cases are totally cheap-o garbage.  On the other hand, all they do is sit on a shelf . . .
B002UNMWAG|3.0|Expectations were high. After 10 years, the much-anticipated sequel to the cult-hit classic Boondock Saints finally crawled out of development hell, made it to the big screen and now, onto Blu-ray. The buzz around the sequel, however, seemed largely fan-generated, and hopes were high that this sequel, likely too late, would live up to the original.    Personally, I was skeptical. It's incredibly difficult to imagine a follow-up that could do the original justice, and since this movie had been in the works for so long (heck, there was some speculation that it was going to come out in 2005) that I was afraid that it would, frankly, not be very good. My hopes were sparked, however, when it was confirmed that much of the talent from the original was returning: Troy Duffy, Norman Reedus, amd Sean Patrick Flanery. Perhaps some of the magic would be rekindled with all of these names back in the game.    The result was mixed. Some fans thought it was the perfect follow-up, others thought it was horrid. I admit that I fell somewhere in the middle. I enjoyed it as a decent action movie with some fun one-liners, thought it was a fairly acceptable sequel, but, deep down, I think that the franchise would have been perfectly fine without this movie.    In All Saints' Day, fraternal twins Conner (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) , known as \\"The Saints,\\" are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father after leaving Boston prior to their stint as mobster-killing vigilantes. They soon realize that the quiet country life isn't for them and that it's time to clear their names, so they head back to Boston to continue fighting the mob. Around the same time as their arrival, a priest is killed in a manner similar to that of The Saints (this becomes a revenge motive for the MacManus brothers). FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (Julie Benz) steps in to investigate, working with local detectives (and familiar faces) Duffy (Brian Mahoney), Dolly (David Ferry) and Greenly (Bob Marley). She quickly concludes that the crime was committed by a copy-cat, but as the crimes become more frequent, it becomes obvious that the real Saints are back in town.    By far, Julie Benz steals the show in every scene she appears in. Though it quickly becomes apparent that she is, essentially, William Defoe's character Paul Smecker from the first movie, Benz plays a fun, believable character with a sweet southern accent who is \\"so f*ing smart\\" that she \\"makes smart people feel retarded.\\" By the time I was halfway through the movie, I just couldn't get enough of her. The returning characters seemed to easily fall back into their roles, particularly Reedus and Flanery. But sadly, it just wasn't the same without William Defoe, who, in my opinion, was one of the best parts of the first movie. Even though he does make a cameo at the very end (and it implies that he will return in a supposed third movie), it just wasn't the same.    The screen writing was as fun as I remember the first movie being, complete with one-liners and curse-laden dialog. Sadly though, the first half of the movie or so just felt like a recycled version of the first, with a plot that I had definitely seen before and that frequently threatened to be stale and/or boring. It did pick up in the second half though, with more action, more surprises and a somewhat unexpected ending that, while enjoyable, felt sadly disjointed from the earlier parts of the movie, almost like the there was a big gap between when the first and second halves of the movie were written.    While I didn't have the opportunity to see the movie in theaters (it seemed to come and go pretty quickly), I got to enjoy it in full-blown Blu-ray glory. While the film itself felt a little low budget and old (as in, it felt a little bit like it was released in the 90s), the picture and sound quality were top-rate, particularly in the action sequences, where it felt like bullets were flying at me through the screen.    The Blu-rayedition of Boondock Saints II is presented in lovely 1080p and 2.35:1 high definition. The Blu-ray includes French, Portuguese, and Spanish audio, as well a English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.    The special features are pretty generous, particularly on the Blu-ray version. They include a collection of very short deleted scenes, a 25 minutes behind-the-scenes feature discussing the franchise's popularity, a funny sit down with Connelly and Duffy, and (exclusive to Blu-ray) a special behind-the-scenes and interview feature, a ten minute piece on the weapons used in both films (ideal if you're into the guns), and a 60 minute feature on Comic Con.    Overall, All Saints Day can be approached as a fun action flick, but may rub some hardcore fans the wrong way. While I personally feel like the movie was a bit of a disappointment, I'm glad I at least watched it.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|One star for visuals, and the other star for visuals. The third for nice try. The downfall to any disaster movie is having unlikable people as the headliners. Viola. Irwin Allan knew this, and that is why he is still the reigning master of bigger than life disaster movies, because if he didn't have likeable people, he at least had people you could laugh at. This movie has neither. Woody Harrelson's character I applauded when he got demolished just to shut his mad man computer geek mouth up!<br />John Cusak plays a confused divorced man with two obnoxious unlikeable kids, and an ex-wife who knows how to scream while on the edge.<br />The effects begin at will with no sense of timing or build up, which makes \\"Earthquake\\" look like Ben-Hur.<br />The only time this movie drives, is when the unlikeable people are traveling, or getting ready to jam within the newest technology of CGI disaster effects which, quite frankly, save this movie from becoming a disaster!<br />The big cracks in the movie are when they stilt to the non emotional calm moments that are meant to bring a form of humanity to the earth's crisis. They totally stop the movie with no value to me. Bring on the special effects.
0061703257|4.0|The narrative grabs the reader's attention immediately and the dialogue carries the story along into a deepening mystery.

0393072231|4.0|All of the one-star reviews demanding immediate release on Kindle simply do not understand the publishing industry.    A publisher produces a book.  This involves various fixed costs, such as editors' salaries, marketing costs, general costs of running a business, etc.; and various per-piece costs, such as printing, binding, shipping and distribution.  The publisher has to recoup the costs of the book through book sales.      Now, the most expensive form of producing a book is in hardcover.  So right away, you have a big initial investment in producing a batch of tens of thousands of hardcover copies, which you really want to sell.  On top of all the fixed costs of getting a book from the author to the printer/binder.  So you look at your potential customers, and figure that there are so many who are so eager to read the book, that they'll pay a lot up front to get it.  So you charge them a premium price, $25-30, for getting the book early - the hardcover price.      Then you know there are others who will be interested in it, but not enough to pay for the hardcover, so later on, say a year later, you sell a lower-cost paperback for $15.  Later still, perhaps if the book is reasonably successful and has long-term value (like a good novel, or basic history), you produce a mass-market paperback that sells for $8.    Then Amazon entered the picture with Kindle.  Most Kindle books sell for $10, which I assume is part of why many customers want them - they can get the content for less than the hardcover price.  So to keep on being able to afford producing quality books, publishers now delay release of the Kindle version, if they release one at all, until some large number of hardcovers are sold.  The same as a delayed release of a paperback.    Or, you get the recent Amazon-Macmillan flap, where, as part of negotiations over e-book pricing (Macmillan wants to charge more than $9.99, Amazon believed it had the clout to force Macmillan to accept a fraction of $9.99 for early-release books; Amazon lost its bet), Amazon de-listed every book published by Macmillan and all its genre imprints, such as Tor.    So don't complain when you don't get Kindle releases the same day as the hardcover.  You're not going to get a paperback the same day as a hardcover either; the publishers have a right, in fact a need, to recoup their costs, if you want to continue reading quality books.    This thread, started by Tor/Macmillan editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden, and the ensuing/surrounding discussions, illustrate the current economics of book publishing. [..]
0783225857|3.0|This is an excellent film with fine script, acting, and music score; however--as another reviewer has mentioned--the 1.85:1 widescreen is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs, and furthermore, the picture quality is only average. I don't recommend this version of the DVD.

B0000019PA|5.0|The haunting yet beautiful composition created by Jeff Mangum and company in the album In the Aeroplane Over the Sea carries great power and can best be described as paradoxical.  His songwriting and lyrics are on the surface basic, yet at the same time full of complexity and meaning.  Both simple and unorthodox, these seamless eleven tracks showcase a mind capable of synthesizing many instruments and techniques into a surrealistic masterpiece.      The album begins in a simple, accessible fashion as familiar power chords back Mangum's straightforward vocal melodies in the intro to \\"King of Carrot Flowers, pt. 1.\\"  Soon the listener becomes enraptured as the tone turns serious with the line `And your mom would stick a fork right into Daddy's shoulder / and Dad would throw the garbage all across the floor.'  Accompanying this abrupt shift in tone is the entrance of new instruments including the accordion and the electric bass.  The opening track thus sets the agenda for the concept album: a transcendent mixture of simple melodies and chord progressions, deeply emotional concepts and lyrics, combined with a tremendous variety of instruments that will eventually include an acoustic guitar, drums, a heavily fuzzed bass, bowed banjo, theremin, zanzithiphone, uillean pipes, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, tape, shortwave radio, singing saw, organ, white noise, flugelhorn, and something called a Wandering Genie organ.      The opening song drifts seamlessly into the second, carried over with a bizarre sustained chord composed of some of these instruments.  The second track, entitled \\"King of Carrot Flowers, parts 2 and 3,\\" begins in a similarly simple fashion as the first.  A creaky guitar riff dominates over ambient organ and bass rumblings beneath while Mangum wails `I love you Jesus Christ.'  Such a perplexing introduction quickly evolves with heavy hitting drums and electric bass over eerie brass parts.  The song then picks up speed for its final stage, characterized largely by a fast punk drum rhythm covered with a loud, noisy bass part.  This song showcases Neutral Milk Hotel's talents extremely well, combining the simple with the weird and mysterious in a challenging musical statement.    The album's third song and title track boasts a strange electric instrument (possibly a theremin) hauntingly floating in the background that seems to match the strangeness of Mangum's wailing voice and jumbled, mysterious lyrics.  This song demonstrates a well-layered composition of traditional acoustic instruments and untraditional electronic instruments, but also begins to impart the overarching theme of the album.  Mangum, deeply touched by the story of Anne Frank, writes a sad and emotional tale about the loss of innocence and unfulfilled promise.    The rest of the album flows together as a terrific piece of storytelling and musical composition filled with its share of ups and downs.  Each song contains different elements of Neutral Milk Hotel which make it unique.  \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" follows the title track as an emotional acoustic ballad.  In contrast, the next track, entitled \\"The Fool,\\" comprises primarily of brass, drums, and a strange high pitched instrument that may be an organ.  \\"Holland, 1945\\" is fast and upbeat with traditional rock instruments and horns, flowing into \\"Communist Daughter,\\" a somber and slow song with an odd assortment of electronic screeches, scratches, and white noise plaguing the background.  The final three songs continue the fantastic and imaginative nature of the album, indispensably bringing the album to its close with the haunting \\"Two-Headed Boy Pt. 2.\\"    The true brilliance of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea lies not in the ability of the band to create songs using such a wild variety of instruments, but in their ability to masterfully compose this elements into something that sounds so simple and beautiful.  To top it off, Mangum infuses their work with a mysteriously personal and transcendent theme, connecting deeply with the listener.  The final product is by no means easy to understand--it remains a paradox for each listener to interpret in their own way.
0307463745|2.0|Download the free excerpt. Read it. You've just read the entire book.    I'm disappointed to find out this book is 10% content, 90% hype.    Most of the book is white-space or illustrations. I'd say about 1/3 of the pages are actual content.    Most of the content is a rehash of everything they say on their blog. I was expecting this to some extent, but there was nothing new presented in this book at all. They pretty much say, \\"Simple is better,\\" 100 times over in a 100 different ways. You'll find entire pages devoted to phrases like \\"Meetings are toxic.\\" By the end of the book you really feel they're just beating a dead horse to fill pages.

B00328G4V6|5.0|Four new songs I had never heard, and new versions of others that are different, but good.   It has great pictures and artwork as well in the accompanying booklet.  The only thing I saw wrong was that \\"Mr.Bad Luck\\", from days with The Blue Flames, was co-written by Randy California(Wolfe), his slide lead/rhythm player/co-singer, and he has never been given credit for this version or the \\"Look Over Yonder\\" version.  Randy wrote about it and did the song on his last Spirit album, California Blues, in late 1996, just before he died heroically saving his son from a rip tide off Molokai.  Now the \\"guitar twins\\" are together jamming in Heaven.
1596912863|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a must read book for Jane Austen fans. Especially obsessed ones. Um, er, I'm not implying that I'm obsessed mind you. Really I'm not. But anyway, back to the book. I thought this book was very funny. The author has a great sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it was too short. I was sorry to see it end. I rarely reread books, but I look forward to reading this one again. I'll save it for whenever I need a little pick-me-up.  I think I'll take a look at some of the other works by this author.

I just bought tickets to the \\"Into the Wild\\" concert and I am so excited to see them live!
0393072231|5.0|A typical Michael Lewis account. Gripping, hilarious and personal. I know of few writers that I enjoy as much.<br /><br />Perhaps lacking the depth of thought of [[ASIN:0393075966 Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy]], or the detail of [[ASIN:0670021253 Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System---and Themselves]].<br /><br />A lot of reviewers are giving low scores as a result of the text not being available on Kindle. This, in my opinion, would be a fair complaint in the appropriate format. But manipulating the review system is a horribly crude manner by which to make it. Michael Lewis does not deserve to be punished for this. He has written an excellent book that is surely worth more than an average of two and half stars.<br /><br />It is well worth a read.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Doctor Who: The Complete Specials was a hoot! The first couple were in the classic Doctor mode but the foreshadowing made Waters of Mars very angst-filled as we saw the arrogance of the Time Lords showing in the Doctor and then in the End of Time we saw it again but this time we see it on Gallifrey itself. Heck, they even caused the madness of the Master to begin with! Loved these and can't wait to see what Matt Smith is able to do as the Eleventh Doctor.

0312370849|3.0|The subject of this book -- the round-up and deportation of French Jews by the Nazis in 1942, with the widespread participation or at least the acquiescence of the French population -- deserves to be better known, and this book tells that story effectively. Admirably, author De Rosnay emphasizes both the complicity of Vichy France and the admirable willingness of present-day France to own up to its misdeeds of the past.<br /><br />The book is not badly written and is quite readable. However, much of it reads like uninspired \\"chick lit.\\" The 21st-century characters, including the main character Julia, are little more than stick figures. I quickly grew weary of the self-centered, charming, shallow Frenchman who is a wonderful lover, and of his flighty sisters who disdain Americans. The dilemmas that Julia faces are reminiscent of a soap opera plot. The \\"Sarah\\" story, although similar to Holocaust narratives that we have all read, has a level of authenticity that feels lacking in the \\"Julia\\" story.<br /><br />Still, it's important that this aspect of the Holocaust be brought to light, and although the material could have been handled better by a different novelist, this is a three-star book.
B003102JDM|5.0|A Serious Man is a movie in the same dark comedy sense as other Coen Brothers' films. It highlights the daily misfortunes of a Jewish math professor who experiences a broken marriage, difficulty with a student and ultimately health problems. Reminds me a lot of the Ferlighetti poem \\"The World is a Beautiful Place\\".  Well worth viewing.
B00004RFFI|5.0|As movie thrillers go \\"Twister\\" ranks just behind [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00005LINC The Silence of the Lambs (Widescreen Special Edition)]] in my book.  It has a great cast, a story close enough to real that my belief was easily suspended, and special effects creating a herd of the greatest movie \\"villains\\" of all time.<br /><br />Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt play a married couple literally one signature away from divorce.  They are modern meteorologists and their passion is chasing tornadoes.  See, Helen watched a monster storm suck her father out of a storm shelter as a child, and now she is determined to launch \\"Dorothy\\" - a scientific data-collection gizmo - into an actual tornado so that the data can be analyzed and a tornado warning system designed based on this data.  This is all back story with a single purpose - put our heroes in the path of several scenery destroying special effects.<br /><br />We catch up with them on a big day - not only has Bill come to get Helen's final signature so that the divorce is final, but a storm's a-brewin'... and it looks like it could be a BIG one.<br /><br />Indeed - well over half of the film is spent in about every variety of \\"holy SMOKES, wouldn't THIS be cool!\\" moment the screenwriters and special effects wizards could conjur.  We learn in the expository intervening scenes that Tornadoes go all the way up to a Five on the Fujita scale - and only Helen has ever seen a Five, the one that claimed her father years ago.<br /><br />We get to see tornadoes toss around heavy farm machinery like a puppy playing with a chew toy.  Our heroes are out in the middle of it, of course, trying to put \\"Dorothy\\" into the path of the cyclone, and giving us a thrilling up-close look at the eye of the beast.  Like a roller coaster ride, we know that every scene with a breather is going to be followed by the attack of the swirling menace.  The film features a tasty and varied [[ASIN:B000002N7W Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack]], with music from Van Halen, Mark Knopfler, k.d. lang and Alison Krauss.  In one of my favorite scenes the storm chasers are taking a breather outside a drive-in movie theater.

0618918248|2.0|This is a book that obviously plugged directly into a high traffic port in the zeitgeist, and it's very difficult to get an objective opinion on it. Richard Dawkins articulates a forceful attack on 'religion' as a negative force in human intellectual development, something best left behind in favour of his particular brand of scientific secular humanism.<br /><br />I felt as though the were two men authoring this book. One is a learned, witty and passionate biologist who is totally absorbed with his field of study. The other is a strangely petulant fellow of the sort who will corner you at a party to deliver a monologue the evils of religion as he sees it. I think the success of this book portends that the former may be consumed by the latter, to the loss of the intellectual life of our era.<br /><br />The main weakness of the book is that outside his own field Dawkins is merely a dilettante. He has been informed of this, obviously, since the preface to my edition contains a statement to the effect that he doesn't need to learn about something of which there is nothing to learn - or that he can't be bothered reading much philosophy or theology because he doesn't think they refer to anything. Since it is the thesis of his book that they don't refer to anything, you feel that he should have taken the time to discern whether this was the case. In other parts, he makes superficial remarks about Biblical scholarship and sweeping generalisations about history that would not withstand any serious investigation. In a popular level book, we don't expect rigorous academic scholarship, but an acknowledgement of the limitations of such a work is in order, not a justification of it as though it doesn't matter. This may seem like a petty critique, but Dawkins is involved quite actively in disseminating his ideology and politics, and given the extreme nature of his views I think the public deserves better.<br /><br />I am very sympathetic to the emotional force behind the production of this book. I do believe that philosophical theism, as it has been embodied in various religious institutions, has many problems and has often been a destructive force in the lives of individuals and societies. To the extent that The God Delusion offers people a way out of this, it has done a worthwhile thing. But the world that Dawkins is inviting the reader into feels like a small and cramped corner of existence, full of self-righteousness and smug intellectual superiority, and with strangely totalitarian ambition. The wide open spaces of the soul are to be found somewhere else, I believe.<br /><br />This is a must-read because of its cultural relevance, not its content. In twenty years, deduct one star from my review.

I've read several other Michael Lewis books (on kindle) and I read the preview in Vanity Fair, but without a kindle edition, I won't read this one.

0156030306|4.0|Charlie is a 32-year-old-man with an IQ of 68 who participates in a procedure involving an experimental surgery designed to increase his intelligence threefold, following in the pawsteps of Algernon, a mouse, who's successfully survived something similar. Before and after undergoing the procedure, Charlie is tasked by the researchers with journaling his thoughts, feelings and actions. Although one might expect the man's life experiences to improve significantly post-surgery, the transformation yields unexpected results, as Charlie finally fully comprehends remembered incidents of his past in a new, insightful light. When his IQ exceeds that of the researchers that he's held in high esteem, things become even more complicated. Flowers for Algernon is a thought-provoking story about several subjects, including society's stereotypes about humans whose intelligence falls at the fringes. On similar subjects: A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nassar, Born on a Blue Day by Daniel Tammet, and Stuck in Neutral by Terry Trueman.

0307454541|5.0|I finished this book last month, but wanted to reflect a bit before writing this review.  Sure enough, the book really stayed with me, so here I am at my keyboard recommending it to others.  What I loved about this book was its multilayered and original (even quirky) plot.  This is an unconventional book, and as I was reading along, I wasn't sure where it would go; in fact, I wasn't even sure who the protagonist was.  There's a whodunit in here, but that's not really the book's focus or (in my opinion) its strength.  Rather, the real pleasure of this book is just letting it carry you along in a journey through some unusual (but still believable) lives.  I'm glad I didn't judge this book by its title, which seems just as quirky as everything else in the book (although I suspect the significance of the title may become clearer once I read the second and third books in the series, which I now intend to do).  No matter how you feel about tattoos, don't let the title turn you off; this book quickly draws you in and doesn't let you down.  And even though this offbeat Swedish thriller is a runaway bestseller, it still makes you feel kind of cool (the way that seeing the movie \\"Diva\\" felt back in the 80s).

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this movie. I found the imagery to be fantastic! We also saw this in the theater. I am 57 years old and I enjoy any Miyazaki movie, but this one has special appeal by his treatment of water throughout the movie. This movie is not for older children, unless they appreciate the art. The characters are supposed to be kindergarten age (the boy goes to a \\"nursery\\") although the mother seems to trust the boy to be on his own a great deal of the time. However, Miyazaki always seems to have children (or characters that appear to be quite young) doing fantastic things. I think that is the point of all his movies. They all happen in dreamlike worlds in a hard to discern time period. They always stimulate the imagination.
B002RSDW80|4.0|Interesting way of presenting the lives of two women, 50 years apart but facing similar problems in life. It was interesting to see the lifestyle of a foreign diplomat during the early 1950s (Julie). Likewise, it was funny to see a bored woman succeeding with her cooking challenge and blogging about it. I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences because of its slow pace. I also hated the scene where they steam the lobster alive! Overall, a fun and interesting movie.

B002S0OBN2|1.0|Do you recall BYE BYE BIRDIE? Of course you do. But do you recall its sequel BRING BACK BIRDIE? How about the sequels to ANNIE or THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS? Difficult, right? That's because they all failed - miserably. Whatever small charms these continuations may have contained were completely offset by the fact that, without exception, they all proved to be inferior and unnessesary in comparison to the glorious originals. Well, poodles, the long-promised sequel to Andrew Lloyd Webber's megahit PHANTOM OF THE OPERA - the biggest theatrical phenomenon of the 20th Century - is here. It's called LOVE NEVER DIES.<br /><br />And we absolutely hate it.<br /><br />As do many, many others. LOVE NEVER DIES has had some stinging reviews: \\"this poor spoof a show\\" (The New York Times); \\"misses on all fronts\\" (Jewish Chronicle); \\"lacks psychological plausibility - worse, it lacks heart\\" (London Evening Standard); \\"simply torpid. Only a radical rewrite will give it even the remotest chance of emulating its predecessor.\\" (Variety).<br /><br />What's wrong with it you ask? Well, for one thing, the story is just awful. We simply do not buy any of the changes in Raoul - or any of the other returning characters for that matter. Where oh where is the dramatic tension? All of the mystery and menance that made the phantom so delightfully memorable lo these many years have been drained away completely. (He even appears alongside all the other characters in the outrageously laughable 14 minute finale!)<br /><br />And please... could someone fill us in on just HOW Christine and the Phantom could have sired little Gustave? Admittedly, it has been some time since seeing the Broadway production wonderfully staged by Hal Prince, but as we recall, Christine was drawn to the Phantom's beautiful soul - but repelled by his hideous looks. (look but don't touch.) In fact, anyone who saw Michael Crawford - or any of the subsequent broadway phantoms unmasked, would surely remember why. Our question then would have to be, are we to assume that Andrew Lloyd Webber and his collaborators would rather we recall the sexy film version of the character played by Gerard Butler (who only seemed to suffer a mild case of acne)... OR, was Christine date raped one evening after copious amounts of liquor and a few ruffies?<br /><br />Discuss...<br /><br />Fans of unintentional camp will probably adore the laughably anti-climatic second act finale which contains, perhaps, the longest death scene in recorded history. We won't spoil just who dies for you, but you may want to give the cd a listen before attending a performance as it may be difficult to hear the actors over the audience's giggles.<br /><br />As to the score, with the exception of one - maybe two - songs, this has to be one of ALW's worst. (And given his output since the occasionally sublime SUNSET BLVD, that's a pretty hard record to top.) We enjoyed the original PHANTOM score - but this! Are we still at the opera? (More so than the first go round we fear.) We were led to believe that the show was set at Coney Island? According to the reviews, the sets and projections are visually stunning, but from what we can hear, the score only seems to give occasional hints of being at that famed American institution.<br /><br />Much of the music is derivative of the worst of all Lloyd Webber's most recent disastrous attempts at a hit. And where oh where does Britain's favorite musical composer find these lyricists who's only gift is to write with little wit or imagination? (He even managed to make the usually talented broadway lyricist David Zippel seem like a hack in the dreadful sung-through bore THE WOMAN IN WHITE.)<br /><br />Which brings us to the SUNG-THROUGH thing! Would it kill Webber to write a show with actual dialogue? When will he wake up and realize that the 80s - and all that sung-through British claptrap that came out of it - are dead and gone? We've all moved on. Why can't he?<br /><br />And recycling the song OUR KIND OF LOVE (A melody originally written for PHANTOM 2 but later re-titled, re-lyriced, re-used and recorded in THE BEAUTIFUL GAME) for the title song borders on insanity. Why not write something new?<br /><br />For that matter, why bother to write a deflating sequel to one of the few glorious acheivements of his rather checkered career at all? Lord Lloyd Webber's choices in projects and collaborators just continues to astound us.ter re-titled, re-lyriced, re-used and recorded in THE BEAUTIFUL GAME) for the title song borders on insanity.

0451196716|3.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have read and, as a rule, I prefer crime noir to horror for my genre fiction.  But I always remembered this book because a childhood friend was a Richard Bachman fan before that author's true identity became known.  Curiosity got the better of me and so here I am.    My take?  Rather mixed.  The story certainly contains an interesting concept (which, even without having read King, I would have expected).  Set in a dystopian American future, young men compete in the long walk, a competition to see which will be the last boy standing.  The winner gets anything he wants.  The losers get a bullet each.  Adding to the interest is that, despite (or more likely, because of) the morbidity of the contest, the walk is the most popular spectator event in the land.      Again, a very interesting concept.  We cannot help but wonder exactly what has happened?  Why are so many young men eager to throw away their lives?  The possibility of winning? The prestige of having competed, even if one does not live to see the glory?  Some suicidal impulse?  Or instead, is the tale symbolic of something else, such as the Vietnam War, which was being fought at the time THE LONG WALK was written?  It is to King's credit that he does not even try to provide any answers.  I appreciate an author that keeps us guessing.    While THE LONG WALK is good on concept, it is much weaker in character development.  I never felt as connected with the characters as I should have.  Perhaps delving deeper into the characters would have revealed too much of their motivations, thereby providing us a clue as to what the walk represents.  As I mentioned above, however, such answers as to what the walk means are missing, a fact that I appreciate.  Nonetheless, I call them as I read them, and the book would have benefited by delving deeper into the walkers themselves.  I should mention that, with respect to the military personnel enforcing the rules, they are conspicuously one-dimensional, no doubt purposefully, and appropriately so.  Drawing them as mere background heightens the tension between what we read and what we do not know.    Overall, if you like weird concepts and ambiguity, and are not overly concerned with deep human motivation, sure, give THE LONG WALK a go.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was something I had in mind all along when I was contemplating switching over to the blu-ray format.  Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and HBO outdid themselves with this mini-series on the exploits of the 101st Airborne in World War II.  The acting is great and the story is moving, as it pays an homage to the real paratroopers from WW2.  What made the series memorable was that it had real vets being interviewed from the unit being depicted in the series.  You can tell that Hanks/Spielberg and company put in a lot of TLC into this project.  The box set is in a catchy tin package with extras like Journals and insight into the training the actors received for authenticity. The blu-ray quality is outstanding too.  This is a must have for any WW2/war movie buffs and any Army airborne personnel.

The box set even includes the movie \\"Razor\\" which was a supplemental to the series.  It is a little pricey but if you really love the show/genre and would like to build your blu-ray collection with something nice, then this is something to consider.

B00004U2GH|5.0|At Folsom Prison was such a landmark recording that his next live album would need to be something entirely different or somehow try to match his 1968 classic.  He went for the latter and the 1969 At San Quentin was certainly an equal to the previous release.  Where to start, well his prescence, humour and compassion come through very clearly.  The track San Quentin was so appreciated it was sung twice and A Boy Named Sue is a fantastic story of a father and son relationship.  Wanted Man is another essential song mixing humour with mischief making, a great Bob Dylan write.  More than on At Folsom Prison, Johnny sings gospel songs, 4 in total, (There'll Be) Peace In The Valley, Daddy Sang Bass,The Old Account Was Settled Long Ago, and He Turned Water Into Wine.  Look out in the sleeve notes for a contribution from Merle Haggard which just about says it all.

B001EAWME2|4.0|There are plenty of reviews on this movie already so I won't get into the movie itself. But I will say that it is a good slasher movie. For me Black Christmas is a creepy movie. Why? This movie came out in 74 and a lot of the spookiness comes from the fact that the movie is old. The camera techniques used give the movie an eerieness that can't be found in newer movies. But enough about that. The blu ray version vs. the dvd version. I purchased the blu ray version of black christmas because it was cheaper than the dvd version. Go figure, right? So the extras on the two versions are the same. So it comes down to picture quality. And that is where this movie falls short. Since it was shot in like 73 it was on old film. Not ever with the expectations of high definition. The problem is that the blu ray is so clear that it shows all the imperfections in the movie and you end up getting a slight grain on the screen. It really isn't a big deal, but I wasn't expecting much anyway because of how old it is. So the bottom line is which one is better. I would buy which ever one is cheaper because you are not gaining much with the blu ray version.
0143036556|2.0|This book was a required read for one of my college courses, and it proved to have some interesting ideas. Diamond hasn't thought his own ideas out, and has proved to be one author that is weakening the science field as he picks out only the science that \\"proves\\" his hypothesis, not a review of all the ideas that exists. He attempts to play the role of an anthropologist when he is an environmental scientist. He contradicts himself with his previous books, clearly a sign he is trying for sales, not complete information for the audience. I suggest reading [[ASIN:0521733669 Questioning Collapse: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire]], as it shows clearly how Diamond could be wrong. I am not saying Questioning Collapse is completely correct either, but it gives a more rounded idea of the story.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is obviously an extremely influential band and arguable one of the best rock bands to come out of the 20th century.  They are constantly pushing the limits of what is possible in the studio, and their fourth album Kid A is an excellent example of their disregard for musical boundaries.  Thom Yorke and Johnny Greenwood are the artistic leaders in the group, and they took Radiohead's energy in a completely different direction with this album.     While Radiohead and their albums are far from ordinary, their first three albums followed somewhat of a traditional rock band recipe.  Heavy use of electric and acoustic guitar underline the soaring vocals of leading man Thom Yorke.  After their critically acclaimed album OK Computer, Thom was ready for something new.  This began Radiohead's shift toward a heavy dependence on electric music.  Thom Yorke enjoyed the idea of making the background sounds dominate the tracks and use his voice as less of a leading tool on each song.     The title track of Kid A begins with a shimmering cloud of electronic sounds with an almost nursery-like synthesizer melody.  An extremely digitized beat underlies the song that lacks singing.  Yorke's vocals are distorted to the point where it is very difficult to understand the message.  Even with the lack of singing, the song is easily one of my favorites off the album.  Some acoustic drums can be heard at different points in the track, but they are quickly morphed into another sound that fits the electronic feel of the song.     The most impressive and striking track on the album also happens to be the most pertinent in a discussion of electronic music.  Track 4, \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", exhibits Johnny Greenwood's unbelievably diverse arsenal of instruments.  The track begins with an ondes martenot being played eerily, until an acoustic guitar joins the mix to give the song a simplistic beauty.  The ondes martenot was also used by Greenwood on the songs \\"Optimistic\\" and Radiohead's version of \\"The National Anthem\\". The ondes martenot is one of the early electronic instruments, following the invention of the theremin in the early twentieth century.     Johnny Greenwood is responsible for bringing the evocative performance of this historical instrument into mainstream music, as he regularly performs the ondes martenot live on stage at concerts.  In one performance, he employed a small fleet of skilled ondes martenot players to perform \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" with six ondes martenots surrounding Thom Yorke as he sang and played the guitar.  It is one of the most inspired pieces of music I have ever witnessed and it is one of the many reasons Radiohead is and will always be such an influential band.   Radiohead have outdone themselves with this album.  They have stayed true to their purpose of pushing the limits of what a rock band can do, and they do it well.  This shift towards electronic music is a welcome one for anyone with an open mind about music and a soul.  I would recommend this album to any and all as it remains one of my favorite Radiohead albums.  The only problem with saying that is I love all their albums and I would simply recommend listening to the band in general.
B003AYZBGQ|1.0|I think that this is an interesting issue - 1 star reviews for Kindle-less books.  I have always enjoyed Michael Lewis' books and was looking forward to reading The Big Short.  With no availability in the US on Kindle, however, I will pass until the publisher/Amazon issue is cleared up.  I actually believe that the availability of an item is relavent when giving it a review.  I know that there are others that disagree, but try the extreme on for size.  What if an author wrote the best book \\"ever\\" and only had one copy printed: would that book deserve a 5 star rating when no one could buy it? Many people that buy books on Amazon have Kindles and choose to solely purchase books electronically.  I have heard that Amazon now sells more books in electronic form than print versions.  If that is indeed the case, then a poor review that is based on availability would be pertinent to the e-book buyer so that they would not waste time with a book they cannot purchase.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|My God, this movie makes 1951's \\"When Worlds Collide\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane\\".  2012 is sad indictment of Hollywood.  It is a ridiculous movie with a cliché a minute. The scene where Calfornia is falling into the sea for instance, is a non-stop montage of narrow cliff-hanging escape among rivers of lava, buckling pavement and exploding skyscrapers all set to a John Williamesque sweeping musical score that is almost laughable.  John Cusack's character achieves these feats of rapid fire skin of your teeth escapes while driving a limousine which among other passengers included his two children.  Placing children in danger to cheaply raise the viewers feeling of angst is one of the lowest forms of Hollywood moving making.  The CGI effects are passable but often very video game-like.  Watch this movie only if you have 2 1/2 hours to completely throw away.
B001HN694K|4.0|I saw Alice in Wonderland opening weekend along with my family. We all enjoyed it very much.  My two kids are 10 and 11. I read the first book as a kid and enjoyed the fantasy aspect of the story.  As a kid the book was intriguing because it really made no sense. I have never read the second book \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".  I have seen several movie adaptations of the story and have read about the origins of both books.      Having said all that I found Tim Burton's version very entertaining and interesting. As many viewers have correctly said this version is a mixture of the two books in both the story and the characters.  I have no problem with that because the movie did have a feeling of fantasy like the book did but with a more cohesive plot.  I think a plot was somewhat necessary for a movie adaptation.    The movie was well produced and had the feel of a full length movie and not a TV movie.  As the movie progressed I felt like I began to see the Wonderland through Alice's eyes.  Her mental dilusion was simple.  Am I dreaming or is this real? This mental conflict of Alice unfolded as the movie progressed. Despite using fantasy for a backdrop,  Tim Burton did a clever job of overlaying it with drama, suspense, and humor.  I think that is his niche in movie making. The acting was excellent.  I do not think any of the characters were overdone.    I also would like to say that I do not understand why every time \\"Burton\\" makes a movie someone describes it as \\"dark\\".  This movie was not \\"dark\\".  The ending speaks for itself.    Go see it and enjoy.
B00337KMAA|5.0|This timely movie is (excuse the cliché) absolutely refreshing.  The dialogue is witty, the soundtrack, direction and cinematography are all top from the opening credits (and song) to the very end.  In short, if you have any sense of humor and intellect see this movie, if not, go and see 2012.
B001HN694K|4.0|So sayeth The White Queen, who was experiencing time backwards, but what 'happens' in this movie is a little hit and miss.    When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.    The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.    The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.    For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?     The four stars are for Bonham Carter, Depp and Hathaway, who all injected their otherworldly magic into a movie that was barely worthy of their talent.
B002WCLG3Y|5.0|good animation, however, it takes to long, to get to the action...and a good story line.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|Any one who doesnt give this album at least a 3 has to be either a Hater or just tone deaf. These people giving it just 1 or 2 stars are doing so for the dumbest reasons like just because its a double disc, You have to be in the mood to listen to either side. So what?? if the 2nd Disc is in-cohesive, maybe that was done deliberately to show off the different sides of Bey's stage persona. Every Person under-rating this album will be sure to over-rate another. This album is filled with great songs. Every song is worthy in its own right. Its a very complex multi-Genred experimental piece. The way this album was executed alone Is just Brilliant. Beyonce always puts out the best albums; She has a voice like none other, she is officially an Icon. I bought this the week it came out and some of Beyonces best songs are on this CD, I was so impressed & moved by it when I first heard it. Favs/Standouts: Halo, Single Ladies, Radio, Disappear, Smash into you, Hello, Ave Maria & Broken Hearted girl just to name a few. However, There are songs that I dont too much care for & will skip over like Scared of lonely, & beautiful (& I dont really respect Video Phone much) but I still see quality in even these skip tracks. It's hard to say which of her 3 albums are the best because they're all great. Throughout her career, This women has touched on just about every genre of music there is & I commend her for growing & taking risk. One can only imagine what she does for her next LP but ill be sure to support her every step of the way. This is one of the best albums ever, its close to perfection!! Good luck finding better...
0385504225|5.0|I absolutely loved Dan Brown's new novel and all of the amazing information about codes, symbols and history of the Nation's Capitol. This guy can tell a story like no other. The style is much the same: short chapters that are fast-paced, breathless, imaginative and intelligent. I had a hard time putting it down. The action-packed tale takes readers on an exciting adventure through DC. I often have found myself running to the computer to find out whether what he's talking about is real or not. Lucky are those ones who live in DC and are able to see the locations in the story. I live in São Paulo, Brazil but next time I go to the US, I won't miss the chance to see those locations.

006621131X|5.0|I can't say I've ever been a big fan of Patti Smith's music, and definitely not a fan of most of Robert Mapplethorpe's, er, art, but I do enjoy reading about music and the '60's. This is one of the most well-written and evocative biographies I have ever read about that era, or any other era for that matter. And I've read a million of them. A tremendous look at art, music, and the bohemian life in 60's/70's New York.

B001TKMAGW|5.0|Being a big Sabbath geek over the years, I've purchased most things Sabbath related with varying degrees of success. This particular release is definitely an exception! I've probably heard this album thousands of time, over the years, and this version is something to be really appreciated. The Remastering on the original album is probably what I would consider to be THE definitive version...it just sounds phenomenal! Owning a recording studio, and trying to listen to recordings that are well done, etc. is one of the highlights of my 'job'. It continues to amaze me how a recording done over 40 years ago, on 'primitive' (even by then standards) equipment, basically recorded live, with a few overdubs, can sound this bloody good! The sound-stage, recording space, details, etc. of these recordings are simply unbelievable. As good as the original recording is, on Disc 1, the recordings on Disc 2, are even 'better', if that is possible. It's VERY hard from me to believe that these recordings haven't been majorly tweaked, or even REMIXED, though, I'd be very surprised if the original tapes were available for that. We've had listening session, here in the Studio Listening Room, and all seem to agree, that these recordings are simply stunning! I'm NOT sure how they did it, but, bottom line is, they did! You find yourself closing your eyes, and 'feeling' Tony playing over in the corner, Geezer off to the other side...and Bill pounding all around! Ozzy's voice seems to jump out at you, and you can actually 'hear' his throat, and the small details that have NEVER before been heard! All the above are reasons to own this CD package, but in addition to the music, the packaging, booklet, pics, info, etc. all are bonuses. I personally would have been satisfied with hearing outtakes, alt takes, etc. since this kind of stuff from Black Sabbath has NEVER been available before...and most of us thought, DIDN'T EXIST! Bottom line is...get your copy now...whatever it takes. Paranoid, and Master of Reality are also available in a similar format, and I have all three. They are simply AMAZING!ster of Reality are also available in a similar format, and I have all three. They are simply AMAZING!
0060012358|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I am an adult, but found this fun to read even though it seems to be a book for teens.  The only thing I had trouble with is the dwelling on bad smells that Terry Pratchett seems to have as a theme in his books.  His stories are so good that it is possible to ignore this and I am sure that young people would not find this a problem.
B003BNFTY0|5.0|I've been captivated by this show from the first episode.  I've watched it several times on USANetwork, and the quality of the AVOD downloads is incomparably superior.<br /><br />The characters in the show are all appealing.  I hope they'll all be back next season, especially Diana Ross, whose character has evolved into a tough, supportive friend for Caffrey and the only person for whom he shows genuine affection.<br /><br />Too bad \\"White Collar\\" has only 14 episodes per season.<br /><br />I'm hooked on the AVOD system.<br /><br />--pat
B000EXZ9P4|5.0|I listened to this cd in the music store when I was selecting some cds to buy. The sound speakers were positioned along the ceiling, so where I walked the music came with me. Instead of looking for a cd to buy, I was listening to one. Emmylou and Mark are magical togeher.  I like the balance of the songs selected, nothing too hard, nothing too soft. They really sound so great together and the production is spot on.  I've never really listened to either of them before.  If this cd was just on the racks, I would have passed it by. So glad it was playing in the store that day. This cd will grab you, that's the only way I can describe it to you. The harmonies are just beautiful.  You just wait in antipiation for the harmonies to kick in on every song. Highly recommended from Down Under x Kangaroos and Koalas x

I look for ways to improve businesses, sales, and life.  I also like to feed my need for just plain fiction. In fiction, I'll look at readability, suspension of dis-belief,  and over all enjoyment of the material, and value.<br /><br />On a 1 to 5 scale, 5 being the best:<br /><br />Readability:  5<br />It's  213 pages in paperback, and it took me about a week to get through the book.  With this type of book, I needed to read a while and digest what I read and then read some more. Slow for me, but that's really because of my interest in the subject matter of a youth growing up. A younger generation, teens in particular, will find it more interesting and easier to read.<br /><br />Suspension of dis-belief: 5<br />Once you let yourself believe that a adolescent boy is writing letters to someone in a kind of diary format, it's fine.  I had no problem believing in the story.<br /><br />Enjoyment of the Material and Value:  5<br />At  about fifteen dollars, even I felt that it was well worth the money.  Especially since I had it autographed.  And I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />But again, someone in their teens to early twenties would find much more to relate to and would even enjoy it better.<br />Stephen himself is an intelligent professional. He is an accomplished screenwriter with the television series, Jericho to his credit. He is also developing Wallflower into a movie. I'll go see it to see how it compares to the book.<br /><br />A good book for grownups and a great book for the younger reader.<br /><br />Thank you Stephen and great job! You put  a lot of heart into Wallflower.<br /><br />Rip Walker, thanks for watching!<br />Author<br />[[ASIN:1449595545 Rip's Book of Common Sense Selling: Improving Sales Through Process Implementation]]

B0031ZWZR2|3.0|Flash Forward: Season one-Part one    Its 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard time, and everyone in the world passes out for exactly two minutes and seventeen seconds, during which, they all have a vision of their lives six months into the future.  Once everyone awakens, there are disasters everywhere.  Planes, helicopters, cars, and busses, have crashed, patients in surgery have died, swimmers have drowned, chaos reigns.  A team of FBI agents in LA are assigned to figure out what happened, how it happened, will it happen again, and can it be prevented.  John Q. Public tries to deal with their individual Flash Forwards (Visions).  Are they real, and can the future be changed.      During the FBI investigation, video tapes are reviewed.  People are seen passing out at banks, grocery stores, malls, and sporting events.  One tape reveals a person walking around at a baseball game while everyone else in the world is passed out.  Intrigued? Welcome to ABC's newest science fiction anthology series \\"Flash Forward\\".    \\"Flash Forward\\" premiered on September 24th 2009, and after ten episodes, went on hiatus. With episode eleven scheduled to be broadcast on March 18th, ABC released the first ten episodes in a two Disc set on February 23rd.  This would appear to be a marketing ploy to allow people who have possibly missed some of the shows to get caught up, but more importantly to draw attention to a series that has been off the air since November. One can certainly wonder how effective this will be since the episodes are available online, and people who are interested in owning the series would wait for a full season release.    Nonetheless, \\"Flash Forward\\" opens with two strong episodes that are sure to draw in the most skeptical and even those who don't consider themselves science fiction fans. The characters are generally easy to relate to, and the individual stories are told effectively considering the limited time available. The introduction of the mysterious figure at the end of episode one, the discovery of a second person who apparently also was immune to that which caused mankind to blackout, and the delivery of the line \\"D. Gibbons is a bad man\\" (Which needs to be on T-Shirts) by the young daughter (Lennon Wynn as Charlie Benford) of the lead F.B.I. agent (Joseph Fiennes as Mark Benford) on the case, make for some of the most enthralling writing for television in years.    Unfortunately, when you start that strong, it is hard to sustain the momentum, and the writing for \\"Flash Forward\\" does begin to falter, as due some of the performances. Though it has only been ten episodes, there are still too many storylines that have gone no where and though they still may, from a purely investigative perspective it seems illogical that they have not thus far. The introduction of a possible explanation to the unusual event could easily be seen as a huge error in judgment by the writers, as it clearly seemed to suck the energy out of the episode in which it occurred. Certain characters have made choices and taken action that seem obviously inconsistent with that which has been established, and other actors are simply not up to the task of playing the roles in which they have been cast.  Sadly, one of the most obvious is Dominic Monaghan, who was so wonderful to watch as Charlie on \\"Lost\\", but is now miscast as Simon Campos, the arrogant Quantum Physics Genius who claims to have been responsible for the blackouts.     Weather \\"Flash Forward\\" can regain the excitement and mystery established in the first two episodes remains to be seen. That and the answers to many other questions are forthcoming in the next six weeks. Regardless, it would seem that a release of the first ten episodes on DVD with bonus features that include a look ahead as well as an interesting and entertaining, though all too brief, feature on how the series opening scene was created, is going to be somewhat of a hard sell.    Recommendation: \\"Flash Forward\\" has the potential to follow in the successful footsteps of the phenomenon that is \\"Lost\\". The writing needs to get back on track, allow the characters to be more consistent in their behavior, and some of the performances need to get better.  There is certainly enough pure energy and mystery in the first few episodes of the series to make them worth owning, but waiting for the entire first season to be available would seem to be a better choice in these tough economic times.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|As with all of Quentin Tarantino films this is such a masterpiece. So far all of his films to date are entertaining. You know you're watching a good film when you lose track of time and find yourself totally into it. He's such a great filmmaker. In this film the killings were a bit disturbing and the subtitles (when the characters spoke german or french) were also challenging since I wasn't use to reading them. Besides that, I really enjoyed watching it.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|Very effective in scaring the pants off any viewer, quite possibly the most terrifying film I have yet witnessed, however, it treads a tired path as far as story goes.  Not to worry the ending is surprising to say the least...a true twist!  However, don't see the crappy American remake of it...stick with the good one!  Ratings are out of 5    Scare Level: 5  Story: 3  Characters: 3 1/2  Aesthetics: 3 1/2    Overall: 4

OK I'LL BITE,CONSIDERING SINCE 1969 I HAVE HAD EVERY VERSION OF THIS RECORD  NOT TO MENTION AT LEAST 7 COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL LP VERSION,WORE IT OUT QUITE A FEW TIMES BACK THEN.  WELL THANK GOODNESS I BIT,THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST REMASTERS IN A LONG TIME.  A DAY AND NIGHT DIFFERENCE FROM THE 1997 VERSION.  EDDIE KRAMER AND TEAM HAVE EARNED AN A+ ON THIS PRODUCTION,YOU WOULD THINK THIS CD WAS PRODUCED YESTERDAY NOT 40 YEARS AGO.WE HAVE HIT THE AUDIO  MOTHERLOAD HERE.  THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE,ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN PLAY IT ON A TOP NOTCH AUDIO SYSTEM,AND IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND ,YOU ARE IN FOR A FABULOUS MUSICAL JOURNEY, AND I WOULD VENTURE TO BET  IT MUST SOUND JUST AMAZING ON HEADPHONES.  NOW SIT BACK PRESS PLAY AND ENJOY THE RIDE.

0393072231|5.0|Amazon should simplify these \\"drive-by\\" one-star hits by crybabies wanting their electronic versions \\"NOW\\" by only allowing verified purchasers to review, period. Then this review and all those unjust one-stars will go away and the one-star posters will be able to take it up where they should have, directly with the publisher, or is Amazon somehow fomenting this strange surge of one-star reviews to force distribution to their clunky, over-priced product?
0596009208|5.0|I have read other java books and because of the nature of the material, I lose focus. This book is very different. It makes a dry subject much easier to understand. After reading this book I am surprised at how well I understand the subjects such as objects, inheritance, encapsulation, serialization and other java/programming subjects. Instead of just telling you how something works, it makes you understand it intuitively so that you don't just know how something works you understand why it works in a fun way. The chapter on serialization uses a picture of an inflatable frog. This kind of silliness breaks up the monotiny of the subject and really helps to make the information understandable while keeping you awake. It is a very helpful book for learning how to think like a programmer.  I highly recommended for people with short attention spans (like myself).
1591843162|5.0|This book is a tremendous tool for self-evaluation, but the real benefit is when you use it to identify the linchpins in your company.

B00328G4XY|1.0|What a shame indeed.  Jimi Hendrix has left a legacy that will continue for centuries.  It's a shame that the people in charge of his legacy feel it appropriate to keep pumping out the same repackaged album time and time again.  The CD is the same as Jimi released originally.  Remastered, yes.  But they've already released the remastered version years ago...which most people probably already own.  And it also begs the question...do we need remastered versions of legendary albums.  Often, the original mix sounds better.  The DVD is atrocious.  It's merely a gimmick to get people to buy the album again in hopes of seeing some footage of Jimi.  Don't bother.  Another half a**ed attempt at the Hendrix family to capitalize on Jimi's legacy.  To clarify, this is a 10 star album!  This is a monumental album, probably one of the best ever recorded.  The one star rating is for the poor taste of repackaging an album with a worthless DVD.  I guess if you don't already own Jimi's albums, there's nothing wrong with buying this.  But, if you already own Electric Ladyland, don't waste your time or money thinking you're getting something you don't already have.
0393072231|1.0|Michael Lewis, a new favorite \\"expert\\" on the folly of the financial meltdown, was a major apologist for bonds and derivative-swapping wall street -- until the truth was so obvious even he could see it -- and see a way to make money on it.<br /><br />Check out what he was saying in January of 2007 about the heroes of his latest book.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"But the most striking thing about the growing derivatives markets is the stability that has come with them. \\"<br /><br />Sure Mike.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|The triggers work very well.  Before I bought them, I never had a problem with my fingers sliding off of the original triggers, but the way they curved down made me have to curl my finger more, and eventually made my finger cramped and sore within an hour.  I looked for some 3rd party controllers with better triggers, until I saw these snap-on triggers.  I recieved them, and they work as expected.  The design helps you push the triggers with more precision and support.  It works great with racing games like Dirt 2.  It does hinder me a little when I want to press the triggers real fast, like when I have a single fire weapon, but it doesn't mess me up too much.  The triggers come in 2 different colors, one matches the black controller, and the other matches the other colored controllers, but you may not recieve the one that matches your controller.  I haven't had any problems with them coming off, unless I drop the controller, but if you want them to stay on as long as possible, don't replace them that often.  The price for the function is definitaly worth it, but it is a little too expensive.  I know it's not that much money, but essentually, all your buying is two small pieces of plastic.  Over all, I would recommend them to anyone who hates the stock triggers but doesn't want to replace the controller.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|For me the natural disaster scenes were great but seeing this rich and privileged preparing for the end 3 years prior 2 discovery of the 2012 incidents and actually killing anybody who tries 2 tell outsiders about really boils my blood.  Never in my life did I want Snake-eyes (gi-joe) to fire his nanomite rock propelled grenade at the dock where the giant ships were sitting to eat that metal and actually force those selfish bastards to actually fight for their salvation! Boy and I thought I was selfish, the only times when I saw people actually kill \\"the help\\" was in action movies where the bad guys, drug dealers or criminal masterminds who created illegal stuff didn't want 2 share it with others for whatever reason. Their really is no loyalty among thugs, 2012 arc company included.  All us middle class/blue collared slobs should make or own personal pods (or something like it) with sonar and or radar or something ground based, not so much gps which rely on satellites.  You can't count on anyone else but your own group when your environment ends.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the most impressive fantasy book I've read in decades, one of the few that captured my imagination long after the book was done.  People liken Mr. Martin to Tolkien, but his greatness lies in *not* being like Tolkien: not once during the book did I think of LOTR.  The latter had the flavor of Arthurian legend and the old sagas; this has the much grittier feel of the Middle Ages, with real people and real politics.<br /><br />Pros: where to begin?  The world he created is unique and wide-ranging, spanning continents and cultures.  His characterizations are superb: he has a cast of hundreds, but every one stands out.  His division of chapters according to viewpoint gives each character the chance to show their own personality and motivations.  Interactions between characters were realistic, dialogue was natural, and people acted consistently with who they were and what they wanted.  He was able to spin out 800+ pages without the plot ever dragging, and the thing kept me up late 3 nights in a row until I finished it.  That was a week ago, and it's still on my mind.<br /><br />Cons: the first is picayune - I'm a little uncomfortable with sex scenes involving 13 year olds.  Yes, child brides were/are the norm for certain cultures, but I'm still not easy with it.  The notion of a 15yo boy leading men to war is even more incongruous.  I just don't see a 15yo, no matter how well trained, as having the experience and judgement required to mount a large scale campaign.  But these are trifles.<br /><br />The real problem with the book is its ending - it doesn't really have one.  The whole thing is basically setup for the next book, with nothing resolved and everything left hanging.  And it gives the distinct impression that the next book would do the same, and the next, and the next...  It was like spending days climbing an enormous mountain, only to get to the top and see an endless vista of more mountains to climb.<br /><br />I was concerned enough to look at the reviews for the rest of the books in the series.  Sure enough, they were of a pattern: nothing resolved, everything left hanging.  Further, the author seems to have developed a sadistic streak.  Killing off my favorite character was emotional punishment enough, but killing off all of them?  I think he's stymied with the next book b/c he's murdered, maimed, or tortured everybody of interest, and has nobody left now to care about.<br /><br />So this book stands as an unfinished symphony: magnificent of itself, yet a poignant reminder of what might have been.n the series.

0393072231|5.0|I was intrigued by Terry Gross' interview with this author, and his prior books have been great so am happy to be reading this one. Notice to people who review the format (i.e., it's not Kindle) instead of the book's contents: I have no problem with whether people like or don't like a book. But as one reader who looks at reviews to learn about the book, not the format, I'd appreciate the ratings being applied to the book's contents and/or the writer's skill. If you don't want to buy the book, go to the library.
B002VECM4A|5.0|PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL \\"PUSH\\" BY SAPPHIRE is one of those rare films that is a true gem of filmmaking.  I'm not just talking about the story, even though that is a particular strength: this film takes you to the very depths of hell, and manages to pull you from the muck and mire and doesn't quite lift you back out, but at least brings you up enough so you can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Precious Jones's journey from abused victim of incest to self-empowered mother is evocative and inspiring in all the right ways.<br /><br />No, what I'm talking about is the overall art behind the film.  Gabourey Sidibe deserved the Oscar that Sandra Bullock whisked away (I think even Bullock was aware Sidibe should've gotten it); Mo'Nique got her Oscar, and deservedly so.  Both give fearless performances; they both actually take risks here, real genuine risk-taking that we don't see much in Hollywood anymore.  The supporting cast is likewise stellar: Paula Patton as a hard-edged but caring teacher; Mariah Carey (actually acting!) as a similarly strong social worker; even Lenny Kravitz as a sympathetic (and thankfully not shirtless) nurse.  Behind the actors is the script by Goeffrey Fletcher (based on Sapphire's novel \\"Push\\", in case you hadn't figured that out), and Lee Daniels's strong, sturdy, confident directing.<br /><br />PRECIOUS (we'll dispense with that horribly long title) is a true work of cinematic art.  It's deep and powerful; it'll take you places, and not necessarily places you want to go.  Be ready to feel uncomfortable; be ready to walk away feeling dirty and soiled.  But there is hope, there is redemption somewhere; PRECIOUS forces you to find it yourself, but it at least starts you on the right path.  Watch this film.  That's all I can say: watch this film.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Whether or not this accurately portrays the Sherlock Holmes from the famous stories is unimportant, at least for me. I wanted to see a good, entertaining film, and that is exactly what I experienced. It is by no means a classic masterpiece, but it was certainly a fun ride. The plot is a tad on the choppy side, but it doesn't deter from whole experience.     The film works beautifully first and foremost because of the wonderful chemistry between Holmes and Watson. It felt pure and believable and watching them argue and bicker for almost the entire film was refreshing and amusing. Jude Law's Watson is the voice of reason and under all the sarcasm and berating, truly cares for his long-time friend. In my opinion, a perfectly cast role. Though I also loved Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, I felt that he muttered alot in the film and was at times hard to understand. But his physical presence saved the role and you can tell he put 100% into this part.     The scenery was gloomy and strangely beautiful, as were the period details, costumes, etc. Guy Ritchie did a fantastic job in reimagining the era and creating a sense of mystery tinged with a clever, comedic flair.     Sherlock Holmes contains enough action, mystery and comedy to keep just about anybody from being bored and would do well with multiple viewings.
0312944926|1.0|I am a detail oriented person. I am one to truly immerse myself in a book - get lost in it - so I love descriptive details in a book. As a result, I have never had any desire to skip even a single page while reading a novel. In fact, many times, I will re-read certain sections to form a very detailed \\"picture\\" in my mind of the story's setting. So, having found my self skipping ENTIRE SECTIONS of Digital Fortress, I can safely declare that this harrowing reading experience was the direct result of one of the worst jobs of \\"plot-unfolding\\" I've ever encountered. A huge fan of Angels and Demons and The Lost Symbol, I am simply shocked that this was written by Dan Brown.<br /><br />First of all, the attempts at being unpredictable were, well, predictable. I always hate when I anticipate the next scene and read on only to find that I was dead on...and knowing that a third grader would have come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />I'm also put-off by female lead characters who are initially painted as tough, strong, and competent, but, in her actions and reactions, prove to be just as weak and pathetic as the typical pretty but pretty useless damsel in distress. Susan may be book-smart, but her thoughts and actions are incredibly \\"stupid.\\" I found myself calling her that outloud. In the end, it doesn't even matter as there is absolutely nothing redeeming or admirable about her.<br /><br />...and are we really supposed to accept the fact that during the nail-biting \\"countdown,\\" this super-genius mega-powerful group at the National Security Agency couldn't pick up the Bat-phone to consult a nuclear physicist, so they had no other choice but to \\"Google it?\\" Really?<br /><br />Such a shame, because the concept and overall predicament had real potential! Unfortunately, getting to the point is excruciatingly drawn out and painfully wordy, and the jellyfish of a heroine is far from heroic and annoyingly lame. Simply put, the storyline is ludicrous, the characters are cartoonish (you'll find yourself wishing the worst for all of them - or just cursing them aloud from your reading chair,) and for the non-techy geek reader, huge sections in the middle of the book are just pages and pages of seemingly endless \\"jibberish.\\"e worst for all of them - or just cursing them aloud from your reading chair,) and for the non-techy geek reader, huge sections in the middle of the book are just pages and pages of seemingly endless \\"jibberish.\\"
1400052173|5.0|Everyone involved in medical research and research ethics should have this book on their reading list. In particular, teachers and scholars should advice students in medicine and the health sciences to read it. Focus and discussion should be on the many ethical questions and dilemmas that are raised, ie. between the individual and the community. No one is left untouched by the destiny  and frustration of the Lacks family which is a gripping story in and as of itself. For academics the core of the matter are the informed consent and how the patient and the family should or ought be compensated on the one hand, and the intellectual property rights and economic benefit for the individual researcher, the scientific community, and the population at large on the other.
0307278255|5.0|very nicely written.  This book allows you to enter into the old and new Indian   customs.  Each chapter depicts different generations of people that are trying to live life in the 20 th century but still carry some traditions from India.  Many of the younger family members are slightly rebelious of there parents ways but tend to see the light at the end.  Easy read, loved the short story stile.
B0002W18MU|5.0|Johnny Cash was most certainly one of the most tortured souls of our history, or was he?  Maybe his life simply caused him to ask for so much and in the catching up with who he wanted to be he had a lot of experiences, and learned more than most will in a lifetime.  His music has always been about his experiences and those he witnessed,  this album is no different.  Something in his voice and the inflection of his words is different, there is peace, there is love, there is reverence. It will touch your soul if you let it - not to mention your heart.
0385528752|5.0|Concise writing with the appropriate dash of humor throughout. I loved this book. Their first 'Made To Stick' book didn't bowl me over, but this book is amazing. I think they have really created something special here.  This is a modern textbook for change in all areas. I can't say enough good things about this book. Both the content and the way it's presented are top notch. You will get many points to take away and apply readily.

B002XMGGK6|2.0|Law Abiding Citizen would have made a real good revenge flick but that plot is just window dressing for some contrived tale about justice and technicalities.  The movie is well made and glossy production.  The direction is good and so is the acting from the two leads.  I just didn't care for how contrived the plot was.  There's a few scenes of very bloody bloodletting (it looks as if it was heavily edited) and graphic violence.  Unfortunately, these scenes are thinly spreaded out in the 100 plus minute film.  The trailer has a lot of spoilers and manages to show the entire movie (albeit in a very brief snippets).  I would have loved to have seen this film as a hardcore revenge/action film instead of this mediocre film that was produced instead.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This verison of Jane Eyre runs very close to the book. A little low budget, but definately worth watching for any Jane Eyre fan!
0553381687|3.0|Before you start reading this series, please be aware that the author has not completed the story, despite the passing of several years since the last book.  I read three of the four books in the series before discovering this, and was very frustrated since there is virtually no plot resolution and threads of character I had come to care about are left hanging in the wind.  I don't mind waiting for another book in a series (I am a huge Harry Potter fan and enjoyed the anticipation as much as the reading) but the frustration of never knowing the outcome certainly took away from the joy of reading.
B001HUHBAE|5.0|I love this movie and the extras are great. I had the dvd with no extras and not Blue Ray and it was like I was seeing a new movie. You must buy this in Blue Ray if you are interested in this movie. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
0307269981|4.0|So I purchased this book after reading the \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\", which I loved.  It's such a great page turner. I don't read mystry novels, but after reading these two I might get in to more.  Can't wait for the third book to come out already pre-ordered it.  If you're not sure you want to buy this one don't think any further and just purchase the book.  ENJOY!

B0021L8US0|1.0|Just watched D9 last night and what a disappointment.  I knew nothing about this movie except what I read on the back of the DVD.  After reading the synopsis and noticing it was by Peter Jackson, I thought this would be a good movie so I took a chance and rented it.  I guess I'm a straightforward no nonsense regular everyday sci-fi kinda guy because I saw nothing in this movie that interested me.  The beginning was way too long and just boring.  It was done as if you were watching the news on television with fake news banners and such.  The only problem was it was full of over the top silliness defeating the purpose of making it seem real.  After 20 minutes of the fake news stuff, I knew I wouldn't like the movie and I didn't.  The acting was silly and the situations the actors were in were silly.  I guess this movie was supposed to parallel the reality of today in showing us how ugly humans are to people (aliens) not of their own kind.  That would have been great except do it in a more serious movie for such a serious topic.  Why would you try to present a serious topic such as racism with over acted, silliness.  Anyway, there are a lot of good reviews for this movie but I'm not sure why.  I've seen it before where reviewers give a movie high praise because it's a thinkin man's movie that has some way out intellectual hidden meaning that the rest of us won't get because we aren't smart enough.  Well, whatever!!!!  I didn't like it and just wanted to give an honest impression.  As mentioned earlier, I think the premise behind the movie was a good one.  I also think that it's great, not to mention difficult, to come up with something that hasn't been done before in the Sci-Fi genre.  However, when you lose sight of the primary goal of a movie which is to entertain then nothing else matters.  There are plenty of 5 star and 1 star ratings for this flick.  So, you either love it or hate it.  Just make sure that you know what type of movie this is first before investingyour time or money.  Whether or not you will like it depends on what you are expecting out of it.  It's not a typical sci-fi movie, kinda over the top, and do not see this just for the special effects, you'll be dissapointed.
0393072231|5.0|I saw the Daily Show interview and came out to check on the book. What did I see? Children rating a book as one-star because early adopters aren't provided every possible thing they wish.    It's a book review, not a question of how the book is provided. Your argument is equivalent to early adopters claiming, in the past:  1) If a movie isn't released on Beta as soon as it's in the theaters, people should give it a bad review  2)If a book isn't released simultaneously in book form and audio tape form, all reviewers should trash it.    But not exactly. The differences are:  1) There's billions more people reading books than using electronic books, a much larger difference between early adopters of older technologies and the existing media of the time.  2) Amazon isn't claiming that an electronic version should be published, you're saying that YOUR electronic version should be published simultaneously with books or you'll trash the context of the book.    Amazon allowing early adopters of their technology to trash the content of books because they're not being pampered is unethical. You are not advocating a new technology, you're using your own business power to try to blackmail suppliers to use your technology rather than that of other people. That's not an honest evaluation of the content of a book, it's bs.    Of course, given the abuse of the system, I'm curious to see if my review will be posted. Especially since I'll close by advocating that everyone who agrees that Amazon's blackmailing publishers is wrong should stop buying from Amazon until they change their policies to ensure that ratings are based on the content of the books.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Few Hollywood biographies capture the ambiguities of the person it portrays, but \\"Planet of the Apes\\" director Franklin J. Schaffner's biography of General George S. Patton proved the exception to the rule. \\"Patton\\" received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film.<br /><br />Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" penned one of the earliest versions of the \\"Patton\\" script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. \\"Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all.\\" Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.<br /><br />Initially, the Patton family opposed \\"Patton,\\" and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved \\"Patton\\" in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit.<br /><br />Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, \\"Call off the dogs.\\" She gushed about it. \\"I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind.\\" Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.<br /><br />The positive reception of \\"Patton\\" seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that \\"we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly.\\" However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, \\"Patton\\" compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.<br /><br />Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, \\"Patton\\" depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal \\"tourde force.\\" Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to \\"Patton\\": \\"I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war.\\"<br /><br />Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted \\"Patton\\" a fascinating anti-hero. Those--like Richard Nixon--who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery.\\" President Nixon watched \\"Patton\\" twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film \\"Patton\\" had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put \\"Patton\\" on their required viewing list of movies.e Patton family and the military proved one part.

B001AX60KU|5.0|When this was released it had been a fair while since Sony/BMG released a top-class Elvis product to the general public.<br />The Deluxe Version contains over 100 songs, a 32 page booklet & with each disc housed in stylish mini LP paper sleeves. The box is CD sized with text foil stamped lift-off lid.<br />The presentation is one of the best ever from BMG and both releases contain a delightful 32 page booklet of photos and memorabilia. The text by Harvey Kubernick nicely sets the scene and includes some interesting stories from Elvis' buddy Lance LeGault including,,,<br /><br />\\"Elvis and I played a lot of music over the years,\\" LeGault acknowledges. \\"He sang all the time. We didn't go to lunch breaks; we went to dressing rooms and jammed. Now, Elvis was very insecure when we started and I think that's why he called me up. Because Elvis had a charming insecurity. But then he warmed up and relaxed, which didn't take long. Look at the opening of that sit-down part - he had an acoustic guitar. And then he traded with Scotty and took the electric. And then it all became electric.\\"<br /><br />There is the thought that as serious Elvis fans, haven't we bought the entire musical content before? This is of course basically true and I admit that the 2000 BMG double CD 'Memories' is one of best \\"Comeback\\" compiles around.<br />However I disagree with the other reviewer here as on this set we not only get the ORIGINAL Album version (The 'Memories' set was a very different compilation) but there is something refreshing about the way this new set has been compiled. Once I started playing these CDs I was grabbed once again by how fresh and exciting this rock'n'roll renaissance still sounds even forty years later.<br /><br />The second CD of the first Sit-Down and Stand-Up shows cleverly leads us from Elvis jamming with the boys on his very first release 'That's All Right' through a fabulous revitalisation of his classic songs all the way to the stunning 'If I Can Dream' which would be his newest single. It is still a fascinating musical journey.<br /><br />I was also surprised by my realisation of just how many \\"old\\" movies songs Elvis used in this TV Special. In this Beatles/Byrds era Elvis could have been taking a chance using some of these old \\"corny\\" songs like 'Little Egypt', 'Let Yourself Go' even 'Can't Help Falling In Love' and 'Love Me Tender' which might have sounded way out of date. Remember that none of us had ever heard Elvis sings ANY of these songs LIVE since the fifties!<br /><br />However the new Billy Goldenburg arrangements and the power of Elvis' vocal push these and every song into something full of soul and passion. It's a real revitalisation, a new breath of life. Did his vocal for Love Me Tender or Can't Help Falling In Love ever sound better?<br /><br />My only negative is that unfortunately BMG decided to use the original Master Tape of the TV-Special, and despite the work of their best sound engineer Vic Anesini it does sound terribly rough at times. But this is to be expected since the tape was always a poor quality Master and, as on previous releases, you can even hear the tape creases go by. Reading the JAT '68 At 40 Retrospective' book one perhaps can understand why, since the wily Colonel made sure that RCA never truly paid for the Steve Binder/Bones Howe produced tapes. Maybe it is karma at work!<br /><br />In any case it is after all the original album sequencing that we all have a nostalgic fondness for and the audio quality is not something that the general public will baulk at. The original album is also now bolstered by the bonus stereo tracks, plus the new releases of the \\"A Legendary Performer Vol.3\\" versions of 'It Hurts Me' and 'Let Yourself Go' - and mah boy, mah boy, do they sound great!<br /><br />Noting a positive audio improvement, the sound on the other 3 discs has been upgraded to a better quality than on previous releases. Noticeable is the improvement on the tracks from the very first FTD release 'Burbank '68` which was mastered too loud and had clipping and distortion on the audio peaks.<br /><br />The third CD features both second shows and because of this both Elvis and the band have relaxed more into the live situation and Elvis messes around a bit more. He even fluffs `Heartbreak Hotel' at the start! However he feels inspired enough to try out the gorgeous `Santa Claus Is Back In Town' \\"My favourite Christmas song of all the ones I have ever recorded\\" even if he has forgotten the lyrics. Similarly 'When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again' gets a proper work-out at the second show.<br /><br />It's particularly nice to enjoy the full second Stand-Up show (several tracks were edited out on the 'Burbank '68 ' release) with the fun of Elvis trying to conquer the `Trouble/Guitar Man' playback. Left standing alone he has to entertain the audience, \\"They're gonna' put me away for a while\\" as he sings `MacArthur Park' and `Tip-Toe Through The Tulips'. \\"It's getting embarrassing standing out here Steve. I've got to do something.\\"<br /><br />The rehearsals CD is not one that one would play often but there are still plenty of revelations as Elvis and his friends laugh and kick around some ideas a few days before the actual Studio recordings.<br /><br />Tracks like 'Blue Moon/Young Love' (\\"I tell you there are 500 songs with that same chord\\") 'When It Rains, It Really Pours' (\\"Goddamn that's high!\\"), 'That's My Desire' and Elvis' delight in 'Love Me' and 'When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again' (how strange that they never made it onto the TV Special LP) are just some of the really enjoyable moments.<br /><br />In the end this is a \\"General Public\\" release providing the best of all four shows plus rehearsals and as such is one of BMG's best releases in years.<br /><br />I realise that if, like myself, you have bought every individual FTD and BMG release (i.e. Tiger Man, Memories and FTDs 'Burbank '68' & Let Yourself Go) then you will have all the content - but of course not all the songs in their correct context. However the whole package is something too good to miss out on not to \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and enjoy this wonderful celebration one more time. It is, after all, only slightly more expensive than one FTD digi-pack release.<br /><br />Overall Verdict: An essential celebration of Elvis at his best.

B002VECM4A|5.0|\\"Shadowboxer\\" director Lee Daniels deserves every award and honor that Hollywood and critics around the world can bestow on him for his electrifying African-American social problem film \\"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire\\" that casts newcomer Gabourey Sidibe as the troubled heroine. This R-rated, 110-minute urban nightmare probably could not have been made without the help of both Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry. You can just imagine what derisive comments greeted this venture when the filmmakers pitched their idea about a theatrical release chronicling a year in the life of an abused obese soul sister. Who would want to suffer through a thoroughly depressing, often offensive movie about a big fat loser trapped in the ghetto? Indeed, when you watch the trailer for this film, you want to suppress a laugh because everything is so hideously horrifying about this poor girl's hopeless existence. She puts up with an incredibly monstrous mother who treats her as if she were own personal slave. Nevertheless, despite its uncompromising subject matter, \\"Precious\\" qualifies as an inspiring film that doesn't rely on sugar-coating and a happy ending. Sapphire wrote her 1996 novel \\"Push\\" in first-person and adopted a rough, stylized dialect to enhance its verisimilitude. Reportedly, \\"Push\\" was Sapphire's homage to \\"The Color Purple.\\" Ostensibly, Lionsgate--the company that is distributing the Daniels film changed the title from \\"Push\\" to \\"Precious\\" to avoid any confusion between this powerful film and the lackluster Chris Evans & Dakota Fanning science fiction epic \\"Push\\" (2009).<br /><br />\\"Precious\\" depicts in semi-documentary fashion the plight of an illiterate, grotesquely overweight 16-year old Harlem girl poised to give birth to her second child. Ironically, Claireece 'Precious' Jones (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) has never had a boyfriend. Incidentally, her first child is a four-year-old girl afflicted with Down's syndrome, and her tyrannical, potty-mouthed mother Mary (Mo'Nique of \\"Soul Plane\\") despises the adolescent and forces her mother to keep her. At school, Precious' classmates ridicule her Buddha-like physique, but she maintains a stoic imperturbability and ignores their insults. Meanwhile, Mary lets her incestuous boyfriend (Rodney Bear Jackson) rape her daughter while she stands in the background and observes this act of child abuse. No, there is no nudity in these harrowing scenes, but the content may be disturbing enough to alienate some audiences. In fact, Mary has allowed her out-of-control boyfriend to take advantage of Precious since the girl was three years old and mother and daughter shared the same bed with him. As the film unspools, Precious finds herself expelled from her high school because she is pregnant. The conscientious school principal arranges for Precious to attend an alternative school called Each One Teach One where drop-outs go to earn their GED. Precious learns to read and write under the tutelage of her instructor Blu Rain (Paula Patton of \\"Hitch\\"), a dedicated but kind teacher who inspires Precious to keep a journal about her life. Meantime, Mary never misses an opportunity to insult, torment, and batter her obsequious daughter. Precious takes everything that her wicked mother can dish out until she comes home with her infant son Abdul. Mary knocks Abdul out of her arms and begins to batter her daughter. Precious fights back, seizes her baby and flees. Precious is in such a hurry that she loses her footing and topples down the stairs. Meanwhile, mom lugs her portable TV outside and hurls it at her daughter. The television barely misses Precious and crashes into a million pieces. Eventually, after Precious has her son, she decides to left her impossible mother and goes to stay with Ms. Patton. If all this drama weren't enough, Precious learns from her mother that her father had contracted the AIDS virus. A brave social worker Mrs. Weiss (pop singer Mariah Carey deglamorized without make-up) helps Precious escape the abuse that her villainous mother doles out with a vengeance. Sure, this sounds as depressing as you can imagine because there is nothing far-fetched about it.<br /><br />\\"Precious\\" ranks as a compelling as well as gripping cinematic experience with kitchen-sink realism about intolerance. What takes \\"Precious\\" to another level of celluloid sophistication is that Daniels takes us into the head of his protagonist, and we see everything from Precious' perspective in terms of her dreams and aspirations. She yearns to have a light-skinned boyfriend, beautiful clothes, and fame. Daniels delivers some incredibly surreal moments. We see Precious' thoughts turned into a movie that she is watching on television, Vittorio De Sica's \\"Two Women,\\" about Italian refugees during World War II that adds another dimension to her wretched predicament. Apparently, Mary forced Precious to eat food even when she was not hungry. This abuse is alluded to in the movie as Precious sees it from her warped perspective.

She yearns to have a light-skinned boyfriend, beautiful clothes, and fame. Daniels delivers some incredibly surreal moments. We see Precious' thoughts turned into a movie that she is watching on television, Vittorio De Sica's \\"Two Women,\\" about Italian refugees during World War II that adds another dimension to her wretched predicament. Apparently, Mary forced Precious to eat food even when she was not hungry. This abuse is alluded to in the movie as Precious sees it from her warped perspective.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|I liked Daft Punk's Discovery before, now I LOVE it.<br />Amazing job on this animated movie set to the albums songs
B0029LHW68|5.0|I really like this group and think this is their best album so far.  I liked every song on this album which is rarely heard of now adays.  Their is nothing to not like about this album: everything just fits perfectly, lyrics, music, tone it all fit so perfectly for this album.  Looking forward to more great albums from this group. This is a must own for your digital collection along with actual CD collection.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This film has a perfect title, THIS IS IT!! This is a must have for any die-hard MJ fan!! I absolutely adored this film. The 3-D effects of THRILLER you cannot beat. It will make you want to jump and shout and laugh and cry. It really shows that he was a perfectionist when it came to his work. It also showed what a wonderful humanitarian he was.     All I have to say is that May God Bless his children, family, and those that were close to him. If you do not like Michael, I guarantee it that you will end up loving him after watching this!!     You cannot \\"BEAT IT\\" because it is not that \\"BAD\\" because it is quite a \\"THRILLER\\" to have in your DVD collection to watch over and over.     Thanks to the family that let us see him one last time in this. I am so happy to have it in my collection!!
B001IHJ97E|4.0|Though the styles of clothing and the sizes of computers have drastically changed, this is still a great movie.  Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood are good in this story of modern inventions that are taken over by the government for war uses.  Realistic idea well played.  This is Natalie Wood's last movie.
0393072231|1.0|Didn't we hear this story before?  In fact, we did about six months ago when Gregory Zuckerman of the Wall Street Journal came out with The Greatest Trade Ever: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of How John Paulson Defied Wall Street and Made Financial History.  One of the best reads of the year, a truly great book.    Zuckerman was the Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the story of how a small band of also-rans and misfits boldly bet against housing and won big.  As Zuckerman's reporting shows, leading the pack was John Paulson, who personally made some $6B over a period of 18 months first betting against housing and then the banks that made the real estate bubble possible.  It is a fascinating account of how Paulson pulled the trade together, despite conventional wisdom always saying he was wrong.  Though Lewis's book recounts the ancillary players in this drama -- like Michael Burry and Greg Lippmann -- Paulson is essentially missing.  It was if Lewis were telling the story of the 2009 World Series winning Yankees and not including anything about A Rod or Derek Jeter.    One of the points of these books is how conventional wisdom \\"missed it, how the media never saw the big story.  By ignoring Zuckerman's much better book, and focusing on Lewis's,the media had done it again: choosing the sizzle of Lewis to the steak of Zuckerman.  And the media wonders why we are all cynical.    Lewis' book may be fun and end with a movie starring Brad Pitt but it is Zuckerman's books that gets at the heart of the matter, best explains the housing bubble and what really happened, and most importantly is the better read.  If you were going to read one book on this subject, make it Zuckerman's.
0439023483|5.0|I remember the moment when I realized that 'The Hunger Games' was not just a good book, but a great one. It was the moment after the main character, Katniss Everdeen, volunteers as a \\"tribute\\" for her district in this year's Hunger Games. She volunteers because her younger sister, Prim, was originally selected. She volunteers because Prim is just 12 years old.  She volunteers because the Hunger Games is a competition to the death.<br /><br />\\"I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage,\\" Katniss says. \\"Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.\\"<br /><br />This sums up what I love about 'The Hunger Games' nicely - As a book it is challenging and complicated and so well done from start to finish. There are moments of almost lyrical beauty and moments of shocking brutality, all paced steadily to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />'The Hunger Games' is set in a future where there has been some sort of cataclysm (war or environmental disaster seems likely), and what we know as North America today has been divided into twelve Districts. Each year, every district must send two tributes, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18 to the annual Hunger Games, where they will fight to do the death in a closed arena. All but one of the 24 tributes each year will die, with the survivor winning a life of luxury.<br /><br />The premise of the book, and the focus on adolescent relations in an extreme life-threatening setting, reminded me in all the right ways of Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game.' In both books, children are portrayed as being as being capable of great calculation, great humanity, and even great brutality when placed in extreme situations. The honesty and the keen observation of the book is one of its strong points.<br /><br />'The Hunger Games' tells a compelling story with a believable and interesting cast of characters. It draws you in from the first page and keeps you reading, despite the fact that much of it is difficult to face. It's not easy reading about children killing other children, but it is the complexity and the challenging nature of the story that makes it so worth reading. There are not clear lines of good and evil, but only survival, while keeping some shred of humanity intact.<br /><br />Expect to be drawn into this story. You may not agree with it. You may not condone it. You may feel that all of it is wrong. But you will want to read it anyway, because it's just that good.is difficult to face.

B0031OCY2E|3.0|This movie could've been awesome.  It was funny, it was well written, and it was one of those movies where you truly did not know what was going to happen.  It was paced out well, and it delivered it's necessary information in a methodical manner.  I couldn't love it though.  Matt Damon.  I kept thinking if William H. Macy had been cast for this movie, it would've been perfect.  It would've sat on my shelf with all of the other few movies that I buy.  If Macy reprised his role in Fargo for this movie, save the Minnesota accent, this would've so much better.  Bakula was good, but he's good in everything he does.  The actor I loved most in this movie was Tony Hale.  We need more Tony Hale in movies.  He didn't have a huge role, and he wasn't funny in this role, but he makes every movie more enjoyable in my humble opinion.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I loved the concept and loved the movie, but why oh why did they have to include the crudeness associated with Mr. Collins?  We already love to hate him.  I did not really want my preteen daughters exposed to the references about his personal habits.  Gross!
B0035G9ABG|5.0|That's just it, I'm done, I'm ready to insert Albarn's name in the great musician category.  That's right, I said musician.  I didn't say rock star.  Who is this guy?  Former Blur guy.   I liked Blur.  Blur was good.  Albarn is great.  He dumped the panache pursuit of the legendary status that the Brit press dreamed up with what's his name, and he began pursuing art.  This stuff is bold material.  It lacks genre.  It's what we've come to expect from this \\"side project\\" but it's advanced.  Rock stars learn what will sell, and they attempt to put the same squares in different holes for as long as they can.  A musician tries to create a different feel, a different color, and a different universe to each album they create.  They can't help it.  It's who they are.  Albarn created another great album of art with this one.  Every song is unique and has its own appeal.  I could list singles and all that, but this album should be listened to in its entirety.  This one's a STRONG RECOMMEND.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|The picture is amazing!. Blu-ray is the way. This movie has fantastic colorful scenes and I love the way they burst into song (great songs) and the way older people of my age just freely give way to acting crazy just for the fun of it and don't care how they look to anyone else. It's just a great, fun, sweet, visually stunning movie!
0066620996|5.0|I read this book in the airport at Munich during the 2 1/2 hour flight delay. Honestly, I could care less about the subject matter. I was bored and my associate had a copy, so I read it. And while I cannot intelligently comment on its business acumen I can tell you: it's a brilliant read. It is written simply and directly. It is easily digestible, clear and concise.    I'm an author. And while my book will never be as highly rated as this one, in its genre it does quite well. My writing style was very much influenced by good to great. Kurt Vonnegut said it best in his first rule of writing, \\"Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.\\" I was not only a stranger, I was disinterested stranger... the worst kind of reader. Yet, in a small but significant way this book changed me.       [[ASIN:1932603743 Stronger After Stroke: Your Roadmap to Recovery]]

B0034JKZ86|3.0|The movie wasn't necessarily BAD.  It simply didn't live up to the hype created by the first ever black Princess.  That Disney didn't create a black princess until 2009 is simply shameful, and I don't think the movie lived up to it's potential.    Honestly, it felt like a re-hashed mix-matched version of every other Disney movie that has come before.  I've grown up watching Disney movies and had high hopes for this one, but instead saw bits and pieces of every movie I've loved thrown together to a new soundtrack.  A soundtrack that sadly sounds like Phil Collins doing jazz.... I can't bring specific moments to mind (I watched it in the theatre when it opened and haven't seen it since), but if you've seen Disney movies several times, you'll see what I'm saying.      I did like aspects of the movie.  Princess Tiana is beautiful and gorgeously voiced.  But, I find it interesting (and disheartening) that Disney's first BLACK princess is forced into a FROG form 3/4's of the movie.  I wish there'd been more African-American culture included in the movie.      I liked the villain.  He was scary, but so have ALL Disney villains.  I liked the hoo-doo Voo-Doo.  It may have been theatrical, but at least it was different than all the other villains (even though this villain looked like Jafar redrawn and had a similar sidekick).      And, I LOVED Lottie, Tiana's friend!  She was hilarious, the only character who made me laugh out loud!    The kids liked it, I didn't mind it.  I'll buy it and we'll watch it a lot I'm sure, but it will never gain the place in our hearts held by movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
B003498SDA|4.0|For years Tom Cruise has done some films that pull the envelope for his talent.  DEspite being nominated for 3 Academy Awards, this man still stands as one of Hollywood's most successful actors.  Although it does seem that whenever he works with actors they seem to either to get nominated or win an Oscar.  I believe the first serious movie he was in is The Color of Money (1986) when Paul Newman won an oscar for it.  Then there was Rain Man (1988) which had Dustin Hoffman winning Best Actor.  Then there was his Oscar-nominated performance as the paralyzed VIetnam veteran in Born on the Fourth of July (1989).  Then there was A Few Good Men (1992) when Jack Nicholson was nominated for playing the general with his famous line \\"You can't handle the truth.\\"  Then there was The Firm (1993) with Holly Hunter playing the secretary of the P.I. hired by Tom Cruise's lawyer character.  Then there was Jerry Macguire (1996) with his Best Actor nomination as a sports agent with Cuba Gooding Jr. winning the Best Supporting Actor oscar as Cruise's ambitious client and closest friend.  Then there was Magnolia (1998) with his Best Supporting Actor Nomination as the crazy self promoter.  Then in 2003, there was The Last Samurai (2003) with Ken Wattanabe receiving a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the samurai teacher.  Then there was Collateral (2004) with Jamie Foxx earning Best Supporting Actor Nomination as the taxi driver.  Then there was Tropic Thunder (2008) with Robert Downey Jr. receiving Best Supporting Actor Nomination for his portrayal of a crazy actor who comes in black face.   Lets see what happens next.

0385504225|1.0|It has to be absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read.  The plot twists you can see them coming a mile away.  The ending is so weak and stupid that it just doesn't make any sense.  If you still want to know what happens in Robert Langdon latest adventure I would suggest you wait for the movie; that way you will still waste some hours, but at least no more than two (hopefully)
B0015ABRE2|5.0|DEXTER:The Complete Third Season:  I was given DEXTER First and Second Season by a friend who thought that I would  enjoy it. Not only did I enjoy it, but I loved it!   I am waiting for DEXTER the fourth season which will be coming out as soon as its released!   Its exciting,scarey,sexy, and also funny! Its sit on the edge of your seat drama!  Michael C. Hall who plays Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter expert with the Miami Police Dept. but also has another hobby as a serial killer but only kills people who deserve it,  criminals who beat the system or somehow get away with murder.     I have spent many a night staying up late because I just had to see the next chapter it's that good. Once you see it and start to watch it you cannot stop until you have seen it all. It's definately for adults a little too graphic and bloody for the younger croud.

B000096I9G|5.0|My review boils down to one word..SUPERB!!    One of the best - if not best - concert DVDs I've ever seen. They didn't ruin it (as so many are) by putting in too many crowd shots, screaming fans or non-concert footage. The focus is where it should be - on the band. Sound quality is stellar as is the video. And the music...need I say more?

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I've just watched Shelter for the 4th time in about 2 years.  I love this film.  Sure, it's not perfect.  But it's very real and it's full of heart.  It has grown on me since I first saw it and it's one of my 2 favorite \\"gay movies\\" - but I definitely don't think you need to be gay to like it.  (The other favorite is a French film, \\"Just a Question of Love\\".)  The dramatic tension in the story is based on simple, generally realistic connections and relationships between people.  Although it is didactic, it doesn't rely on or need melodrama or common gay stereotypes to produce impact; and you'd have to be pretty cynical and jaded not to be affected by it.  The story and characters are engaging, the acting is good, the production quality is good, the screenplay is pretty good, and the soundtrack supports the feel of the film.  Technically it's not a 5 star film, but it has qualities that work for me and raise it above the ordinary.  In short, Shelter is beautiful and heart-warming in its simplicity.
0743298039|4.0|This story involves an introverted young woman biographer who is chosen by a reclusive well known writer to pen her life story. The challenge is that Vida, the writer, has never told the same story twice about her life, so Margaret has no idea if they are all lies or if each holds a grain of truth. Margaret journeys to Yorkshire to work with Vida in a very gothic country home. I enjoyed the mystery of the book and the interactions between Margaret and Vida.  The tale drew me in and more than once, I wish I could have read Vida's book.  There were many twists and turns, but I found the story to be believable. I thought some of it was a little overwrought, but on the whole it was a good book and a page-turner.

B000WOXVJQ|5.0|I don't have a lot to add, other than to say, look at the breakdown of the reviews - it's almost exclusively 5-stars. And for good reason.    I received this Marley 4-CD box set waaaaay back in 1993 as a birthday present, and I still listen to it to this day, almost 20 years later!     It is hands-down the best box sets you can ever buy. It's one of my Desert Island Top CD's, and I've gone through literally thousands of CD's over the last 20+ years.     Listening to the music on these CD's is almost something of a religious experience; it's the power of really good music to truly move you (drug-induced or not).     I cannot recommend these Songs of Freedom enough. You should skip \\"Legend\\" and just buy this. But be warned, you may end up purchasing all of Bob's individual albums afterward.
1593080204|5.0|This classic really stands the test of time.  I've wanted to read this book for years, but just never wanted to \\"dive\\" into history and it's strange language.  I'm soo glad I did!  I loved it!!  The Barnes and Noble Classic version is great because it gives you little footnotes on historical terms and phrasing.  It was a wonderful read that I couldn't put down.  I would definitely recommend it to even occasional readers like me.
0393324818|5.0|Excellent book! Even if your not a baseball fan you will love this book.<br /><br />Have you ever felt like everyone one around you is dumb and they are doing things the most inefficient way possible? Even when you or others try to show them the error in their ways with cold hard facts to back it up, but they continue doing it their way saying things like \\"we've always done it this way\\" \\"if it's not broke don't fix it\\" etc.... Billy Beane felt the same way, so he went out and showed everyone just how efficiently he could run a baseball team. He had less money, assistants with ivy league degrees instead of baseball pedigree,  discarded/has-been/no-name players, and he some how found a way to win tons of games over multiple seasons and get tons of value out of seemingly nowhere.<br /><br />I really liked this book!
B001UV4XWY|4.0|While watching this film, there were a few things going through my mind: 1)Why hadn't it gotten more recognition in the theaters? 2)It seemed to be a lot like a lengthy version of a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode.    Although this was not a perfect film, it was a very intriguing and craftily made one. I've heard many negative reviews, especially ones bashing the film's ending, which left a couple of loose ends. Personally, that is what I liked most about it. As an American audience, we expect filmmakers to answer every question, so that, when the film reaches its end, we're left completely 100% satisfied. Although many or most films tie in all the loose ends, great ones, for the most part, do not. That is why we can take pleasure in viewing them more than once. I will agree that there are many films where the writer or director does a poor job of pasting the story together in the conclusion (such as The Grudge, Hide and Seek, and other such films). The Box's indefinite ending seems deliberate and, for lack of a better word, fitting. Every question I felt needed answering, was; and everything else was left for my mind to attempt to piece together by itself. That comes to show the movie did its job, at least for me.     Another thing to like is the production values of this film. It was terrificly shot, it captured the 70's perfectly, and it made the circumstances of the main couple seem very intense and severe. The entire film, I strongly felt for these two people because, although they did act on selfish impulse, I don't really think they were fully aware of what they were getting themselves into. My family saw this movie before I did and warned me that it was confusing and left them wanting more; so I came into The Box speculating. As I was watching, I realized the plot of this film served as somewhat of a modern fable or parable, showing the consequences of a society driven by greed. I felt it was supposed to be viewed as that, and not meant to be rationalized. In rationalizing the film, I feel many people lost what was truly important about it. I'm sure many asked: who are \\"the employers\\" or who really are the extra-terrestrial type humans in the motel? Why doesn't the story specify? My answer to this is: it doesn't have to.     I felt The Box worked in somewhat of a Theological level as well. In a society where people are playing God, the people become God. The absence of God is strongly felt in this movie, regardless of your religious affiliation. I thought this was interesting, because I think this is something the director was attempting to tackle. In the end, we don't know who the odd people roaming the setting of this film are: they can be a symbolic representation of God (or a lack of one) or they can be aliens from another planet. But, like I said before, in the end, these questions don't matter, because they all result in the same thing.     My suggestion is that you walk into this film with no preconceived notions, or expecting to hate it; because, the fact of the matter is, most Americans (who want their fairytale ending where everything is in black and white) probably did hate this movie. The film is very unconventional and odd. It makes you want to rationalize all the plot-points, but the film itself seems to break away from the realm of rationality, which means you do too. You'll see that once you let your mind rest and accept the film for what it is, you will be utterly intrigued and highly entertained. Give this film a shot; I hope you won't regret it.

Seth Godin expresses in readily accessible language why everyone's an entrepreneur today--and we should all think like artists.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Roland Emmerich has become a very rich man taking a basic disaster screenplay straight out of a freshman college text, superimposing some outlandish subject on it, spending ninety percent of his budget on special effects and peddling it to \\"the masses\\", who, predictably, gobble it up.  Oh, and he also uses it to peddle his worldview, which, amongst other things, is anti-Christian and vehemently anti-Catholic.    \\"2012\\" is just more of the same, capitalizing on the 2012 craze, and grossing over $750 million world-wide.  Most of the cast are worldview fellow travelers like Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson.  John Cusack gets top billing, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is the only one who warrants that treatment in this picture.    The climax and ending are laughable.    One of the \\"arks\\" takes a direct hit from a rather large chunk of Mount Everest and, aside from a small hole and crack (which for some strange reason doesn't let in any water), there's no noticeable damage.      The first land to reemerge is --- what else --- the Cape of Good Hope and south Africa, followed by most of the remainder of the continent.  Strange how the rest of the world was literally turned upside-down and yet Africa somehow not only was spared but appears to be fully habitable.  The no doubt unintended irony is that most likely only a few African politicians and billionaires survived aboard the \\"arks\\".

B003A9OVS0|5.0|The latest offering of Gorillaz music is upon us.  Damon Alburn is quite a character, with well; all his characters!  Although I have not bought the complete album, I have heard some tracks.  The one and only track I own if the Lou Reed guest track.  I am not sure if Lou phones his vocal via New York to London or if he is in on the sessions, but it doesn't matter.  His mechnical, monotone is so persuasive and melodic, it really frames the beat and keyboard lines.  I listen to it over and over and the track leaves me stuttering.<br />In an album brimming with collabs, this pairing looks good on paper and in song.  (check the Mick Jones/ Paul Simeonon collab) Damon must be spinning around London in a great mood, waiting to take his 3D band out on tour across the world.  Let's see if Snoop will join him on stage in LA.

1576754227|3.0|Brian Tracy's Eat That Frog Review<br />An Eat that Frog Review can launch a discussion which is very relevant in today's busy world. Eat that Frog is a phrase that serves as a metaphor for a person's taking on the most challenging tasks of his or her day. Author Brian Tracy's book Eat that Frog! centers around this concept.<br /><br />Eat that Frog shows people how to focus on the tasks which are most important and how to organize their days better. The best selling book, which has already sold over 500, 000 copies and has been translated into 20+ languages, enables people to learn twenty-one solid methods to halt procrastinating and to get more things accomplished in less time.

B000001FI7|4.0|This is an eclectic sound. It sets the mood for romance and sitting in a place with big sofas and pillows.  The vocals are very effective and leave you feeling that you've that you've heard something here that's very different.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B002WY65W4|4.0|I'm not a big fan of splatter in general, but here it works. The blood and guts are always somehow ironic and goofy, befitting the tone of this spoof. Woody is good, Jesse does his best Michael Cera impression as always (seaparted at birth, those two?), and it's nice and short, moving quickly and never getting dull.<br /><br />Bill Murray's bit is quite funny if not hilarious, but make sure to watch past the credits at the end to see a very funny bit with him reprising his Caddyshack Carl in zombie makeup.<br /><br />Looks good in blu-ray; all things considered, Zombieland is a bright send-up of the zombie/thriller genre, and worth seeing if you feel like some bloody laughter.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was begged to go see this movie which I had no interest in the first place to watch. I like gory movies,action, suspense which I knew this wasn't in the first place my type of flick. So they begged me enough that I went and really all I can say to sum it all up is im glad I did and this movie is amazing. I will never second guess a movie again I can't believe the special effects that Avatar has. Transformers 2 was amazing this just ate it all up for breakfast and lunch an still wanted more there photo realistic an what will be used for years too come. I didn't think this movie would have any action and man I was wrong it has about everything you could want. Take Transformers 2, The Matrix, Dances With Wolves, Jurassic Park, Last Of The Mohicans and King Kong put them on steroids an you now have Avatar. I could go on and on but atleast give this movie a chance im glad I had second thoughts you wont regret it plus either way do you know a single person that hates Avatar not a chance cause it is that amazing... Have fun watching the best movie to date.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|Obviously I love Star Trek: The Next Generation and if I was just reviewing the show I would say 5 stars.    The packaging, as expressed in other reviews, is simply awful.  All the discs are together in brittle green case with packaging tape binding them together.  The seasons aren't separated, although I will say that the discs are clearly marked so finding the seasons is more annoying than a real problem.  The craftsmanship on some of the graphic elements is a iffy, the text is actually blurred on some of the disks and it is difficult to get the green cases back into the large plastic container.  Because the green case isn't made out of a very flexible plastic, I'm concerned that I may crack the discs or the case whenever I remove a new disc.    On a positive note, there are some extras including interviews with the cast.  Audio commentary on some key episodes would have been great, but is not included.  The other positive is it is the least expensive way to get all of the seasons.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Welcome Back.    This album features a lot of the ideas from classic Megadeth Albums; political ideology backed up with heated vocals, melodic riffs with burning guitar solos on top of them. The album opens up with \\"Sleepwalker\\" which is a recollection of Dave Mustaine's nightmares and goes on about that. The next song \\"Washington is Next!\\" is one of the numerous politically driven songs, now on this song Dave takes a different stand on this song that he has before on older albums. By speaking of Biblical prophecies pointing to the end of the world and tying that to the current political situations that we're in, and going about the New World Order believed to be on the rise of political power.    Now onto \\"Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms\\". This is by far, the most unique song of the album, seeing as how it doesn't talk about politics, war, or the effects of violence. This song actually is about the love that God has had for Mustaine, and I'm sure it's on the album for us all to get something out of. Now, I am a Christian, and Dave's conversion to Christianity was a big deal to me. This song really speaks out to me, and is a reminder that while we were enemies of God, He still loved us and took us in.    \\"United Abominations\\" is the next song featured on the album which starts with some dissonant chords and as the song gets more involved you hear the classic \\"radio conversations\\" from the older Megadeth albums. It's a man going on about the issues going on in the world and how the United Nations does nothing about any of it. The rest of the song is about the failings of the U.N. \\"Gears of War\\" is another political song speaking about the ethics of war. \\"Blessed are the Dead\\" is another song based on Dave's Christian Beliefs, he is talking about the war that will \\"end all wars\\" and how terrible it will be, but he is washed in blood and will be safe from all of this.    The song \\"Play for Blood\\" is a song that I don't fully understand, other than the fact that it just sounds really good; it's a song that I would probably use as a sports teams promotional video soundtrack.Now, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" is actually a remake from off of an older album, but they sped up the track and added in Cristina Scabbia, lead singer of Laguna Coil, as a background singer and made the song more of a duet. The song itself sounds great. The final political song on the album appears now on the album \\"Amerikhastan\\". This song is about the Islamic assimilation that some believe is taking over some European nations and is now working its way into the United States. \\"You're Dead\\" is a song about revenge, and the pains from someone who's done wrong. Some may believe that it may be another revenge song about James Hetfield or Lars Ulrich of Metallica, but the second verse seems a little more redemptive than past revenge songs. The album ends with the song \\"Burnt Ice\\" which is about a man who loses everything to an addiction to Crystal Meth and his struggle to escape from it.     This album blew me away when I first heard it. I may be only twenty years old, but I have been listening to Megadeth for about 5 or 6 years now. I have gotten almost every album and am still working on getting them all. The first album I had was the Best Hits album Capitol Punishment. I loved that album, obviously, it was the best so far (seeing as it is the greatest hits album). I then got The System has Failed, which was great, but not as great as I thought it would be, I then went back and found the early Megadeth albums and fell in love with them. When I came across this album I was told it was great, but remained skeptical until I listened to it. I'm glad I did, welcome back Dave.
0393072231|5.0|This book is the best possible explanation for why I and so many others have been run over by an economic truck driven by unlicensed drivers because hey we do not regulate this form of mayhem.  No banker lost money much less millions.  No financial leader was held accountable, instead they are in the government.  Michael Lewis had to have done remarkable work to get to know the cast of characters so well and to explain the financial instruments and their history so clearly.  This is exciting, and the heroes - and they ARE here - share one characteristic.  They think for themselves, analyze where others will not, and act on their decisions.  One reviewer said that other readers might not be enthralled as he who read this in a day was.  I read this book in one reading, it is that good.  And would the Kindle cry babies please get their own corner or romper room or somewhere else to go?
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I saw some of this series when it was first shown, and was delighted to get the whole thing, plus the additions. All in all, it and its judgements and positions have stood the time remarkably well. Naturally there are things not included, as the producer readily admits - ULTRA and its use were not known at all. The Olivier commentary is brilliant. Best of all, the war was then recent history and there is an impressive range of first-hand accounts from participants and eyewitnesses, their memories still fresh.<br /><br />What I found most amazing was the achievement of getting still unreconstructed Nazis to talk about it - the one that talks about how \\"all the good Hitler did\\" has been submerged in all the negative publicity, Albert Speer hedging on the Final Solution. And then there was Traudl Junge saying that Hitler was \\"quite a nice man\\" (I guess he was to her). My favourite is SS Corporal Richard B&ouml;ck, the Auschwitz man who refused to participate in exterminations. This is courage far, far beyond the call of duty. Why doesn't this man have an entire chest of Medals of Honor?<br /><br />The Second World War/Great Patriotic War was the most destructive in history - 56 million people died, untold millions had their lives ruined and the cost was tremendous. This should be compulsory viewing for all would-be warmongers (assuming, of course, that they're rational and don't receive direct divine instruction).
B00005KHEU|5.0|One of the finest ELO albums.  Subtle storyline inside.  There are bonus tracks not found on the vinal album.  Nice strings. Some of my favorite ELO songs.
0446569895|5.0|I think the thing I am most impressed by with this book is how easy it is to read. It's almost as though you are sitting down and chatting with the Ozzman himself. Extremely funny anecdotes, and the book never gets too serious about itself. If even half the stuff in this book is true or recalled correctly, Ozzy was truly a madman. And I wouldn't have it any other way! I only hope he lives to 100 to show up all those who thought he'd be dead by now.
0393072231|1.0|Lewis was asked on CNBC why this book isnt on kindle. He said \\"why sell something for 10 when you can sell it for 16, it will be on kindle in a few months\\" im paraphrasing. Please wake up publisher we dont want to wait a few months and I cant live without my kindle so I wont buy the paper version. There will be better releases in a few months!!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Being almost 40 years old, I'm not easy to impress. But this band has pulled it off now three albums in a row. This is a band where each member contributes in a major way and together they achieve an amazing synergy.
0393072231|1.0|Where is the Kindle version?   Saw clips on the book and went to buy for my Kindle, no such luck.  Publisher would rather stick to bricks and mortar.      Wake up and smell 2010, give us the book on Kindle.
B003ATEBGM|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching \\"The Princess and the Frog,\\" not only because it is quite an entertaining movie, with all the traditional Disney elements, but also because it provides evidence that good, old animation is still alive and well. This is important because, despite the greatness of computer-generated animation, Pixar's style, the classic animation should never die. \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is delightful and colorful, spiked with an excellent jazzy soundtrack.    As in any other Disney film, this is a story about good versus evil, with a dose of true love. The main star is beautiful Tiana, whose working-class parents do the best to provide for her. However, it is her father's cooking that she inherited, and her dream is to open a restaurant - \\"Tiana's Place\\" - in her native New Orleans when she grows up.     The years pass by and Tiana indeed becomes a beautiful woman, who divides her time working as a maid and as a waitress. One day, she learns through Charlotte, one of her closest friends, that Prince Naveen is visiting town. Charlotte's father is rich, and he is hosting the Prince with a party.  Enter the Evil Dr. Facilier, a powerful voodoo practitioner who sees money in marrying Prince Naveen and Charlotte. For that purpose, he transforms the prince into a frog. That same night of the party, Tiana goes to the balcony of Charlotte's mansion and asks a star for her dream to open a restaurant to come true. It is then that the frog appears out of the blue, and tells Tiana that if she kisses him, he will transform into a prince, and that he will help her open her restaurant. Bad move. That's when Tiana's problems begin.    \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is just precious - a treasure --, and brings back Disney's tradition of quality animation. It is also an important film in terms of political correctness, because the main characters are all African-American (voices included). This intelligent design follows the footsteps of \\"Mulan\\" and \\"Pocahontas\\" of significant roles for minorities in animated movies. The Blu-ray edition reviewed here, in addition to the film, also includes deleted scenes; a making-of feature; the documentaries \\"The Return of hand-drawn animation,\\" \\"Conjuring the Villain,\\" \\"The Disney Legacy,\\" and much more  This fantastic set includes a disc with the DVD version of the film, and another one with a digital copy. Released March 15, 2010. (USA, 2009, color, 98 min plus additional materials)     Reviewed on March 15, 2010 by Eric Gonzalez exclusively for [...].
B0028RXXFC|4.0|Enough has been said about the high quality series, but the packaging of the disks needs some help.  The book looks good but to have to slide Blu Ray disk into a heavy, tight paper sleeve could easily damage the disks.  Higher priority should be placed on protecting the item when spending this amount of money.  This is an item that a person will want to hold on to for years to come.
B000000WA4|5.0|i cannot write a detailed analysis like the other people on here have. i don't know much about the structure of songwriting other than how the finished product makes me feel.    this album changed my life.    please listen to it.
B00365YVRO|3.0|As a lifelong follower of Sade I hate to say that this long anticipated album is a complete dud for me minus the hit track and Moon and the Sky. It's very slow and there is a missing interaction with the band. I always looked forward to her playful interaction with the horn section which I think is a trademark of her music. There is nothing upbeat about this album minus SOL. Hey! I get it. Sade is getting older and the music definately reflects that but I expected more than one song to jump off like \\"Paradise\\" but it didn't happen. Love you Sade but this album just didn't cut it for me. Lover's Rock which is down beat blow's this album away! The only saving grace on this album is Soldier of Love! Excellent! Still, I'll be a lifelong fan! The woman is a true underrated (in the U.S.) artist and beautiful to boot! Hope you put more albums out Sade cause I'll buy to listen.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When this series came out I watched the pilot episodes and laughed so hard that my housemate thought that there was something wrong with me.  I could completely identify with every character in this sitcom and found a very synchronous connection between the characters, the living spaces and work environment and what I had experienced in my life in a former job.  Sheldon's overt Asperger's Syndrome adds an element of humor that allows us to laugh at \\"smart\\" people without feeling uncomfortable and out of line.  The timing, writing and character development is done very well on this show and it just continues to blossom from one season to the next.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new, quirky sitcom that turns science on it's head at times .... you may find yourself enjoying \\"The Big Bang  Theory\\" the way I did those first episodes.  I remember laughing so hard I thought I was going to break a rib.  The newness and very succinct humor really got me good.  If you work in a science background and among scientists ... you will find humor in this great show.<br /><br />I love it!
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Avatar  Not quite new.  While the movie Avatar has originality it is nothing new.  The movie did not live up to the expected hype.  The CGI is nothing new.  Motion capture has been used in Lord of the Rings and The Polar Express, not to mention many others like Appleseed.  Granted, a new camera was designed to captured facial expressions.    Sustains    Avatar was visually stunning.  The environments were beautiful to look at and vehicles and creatures fit seamlessly into world that James Cameron created.  There were elements of character development that are needed in any film, the whole good vs. evil complex.  It is a fun movie with elements of adventure.  Lack of a sex scene.  While there was an intimate moment, the audience did not get the actual act that so many movies go with.  By itself this deserves two thumbs up because movies with a sex scene tend to ruin the movie.  Implying is perfectly acceptable, since it is a naturally occurring event, but the audience does not need to see the actual act in progress.    Improves    While visually captivated, the movie relied too heavily upon it.  Hope that visual elements would drive the scenes.  It relied too heavily on the scale of the environment to build epic scenes.    The movie did not possess the drama and suspense necessary for vital scenes.  At the beginning the audience gets a sense of the tensions between the humans and Na'vi when a mining truck goes by with large arrows sticking out of the side.  The scene is about five seconds long and does not build up the hostilities both sides have for each other.  Instead of telling the audience that this planet is extremely hostile (Grace tells Jake at one point), show it!    Plot line.  The plot proceeded too quickly; it felt like it was rushed.  The movie hits the ground running and does not stop to let the audience breath.  Maybe it should have spanned two movies.  While the movie is two hours and forty minutes it could have been better if it followed Lord of theRings and lasted for three hours.  The movie tended to act as a roller coaster, moving really quick and wanting more when it was over.  In this case not more because it was awe-inspiring, but more content to expand and explore the story.    There is a lack of character development.  The main character Jake does not even think twice before joining the Na'vi (the indigenous population on the moon Pandora).  He feels no remorse when he scouted out Hometree (a giant tree that the Na'vi live inside) and gave the intelligence necessary to bring it down.  Nor does he have any remorse for becoming a traitor to his own species.  He feels more remorse for the fact that his girlfriend is disappointed in him than the fact he helped the destruction of their home.  Another scene later on in the movie is when Jake meets Neytiri (the main female character) for the first time.  She tells him he has a good heart, but she only has known him for about three minutes after she saved him from Viperwolves.  Hardly any dialogue is expressed at this point, so the characters do not know each other that well.  Colonel Quaritch is seen to be this evil war mongering soldier.  The only title he deserves is soldier.  All he was doing was his job, the corporate executives failed in their negotiations and all that was left was the military option.  Colonel Quaritch was one of the better characters who actually stayed loyal to his job and his race.    It is okay to base characters off real civilizations.  However, James Cameron goes too far with similarities.  The Na'vi hit the audience over the head with a bat that they are like Native Americans, mimicking their actions and vocalizations almost seamlessly.  It was like watching Last of the Mohicans in space.    Soundtracks are supposed to be created for one movie.  While James Horner is a fantastic composer you hear too many of other movies in this soundtrack.  During the track to Climbing Up \\"Iknimaya\\" - The Path To Heaven\\" you can hear smidgeons of the soundtrack Glory track Preparations for Battle.  Glory was composed by James Horner.  During the track The Destruction Of Hometree there is the distinctive ambiance to the movie Enemy at the Gates composed by James Horner.  The audience should not be thinking of other movies when they are watching it.    If Unobtainium was the only resource that could preserve the Earth, then the humans would have utilized more destructive tactics.    Content rating.  The movie seemed to try to connect with too many viewer ages.  It was not afraid to show someone getting smashed by a block of explosives, yet there was no blood when a character gets shot several times.     Final Rating and Closing Elements  This movie deserves 3 to 4 stars (say 3.5 stars for averaging) and is worth seeing at least once.  It is not one of James Cameron's best and is maybe a bridge for better movies to come; after all he has been out of the loop since Titanic, a twelve year span.  The movie had and has great potential, so everyone will hopefully see when the next one comes out since the actors are singed on for two more movies.
0812973992|3.0|From an interview with Colum McCann in the back of the book, it seems like he's quite a decent fellow, so I'll raise a toast to him.  (I've also enjoyed some of his earlier work.)  And the characters in this novel are certainly decent also: despite their quirks and weaknesses, it's hard not to root for every one of them.  But I'm afraid that my best wishes for both the author and his characters don't help my response to the book itself--which is, to put it simply, that I found it boring.  I honestly had to work and work to finish this novel.  I won't rehearse the plot of the book since you can find it in other reviews, but I think the conception (imagining the day of Philippe Petit's walk between the towers) was fantastic.  The characters, as noted above, cry out for our sympathy.  The ending is sweet.  But somehow the whole piece, the way it tries to show the \\"two degrees of separation\\" that hold together a city, never holds together itself.  In trying to manipulate the characters and their relationships through the complexity of their lives and this particular day, the novel feels more arranged than heartfelt: characters seem to have functions in a plot rather than lives in our imaginations.  Scenes end up sounding like \\"set pieces,\\" where the prose sounds self-involved and the characters consequently artificial.  Some tumble into stereotypes, and others seem less than complete (e.g., one character is said to belong to a religious organization simply referred to as the \\"Order,\\" as if this were a Dan Brown novel.  Religious orders have particular names and identities, even if imaginary ones, so why not fill us in on this?).  The shadow of the Twin Towers haunts this book, but the poignancy of this real event isn't enough to sustain a poignancy in the book's imagined ones.
B0012GMV58|5.0|With WELCOME, his fifth album with the Santana band, guitarist-leader Carlos Santana continues to embrace both jazz-rock fusion and spirituality. Along with the Allman Brothers Band's instrumental tour de force \\"Jessica\\", this album is an example of what jazz-rock fusion groups SHOULD have aspired to in the mid-70s, instead of going for a \\"fuzak\\" sound and style a la Dave Grusin. WELCOME is a very spiritual CD that will mean something to you whether you're Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Unitarian, Muslim, Baha'i, Hindu, or something else entirely. This CD is a must-own for any Santana fan and/or spiritual seeker.
B003102JDM|4.0|I can't recall such disparate reviews for a film - which is, I suppose, not surprising, given the subject matter and the often-polarizing Coen brothers.  For every film they've made that has received nearly universal acclaim (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), they've made one that either inflames or frustrates or just leaves many scratching their heads (Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Big Lebowski - yes, remember this film was panned when it first came out, before it attained its now-legendary cult status).  I wouldn't call this my favorite Coen brothers film by any stretch, but I found it a remarkably well-told, fascinating story, filled with the usual vivid assortment of Coen characters.  For me, whatever flaws it may have are infinitely offset by the wonderfully skewed view of people that the Coens present - no one else makes films like this, and A Serious Man is most certainly cut from the same odd ream of cloth the rest of the Coen milieu comes from.  Just to see Sy tell Larry that he believes it's important at times to count to ten - and then to have Sy literally do that very thing, out loud and then sliently - is, to me, what makes a Coen brothers film so funny and so compelling.  I'd say the same for the scene where the Korean student's dad confronts Larry in his driveway; it's funny because it's uncomfortable and awkward and a trifle disconcerting.  In any case, I would never suggest that this is a film for everyone - the reviews here certainly bear that out.  But I don't understand why some would say it's anti-Semitic, or that you have to be Jewish to relate to it, or that it doesn't tell us anything new about its subject matter.  I think many are simultaneously reading too much and not enough into the film.  And I suspect the Coens are perfectly fine with that, since I doubt seriously they expected this film to be embraced universally.  And I think that's why they make such great films - they make what they want to make, and let the proverbial chips fall where they may.  Thank goodness for that.
1423101472|5.0|This whole series is great!   My 10 y/o son wanted me to read it after he read the series over Christmas break. I thought it would be a more child based book.  I was plesantly suprised that it was good read for people older then 15y/o.  It is a very easy read from one book to the next!  Wish more was written in the series.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since the '80s and it was wonderful to see it again. The picture quality was great and after a slew of movies that have been ruined by \\"improvements\\" to the graphics it was quite refreshing to find it unmucked with.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|Saw III -Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Be prepared to cry....  From the very beginning this movie tugs at your heart & pulls at all your emotional strings. You'll laugh, you'll smile, you'll cry & cry some more! REALLY you will!   Every animal lover & especially dog lover should see this movie.   I gave this DVD to my father & I came home to find him in the basement by himself bawling his eyes out.  Really a touching story of love & loyalty. An A+

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This series has no equal. It is due in large part to the thoughtfulness and competent assembly and editing of a huge amount of archival footage. The fact that many of the protagonists, British, German, Japanese and American were still alive to be interviewed was most fascinating. Some of those interviews were absolute coups, such Himmler's adjutant. No amount of documentary film replaces real study, but for getting a lead on a subject one would want to pursue further, this collection is the best live index on the subject of the Second World War I know.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|*Sigh* After speaking my piece here, I'm going to seriously consider writing nothing but positive reviews for awhile, because given my short review history, some people might think I'm just a 'Negative Nelly' type of guy. But nothing could be further from the truth. I'm not the type of person who's hard to please. My wife and I spend so much money in Blockbuster, we should own a controlling interest in that company, and out of the slew of horror movies we buy, I would rate at least 75% of them decent and watchable. But whenever a hyped-to-the-moon-and-back, umpolished turd like this is thrust upon an unsuspecting and gullible movie going public, my hackles rise, and I feel an overwhelming sense of duty (for lack of a better term) to warn people.    Another reviewer said it better than I ever could, when he (or she) said this movie really shook his (or her) confidence in 'professional critics'. I'll just stick with the 'Joe Six Pack' reviews from here on out.    Now, onto the movie.    I'm so incredibly sick and tired of all the \\"You have to use your imagination!\\" type horror movies that have been polluting Hollywood ever since 'The Blair Witch Project' was released. Note to any 'professional film makers' who may possibly read this for feedback: When we (the movie going public) walk into a theater to see your movie, or go to Blockbuster to buy it, were are plonking our hard-earned dollars down for YOU to entertain us. YOU are the one making the movie, not us. If I want to 'use my imagination', I'll read a book. (and yes, I do actually read, alot) What movies like these are doing would have been tantamount to someone asking a New Orleans Saints fan to buy a ticket to the Super Bowl, go to the game, then put on a blindfold, insert a pair of ear plugs, and imagine the game being played, instead of...you know...actually watching it. Or asking the same fan to wait until the last 45 seconds of the game before entering the stadium.     This movie was painful. BORING. Let'swatch the camera watch the couple sleeping. Let's watch the camera record a door moving back and forth. Let's watch the camera record the couple bickering. But the plot THICKENS!!! Let's hear mysterious 'bumps in the night!' Let's hear the girl scream for no reason! Let's watch the testosterone-having boyfriend challenge the demon to show itself and fight, like a ten year old schoolboy trying to impress his ten year old girlfriend! Rinse, lather, repeat. Until the last few seconds of the movie.    I thought 'The Blair Witch Project' was bad, but that movie was like 'The Exorcist' compared to this. And to make things 1,000x worse, this movie is a blatant, brazen, completely SHAMELESS rip-off of 'TBWP'.    Sorry, but if you're reading this, and you're one of the people who actually found this scary, I feel sorry for you. And for God's sake, whatever you do, don't ever watch 'The Muppets Take Manhatten', because that movie will literally scare you to death then.    I could rock'n'roll all day long and all night about how bad this movie is, but I've wasted far too much time, breath, and electricity on this review already.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Great movie for any Jane Austen fan! Do not attempt viewing without a working knowledge of Pride and Prejudice!
B002WCLG3O|4.0|As a big fan of the halo universe, i really enjoyed these shorts.  the animation was good or great in all of them.  the stories were lovely little peaks into the coolest parts of the halo mythos.  i only wish there was a longer form, heavier plot piece.  i hope we see more of this kind of thing from bungie/343 studios.
B00328G4V6|3.0|I am sorry but this album is extremely subpar.  I had hoped to have purchased a Hendrix album that would sorta fill the gap between Electric Ladyland (1968) and First Rays,South Saturn Delta, Cry Of Love, etc (1970).  You know, something in my large Hendrix discography that I could put 1969 to and be happy with.  Boy was I wrong.  I own most every Hendrix album that has ever been released and this is just a way for Hendrix LLC. (Jimi Hendrix's greedy half sister...read Room Full of Mirrors Bio) to make another buck.  I give it three stars and not one because, c'mon its JIMI.  The few songs that are on Are You Experienced should not be on here at all.  Yeah it is nice to hear a different take on Stone Free but it is so inferior to the original.  Overall, I truly believe that the Hendrix vaults are being raped to make money and that Jimi would never have wanted this album to come out this way.  I would be rolling in my grave.  Would have made a better EP than LP or Box Set material.  I hate to say it because I love the man's music so much. Ships Passing is basically Nightbird Flying...Mr. Bad Luck, Look Over Yonder...Lullaby For The Summer, Ezy Rider and so forth....so yeah these tracks are hardly \\"newly released.\\"  Just buy the Valleys of Neptune 7\\" single or download the title track off of Itunes.  Wish I hadn't have had such high hopes.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|I am listening to Plastic Beach more and more the past few days and it's growing on me. Yes, it's exactly what you would expect from the Gorillaz...awesome, creative and just plain good!<br />Demon Days and the self titled Gorillaz album would rank higher than the new release, but I wouldn't be surprised if Plastic Beach crept up to No.2 over time.<br />The album finishes pretty strong with tracks like 'On Melancholy Hill', 'Plastic Beach' and 'Pirate Jet' but has some other below average tracks like 'Sweepstakes' and 'Cloud of Unknowing' which is probably my least favored songs on the album, even though they feature Bobby Womack and Mos Def...<br />Of course the first single 'Stylo' gives a lot of mileage and will continue for a while. Some other surprise songs like 'Empire Ants' and 'Superfast JellyFish' make this album very unexpectedly pleasant.<br />Overall, plenty of originality from previous Gorillaz albums, which in itself is exemplary. I want to give this album 3.5/5 but Amazon only let's me do 3 or 4, so I had to go with 4, keeping future times in mind!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|This is a really great album.  I listened to their first one til I wore it out and this is the same.  I esp love track 6 and 7.  Beautiful singing, soothing, kool.  Just great stuff on par or better than their first album.
B002WCLG48|1.0|I was very unhappy with this movie.both Dvd's were scratched.I would have sent it back but that's like pulling teeth considering i still haven't been refunded for something i bought that i never received from Christmas of 08!
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This movie is so adorable I was smiling the whole time I watched it.  I watched it in the original Japanese with subtitles, and I highly recommend watching it that way.  I watched a little of the english dub and I was not impressed.  But, back to the movie itself.  The music is great, the animation is spectacular.  I love Myasaki...ever since I was a kid.  Nausicaa was the one I grew up on but Ive seen almost all of his movies.  This one is more towards kids like Totoro but this is even better than Totoro!  It is very enchanting like a disney movie but of course better.  The music reminded me of disney a bit, in a great way, like sleeping beauty or snow white.  Such a great movie, buy it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|She started late and does not have the overdubbings of an Enya recording.  She has simplicity and  the potential to be another Barbra Steisand. Her choice of materials suit her voice as a performer rather than an opera singer.
0307346617|1.0|I got this book for Christmas and previously had no experience with zombie literature. If this book is considered \\"very good\\" by zombie afficiandos, as it would appear from the majority of the reviews, this is certianly a genre I should avoid. I found the writing to be boring, the delivery choppy and the theme far too preachy. Moreover, the book was filled with inconsistencies. At Yonkers, the zombies are aggresive and over run the military. Later, they are so lethargic that one just whacks them with a shovel to kill them. As always, I read it to the end to see if it got better. In retospect, I wished I had stopped half way through and started a good book. Don't waste your time on this one.
1423119509|4.0|This book shipped fast. Arrived with no dents on the box. Great book collection for young readers. My 13-year-old daughter loves it.
0393072231|1.0|I would love to read \\"The Big Short\\" on my Kindle for $9.99. As a recent Kindle owner, I'm never buying a non e-book again. I enjoy reading Lewis's work, but his publisher needs to get with the program.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|I purchase this movie used it was in great condition  and the price was great.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Great movie! I watched \\"Once\\" in the theatre when it first came out, and loved it so much, that I told everyone I knew back then who could really appreciate a smart movie, to see it. Now I own it can see it and share it whenever I want.
6305428042|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was Twelve and I've been hooked ever since.I haven't met many people that had any negative things to say about this film,most everyone I've shown this movie to has liked or loved it. I do agree with most people posting here,this movie is very underrated compared to a lot of films in it's genre.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is the second album from the legendary Rainbow and sees the classic line up that went on to record the magnificent \\"Rainbow Live\\". Cosy Powell has been drafted in to play alongside Jimmy Bain to form the rhythm section from Hell and most of the tracks are centred around the myth and legend that brings out the best in Dio's masterful lyrics. There is no weak point on this album but if you had to nominate one track then it has to be \\"Stargazer\\", which is eight and a half minutes of pure musical heaven, and still sends shivers down the spine even thirty (!) years since you first heard it. God knows what Blackmore, Dio and company are doing nowadays, but for this critic they never surpassed this. As for Cosy Powell, God rest you mate, there'll never be another.
0143034901|5.0|Beautifully written.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Spanish literature.  I like short chapters so that I can fit them in a busy life and hate leaving chapters in the middle.  This book is written in such a way.  The only problem is that I hate to put it down in order to do that which must be done.  Too bad life gets in the way of reading........especially with THE SHADOW OF THE WIND.
B003162R7E|5.0|Back in the day I had a lot of these songs on The Essential Jimi Hendrix LP's.  It's great to finally hear these songs again for such a great price. I watched the DVD once already...probably won't watch it again anytime soon although Eddie Kramer offers interesting insight to Jimi's music and creative genius.  It's cool hearing the guitar tracks seperated one by one and then everything coming together.  Jimi's songwriting and playing was at a different level and the melodies of his guitar will stay with you and never grow old. The music is timeless!! If you don't have these songs already do yourself a favor and buy this!  Jimi's music was a gift for us to enjoy!!!
0471267554|4.0|I started a Paleo diet around 3 months ago after researching it. I've benefited greatly from the change in eating habits as a result of this. Since Cordain is typically associated with Paleo style diets I figured I should start with this book. While the book does offer up an overall foundation for Paleo eating, it is often time filled with opinion based information (such as tossing in our supposed evolution from monkeys as if it were fact) and many other opinions. However as the intro to the book states: \\"THIS BOOK REPRESENTS the culmination of my lifelong interest in the link between diet and health, and of my fascination with anthropology and human origins...\\" and as such the book is written from that perspective.     A previous reviewer stated that the book lacked research sources to back up some of the claims, however the book contains 20 pages of sources cited many of which are studies and/or research done that relates to the topic matter. Though I will say that the book needs to have footnotes or otherwise label the content with the associated resource so the reader can easily review it as they read the book.    The content of the book on a whole offers some solid reasoning and ideas regarding why the Paleo diet is clearly a much better solution compared to how most Americans eat. However this book is not a definitive guide for all things Paleo, and as such the reader should use this book as a stepping stone for a Paleo diet. I would recommend this book especially for the price as it does contain some very good info for would be Paleo dieters.
B0035V35PI|4.0|If you're planning on going over the top there can be but one destination... NINJA ASSASSIN.<br /><br />Despite having one of the most redundant movie titles ever, this joint is an express train to Badassvill. NINJA ASSASSIN is exactly what a ninja flick is supposed to be, precisely what every 80's ninja flick wanted to be and totally what I'd have done if I made ninja flicks. Geysers of ninja blood not medically feasible, cascades of ninja shuriken* blocking out the light and an acid trip of ninja martial arts unseen since The Matrix await you.<br /><br />Is there a ninja story? Ninja please!<br /><br />If you're put off by brutal ninja training flashbacks, supernatural ninja powers, forbidden ninja love, ninja betrayal, ninja vengeance and plenty of tough-guy ninja glaring, go watch the notebook sissy-pants cuz NINJA ASSASSIN is going to sneak up and kick you in the girly parts in a completely unsneaky way.<br /><br />DO NOT watch this movie with people who presume to know anything about ninjas, historically minded ass-tards that can't just enjoy stuff or female companions who have ever said \\"I don't get it.\\" during a movie.<br /><br />Ninja.<br /><br />*I must note that the shuriken in this movie aren't the credit card thin coaster sized hunks of crap you'd buy at the local dirt mall form the creepy guy. NO SIR! These things are armor piercing hub caps that make a noise in flight like a P-51's prop coming loose sound like a damn tire iron when they hit something.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is such a fun spoof on \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  I've watched it three times!  The DVD arrived in great shape.
0316017922|4.0|We all know that being in the right place at the right time has a lot to do with success.  Malcolm Gladwell gives us lots of examples, the first of which is about being born in the right month if you aspire to professional hockey in Canada.  He also stresses the importance of ambition, hard work, and the influences that shape our lives.  The most disturbing section has to do with cultural influences and the devastating airline tragedies that occurred partly because of a co-pilot who was overly deferential to the captain and to air traffic controllers.  The author often reminds us that it's not necessary to be exceedingly smart to be successful; it's just necessary to be smart enough.  He gives the example of a man whose IQ is in the 190s but didn't finish college because of his inability to negotiate a class schedule that would allow him to continue.  In contrast, another man attempted to murder a professor and still went on to become immensely successful.  Near the end, he takes a linguistic approach to explaining one of the reasons Asians excel at math.  I had never really considered how the English language makes arithmetic more difficult than it needs to be.  He also presents a strong case for year-round school.
B003BLE88U|4.0|There are so many posthumous Hendrix recordings out there it borderlines on blasphemy. The novice Hendrix listener might not \\"experience\\" Jimi Hendrix for what he really was...one, if not the greatest, rock guitarists of all time. For those who are just getting into what Hendrix was about, this album is NOT for you. Grab \\"Are You Experienced\\", \\"Axis Bold As Love\\" and   Electric Ladyland\\". Trust me, those albums will BLOW YOUR MIND! \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\" however, is an album for the truly devoted Hendrix fan. What I like most about this album is it's rawness. It's like being in the studio with Hendrix while he's just having fun and jamming. And who wouldn't want to buy THAT ticket? The sound quality is superb, and the basic tracks haven't been ruined like some other posthumous releases, like on \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Midnight Lightning\\", where random studio musicians actually OVERDUBBED over the original tracks. (Alan Douglas...you should be ashamed of yourself.) On this album however, I'm glad this has been released, and I do not feel like it's a rip-off to make money. There is quality stuff here.     Track By Track:   1.) Stone Free - Basicly an alternate version of the original. I prefer the original, but this is a fun and interesting listen.     2.) Valleys Of Neptune - I'm not a fan of this song, and I doubt it would ever have been released on an actual Hendrix approved album. If so, it would have been MUCH more orchestrated, perhaps like 1983 (A Merman I Should Turn To Be) from Electric Ladyland. Still, it's great hearing Hendrix' in his writing process.     3.) Bleeding Heart - I LOVE THIS VERSION. It's the best studio version I've heard. The version from \\"War Heroes\\" just didn't have the bite and rawness that this classic blues tune deserves. Hendrix kicks into this version hard and heavy from the start. Fantastic guitar work here, and a great variation on the original vocal approach.     4.) Hear My Train A Comin' - Most Hendrix fans will tell you Hendrix' 12 string acoustic version is the best, and they would be correct...but this electric version is really nice also. I have a version from a live LP called \\"The Jimi Hendrix Concerts\\" that I feel is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but this is a great listen as well, and once again the guitar playing is other-worldly.     5.) Mr. Bad Luck - There was another version of this song called \\"Look Over Yonder\\". I'm not a fan of this song or either version. This is not Hendrix' best song writing by a long shot, but still...it's Jimi Hendrix on guitar.     6.) Sunshine Of Your Love - Hendrix was a major Clapton fan and he did this song instrumentally with The Experience many times live, and it was a staple of his live shows. It's finally nice to hear a studio jam of this song. It has become my favorite version, and the guitar playing is VERY NICE!     7.) Lover Man - Again, a song Hendrix performed live many times. This studio take is nothing short of amazing, and is a fresh approach to the song. Again, it has become my favorite version.     8.) Ships Passing In The Night - This is actually a slowed down bluesy version of \\"Night Bird Flying\\", but only a true Hendrix head would hear that. Again...this has become my favorite version of \\"Night Bird Flying\\". Why it's called \\"Ships Passing In The Night\\" on the album is beyond me. I'm hoping they didn't change the name to make it seem like a new song. It isn't, but it IS a totally different approach to the way \\"Night Bird Flying\\" was eventually released.     9.) Fire - Nice alternate version, and GREAT drumming, but the original is much better.     10.) Red House - I have a plethora of \\"Red House\\" live versions, and they all bring something unique to the table. This alternate studio version is very nice also, with some great blues licks of course, but with no real new surprises. The major problem with this version is that the final verse is faded out, without any \\"I know her sister will!\\" lyric at all. Highly anti-climatic to saythe least.     11.) Lullaby For Summer - Once again I am baffled why this song is named \\"Lullaby For Summer\\" on this album. It's basicly a jam based off the opening riff to \\"Ezy Rider\\", with some very cool hook riffs thrown in the middle section. The thing is...IT ABSOLUTELY ROCKS! \\"Ezy Rider\\" was never one of my favorite Hendrix songs, but I am BLOWN AWAY by this instrumental jam version! I can't praise it enough.     12.) Crying Blue Rain - A VERY nice bluesy jam. I love the guitar tone. The only drawback with this track is that I believe it loses it's \\"blues mood\\" when the band speeds it up towards the end. But still...just wonderful guitar playing.     Bonus Tracks:     13.) Trash Man - This is actually the instrumental \\"Midnight\\" sped up just a bit. Great licks and a nice version...but the original has much more feel in my opinion.     14.) Slower Version - A nice instrumental jam. However, the sound quality doesn't seem to match the rest of the album, and the guitar tone seems very overdriven. Still, Hendrix' guitar playing shines brightly on this track.     There will probably be more posthumous releases to follow, but who knows if there will EVER be another Jimi Hendrix CD release of unreleased material as strong as this one. So to me, it's like Christmas came early. I hope this review helps in your decision to purchase this CD. If you already own the Hendrix classics, and you are like me and CRAVE to hear more, then I HIGHLY recommend you buy this album TODAY!
0345494768|5.0|As I was poking through my tattered Star Wars scrapbook (dated February 15, 1978 - age 9), complete with triple-digit membership number for the original Star Wars Fan Club, and including a signed photo of Mark Hamill, I recognized again that I am truly a Star Wars geek by any measure.  I may not know the middle names of the Lucas grandchildren, or still have legions of stormtrooper action figures in their original packaging, but I do know me some Star Wars.<br /><br />Short and sweet: this book exceeds my greatest expectations in both the depth and relevance of information, and the quality of writing.  The large coffee table book format is a little obnoxious (reading it's a bit like wrestling a gundark), but frankly the quality of the content would make almost any production sin forgivable.  This book is clearly a labor of love, and from one Star Wars fan to another I can only recommend it with the most hearty enthusiasm.
1416594787|5.0|I found this book to be well informed. Dawkins knows greatly of what he is talking about. This book is not as much of an attacking on creationist as his previous work in \\"God Delusion,\\" but was more focused on a continuation and support that Evolution does occur.     An interesting perspective Dawkins brings up about the notion of theories, was \\"the Earth being round,\\" \\"Photosynthesis,\\" and \\"plate tectonics\\" are all examples of theories that no one hardly questions anymore, these theories are now incorporated into our every day lives as accepted things that happen, yet they still have the term theory attached to them. This is an interesting argument that Dawkins brings up to those who question the factual nature of \\"Just a theory,\\" which I found to be fascinating.     Another fine example of how Evolution is occurring right now in viewable evidence is the E. coli experiment being done at Michigan State University. Which showed after 20,000 generations in E. coli that a particular strain developed the ability to feed on citric acid in an agler petri dishes, which was explained as unheard of for E. coli to do.    I highly recommend reading this book it is an excellent companion to Darwin's On the Origins of Species.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|First off if you're considering buying this movie don't pay attention to all the negative reviews, it's just that \\"they\\" wanted it to be exactly the same and it is and it isn't. The first Boondock Saints movie is number two on my favorite movies list behind The Dark Knight so I had high expectations for this one and my expectations were met. A sidekick made sense and Clifton Collins Jr. was pretty awesome as Romeo. The action is top notch and Sean and Norman were fantastic in this one as well.<br /><br />The sequel took along time to come to fruition and it is well worth it. Anybody who says the Boondock Saints II is too late is not a real Boondock fan. I would have waited impatiently another ten years if I had too. Just be grateful we got another movie. Hopefully there will be a Boondock Saints III sometime in the near future. This movie is superb. The action is stellar, the quips are really funny, and the plot is good not great but the ending gives us something to look forward considering some truly powerful forces are seemingly now behind the Saints and what they do.<br /><br />Romeo's crying again. HAHAHA!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I watched Ms. Boyle on TV when she appeared on I beleive it was  Talent Search where she froze on camera and couldn't continue.  My heart went out to her.  That happened to me once and it was called then and now \\"stage fright\\".  When I  accidentily ran accross the cd on Amazon I decided to purchase it.  I sure glad I did.  The lady has talent and she should be heard.  So far I haven't heard it played on any station that we have, here in central Arkansas.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Everything that this prior reviewer has said about Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is spot on. This is what Sherlock Holmes was supposed to be if ever adapted into a feature film. Robert Downey Jr. either really did a critical read of the stories or he had somebody explain them to him very carefully and patiently because his acting is very similar to what you read on paper. He even had many of the mannerisms and meter down pact. This was a solid vision that Guy Richie had and he executed it well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was all the CGI which looked awesome but maybe the movie didn't need so much. Just my opinion. However those that were expecting a watered down Holmes should really read the stories and do some critical analysis and you will be surprised how wrong you are.

B0035YDM9E|3.0|This is a well written discussion of the current financial crisis by a liberal economics professor. He says that the Bush and Obama administrations have both funneled way too much money to the various failing financial institutions; their goal has been to just muddle through and hope that these zombie institutions revive on their own before the crisis gets worse. If this approach doesn't work, these institutions will fail and worse will follow. Prof. Stiglitz wants much more regulation and government involvement to prevent future problems, but he wants the banks and those who ran them into the ground to go bankrupt. All excellent ideas. Personally, if I were in power. I am not sure that I would have had the guts to tell AIG, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc. to all file bankruptcy within a month or so of each other. And I don't think the US political system is capable of agreeing on any sort of major change of the sort Prof. Stiglitz recommends.<br /><br />Prof. Stiglitz also describes the long list of underlying economic problems the US faces; trade and government deficits, poor educational performance, the need for new energy sources, the aging population, endless increases in health care costs, etc. All in all, it's a long and ugly list.<br /><br />And a larger question arises about any list of suggestions about how to restructure the economy. If we were smart and disciplined enough to devise and enact a comprehensive list of reforms, no matter what they were, we wouldn't have gotten into this mess in the first place.
0765318741|4.0|First and foremost, anyone considering buying this book -- I speak specifically of the trade paperback edition with Will Smith on the cover -- should be advised:  the first half of the book is the short novel \\"I AM LEGEND\\" and the second half is a collection of unrelated short stories by Richard Matheson.  Nothing on the cover, title page, preface, etc. clues you in to that fact.  In the front matter, if you look carefully, you'll see all the stories listed with different copyright dates.  That's the only hint that the 300+ pages of this book are not entirely devoted to a full-length novel entitled \\"I AM LEGEND.\\"<br /><br />That out of the way, I enjoyed this.  The novella (@ 150 pages... maybe 30,000 words) \\"I AM LEGEND\\" was interesting.  It's much more about human isolation than monster-fighting, with Robert Neville as a bi-polar Robinson Crusoe rather than a cheeky tough-guy Will Smith.  I'm not a big horror fan, but Matheson is one of the granddaddies of the genre, and you can see why here.  His writing is taut and engaging, with human pathos and creepy scares woven together.  The short stories tucked in here give you a nice overview of his work -- from the comic to the disturbing -- again making it clear why the likes of Stephen King and Dean Koontz worship at Matheson's altar.<br /><br />One wonders why the publisher felt they needed to hide (no other word for it) the fact that this book is an anthology and not a singular novel.  If you like the Will Smith movie and want to read the book, would you really be put off by seeing \\"...and Other Stories\\" on the cover?  Sadly, that may well be true.  Short stories simply do not sell like novels.  Too bad, because if -- like me -- you don't know much about Richard Matheson, this book, with its famous short novel and lesser-known short stories, is an excellent intro.<br /><br />-  mattmchugh

B001GCUO5M|4.0|Here is a film that would be decidedly mediocre if not for Scorsese's deft ability to craft elegant/unsettling atmosphere. The movie writhes with tension, conjuring up images of Kubrick at top form (the Shining comes to mind more than once). The visuals are sleek and appropriately chilling. The sound design is masterful (a consistently unsettling horn signals danger). The suspense is palpable. I would recommend it fully, despite the ending revelation being a bit obvious. There is little blood and gore, relying instead on macabre imagery and good old fashioned scare-tactics (mood lighting, a scary storm, dark mental hospital environs). There is some violence in the form of WWII flashbacks that do a lot to characterize Leo's oddball protagonist. Overall, a scary, somewhat depressing showcase of supreme tension from a master of the art form.

B00005JLD4|5.0|The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is about the Aborigines indigenous people in Australia. A man they call Mr. Neville ran an office that took Aborigines half- caste children from their families because of their mixed race. The main characters are three girls who are taken from their families at very young ages, to be taken to a camp where they are to learn proper manners and learn how speak English and pray. Molly, the oldest, is a very important role model for the other two girls because she is a little wiser and she has bravery enough for the three of them. The girls decide that they don't like it in the camp, so Molly finds an opportunity to escape. They ran and ran for miles and stopped along the way to get food from good people, and kept on going.   At one point, they ran across a man who told Gracie that her mother was in a different town, and that she could get to that town by train at the next stop. At first, Gracie believes Molly when she says that he is lying, and follows. Then a few minutes later, she turns around and starts to head for the train station. Molly and the youngest girl keep going along the Rabbit Proof Fence and eventually turn around to go look for Gracie. They find her sitting at the train station and just as she starts to walk toward the two girls, a car comes out of nowhere and takes her away. At the end of the movie, the remaining girls find their way home and are reunited with their families. After they grew up and had children, they were taken away again, along with the children, and she escaped and walked all the way home a second time. Mr. Neville was in control of the Aborigines kids in Australia until the 1970's.   I think this movie relates to world religions because it shows how punished the indigenous people were and how they weren't allowed to practice their own religions for a very long time. In some cases, as in this movie, they weren't even allowed to be with their families. Now, their culture suffers because there is no culture left. I think that indigenous people were treated horribly in the past, and since this didn't stop until the 1970's in Australia, there is no telling where else it is going on in the world.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|At the beginning of the movie, Gandhi was in South Africa working as an attorney. He was well dressed, yet not very well-spoken. In one of the first scenes, he was thrown off a train because a \\"colored person\\" wasn't allowed to ride in the 1st class section, even though he had a ticket. In my opinion, that is what started Gandhi's quest to free his people, and decided to go back to India where he was from. He went around India meeting with people who wanted to be freed from the British Empire's rule, and thus formed an alliance that preached non-violence. It worked very well at first- Indian's would gather and listen to Gandhi speak about how they could gain independence. One of the main ways they made the British soldiers look bad to the rest of the world was when they tried to raid the salt mill. The significance in this was that the salt was gained from the Indian Ocean, and thus belonged to the Indians. When they would walk up to the gate, the British soldiers would beat them down and the Indians never fought back, making them look cruel and harsh to the rest of the world.   Eventually, Britain left India on good terms with the Indians, although civil war started to break out. There were Hindus and Muslims living in India, and they couldn't get along. Gandhi started to fast and people eventually started to see the light, and stop fighting. I'm assuming that from all of this, it is how Pakistan became a country but I am not positive. By the end of the movie, Gandhi convinced everyone to stop the fighting and live as brothers. He was on his way to Pakistan to meet with the officials when he was shot. It was a very sad ending to a great story.   I think this movie related to world religions because it shows how people who practice different religions sometimes don't get along if they are living close together. Peace can be accomplished if everyone has Gandhi's outlook on life and non-violence. In this particular movie, Muslims and Hindus were living in India and there was so much hate between the two groups, it eventually led to rioting and a civil war that almost destroyed the whole country. By the end though, everything was worked out- not to say that there isn't any animosity between the groups. I loved this movie because of the passion the Gandhi had for other people, and the impact that one man can make on an entire country.
B002OEUZP0|5.0|The Blu release is not yet available here in the States for another 6 months according to [...], so when my dad and I saw that there was a Canadian release we jus couldn't wait for it.<br /><br />Video: 8/10<br />The movie resolution is in 1080i, but it's a good transfer. Now because of it's higher resolution some of CG scenes are WAY noticeable and can look a bit \\"cartoony\\" but that shouldn't hold you back much.<br /><br />Audio: 9/10<br />The movie has three tracks consisting of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 5.1 Dolby Digital for English and a 5.1 Dolby Digital in Francais (French). I listened to both English tracks and they are very crisp and clear. The DTS-HD MA track will have you excited in some of the more action or suspense scenes. A good scene to listen for is towards the end when the planet is falling a part and the Jupiter 2 is flying through the planet.<br /><br />Bonus Material:N/A<br />There is NONE what so ever. Not that big of a deal breaker for me as I just wanted to see this movie from my childhood past.<br /><br />Summarize:<br />In the end it's a good deal.

B002XMGGK6|4.0|From the DVD slipcover:<br /><br />\\"Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) is an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter were brutally murdered during a home invasion. When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor is assigned to the case. Against his will, Nick is forced to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years...\\"<br /><br />This is the setup for Law Abiding Citizen, which at first appears to be another a legal thriller but little by little becomes a revenge film in a similar fashion to [[ASIN:B0002IQMAM The Punisher]] and the like. Clyde is out for vengeance and it is Nick's job to prove in court that Clyde is guilty, a phrase from the movie \\"it is not what you know, but what you can prove in court\\" echoes the conflict between these two characters throughout the film.<br /><br />The movie was quite entertaining and this is basically due to the fact that there are several reveals and twists that help the story move forward, Clyde's quest for vengeance is quite gory at times so parents be warned if watching this with young kids. Acting is quite good but definitely not the best from Jamie Foxx. Gerard Butler's character is written in a way that even though you know he's wrong and he is clearly the bad guy you still feel empathy for his cause, which makes him a very interesting character. Simply put, `Law Abiding Citizen' is what I would call a  popcorn flick, do not expect a work of art but pure entertaining, if you see it like this you will definitely enjoy it and accept its bizarre and bloody death sequences.<br /><br />The edition included in this DVD is the 109 minute theatrical version, the [[ASIN:B002XMGGJM Law Abiding Citizen [Blu-ray]]]edition does include both the theatrical and uncut versions if you are interested in it and own a Bluray player.

My copy of Linchpin is underlined, highlighted, dogeared, has post-it notes sticking out the top and sides and the piece of paper that I use as a bookmark is covered on both sides with my sometimes undecipherable (except to me) handwriting.    I received this book as a gift from a friend.    And that is one of the messages that I got from the book:  give gifts.    In work and in life: make art and give gifts.     I've read some but by no means all of Seth Godin's previous books.  This book is by far the most passionate one that of his I have read.    But not only is it passionate, it is practical if you turn on your heart along with your brain.  It took me a long time (relatively) to finish the book.  I had to put it down time after time to ponder what the implications were for me in my daily life, both at home and at work.  There are plenty of practical tips here.    I don't look at this book as being good for employee motivation.  I see it as more for personal motivation.    Read it.  Its good.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|It's been a while since the last Gorillaz album, but Damon Albarn hasn't lost the touch. He pretty much produced this one on his own, and the project didn't start out as a Gorillaz thing, but it still fits the \\"band\\"'s sound for the most part. It's not totally similar, but the general feel is close enough to maintain the feel of the world's best fake band. Instrumentally, there's a stronger focus on orchestral elements and trip-hop/electronic sounds instead of more diverse instrumentation, and Damon doesn't sing quite as much, with quite a few guests appearing, especially in the first half, from rappers like Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, and the members of De La Soul to older singers like Lou Reed and Bobby Womack. Not every guest makes a great contribution, but enough of them hit to keep the diversity welcome.    I'd say this disc is somewhere in between the first two Gorillaz albums, maybe not in sound but in consistency. Their debut had some outstanding moments and really good songs, although parts were less interesting and sort of dull. Demon Days on the other hand, might not have quite reached the same heights in a lot of places, but is more enjoyable throughout the entire running time. Plastic Beach has a couple of clunkers, but generally matches or comes near to matching the strengths of both albums. I might call it my favorite Gorillaz release, although that opinion could easily change again. It's a bit front-loaded with awesome songs like \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\", \\"Stylo\\", and \\"Empire Ants\\", though there's good stuff in the back half too, like \\"Broken\\" and \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\". I don't really know what the future holds for this project, but I hope it involves more music before the year 2015.
B000RXE33U|5.0|Like many people I saw a movie first. Naturally due to media constraints, you expect certain amount of the book to be homogenized. So I wanted to read what was missing.

I LOVE this movie beginign to end, but the special features are awfully boring and simplistic that doesn't worth your or my money.    There is absolutely nothing cool about them.  No enterviews, no featuretes, no deleted scenes, no comic book comparations, no special effect documentary, no make up documentary, no nothing.      The movie is awesome, bu the product doesn't worth the effort.  I lost my money in this, so I suggest for you to save it and get the ultimate cut or new edition of the blue ray version to get some good extras.    Terrible...

B000UR9T7I|3.0|Spider-Man 3 (2007) could be director Sam Raimi's final contribution to the Spider-Man saga.  The film introduces key characters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard),  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), and most significantly, the alien symbiote, that later creates Venom.  Small time crook, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), is transformed into The Sandman, and is also revealed as the actual killer of Uncle Ben.  If that were not enough, Harry Osborn (James Franco) makes a not unexpected appearance, as the new Goblin.  There is a lot going on, but even with some meandering subplots, things seem to hold together well enough.<br /><br />While Raimi's films can certainly be appreciated for the technical achievement of successfully bringing Spider-Man to life, from the very beginning I have not been comfortable with the universe created by these films, because it strays rather far from the original comics.  In this regard, the writers did not get many things right, most importantly capturing the essence of Peter Parker.  Maguire's Parker is an incompetent goof, which is absolutely not what the Parker from the comics ever was.  The mischaracterization is attributable to a combination of the script, and Maguire's personality.  Although he has trouble keeping his mask on, Maguire is pretty good as Spider-Man.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, who plays Mary Jane Watson as written.  Which would be great, except the writers mischaracterized her as well.  The same can be said for characters like, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacey, and Betty Brant.  One bright spot has been the superb casting of the villains.  William Dafoe was excellent but was victim of a horrible costume.  Alfred Molina was absolutely brilliant as Doc Ock.  Thomas Hayden Church, and Topher Grace, and both give very good performances, and James Franco makes a stirring and impressive transition, into the new Goblin.  Regarded as disposable, Raimi continues the rather unfortunate trend of killing off his villains.<br /><br />Under the effects of the symbiote, Parker becomes an obnoxious, self absorbed jerk.  He treats his neighbor Usula (Mageina Tovah) like a dog, uses Gwen to degrade MJ, slugs MJ, blows off Harry face and almost kills him, and never even looks back.  Peter is a hard guy to have any empathy for.<br /><br />Venom's appearance is brief, but Topher Grace makes the most of out of what little time he has.  The special effects for Venom are outstanding.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for the lumbering giant Sandman, who looks like a pumped up escapee from a Stephen Sommers' Mummy flick.  In over forty years in comics, Spider-Man has never had problems with keeping on his mask, the way Maguire does in every film.  It is outrageous how many people have seen Spidey without his mask.<br /><br />As in life, Uncle Ben's spirit, shows only concern for Peter, not for vengeance, or even for his wife May.  The new Goblin teaming with Spidey is a really nice touch, with a fate for Harry Osborn that is sort of similar to the comic.  Likely reflecting last minute script revisions, the film has a rather untidy ending, with Peter forgiving Marko for killing Uncle Ben, and the symbiote's messy exit with Topher Grace.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 looks fantastic in blu-ray, a film that takes full advantage of the benefits of the format, with lots of cool bonus materials.  The commentary track featuring Raimi, and assorted members of the cast is very freeform, with Thomas Hayden Church, providing some witty comments.  Surprisingly, Raimi's contributions are rather minimal.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 concludes with no clear future direction.  As of January 2010, Sony Pictures has shelved plans for Spider-Man 4, after Raimi pulled out of the project.  A rumored complete reboot of Spider-Man, similar to Batman Begins, may be direction the series will take.  If this is the end of Raimi's affiliation with Spider-Man, it comes at a good time.  The foundation of Raimi's Spider-Man universe was off from the start, and it would have taken a fantastic story to rehab and reinvigorate the series.  Maguire and Dust are now a little old to still be in college, and the rocky relationship between Peter and MJ, took some major hits in Spider-Man 3.  Hopefully Spider-Man will continue in feature films, in a form closer to the original characterization by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.s off from the start, and it would have taken a fantastic story to rehab and reinvigorate the series.

2839906171|5.0|The area of New Business Model Development is helping to demystify a complicated area of business thinking.  This is a very well crafted book, it is clear, has excellent diagrams and logic processes and will certainly enable existing and start-up companies to review their business strategies using the range of tools on offer.  The methods are fairly straight forward and so it gives the reader interested in business processes a fresh look at organisation within the firm and how value propositions can be integrated within the business model process. I was interested to see if the book could help in value chain opportunities that link informal and formal markets and I am still working on that.  However this new book has certainly been a very helpful insight into current business planning and thinking and I would recommend it to people seeking tools to dissect and reformulate new and existing business plans.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart hits the old nail on the head, ego that is! Yet, I would assert that there lies a far deeper level of consciousness, that of the Unconscious that was investigated and systemized by Carl G. Jung in his work in depth psychology. Eckhart simplifies the matter yet gives you a practical means of understanding the mind. Jung on the other hand, posits absorbing mental chatter and integrating it into one's awareness. So, here's the question for me: Can you really stop unconsciousnes from erupting into the mind?

1423321650|2.0|Having read the Sword of Truth series several times I decided to give the audio-books a go. Wizards First Rule was fantastic and the narrator brought the characters to life with his voice. The imagery that he created kept me riveted to my ipod even though I knew what was going to happen next. At the end of the first book I eagerly looked forward to the second in the series, but was surprised to find that the publishers had decided to go with another narrator. Examining the rest of the series I saw that they kept switching narrators around as if they really don't care about a sense of continuity. Even though these audio-books are way overpriced I went ahead and purchased Stone of Tears. What a mistake! Jim Bond has a voice and diction that I can only compare to a 90's computer voice synthesizer. His style of narration is flat and boring with no flare whatsoever. Even though the story is great, I find myself dreading the next book and may just drop the whole series and go back to print. Its to bad that the publishers really don't care what the listening audience thinks about their books or they would \\"audition\\" the narrators before giving them the projects, not to mention keeping the same narrator for the entire series. Storytelling is an art-form and needs to be treated as such. The story itself is only one part of the experience.
0312427999|1.0|The author likes to think that only Milton Friedman disciples would ever stoop so low as to use the shock of a natural disaster, economic disaster, or security threat, etc to take advantage of frightened citizens to enact deep changes in either human rights, freedoms, or government control.  Well, with the most recent economic disaster, Obama is using the \\"shock\\", to enact unusual control over business, unusual levels of taxation, and taking unusual control, limiting our freedoms, and taking over some private enterprises.      While I agree with the concept - it is easier to get a group of frightened citizens to accept extreme changes that would never happen in a steady state - this tactic is not limited to just the \\"devil worshippers\\" (re: Capitalists), it has been done and will be done by any one that is in power with an extreme agenda and an opportunity (extreme shock).

B0035V35PI|4.0|From V For Vendetta director James McTeigue and the Wachowski's comes Ninja Assassin, a spectacularly over the top bloody blast.  Japanese pop artist Rain stars as Raizo, an orphan who was raised and trained to be a ninja, and eventually went against the group.  Now, he seeks to take revenge on his former clan in an effort to protect an Europol researcher (Naomie Harris), which results in buckets of blood, plenty of dismembered limbs, and overall graphic ultra-violence.  If you're attracted to Ninja Assassin in the least, then you already know what you're getting here, all done in a pretty flashy and stylized method, which is definitely not a bad thing here.  Its story isn't anything that hasn't been done before, but the fact that McTeigue used as many big-time resources as he could here play a vital role in how the finished product ends up turning out.  In that regard alone, Ninja Assassin is a success, and if you're an action film junkie, this is nigh-essential viewing.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|Prince Naveen might know the differnce, bit I'm not sure I do. Nor am I sure that Ron Clements and John Musker know the difference between this film and their previous films, because there isn't much of one.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting old, but practically everything in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" seems a bit stale. Not only does the story resemble a mash-up of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", but there are more than a few moments and characters that seem to have been lifted from previous Disney films. For example, Tiana has a dangling lock of hair that resembles Belle's. Dr Facilier (who isn't given enough time for us to really learn to hate him) comes across as a voodoo Jafar, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />The only real surprise is that one of the \\"good\\" characters dies. This is the first time this has happened since \\"Bambi\\". (Trusty was supposed to die in \\"Lady and the Tramp\\", but Peggy Lee supposedly talked Disney out of it.)<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" isn't as good as \\"Lilo and Stitch\\", a considerably more original and charming film. It's second-rate Disney. But, to be fair, second-rate Disney is better than anyone else's first-rate. The kids will love it, and as is typical of Disney, there's nothing in it to make adults wish they weren't watching it. It just isn't very magical.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is (yawn) typical Disney, sharp, detailed, and vibrantly colored.

0785134352|5.0|If it's one thing Mark Millar (Wanted, Wolverine: Enemy of the State & Old Man Logan, Ultimates, Civil War) knows, it's how to shock the audience.  The much anticipated, and much delayed, Kick-Ass does just that and more.  Published under Marvel's Icon imprint, Kick-Ass reunites Millar with his Enemy of the State partner and Marvel artist mainstay John Romita Jr. (World War Hulk, Amazing Spider-Man), and once again finds Millar poking fun at the sort of comic book conventions he did with Wanted, although the results are not nearly as nihilistic.  Dave Lizewski is a comic book obsessed teenager who decides to take his love for superheroes to a new level when he dons a green costume and decides to fight crime.  Naturally, things don't work out quite so well for him at first, and eventually, he finds that he isn't alone in the superhero business as he encounters Hit Girl, Big Daddy, and Red Mist.  That's really only scraping the surface of Kick-Ass, as Millar presents the humdrum and dreary existence of Dave with such dark comedic flair that it's hard not to admire the series as a whole.  That, along with the great artwork by Romita, makes Kick-Ass all the better.  Word of warning however, Kick-Ass is definitely not for the squeamish: it is ridiculously bloody, violent, and will be more than likely deemed offensive by some.  With that in mind though, Kick-Ass should be checked out at the very least regardless, and if the upcoming film adaptation is half as good, there will be even more reason to celebrate.
B0035V35P8|1.0|- The fighting scenes get so much help from camera tricks, and CGI animation that they look obviously fake. For example, when Rain used a bath towel to fight a female ninja in the laundry room. At first glance, it looked interesting. However, after a closer look, I found they had awkwardly utilized camera or CGI tricks. Also, in the last scene, the firefight where Rain fought against his former master, the environment was so dark, I could hardly see a thing. I was told the darkness was used to hide the wires or some other cinema tricks. I believed so.   Besides, the action look stiff and not realistic. No, the martial art skill of this movie is not comparable to that of Tony Jaa , Jackie Chan , Sammo Hung  and Donnie Yen.         - The acting leaves so much to be desired. The dialogue does not help either.      In short, Korean pop artist Rain is popular because of his singing but he's not a promising action actor.

B00337KM2S|1.0|i was forced to see this film on a date with a guy who unlike me loves chick flicks. in saying that ten if love that sort of genre this is perfect sort of film since has all the qualifications from torrid love story to misunderstood charaters to the sort of all in all happy ending. as for me well i find it was over hyped, mainly boring, let alone a running cliche. the only good parts were the suicide which sadly they did not show onscreen and that it ended after about an hr and a half.

B00328G4V6|4.0|Hendrix the mad perfectionist would never have approved these tracks for release but Eddie Kramer is a reliable compiler.  He was one of Jimi's best co-conspirators (along with Chas Chandler and Buddy Miles).  I still can't quite figure out why Hendrix was re-recording songs like \\"Fire\\" in early 1969 when he should have been moving on to a next studio album.  But evidently the Experience was no longer a comfortable unit to play in because of Redding's restlessness.  Kramer wasn't supervising any of these sessions so Jimi didn't have the confirmation he needed to finish these.  And he was in a writing slump after putting out three astounding original albums in the previous 18 months or so.  Nevertheless it is a listenable collection and the master is pumping out plenty of exciting music on his guitar.  Star Spangled Banner is from this period as well and is a bit of a surprising omission.  But you can get that if you buy the box set from a few years ago.  This set is very much in the spirit of South Saturn Delta and the box set, explorations that didn't quite reach Jimi's lofty standards.  I'm guessing a new listener would still be amazed.

1932100660|1.0|After reading \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" by Gary Taubes, I thought I would investigate this book which purports the exact opposite of Taubes findings. \\"The China Study\\" was obviously written by a scientist who has his opinions and wants them to be right no matter what the outcomes of his cited study. As a masters in nutrition student, it has been drilled into my head that you have to go with the results of the study, no matter how disappointing they are in supporting your hypothesis. This is how science works. You do an experiment, you assess the results and publish. Your hypothesis is either proved or disproved. \\"TCS\\" obviously has a bias and that is: don't eat meat, eat vegetables and you'll be healthy. But after reviewing the study that this book was based on, somehow they find it ok to tweak the results and support their view that eating meat is bad.     This debate will go on likely for many years to come. Only once people actually read the science that backs up low-carb, higher protein intake for good health, will we ever make any headway here. About 40% of what I have just spent 3 years studying in order to become a registered dietician is wrong. Low-fat diets may work by starving the individual to eat less calories, but when the diet stops and the person goes back to their regular way of eating, they usually gain all the weight back and then some. For most people, eating low-fat just makes you fatter or atleast keeps you from losing.     Protein and fat fill you up. Carbs make you more hungry. Study after study and diet after diet proves this. If you are vegetarian, this will make you mad. I understand. I also know that when I spent 10 years eating a low-fat, mostly plant based diet, with occasional lean protein like egg whites and fish, I gained 30 pounds. I exercised, which made me more hungry. I would not eat when I was hungry at night, thinking I'm losing, so get used to the feeling of hunger. I would eat \\"balanced meals\\" through out the day, spacingout the calories I was supposed to consume (1700 kcal) and recorded all this in a food diary.    But 30 pounds heavier, I have to conclude that low-fat/high-carb is not for me. My body craves protein and fat and after reading well-substantiated books such as GCBC and Atkins books, I have already lost 10 pounds in 2 months. I don't consider low-carb/high-fat/higher-protein as a diet. It is a lifestyle. I no longer need to record what I eat. My body tells me when to stop eating, not my food diary calorie allotment. I exercise less vigorously and enjoy it more with my young children just taking walks with them. I eat sustainable protein sources from grass-fed farms, organic leafy greens, full fat salad dressings, and cream in my coffee (among many other delicious things). I have more energy, I don't think about food all the time, sleep better, have clearer skin, and need a new wardrobe.     I look forward to practicing as a registered dietician one day. It will be an uphill battle teaching others about the well-supported benefits of low-carb eating, and with poorly written books like \\"The China Study\\" out there, it will be even harder.    Educate yourself. You HAVE to look at the science and do what is right for you. If you can eat as a vegetarian and you feel great, good for you! You are one of the \\"lucky\\" ones. I, on the other hand say.....please pass the bacon and get yourself a copy of \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" instead. It will set you on a totally different course and change your life for the better.    PS: Remember that if you want to look like a hippopotamus, then eat like one - a vegetarian.

0316069906|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who decides they want to eat meat during their lifetime. If you know the truth, you can make a better informed decision, and I think the problem is that people just don't know about what goes on. I found this book horrifying in some parts, and was astounded at what can and does go on when it comes to the treatment and death of animals all because we feel like eating some chicken nuggets that day. He writes in a way that is not some empty, factual, industrial exploration. It is actually interesting and he draws you in with his narrative, correctly and meaningful connecting eating meat and it's implications and influences on a human beings life, which I believe was the point of the book; Connecting what it means to eat animals with your own life. I have read Michael Pollan's book, and very much enjoyed it. But I  read this book after Omnivore's Delimma, and was blown away by how much more impact and meaning it had for me than Pollan's. And while I still like his book tremendously, I see how Foer's book really made me want to 'do something'...while Pollan's just made me think about it.    Also, after reading this book, in regards to the facts and truth he reveals, it made Ominvore's Delimma feel like a high school course in factory farming. Perhaps that is because he was willing to go all the way, show us the disgusting dirty truth, because he isn't going to turn around and eat meat later. Pollan still eats meat, so I wonder if that has anything to do with how his book actually treads lightly in regards to slaughter and inhumane issues. He covers them, for sure, but not as in depth as Foer did. And that makes me curious.    Overall, I wish I could convince everyone to read this book. It is so important. Not only to animals, but to people and their environment they are choosing to destroy in the name of profit.

B001NFNFIK|5.0|This is a strange film and a strange story. Louisiana is strange by definition but the crimes in that place on the bayou are more than strange, they are bizarre, frightening too. The killing of several girls leads to some kind of pervert who provides himself with some kind of absolutely clandestine mission. But his interest is also to work for some white money men who are in business and in many other activities under the table and even under the water, and behind the screen, the big screen of the cinema. Another murder comes up, after vtwenty years or more of rotting in the bayou, a black man who managed to be the lover of the wife of one of these few white business men whose business is shady even if their complexion is rosy. The cop has to go through all kinds of forms of intimidation, right out and right away violence and physical or police pressure. He just goes on to the end. He uses some methods that are not entirely correct but the result is the same: justice, and in this case his justice is justice, though not exactly in a court of justice, rather in the back of justice. The rhythm is also slightly slow. The best part is the haunting vision of some southern confederate general more or less playing hooky with our crime stories. But that's only a touch of naivet&eacute; and superstition. The whole thing is the best American French film, or is it the best French American film, I have seen for a while. It takes a certain Bertrand Tavernier to do that kind of a miracle or is it a prodigious happening?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
