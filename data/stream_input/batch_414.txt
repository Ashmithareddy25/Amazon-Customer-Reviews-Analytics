B000006CCG|5.0|W.A.S.P.(1984). W.A.S.P.'s debut album.<br />Back in the early to mid 80s, glam metal was beginning to surface, with many of those bands like Def Leppard and Quiet Riot coming out of the earlier NWOBHM scene (New Wave Of British Heavy Metal to the uneducated). At the time, most of these glam metal bands were just starting out and the scene wasn't satuated with tons of cookie cutter bands and ridiculous clothing yet (that would come into effect in 1986). So many were just concerned with writing good hardrock/heavy metal songs. To me, I've always found the better glam metal bands to be the ones that always borderlined on real heavy metal music, but stayed commercial enough to keep in the realm of the glam metal genre. These include Twisted Sister, Kick Axe, and of course, W.A.S.P. This Los Angeles based band consists of lead singer/bass guitarist Blackie Lawless, lead guitarists Chris Holmes and Randy Piper, and drummer Tony Richards. This band appears as a much darker act than most glam metal bands, especially with their Priest-esque leather &amp; studs outfits and the bloody stage props. Cheesy, yes, but it sort of adds to the appeal, and they're not overworked on the looks like say... Poison or Cinderella. With all the disgusting props, these guys were sure to be shunned by anyone associated with the Washington Wives, Tipper Gore and Susan Baker. Anyways, the music is what's really important, and in that they truly deliver. Sounding like a perfect medium between Quiet Riot and Twisted Sister, W.A.S.P. serves up 10 tracks of pure metal anthems, with nary a filler moment to be found. And thanks to the 1998 remaster treatment, not only do the tracks sound better than ever, but we also get three bonus tracks, including the A-side which was previously only available on their first single. Let's take a look at W.A.S.P.'s debut.<br />Starting things up is the aformentioned &quot;unreleased&quot; A-side, 'Animal (FLAB)'. This was an excellent track and I'm definitely gladto see it on here, though you can clearly see why is was originally cut. The next two catchy, bouncy rockers, 'I Wanna Be Somebody' and 'L.O.V.E. Machine' follow nicely, and are easy to get stuck in your head. 'The Flame' is a rocker which definitely brings to mind Metal Health-era Quiet Riot. 'B.A.D.' slows the pace down, but it's still very noteworthy. If anything is to be said, it's that W.A.S.P. likes to use initialed words in ther song titles, much like Anthrax. 'School Daze' is sort of your typical &quot;rebel kid&quot; anthem. Then there's the awesome fast rocker 'Hellion' (NOT the Judas Priest song), which sports a giant chorus. 'Sleeping In The Fire' is the album's ballad, though not a wimpy ballad by any means. 'On Your Knees' is a favorite blazing rocker of mine, and 'Tormentor' pounds all the way through. 'The Torture Never Stops' is a galloping rocker, like a cross between Iron Maiden and Yngwie Malmsteen. Both the B-sides are a welcome addition as well. 'Show No Mercy' sounds very similar to 'On Your Knees', and 'Paint It Black' is an excellent Stones cover, and does the original great justice.<br />If you're a fan of Quiet Riot and/or Twisted Sister, you will be right at home with W.A.S.P.'s debut. It has plenty of catchy metal anthems to bang your head to, and most importantly, it rocks like few can! So it gets my full 5 stars. I haven't checked out W.A.S.P.'s other albums yet, but I'm sure they've followed suit to the debut's style. I believe they're still around today. Simply put, if you want a decent glam metal band that plays good and memorable songs, but without all the decadent qualities, then W.A.S.P. is your prime pick. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other similar albums:<BR>-'Metal Health' by Quiet Riot<BR>-'Vices' by Kick Axe<BR>-'Under The Blade' by Twisted Sister<BR>-'You Can't Stop Rock N Roll' by Twisted Sister
0060194995|5.0|I am sorry to say that it took me this long to read this wonderful book.  I won't give away any plot, because it would bore those who know about it and ruin some of it for those who aren't familiar with the story.  <BR>   This is a deeply rich text consisting of many beautiful relationships.  I was especially touched by the brother/sister relationship that goes through changes during the time-frame of the book, but always comes back to a very caring and loving place.  I loved the innocence of the characters and how they are slowly learning what the world is about. The mystery of Boo is so tangible in my mind; I played those games myself.<BR>   However, in all the beauty of the town, the folks and the family there is an ugly undercurrent that drives the story.   While many parts of the story are sad, I was left with a feeling of great hope and love.<BR>   Harper Lee has written a novel still relavent today, over 40 years after its original publishing.  This is an amazingly moving story.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Christmas came early last year when I got the chance to review a new film called Cold Mountain for my article in the magazine I write for. I expected a tedious and dowdy journey of the heroic soldier travelling back from the War to his sweetheart that I have reviewed so many times before, but I was in for a supprise. With an all star cast and Jude Law and Nicole Kidman leading the way, I belived my pre-written review of a \\"fidget in your seats\\" film would need to be re-written. Jude and Nicole gave heart-warming proformances as the lost lovers and the on-screen chemistry worked well with the story line. (I also write a gossip column in the magazine and could quite happily once again go on about the denyed \\"affair\\" between them, but....maybe not!) However, I feel Renee Zelweger with her informous Ruby steals the limelight away from the others. She clearly shows the hard surface of Ruby's character in the beginning, but Renee has the power to release the softer Ruby steadily thoughout the remainder of the story, especially with the events concerning her Father. The Oscar sitting on her matlepiece at home is clearly deserved. The dodgy Yank accent is the only let down of this masterpiece, and as my readers know, I never give full marks on my review as there is always room for improvement, but I have to admit, this is the closest I have ever got to giving away full marks!
0767802470|5.0|Ok.  Step one, turn out all lights and isolate any external sound.  Step two, crank the subwoofer UP.  Step three, set the language to &quot;german.&quot;  Step four, get a couple of buckets of seawater to pour over one's head at the proper scene (this is optional).<br />No other submarine movie comes remotely close to depicting the claustrophobia and violence of undersea warfare as Das Boot.  Before  the movie, I had little sense of the suicidal missions that thousands of German seaman were subjected to even in the early years of WW2 - and for that matter, the equally ruthless way that speeding Allied convoys left the crews of sinking ships behind to freeze and drown in the North Atlantic.  It was a particular act of courage and skill for the director to confine most of the action into a literal steel tube barely tall enough to stand in.<br />Das Boot MUST be watched in the original German, much like Pat Buchannan's &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; speech as the 1996 Republican Convention.  For weeks after the seeing the movie the first time, I kept hearing &quot;Alla-a-a-r-m!&quot; and the ka-BWANG of exploding depth charges.  Jurgen Prochmow has been wasted in a number of movies (e.g. &quot;Dune&quot;), but he beats out Connery, Gable and the rest as the best Captain around, alternatively ruthless and caring for his men.<br />This movie is so head and shoulders above subseqeunt films like U-571, any comparison would diminish the accolades this movie deserves.
B0000033P0|5.0|The first ELP albums I heard were Brain Salad Surgery and Works Volume 1. I was 17 the first time I saw them in 1987, as Emerson Lake and Powell, which from then on I explored and followed the music of this band. It was extremely disappointing that they disbanded after thier 1998 tour. They were absolutely \\"phenominal.\\" They never sounded better or more in synch with each other. To this day, the only equal to Kieth Emerson is Rick Wakeman. None to Carl Palmer, especially after seeing him play live.<BR> Tarkus....I hated this album when I first bought it. I was expecting to hear something similar to Brain Salad Surgery. The interesting thing with ELP's music is the more you listen to it, the more you discover it, and the more you like it.. Tarkus is now my second favorite ELP album. There is so much going on, different sounds, different structures, different styles, it is really quite an amazing music score. There is no music quite like it. It has very heavy percussion, and if you like keyboard music, you are going to really like this, maybe not your first time listening to it, but you will discover all the different musical complexities that are going on. Lakes' singing is fitting to the music, particularly in Tarkus and Bitches Crystal. This is true progressive music. You have the Tarkus suite which is comprised of 7 pieces of music (the Battlefield was the pinnacle of the suite), An almost \\"ragtime\\" tune in Jeremy Bender, A piano and ribbon synth volatile song in Bitches Crystal, church organ in The Only Way... and more. I recommend this to any enthusiast of keyboards, percussion, or progressive rock music. Just be open minded, because this is a different world of music waiting for you to discover.
0792162803|1.0|This movie had EXTREMELY bad humor, EXTREMELY bad acting, and was seriously insulting. It insulted my religin and kids with mental disabilities. My sister is autistic. This movie is unwatchable- I could hardly bear watching. They tried too hard to be funny, and turned out STUPID. Never watch this. Bad words, bad humor, bad- everything! The sexual jokes were really bad and disgusting. How could this have actully made it to the big screen? And if you think I sound old-ladyish, then I'll just let you know: I'm 13.
B00000DGUG|1.0|I was a huge fan of Alanis, listening to Jagged Little Pill religiously. I was both happy and excited to have secured a copy of this CD when it came out and a hurried home to play it.<BR>I was hugely dissapointed.<BR>When I listened to this CD I was reminded of a chorus of yowling cats with a finale of barking dogs. Apart from 'Thank U' this has to be one of the biggest piles of crap I've ever listened to, and if you are even THINKING of buying it I suggest you get therapy because you obviously have a serious problem. At least I had the excuse of never hearing any of the tracks on this CD when I bought it, as I still was in the happy place of imagining that this would be as good as 'Jagged Little Pill'.<BR>Ignorance is bliss.
0425180638|3.0|This is just really more of the same..lots of extremely gruesome details from post mortems, and going over and rehashing old bits from past books featuring Dr.Kay Scarpetta and The Werewolf. It really got rather tedious towards the end, and as the book finished with The Werewolf and the two main baddies from this story, Jay Talley and Bev Kippen, alive and at large, the inference can only be that the author intends to drag out the story in more books..don't think I'll bother !
B0000041Z5|5.0|If you like your Brahms on the lame side like Georg Szell then this might not be for you.  However, I love the freedom and emoting this orchestra does for Solti...much more exciting then the Cleveland orchestra foray.
B0000041LA|1.0|After purchasing this CD set I was to say the least dismayed!  Askenazy's performance is routine at best, and Previn is amazingly luke warm conducting the LSO!  Decca/London's remastering is one of the worst I have heard for a 1975 recording!  The strings are shrill, like fingernails on a chalk board, and the whole set has a weird bassy kind of imbalance!  The best Prokofiev set to buy are the two CD's containing all five concertos on NAXOS, with Kun Woo Paik, and Antoni Wit conducting the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra! Superb performances, and some of NAXOS best digital recording!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin really is about what goes on under Avril's skin.  It's amazing. If you thought she was good in Let Go you will be blown away by UMS.  There is still some catchy, pop, sing-a-long songs but then there is those deep, meaningful songs that you'll LOVE!  I recommend you buy this CD today!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Let's start off by saying this, if you watch this movie with amazingly high hopes then you will be greatly dissapointed. The Matrix Revolutions isn't what most people think, or what most people will tell you. It's not a horrible film, not a dissapointment, but it's also not an amazing finish to an amazing trilogy. It's an above average finish to a very deep trilogy. <br />The Matrix Revolutions starts off right from where the 2nd one ended. Right after Neo is an some sort of coma. However his brain is in a similair state of a regular human in the matrix. The movie does basically what you expect it to do which is show a war, have some great fight scenes and be too serious for it's own good. Although there are a few suprises still up the Wachowski brothers sleeve's to make the movie still feel fresh to a certain extent. The addition of the train station is one of them, not to mention you finally see the \\"machine city\\" where all of the sentenals are made to destroy Zion. These things make the movie likeable, but no where as good as the 2nd film (which in my oppinion is the best of the three) or the first film for that matter. The main thing that hurts the movie is the fact that the main idea, the plot, the whole trilogy just isn't as fresh as it used to be (kind of like Men In Black 2 - theres nothin suprising about shooting up aliens in 2003 like there was in 1997).<br />In the end this movie is a good finish to the Matrix trilogy. You'll like it if you go into the mind frame (right before watching the movie) that your going to like it because it is a matrix movie. You'll also like it if your not a die hard fan and you expect the series to lose alot of it's steam from the first 2 movies. Die hard fans, should watch it, but they'll be dissapointed. Hated the 2nd one? you'll hate this one even more
B000040OBS|5.0|Punk rock is a very visceral form of music to start with; one listen to the Sex Pistols' catalog (or at least their debut album)will leave no one doubting that. But the idea of a punk recording adopting influences from the German rather than British or American rock scenes struck most people then as unusual. Moreover, the idea of a punk recording consisting of no more than of what were then state-of-the-art electronics (today they're 'vintage') and extreme vocals was even more unusual. After honing their skills for six years prior, the duo of Alan Vega and Martin Rev who make up Suicide released this, their debut album in 1977, probably one of the most forward-thinking pop recordings of its day.<br />Having very little experience with groups like Wire and Joy Division (both significant in their own right), I find it hard to accept that either act could have created something more chilling than this. Perhaps Suicide are the beginning of what's now refered to as \\"post-punk\\", a style of punk which relied heavily on synthesizers, drum machines, and so on. Suicide's second and third releases convey a similar energy and drive, but this self-titled work remains the purest expression of their modus operandi, a harsh, almost dirty, bed of synth arpeggios which provide the foundation for Vega's vocal meanderings, most powerfully expressed on 'Frankie Teardrop' and the alternate take of 'Harlem' from the CBGB live performance on the bonus disc. Think of it, if you will, as the kind of music either Terry Riley or Klaus Schulze would have made if they were punk musicians, or if Kraftwerk had stronger theatrical tendencies. Beautiful, occasionally distrubing and always mesmerizing, Suicide's debut is certainly one of the great electronic albums of the '70s, and maybe of all time.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The cast is superb and the plot isn't obvious right away like most movies.  Bronson's protrayal of a man who has waited years for revenge is great.  This is in my opinion the best western ever made.
4789009637|5.0|I especially like Genki's extensive use of Kanji (with Furigana) to allow me to slowly become accustomed to them. The grammar is taught very well, although I recommend Japanese Step by Step as a better technique or way-of-thinking about verb conjugation. 'Step by Step' uses a flow chart to conjugate the different verbs - the best way I've seen to teach it yet!  The point I'd like to add about this book is that I think it starts a tad too fast for someone who's just decided to learn or is starting from nothing. If you haven't started Japanese classes at the same time you will need a Preliminary study period before beginning with Genki. I did this by accident, and it suited me fine. I bought \\"Japanese For Young People Bk I\\" and finished it before I started Genki. I also started night-classes for 2 hours a week for about 2 months. By the end of that time, I was almost proficient with Katakana and Hiragana and could flip through the first 2 chapters of Genki - saying \\"I already know that\\". Importantly, though, I was able to start using Genki's Kana-only (after chapter 2) format with relative ease. Had I not used a preliminary study period, it would have been very slow going and just too daunting with all that Kanji.   So, if you've mastered Hiragana/Katakana more or less, and have a few weeks of vocabulary and speech introduction, then Genki is the best book around - and I looked at all of them, believe me!  I also think it's the best serious or all-round book I've seen. That is to say, it really does teach you how to write, read and listen, without favouring any particular interest group. Incidentally, my native Japanese teacher recommended this book to me - she used it to give out homework (from the studybook).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is one of the hottest pop stars of today. Her music is so catchy, so versatile and has good lyrics. She has grown into a more mature adult. And her songs prove that. this cd doesn't have that bubble-gum teen pop that she used to have. She now has mid-tempo pop songs, trancey/dance songs, hardcore hip/hop songs mixed with a lil reggea. She also has some pop and beautiful ballads. <br />1)Me against the music- 7.5/10 This song is the first single which includes the queen of pop, the almight Madonna. It has midtempo beat with some guitar riffs. It's ok. This song is radio-friendly and good for the clubs. it'll get u pumped up and make u shake ur booty on the dancefloor all night long!!!A really good video with good choreography.<BR>2)(I got that) boom Boom - 9.5/10 This song featurs the kings of the crunk, the Ying Yang Twins. This is an awesome hip/hop song. This song has a catchy chorus accompanied by an awesome beat with some banjos. This song will become a club-smash.<br />3)Showdown - 8/10 This song has a reggea/rock beat. it's very unusual. something that Britney has never done before. Very unique and interesting. this song is mid-tempo but still good. I'm guessing this song is about sex. Britney practically talks her way through the whole song and the chorus is pretty good.<BR>4)Breathe on me- 9.5/10 This song has a very trancey vibe to it. Very atmospheric. It's very reminiscent to a Kylie Minogue song. this song is good for grinding becasue it's so addicting and very sexual.<BR>5)early mornin- 4/10 O god! I hate this song so much! This is a Moby produced song. This song has no substance and is really dull. this songs about an after-party. It's kind of a song that Madonna would do. But i give britney props for tryin something different.<BR>6)Toxic- 10/10 Her 2nd single. This is the best song off the whole album. Very catchy. But it is waay to overplayed on the radio. But i still think it's awesome. This song kind of starts out like linkin parks \\"Faint\\". anyways this song has the 60's violins with an electro/pop feel to it. this song should be a theme for the hit tv show \\"Alias\\" starring Jennifer Gargner. The video is awesome with good production and special effects. But it's kind of a rip off to the No doubt video \\"It's my life\\" which has the same storyline.<BR>7)Outrageous 9/10 Just announced, this will be her 4th single. this is an R-Kelly penned track. Very vey radio-friendly and i think it would be a radi smash hit. It's a typical R.kelly song where Britney sings about her sex drives and shopping sprees. An awesome beat with the indian flutes in the background. The chorus is amazing.<BR>8)Touch of my hand- 8.5/10 (...). It's the most touching song and the most beautiful song out of whole album. it has amazing amazing asian/chinese strings with a good melody. It sounds a lot like \\"Frozen\\" by Madonna. Britney has a lot of guts to talk about a subject so personal. this song is electro/pop/asian<BR>9)The hook up 7/10 This is a pure reggea/carribean/puerto rican song. It's a very good dance song. But Britney should have collaborated with Sean Paul to add more flavour to this song. This song sounds a bit like \\"Baby boy\\" by Beyonce. But its good anyway.<BR>10)shadow - 9/10 the first ballad off the album.  It's a matrix produced song which sounds a lot like \\"I'm with you\\" by Avril lavigne. This track is a little bit too overproduced but it;;s still pretty good. A top40 type material song. The best part is when the song reaches it's climax where Britney voice soars and is at its best.<BR>11)Brave new girl- 8.5/10 this is a bubblegum song that should have been on the legally blonde 2 soundtrack. This song is very catchy. sorta radio-friendly. britney attempts to rap in this song. And i must admitt that she's pretty good. Her voice is computerized all through the song. It should have been a Hilary duff song. and it kinda also sounds like \\"Ray of light\\" by Madonna at some parts of the song. Very poppy/techno/electro song. But very good.<BR>12)Everytime- 10/10 this along with toxic is the best song on the album. this is her 3rd single. this song is very touchin and is one of the most beuatiful ballads i have ever heard. I can't believe Britney actually wrote the song along with the melody. Thats very impressing. This song, sadly is for her ex bf Justin timberlake. So britney must have cheated on Jt becasue she sings her heart out by sayin that she sorry. this song has very nice piano riffs accompanied by a good harp.Her voice shines in this song. Awesome video too about reincarnation.<br />This is the best album i have ever purchased and will remain in my cd player for many years to come. Britney will probably become the next madonna if she reinvents herself and makes good music. Britney will be in this music industry/business for a long time!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|What more is there to say of Josh Groban?  He came out with his debut and I think he surprised people because he was different from other people in the music industry.  He appeals not only to classical-oriented singers, but the mainstream audience as well. &quot;Closer&quot; is just as good as his debut (&quot;Josh Groban&quot;) if not better.  My personal favorites are &quot;per te&quot;, &quot;you raise me up&quot;, and &quot;si volvieras a mi&quot;.  All of the songs are great and what seems to accentuate the greatness is that the majority of the songs are not in English and it seems to make the songs have more &quot;character&quot; so to speak.  5 stars.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Wow, I always been a fan of cannibal corpse's music since eaten back to life to now and i haven't realy been dissapointed yet. Alot of my friends hate cc but i happen to find their music in iof the most original ever  because they were basically the first to make gore deathmetal i assume but i know  there's  older deathmetal bands that talk about what cc does but anyways, I just got cc's latest effort wretched spawn and i seen them live last year which was worth it. I seggust for any one who loves pure deathmetal with nonstop brutally  then buy it!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Want to know if this DVD is for you?<br />LONG ANSWER:<br />Well, it depends on what kind of person you are, even if you're a Pink Floyd fan. There are many kinds according to the type of music and/or mood they prefer.<br />1)There are the solitary, silent people who prefer to stare at something and find beauty even in the patterns of the floor tiles. These people prefer to look beyond what can be seen or heard and find &quot;the spirit&quot; of something, no matter how caothic it may seem. These are the fans of 1968-1972 Pink Floyd's looong, strange pieces. I know somebody like this, a painter, friend of mine, and he was immediately hypnotized by &quot;Echoes&quot;, in spite that he wasn't a huge fan of Pink Floyd. These people will really enjoy the original concert film. I did. If you dream about being alone in the desert and watch the sunrise listening to &quot;Echoes&quot;, this is just for you.<br />2)Others prefer the glamour and the coloured lights of traditional concerts; they like interviews with artists, special 3D-effects, and Star Wars. They enjoy jazz and prefer more &quot;structured&quot; music. These profile correspond to Pink Floyd fans from &quot;Dark side&quot; through &quot;Wish You were here&quot;. These could love the Director's Cut; however, some of them might be dissapointed.<br />3)And there are those who don't really appreciate jazz, classical music, or staring at anything. Those of you who listen to pop music all day or who think &quot;The Wall&quot; is the best Pink Floyd music ever, this DVD is not for you.<br />There are many kinds of art... There is simple-structured art, like pop music or naif-style paintings, whose beauty can inmmediately seen, but when trying to find the soul of it... well, there isn't any. And there is the other kind of art, that present in desolate De Chirico paintings, in El Bosco's obscure visions, and in the desert. This can't be appreciated in a first sight; instead, it needs to be studied and re-visited many times, in order to love it. This is the type of art present in &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;. I saw Shrek and liked it a lot the first time, second time it wasn't that fun and the third time it didn't capture my attention anymore. But Live at Pompeii is a DVD I will wear out.<br />SHORT ANSWER:<br />If you really love the songlist, buy it. If you like Pink Floyd but don't like these particular songs, keep searching.times, in order to love it. This is the type of art present in &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;.

1573225517|5.0|To say the least, Hornby has a great talent that many of us wish we had. I'm most like Horny, in terms of thought. I just don't have the ability to write them down such like he does. His observations are incredible. This is more than just a fictional story, but a view on life. His Top Five lists have more meaning than just being a Top Five list. Afterall, everything (and everyone) needs a reason to be within the top five.<br />Overall, I'm speechless in response to this book. Not only is the story flawless, but Hornby's writing and observations of life itself are amazing. The end where Rob (main character) realizes and admits to his on faults is ingenious. <br />High Fidelity is a quick, great read. I recommend it to anyone (especially younger adults). Sit down one weekend and read this book. You'll be amazed. The next weekend, check out the movie. John Cusack does an excellent job with the character and has great chemistry with Jack Black.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This movie wouldn't have stod a chanse of being sucessful without its wonderful score. The emotions that it delivers to the viewers are constatly present. Comparing it to another score for a film about Jesus, The Last Temptation of the Christ, this one's at lest 10 times better. A Score can really break or make a movie. This time it sureley made one. Excellent work by Debney.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I have not seen a better movie in almost three years. <br />Having read the book, I realize that screenwriter John August has incredible talent. August took Daniel Wallace's great story and elaborated it immensely. To understand the amount of work August did on the story you must read the book and watch the movie. It is unbelievable how well this was written for the screen. Amazing how such a great movie can come from the same writer as some of the Charlie's Angels movies.<br />Tim Burton does an amazing job directing. This movie is his second Edward Scissorhands. Both movies are amazing, and largely due to Tim Burton's directing.<br />There are no complaints on actors or actresses, and just the same there are no outstanding actors/acresses in the movie. All come together to produce an amazing film.<br />This is a must see.
0061020710|5.0|Open the door to your mind and let a bizarre vision enter.  It's a Discworld, resting on the backs of four elephants, who stand on a massive tortoise swimming through space.  There's magic here, symbolised by the eighth colour of the rainbow - octiron.  There's little magic done in this story, but the tale itself is more compelling than any stage sleight-of-hand.  For while there are trolls, dryads, barbarian heroes, it is the real people who are the focus.  Publishers, notorious for lacking a sense of humour, label this book &quot;Fantasy&quot;.  Don't be fooled.  This book is the first step in a journey to face ourselves - a tramp to realms of reality, presented with wit and wisdom.<br />Rincewind, a failed &quot;wizzard&quot; is given the task of guiding, and guarding, the Discworld's first tourist.  Originating in the Counterweight Continent, Twoflower is an insurance clerk.  He knows about the &quot;reflected sounds of the underground spirits&quot; - echo-gnomics.  Introducing the concept to the denizens of Ankh-Morpork, the Disc's greatest city, proves disastrous.  Rincewind, who knows the City is experienced in disasters, is more concerned with his own survival, which is threatened at every turn.  Yet, like the City, he bounces back to confront the next crisis.  He has some help, in the form of one of the Eight Spells, which, if improperly invoked, may distort Time and Space.  It's a heavy responsibility, especially for one who's so adept at dodging such burdens.<br />While the magic is subdued, nothing subdues the gods but each other.  Overseeing the Discworld, the panoply of deities idle the days with The Game.  The contenders, Blind Io, chief of the gods, Offler the Crocodile God, and Fate, cast dice to guide the movements of the Board's pieces.  These, of course, are Rincewind and other denizens of Discworld.  Logic says Fate must be the ultimate winner, but The Lady is a strong opponent.  She is the one goddess who arrives at her own whim, as Rincewind learns to his distress.<br />All these deities, characters and events are presented in the most compelling style.  Pratchett is a master of language and offers levels of wit, pathos, characterisation and story rarely matched and never excelled.  He also adds science to a field usually devoid of real knowledge.  The combination is explosive, while demanding reflection.  For that is the purpose of his writing - to mirror another world, ours.  There's a laugh per page, but when you've wiped your eyes, you'll realize there's far more here than humour.  Start with this volume and be prepared to continue the trek.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Although I do not own this DVD set, I've seen the entire Fawlty Towers show. It is simply amazing. The actors/actresses come together great, all carried by the immensely talented John Cleese. Personally I choose Fawlty Towers over Monty Python. It is ingenious. I watched the entire show within a few weeks, and would have done it in less time had I not other things to do. I've never seen a better television program and doubt there will be another like this. Even if you know nothing about this show nor anything about John Cleese, I suggest you give it a try. Most of you will enjoy the great humor.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I've just gone through Ep. IV SE once again, and there I clearly felt, that all those digital enhancements Lucas has done for the SEs and will include for the DVD-versions will have no effort at all! Those  movies are so clearly and obviousley 70ies / 80ies work (what's so bad about that anyway???). No matter what Lucas tries to hide the simple fact, that these are OLD and technically OUTDATED (but incredible great) movies, he probably won't succede. He would have to throw away 95% of the FX-shots and replace them with new ones - and even then I doubt, the movies would perfectly blend with the prequels and give audiences the ILLUSION of a seamless six part saga. Too much has changed technically from miniaure shots to the computer power of the year 2004. Too far allready has the logic of the story been streched to somehow make the prequel-reapperance of beloved Characters like R2-D2, C-3PO, Boba Fett, Yoda (and Chewie for Ep. III?) possible. Too much has Lucas' intention changed over the years from making space adventure movies for juveniles AND grown ups to some kind of Disney-in-Space for the smallest. So maybe Lucas may be able to fool HIMSELF about the fact that he and his most successful movies are slowly getting old by making all those changes, but I doubt he can fool the audience (with the exception of some die hard fanboys). Maybe it would be WISE to stop raping the corpses and simply let those movies age with pride and dignity. They (and the millions that have seen them in their original incarnation and actually MADE them what they are today) have earned it!<BR>Just my 2 cents...
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The Fog of War is an interesting DVD from the perspective about how people make decisions about important matters of life and death.  The entire movie is an interview with Robert S. McNamara the Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.  He tells a lot of the detail about his personal life including his academic career and rise to head Ford Motor Company.  The main lessons begin when he leaves the position at Ford to head the Defense Department.<br />Secretary McNamara was a central figure in both the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.  He uses vignettes from both to illustrate the central eleven lessons.  The eleven lessons explore the cognitive and moral reasoning that occurs during war.  These are important lessons with relevance to the decisions that any country makes when they make a similar decision.  The analysis here includes such topics as the unilateral use of power, what is morally appropriate in war and the limits of rational thought during war.  He discusses the interactions he had with President Johnson and some disagreements they had.  Most importantly he presents a synthesis and conclusions in some of these areas.<br />The central theme about how there is a lack of clarity in many war time decisions and the fact that this leads to significant moral mistakes where large numbers of innocent people die is well discussed.  He is able to illustrate these points with clear examples of encounters he had during the actual events and in retrospective reconstruction with his counterparts from the former Soviet Union and Vietnam.<br />I heard at least one critique about this film that criticized it for not really being a documentary, but presenting a viewpoint.  I think that is clear both from the format and the occasional off camera questions by the film maker.  I think there also might be a question about how robust the data is that are represented, in terms of the factual basis of some statistics.  Balancing these questions was a compelling fact that the US and the Soviet Union had three very close calls in terms of nuclear war.  Before hearing statement, I was aware of only two of these incidents and would have appreciated an elaboration of these incidents and how they were processed by the US military and executive branch at the time.<br />In spite of a few style points, I found the format of this film and the content compelling.  McNamara's viewpoint is both from a man who was there in history at the time and a man who has thought about what happened and revisited it many times.  Although there is the limited detail of a film, the general observations here are both historically relevant and can be applied to current government decisions about war and terrorism.  After I watched the film, I went down to my local bookstore and tried to purchase a hard copy of the book.  I was surprised to learn that the book will not be available until this fall.  I hope that both the book and the film will be studied, discussed, and researched at all levels - as a way that mankind can get serious about trying to prevent these problems in the future.<br />George Dawsonpelling fact that the US and the Soviet Union had three very close calls in terms of nuclear war.

B00000JCOV|4.0|My first metal album was Metallica's Black Album, from then on i've been hooked on everything metal. I've listened to a lot of music, giving everything a try, and this album is one of the few I actually chose to add to my collection. It has pure emotion through every second of the cd.
B000002JSJ|5.0|PRESENCE is Led Zeppelin's most metal-oriented album ever. There are no acoustic moments, just pure electric hard rock &amp; roll. The band had been beset by a number of problems around the time of its creation. (Robert Plant recorded his vocals in a wheelchair, the result of a terrible car accident.) However, it is as good as anything the group ever recorded, despite the tension that you can detect listening to it.
B00009V7RF|3.0|I believe Simon Cowel said it best, \\"it was good but it wasn't great,\\" and that fits this cd perfectly.  While this cd is nice, it isn't terrific.  There are in fact some nice songs on here, but for every \\"Shut Up\\" there is another \\"Latin Girls\\".<br />Some of the songs that highlight this album are \\"Let's Get Retarded\\", \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Fly away\\", and \\"The Apl Song\\" and \\"Hand's Up\\" and \\"Labor Day\\" are alright.  But even the last two are on the border line.  They released \\"Where Is The Love?\\" which annoyed me to death, but I'm glad I kept an open mind and listened to their other work, because other wise I would have skipped right past this cd.<br />The Black Eyed Peas are a good group, and I love Fergie because she can sing well.  This group needs to get better songs though that aren't so centered around Will.I.Am and need to focus on the rest of the group as welll.
B000002J0B|5.0|HOUSES OF THE HOLY is an extension of the abitious direction that Led Zeppelin was taking on LED ZEPPELIN IV. The opener &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is an epic of sweeping proportions, and the songs that follow are an interesting mix of staight-ahead hard rock, folk, R&amp;B, and even reggae. This is one of the most important Led Zeppelin albums ever, even if others are more highly regarded.
B00009V7P8|1.0|After reading so many great reviews for this CD, I could hardly wait to get it in the mail.  I had, unfortunately, dismissed the few negative reviews that said things like &quot;I wanted to kill myself after listening to this CD&quot;...  whoever said that wasn't far off.  I really do like the song cannonball (which is constantly played on the radio around here)... and there is one other that I like, although I can't quite remember the name (and I think it might be too soon for me to try to listen to the CD again to figure it out)... but most of the CD is filled with the unbearable sounds of this guy mumbling and whining... and the ENTIRE CD has a melancholy tone... it's just entirely unpleasant for me.  I actually really enjoy whiny chick music though...  maybe Rice is just missing some of that angst.  I don't know what went wrong here... I might try it again in a few weeks... but for now I am definitely and overwhelmingly disappointed.  :(
B000002J1U|5.0|LED ZEPPELIN III was the first album to emphasize the acoustic side of Led Zeppelin, and the results are great. The best songs are \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's The Way.\\" This album is the polar opposite of PRESENCE. Listen to them back to back and see what I mean.

B000002JSP|5.0|IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR was a great final album from Led Zeppelin. However, it was not intended as the final statement, as the group was planning another studio record when John Bonham drank himself to death. However, Bonham's alcohol problems do not seem to have affected his performance here, as the songs are all great and the band tries some artsy experiments. Judging by the variety of styles and sounds here, one can only guess where the group might have gone next if not for Bonham's senseless alcohol-related death.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The movie has no over-powering theme.  I believe the viewers who gave it bad ratings were put off by this.  It is seriously like watching an excerpt from the daily life of two people.  But it does so in a way that reveals some things about our own nature as people.  <BR>A successful older man and a married-too-soon younger woman meet in Tokyo.  Both are at odds with the culture there, but find eachother and spark up a very interesting friendship.  They share common interests but are from two totally different generations. The man is going through his mid-life crisis and the girl is just lost and confused in Tokyo.  They find a common ground on their cynicism and have a wonderful time together.  This is not the meaningful part of the story however.  <BR>The great thing about the movie is in observing the subtle sub plots of the movie and observing their behavior.  This is definitely an &quot;intellectual&quot; film if you want to call it that because it plays on how your philosophy and perception.  That is its draw.  If you're expecting a thriller or drama or love story, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for a movie that is very well acted and very well written and makes for a thought provoking view, watch Lost in Translation.

B00003CXDG|5.0|This movie is what action movies are all about. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and it does pretty well in other ways. The story is still pretty good, nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's still good. Some people may say that the save-the-world theme is old, but that's what action movies are about. Give me one James Bond film where 007 didn't do that. Give me any other action movie without that theme. Lord of the Rings had it. Star Wars had it. So does the fact that M:I-2's story revolves around someone saving the world make the movie bad? No way! It's the kind of plot that makes an action movie an action movie. Moving on. Like others have stated, the purpose of action in these movies is not to seem totally realistic, but to be really entertaining and fun to watch. Actually, it still is pretty realistic. What's all this junk about Ethan hitting all his shots (Which is pretty unrealistic, I'll admit)? Didn't any of you watch the Biocyte shootout? How many of his shots hit one of Ambrose's men? Maybe a quarter of them! He's still human and has down-to-earth abilities, not completely unrealistic superhuman stuff that a lot of people criticize. And besides, until the road chase, it is perfectly reasonable that Ethan didn't get shot! Half the time he was behind a wall or lurking in the shadows, waiting for the moment to go Splinter Cell on a patrolling guard. Anyway, sorry I lingered. The acting in this movie is great. Tom Cruise gives Ethan Hunt a very human qualities. Thandie Newton, who plays Nyah Hall, also does the same for her character. Ving Rhames returns to the comic-relief character Luther (the brilliant computer programmer from M:I),  and continues to give Luther the comical humor from the first movie. John Polson is introduced as the Australian helicopter pilot Billy Baird, and also gives a lot of humor to the movie.   And by the way, both Rhames and Polson do a great job of acting besides the humor, and bring the characters to life very well. Dougray Scott is the villain in this movie, and does it very nicely. He gives Sean Ambrose the kind of madman look and nicely combines it with cold-blooded intelligence to make the character a very good villain. And finally, Anthony Hopkins is Ethan's new leader, and does a very good support role. What about the music? Well, if you've seen the first movie, the music is just the same with a little metallic feel to it. And if you haven't, then don't worry, you won't be dissapointed. This is a great action movie that will keep you entertained throughout the two hours of the film, and does well in areas that some action films don't quite succeed in, despite what others say.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is the best film i have ever seen. It is scary, funny, and is entertaining throught. This film couldn't of been made better. See and you will agree.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Definitely the best of all the Christopher Lee Dracula films.  The sequels do not live up to this film, mainly because they do not contain all of the original characters such as Lucy, Jonathan Harker, and of course, Van Helsing.  This film sticks with the original Bram Stoker novel with these characters.  The only person missing is Renfield, plus nothing is ever mentioned about Dracula being able to turn into a bat, a werewolf, or mist.  Yes, this was 1958 before visual effects were what they are now.  But, in the Bela Lugosi film, at least mention is made of these things.<br />Lee is smooth as the Count, and Peter Cushing is a delight at Professor Van Helsing.  These two were great together in other films, and it is too bad Cushing did not continue into the sequels (with the exception of the present day setting films).  He would have made those films better and much more entertaining to watch.<br />A must have for any horror film fan.
6305903182|2.0|Scream 3 is very fun, funny and is entertaining through out. But unfortinatly it is not at all scary. If you are in the mood for a fun film to watch with your friends you found it. If you won't an edge of your seat thriller look some place else. Scream 1 and 2 are much better.

0451167716|5.0|Everyone once in a long while comes along a book that would forever stand out in the midst of all its contemporaries and get etched into the consciousness of the general populace. One such book is Godfather, a modern day masterpiece by Mario Puzo. This book, a classic of our modern times has been widely read and appreciated for over a quarter of a century and has even been adopted into three of the most popular motion pictures ever.<BR> In this book, Puzo delivers unto us a spellbinding tale of the American Mafioso of the Sicilian origin. The intricately woven plot revolves around the lives of the family members and associates of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone, who is portrayed as a man of immense bulk and even immense power in every place, yet over staying out of the limelight. It delves deeply into the lives of the Don, his family and his associates and henchmen. It gives us a ringside view of an American born Sicilian son's vendetta against his father's attackers, his time in hiding and ultimately his rise as the Don upon his father's death. Through out the book, there is always the feeling that even the Mafiosi have their own families that they care deeply about, as is evident from their actions. At times, even these bloodthirsty `animales' seem humane, an achievement on Puzo's part. <BR> The portrayal of the brutal, remorseless world of the mafia, which is so dark, yet so magnetically charming, is brilliant, at times even mercilessly so. This tale had raised much of a storm in the hearts of it's readers, albeit one of awe and admiration.<BR> Anyone who starts reading this book would never be able to put it down; so engrossing is this tale of an entire underground, invisible, all pervasive, secret society.
B00006RU5B|5.0|this is one of my favourite recent rock cd's from this talented alternative rock band fronted by chris cornell.very highly recommended.five stars.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This off beat musical comedy is too fun, too sick and just plan rolicking for words! <br />The cast is perfectly matched to each character, the do wop Motown ala Crystals combined with Levi's rock out bass as &quot;da plant&quot; draws you onto the screen!<br />One for today's generation, sophisticates and those who want to really enjoy a musical - when it's over, all you want to say is &quot;Wasn't that a lot of fun!&quot;  <br />Rent it, buy it, but ENJOY it.........

B00005JN0A|3.0|Eurotrip was a fun movie, don't get me wrong, but it is nothing like I had imagined.  I just bought this DVD yesterday, and watched it, the laughs aren't very constant and alot of times, it is just stupid.  If you are going to get this, definetly buy the unrated one because some of the unrated scenes make it kinda worth the money.  It should've been better.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Concerts don't get any better than this! What do you get when you have world-class musicians coming together to dedicate a night to a world-class musician such as George Harrison? A world-class production!<BR>Not only are ALL the musicians top notch, they were all friends with George, and their dedication to performing his songs to perfection was obvious - and they came as close to perfection as one could expect.<BR>In my mind, if you're debating about purchasing this DVD, there's only one thing to do - buy it! I've shown this DVD to almost a dozen people, and even the few that were in their 20's (too young to have grown up with George's music, much less The Beatles) were raving about the concert and how well it was done. Simply put, this DVD raises the bar for concert DVD's into the stratosphere. Good luck to those who try to match it's quality; I doubt it will ever be done.<BR>Many thanks to Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Ray Cooper and Olivia Harrision for their production efforts - you've produced a tribute to George he deserved.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This album may not be Dark Side or Wish You Were Here or The Wall, but it is still extraordinary in it's lyrical honesty, musical genius and first class production.  This album is as much a Roger Waters solo as Momentary Lapse of Reason was a Gilmour solo.  Considering Waters true solo efforts, this one shines compared to the others.  Gilmour has one vocal credit (Not Now John) and no songwriting credits, but his guitar solos are predictably excellent.      The album is mostly a collection of WW2 ballads written by Waters ('Hero's Return', 'Gunners Dream', 'Fletcher Memorial') with typical Waters interludes reminiscent of The Wall.  'The Final Cut' and 'Not Now John' are the strongest efforts on the album and each gained considerable airplay when the album was released in 83.  Oddly, when I go to pull a Floyd CD to play, this is often the one I choose. Most true Floyd fans will agree that this album is their 'Final Cut' since the band essentially disbanded after its release.  Gilmour recruited Mason and literally exhumed Richard Wright to stand in on the two post-Waters Floyd Albums (Momentary Lapse and Division Bell).      Take this album for what it is: the final true 'Floyd' album and a sort of follow-up to the Wall.  I love it and play it often.  If you are old enough to remember the MTV videos from this album back in '83, you are lucky.  They were some of the most interesting videos made at the time.
B00013F38K|5.0|An old favorite on mine, and now I remember why.  This is a very special and unique series.  It was so far ahead of its time that after 30 years there is still nothing on TV or cable to match it.  Each episode is not only fun and involving, but also has meaning.  The acting (including the guest appearances by people like a young Jodie Foster) is top notch.  The special features (including in-depth talks with a now older David Carradine) are very high quality, and add to the understanding/enjoyment of the series.
B00003CY6M|4.0|OK, so you know how this movie will end. A guy and a girl meet each other under weird circumstances, fall in love and meet years later because they are meant for each other. Like so often.<br />but it's not bad at all, the clues are very funny and even though it's too absurd it is still funny. A nice 'romantic comedy'.<br />There are some classic moments that couples must have done before or after seeing this movie. Like connecting the dots (freckles) on a girl's arm... sigh... do soulmates really exist?
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|It's uncommon to find some of the finest acting, scripting, and filmmaking that Hollywood can offer all within one motion picture. That's what makes Mystic River so extraordinary. <BR> From the very first scene, Mystic River induces the viewer into a gripping tale that revolves around Jimmy Markum, Dave Boyle, and Sean Devine; three childhood friends who reunite as grown men when Markum's daughter is tragically murdered.<BR> Sean Penn stars as Jimmy Markum, the grieving father who swears vengeance for his daughter's death. An ex-con, Markum utilizes his criminal ties to seek out the identity of his daughter's killer, with intentions to enforce his own justice. Penn succeeds in realistically portraying the emotionally unstable Markum, which can possibly earn him his first Oscar after falling short on three previous opportunities.<BR> Tim Robbins plays the soft-spoken Dave Boyle, whose social disability is a result of being a victim of a disturbing crime as a child. Although he hasn't received as much acclaim as Penn, Robbins is equally effective, if not, better at times in his performance on camera.<BR> The last of the three friends is Kevin Bacon's character, Sean Devine; a detective whose job conflicts with personal life when he takes on the murder case of Markum's daughter. Despite being billed high in the credits, Bacon receives limited screen-time and is often times overshadowed by Laurence Fishburne, who plays his partner, Whitey Powers. <BR> This is one of several lapses that occurred when adapting Dennis Lehane's novel into a motion picture screenplay. The blame lies with the editing department more so than Academy Award-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland, whose chosen dialogue keeps the audience hooked for the 137 minute duration. <BR> Without the superb deliverance of the script by the actors, however, Helgeland's work may have been overlooked.  Rounding out the stellar cast is Laura Linney and Academy Award-winner Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Robbin's wife, Celeste Boyle. <BR> Directed by Clint Eastwood, the filmmaking of Mystic River is what really puts it over the top. Eastwood combines challenging shots with his self-composed score to construct breathtaking scenes that otherwise, would have been less memorable. <BR> Mystic River contains all the components one wants to experience when watching a film; a compelling story, talented acting, and visual excitement. If there has been one movie worth seeing this entire year, Mystic River is an uncanny contender.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I bought this movie on VHS for my kids. I have, and still do buy from Amazon, so imagine my surprise when I realized that this was sold to me by a third company. The VHS arrived at my house BLANK. I sent several emails to this company and never received a reply. Sent emails to Amazon and didnt receive a reply either. Sent the VHS back for exchange or refund and didnt get either. I had already paid my credit card so I could not contest the charge. Most unpleasant transaction. I give the moviw 5 stars because it is EXCELLENT, just DON'T BUY it here!!
B000002UWW|4.0|... I do not know if I can add anything else to this great compilation of anti-hits with the obvious excpetion of Under the Bridge. <BR>Overall all of the musicianship is very solid, everybody loved Flea's wild bass playing and the guitar work is also very proficient. <BR>The two polarities in this album are the covers. Higher Ground is a spectacular cover that gives a different but not worse feel to a Stevie Wonder classic. Fire on the other hand adds a worse, unoriginal feel to the Jimi Hendrix classic. <BR>Some of the band's best and most fuinky material of their early years is also missing but for all those that own the albums this is no biggie. However the compilation faisl as a good introduction to either The Red Hot Chili Peppers or to their early years. I would not buy any of their compilations, but would instead focus on buying the individual albums.
B0000CE742|5.0|This is the Cher compilation to buy. There is none out there that is as comprehensive as this one. Buy the Canadian import (this version) because it contains a lot of tracks (heck a whole other disc) that were not on the US version. This version came out in Canada shortly after I saw Cher in concert in Calgary on August 25th. A night I'll never forget. She is a class act, and when you listen to this collection, you understand why she's been around so long, and still has staying power. She's been through so many changes throughout her career, some things have worked, others haven't, but she's still Cher. Everything from her current hits like &quot;Song For The Lonely&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song&quot;, &quot;All Or Nothing&quot;, to her 80s work including &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;, &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, her 70s work including &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, &quot;Dark Lady&quot;, and her duets with then husband Sonny Bono such as &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, &quot;Baby Don't Go&quot;, and many others. Overall a very comprehensive collection, THE Cher collection to own!
B00008G6EZ|3.0|Nos encontramos ante una version con puntos altos y puntos bajos, grabada en Zurich en 1999 (no 1954 como aqui se dice). Para comenzar, el montaje casi minimalista de JURGEN FLIMM es totalmente aburrido y falto de ideas. En lo vocal, RODNEY GILFRY es un gran Don Giovanni, tanto en lo fisico como en lo vocal mientras que ISABEL REY compone una notable Donna Anna, sensible y bien cantada. CECILIA BARTOLI como Donna Elvira compensa una emision un tanto descontrolada con una actuacion escenica de antologia. LASZLO POLGAR es un Leporello un tanto engolado, pero muy interesante en lo escenico. LILIANA NIKITEANU (Zerlina) y OLIVER WIDMER (Masetto) estan discretos, mas el que ella. ROBERTO SACCA como Don Ottavio consigue una buena actuacion global y MATTI SALMINENN un soberbio Comendatore.<BR>NIKOLAUS HARTNONCOURT al frente de los cuerpos estables de la Opera de Zurich (mejor la orquesta que el coro) realiza una gran lectura de la partitura mozartiana.<BR>Una lastima, porque con unos cambios en el reparto y un buen montaje hubiera sido una version extraordinaria, pero se queda en una version correcta.<BR>Como alternativas, no dejen de ver la pelicula que dirige musicalmente Furtwangler o la version en teatro de Muti desde la Scala.

BUT, it gave us some spectacular matches, including a great triple threat and a hell of a WWE title match.<br />UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>Big Show (c) v. Jon Cena ***1/2<BR>Great opening match. Cena just looks so so so excited to be there. Big Show preforms well in losing his title.<br />WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>RVD/Booker T (c) v. The Dudley Boyz v. La Resistance v. Jindrak/Cade **<BR>Again, tag team wrestling has gone to hell. I'd really like to see just two teams go at it for once. Enough of this stuff. Fast paced, but it puts me to sleep.<br />Christian v. Chris Jericho ****<BR>Besides the title matches, this was by far the match of the night. Jericho was his usual brilliant self, but it was Christian who stole the show in this one. He's probobly the most underrated star in the WWE right now. He's moving up fast and earned a well-deserved mania victory. Not a dull moment with one hell of a twist in the end.<br />Rock n Sock v. Evolution ****<BR>Another good match. Not the greatest in terms of wrestling, but by FAR the most purely entertaining match of the night. Rock and Flair are hysterical together. Foley is just oozing with class and puts over Orton. Orton does his part too. Very fun match.<br />PLAYBOY EVENING GOWN MATCH<BR>Sable/Torrie v. Stacy/ Miss Jackie *<BR>Matt Hardy was left off of the card for this. Awful<br />CRUSERWEIGHT OPEN **1/2<BR>I'm not a big big fan of Cruserweights, but I was excited for this match and a little let down. I thought it was going to More of a battle royal type thing or at least the format they had with Chavo mixed in insted of at the end. Not bad though. Billy Kidman impresses big time.<br />Brock Lesnar v. Bill Goldberg **<BR>Stone Cold shouldn't have been involved in this to begin with. Brock announcing he was leaving and Goldberg almost def. leaving really put the crowd on edge. They really rode both of theseguys bigtime. The match was just bad all the way down. Circumstance and poor booking killed this match. Biggest dissapointment of the night by a long shot.<br />WWE Tag Team Titles<BR>Scotty/ Rikishi(c) v. APA v. The Bashams v. TWGTT **<BR>TWGTT really put on a cool show here. Again nothing to get excited about though. Typical tag team bore fest.<br />WOMENS CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>Molly Holly v. Victoria(c) **1/2<BR>I'm not the greatest fan of women's wrestling, but lemme tell ya, these girls can put together a hell of a match. For women this was outstanding. The hair stipulation also added to it. I enjoyed it.<br />WWE CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>Eddie Guererro(c) v. Kurt Angle *****<BR>Thrilling match. Technical materpeice. Great Ending. I knew this would be good going in, but this match really blew me away. Loved every second of it.<br />The Undertaker v. Kane ***<BR>Super hyped match. A great return for the dead man, it's just this match was SO predictable. The two worked a little slow, but for entertainment value alone, I'll give this an extra star.<br />WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>Triple H(c) v. Shawn Michaels v. Chris Benoit *****<BR>Off the charts. Second best mania main event I have ever seen besides the Rock and SCSA at WM17... Still, a phenominal match with an AMAZING spot on the table, good use of the outside area... what impressed me is that we didn't see any weapons used. They put together such and incredibly entertaining match and the ending is appropriate. Benoit was way way way overdue for the moment, but then again, that's what made it so special. Best ending to a wrestlemania ever.
B0001932ZA|3.0|Let's make one thing clear-- this is not a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It is painfully dated in its look and feel, much of the acting is marginal (Arnie has improved a LOT since!), and the musical score reminds one of nothing so much as a bad mid-80's teen angst hairspray-fest. Maybe a porno. A bad one at that.      But I love this movie! I find the silly dialog and excessive violence (and there are PLENTY of both!!!) more ironic then anything else. The choice of Richard Dawson as the host of the \\"Running Man\\" show proves to me that irony was what the producers were going for.       This disk is worth buying just to watch the Battle of the Future Governors. Ventura v. Arnie. The irony grows...      My wife and I have debated the value of this movie for years (OK, I keep telling her what a great flick this is, and she rolls her eyes and laughs at me). I have defended it as a brilliant if somewhat cheesy social commentary.. She thinks its a dumb explolsion-fest (truth is, we're both right...). When it came out, it would have been easy to dismiss this as a silly vision of the future, but not today. Mix together WWF wrestling, Survivor, Fox News, and Cops, and-- guess what?-- you've got Running Man! Show this one as a double-feature with RoboCop (make RoboCop the second feature- its wittier, more ironic, more violent. But the music is just as bad).      On to the DVD-- the video is probably as good as one can expect from a medium-budget movie of the day. Not bad, considering, but the picture is often a bit muddy and soft around the edges. Again, you can only milk so much out of the source, and this aint exactly 'Gone With the Wind', so you can only expect so much effort in the remastering. The DTS track is really a waste for this movie-- I got nothing extra out of the dialog or sound effects from the higher-end sound. The score sounded very clean, but, well, the score sucks, so whats the point?      I feel compelled to make a comment on the one Feature added to the movie-- the short documentary on the Patriot Act. First, its mediocre, and had the feel of something slapped together. Second, I think a piece on manipulation of the media would have fit better with the theme of the movie. It was an adequate, factual piece, though, and it is a sensible, but not perfect addition to this disk. I do not understand so-called Republicans that bristle at this sort of stuff, though. Have you all lost sight of what a \\"conservative\\" actually is? Read the Church Report that blew the lid of of J Edgar Hoovers wierdness when he chaired the FBI (mentioned too briefly in the feature). Look at the authors. Goldwater. Baker. REAL conservatives who saw big opressive government as the biggest threat to our nation. I find it silly and tasteless to see what is quite obviously a co-ordinated assault against anything that doesnt suit the views of the current administration as part of these reviews.
B000002NFM|5.0|Some albums stand out from the pack either because they are unique or outstanding.  <br />\\"The Fat of the Land\\" by The Prodigy stands out for both reasons.  As any good dance album should, \\"The Fat of the Land\\" provides a raucous good time from start to finish.  It is full of energy and inculcates the listener with that energy -- I think it's impossible to not feel like moving when this album is playing.  Moreover, I really don't think that there is even one remotely weak song on this album.  <br />However, what differentiates this album from others of its kind is that it is an odd dichotomy of dark and forboding and yet pounding and fast at the same time.  I think that it serves up a different sound that I really haven't heard since.  <br />\\"Breathe\\" and \\"Firestarter\\" are the two songs that people would be most familiar with -- and they weren't hits for nothing; they are contagiously feral and to this day their sound holds up.  In addition to those two, I really like the songs \\"Smack My Bi*ch Up\\" (the song is just flat out pure energy -- you become its b*tch as it smacks you upside the head and exhorts you to dance, to move, to do anything but just sit there on your hands), \\"Funky Sh*t\\" (my favorite on the album due to its slightly eerie sound), and \\"Narayan\\".  <br />If I feel the need to pump up the stereo with something that is fast-paced and energetic, I usually reach first for \\"The Fat of the Land.\\"  If you are a little tired of what the 2000s have served up so far and want to go back in time and explore the 90s, this is definitely one worth checking out.  I'd be very surprised if \\"The Fat of the Land\\" didn't grab you.
0780622553|3.0|This movie leads the viewer through a maze of incredible imagery. The city above is neo-grunge, but the Strangers' city below is a bizarre Art Deco noir. The Strangers redesign that city above, every day, in amazing scenes of rubbery, expanding skyscrapers. The city below is filled with dark, cavernous spaces and monumental icons of unknown meaning. (The Strangers also defined the trenchcoat look later popularized by The Matrix.)<br />The story has that Kafka feeling about it that is blatantly fictional, but still sounds true to that frightened little voice in the back of the mind. The city and everyone in it are manipulated every night at midnight by dark forces for dark purposes. Each morning, that facts of history have been altered. The population's memory has also been altered to match. All of the past has been changed, switched onto a new track -- except for one man.<br />It's quite amazing how, with such a strong start, the movie falters so badly. There was much more to be made of this plot, and much better use to be made of Jennifer Connelly. The Strangers never managed to make much sense - despite the nominal purpose for their experiment, they show little interest in its outcome. In the end, the incredible visuals carry the movie.<br />I like this one for its imagery and for the Twilight Zone sense of its beginning. It could have been more, but that's enough.
0743490304|4.0|Excitting novel from begging to the shocking end.I liked the Robert Lungen novels better but still found this novel full of twists to keep you reading.
1563890119|3.0|I'm a late-comer to the Sandman series, but it's become one of my favorites. I read these collections of the original comics out of order, as I encounter them, and started with some of the later collections.<br />That's why I found this Sandman such a surprise. I really didn't like it that much. I think it suffered from two big problems. First was a problem of the comics business: there's nearly no such thing as a new series. The big publishers, at least when Sandman first came out, felt the need to graft new characters onto old story lines, perhaps to spark initial sales. Sandman really didn't benefit from that surgery.<br />Second and more understandable is that a new series, esp. something so different from DC's usual, needs a little time to find itself. The good news is that, by the end of this collection, the Sandman story line really did seem to come into its own. The last piece in this book, 'The Sound of Her Wings,' is the Sandman I've come to enjoy. I'm just worried that new readers might be disappointed by this book and not come back to the later, better work.<br />This isn't bad by any means, it's just a fitful start to an exceptional series. After this, it just gets better.
1400032717|4.0|Excelent from start to begging.The main character Christopher is well writen you'll get lost in his imagenation.A great book for a book club.The only thing is the story at times drag's on but then it gets back into the humor and emotion.Highly recomand this book.You'll love it.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|OK, so. Let me start off. I used to hate Avril. I hated her old CD too. It was just too much of a pop CD for me, and so it just annoyed me. But i then decided i would try this CD, and see if she had matured anymore. And she did! The CD is actually pretty good. Now dont start thinking im some teenybopper or some Avril wanna-be, because im not. I actually dont like Avril as a person because she's such a hypocrit, and the fact that she was in the music buisness at such an early age, and one minute saying she writes hard-core punk songs and that shes punk, and then the next minute saying shes not punk, that she doesnt lable herself. The music buisness just kinda tore her apart on the whole lable thing. But, if the songs are good, i dont care who sings it, and in this case, most of the songs are pretty good. Yea, there are alot of &quot;oh,oh,oh's&quot; and &quot;yeah's&quot; and she does have some repetitive lyrics, but her lyrics have gotten better, and they're about more important issues then this guy being a &quot;sk8r boi&quot;. But i must say, Avril's music has gotten better.

1592400876|5.0|\\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\" by Lynne Truss entertained me. I learned a few things, too.<br /><br />Truss takes to task the errant punctuation found through common language. She even finds problems in Amazon.com reviews. I cannot disagree; my own reviews are littered with errors. She cites a review of Hugh Grant's movie \\"About a Boy\\". The reviewer, like so many of us, did not proofread his work, and left his shame available in review form.<br /><br />While claiming not to be about class distinction, in the British sense George Bernard Shaw meant to reduce in \\"Pygmalion,\\" she still comes across as arrogant. There is no way to avoid this poise of authoritative injunction. Punctuation is a perfect science with imperfect applications. We readers tolerate (or completely miss) errors because we understand both the message and the messenger.<br /><br />Truss' examples are humorous. Her writing is bright, with all British overtones. These overtones were resident in the original English edition, and the copy published in America is verbatim. It works to highlight the accidents of poor punctuation pervasively nicking our writing. By selectively altering a comma here and there, she shows how meaning is sometimes entirely changed. That's good to remember.<br /><br />She is clear in the beginning to say this is not a grammar book. Grammar is not punctuation, she correctly says. However, she misleads the reader into believing this is a punctuation book. It's not. It is about punctuation, with many stories, anecdotes, tales and lessons teaching proper punctuation. The book never closes in on being purely a list of 'dos and don'ts'. It is valuable for that, especially as her style welcomes the reader more than the standard reference book on the topic. She encompasses punctuation as the basis for her book, but Truss never lets the method arrest its entertainment value.<br /><br />Intelligent readers for whom the use of language matters will indubitably learn something.<br /><br />Throughout are citings of the kinds of punctuation mistakes forwarded in e-mails by editors to their friends.<br /><br />This book is a primer, at best, but completely incomplete. We are taught quickies in the usage of apostrophes, commas, colons, ellipses, semicolons, dashes and, in her estimation, the rarely used hyphen.<br /><br />Who should read \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\"? Smug freshman copyediting students and their pretentious high school counterparts, full-time professional editors who need to remember they are not alone, anyone who makes a living joining letters on a page, and junior high school English teachers who need never forget that even their best efforts will not teach every student. Most of all, as I'm confident Truss would agree, amateur book reviewers like myself should read this; we could learn the proper use of a semicolon.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\" by Lynne Truss. It will not replace your AP, Chicago, MLA or APA stylebooks, but it will add to your enjoyment of their much-needed use.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comare citings of the kinds of punctuation mistakes forwarded in e-mails by editors to their friends.

B00006690H|5.0|well as many of u probabley already know, eminems other cds( slim shady lp, mm lp) wernt really that &quot;edited&quot; but this is actually edited. i like what they use to edit the sounds: dj record spinning, cats meowing,and stuff like that. u should get this cd.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|No one could have been more excited to get this CD than I was, but after a couple of run throughs, the dissapointment of a lossed opportunity prevailed.  If you listen to the intro guitar parts, played by Clapton with great feeling for the style of the period, you can hear the potential of this project.  Then, a rather mediocre band kicks in and the thing just decends into competent, rather messy, bar band covers.  The cover and title of the CD lead one to believe that this is Clapton and Johnson, face to face.  Instead Clapton apparently felt he needed a lot of help to face up to his hero, and there he ultimately failed.  If Clapton had had the courage to have faced up to task and really done this solo, as it should have been done, he would probably have triumphed.  As it turns out, though, this is a failure. Hearfelt, yes.  Respectful, yes.  Fawning, perhaps.  But still we have a man who could just not step up to the plate.  Have faith, though.  Some day, Mr. Clapton might have the courage to revisit this project and do what he should have done this time.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|ok i would just like to say avril has an incredibal voice. she is creative and also her music comes with truth to it and i would just like to say it is a great album and you should buy a copy of it and im shure she will have more and more albums in the futer and truly will be an icon in the music industry at one point in time in her life not just one of thouse one hit wounders.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This movie was a bonefide stinker.<BR>Severe over-acting by the stars and a plot that was so obvious that only someone who couldn't figure out the ending to the weekly A-Team episode would be kept wndering.<BR>Sean Penn will never be the godfather that Brando was.  He shouldn't even try.  Even the ending was pathetic.  <BR>The only good performers, and they they were good, in this whole movie were the two goon friends of the Father. I gave it one star because there wasn't anything lower.<BR>I watched this because of the Academy Awards garnered by but not deserved by the two stars.  They Academy ought to rethink its policy of giving awards based on popularity and actually give awards based on performance.
B00008MNYS|5.0|This is his best CD.  His DVDs are the best, but if you can't get a DVD, this is the best bet.
0385336810|5.0|Finding &quot;Chick Lit&quot; to match the funny wit of this writer is certainly difficult. Written in the 1st person, Kinsella turns her heroine (Emma) into a lovable stand-out. Fans of the Shopaholic series will not be disappointed with the almost-familiar shenanigans of the heroine. <br />This love story is like a modern day knight-in-shining-armor tale, but with a delightful spin: the so-called damsel-in-distress is actually self-empowered and feisty. You find yourself cheering her on as she jumps from scrape to scrape in a delightful way. <br />Emma is a lovable character that the female masses can relate to. Fast-paced and funny, this is an excellent summer read that any woman can devour.
0446677450|5.0|I have to agree, IN FACT, I can't agree more with that reviewer from Texas, USA who  said that this book by Robert Kiyosaki changed his life. It changed mine too. But a word of caution, this is one of those books that you boss hopes you never read.<br />Your friends and relatives won't be too optimistic either, unless of course they have read it and tried some of the ideas presented in the book.<br />My advice: If you want to learn anything, learn from someone who has done it. RTK has done it. Retired at 48 with a book that that has and continues to be a best seller now for 9 years, a book that is revolutionizing America and the World.<br />Thank you Robert!
B00001W9G0|5.0|I've seen this movie many, many times. I can be brought to tears by watching JUST the last scene. This movie is a true visceral experience.<br />Characters that could have been stereotyped are incredibly complex and true. And that's a big part of the story. We go through life and label people, yet we just don't know what might truly lie beneath.<br />Katie and Hubble see what lies beneath. How we don't know. Two soul mates who come into each other's lives but cannot stay. I know all of this sounds sentimental but this is a truly sentimental favorite.<br />Watch this movie!!
B000002NIW|5.0|I hate it when people compare Deftones to Korn, Limp Bizkit, or any other nu-metal band out there. In fact, I hate the fact that people label music and the labels they give can come across as 'cool' or 'uncool' at any given time. The truth is, Deftones do their own thing. They do what they want, and don't compromise for anyone- which is what makes this cd so awesome. It's what makes the band themselves awesome. I've come across many people who love the Deftones, many who hate them, and many who think they're 'alright'. I guess you have to make your own mind up, but for me, the Deftones rule.<br />If you love heavy yet melodic rock music which is aggressive and violent but at the same time ethereal and soothing, then this is for you. Hell, if you like this sort of music, you should own this album already! Classic stuff. My fav song on here is Be Quiet and Drive, and yes, I know that's a cliche, but words can't actually do justice to how good this song is. My Own Summer also kicks serious ass- it was the first song I heard of them, and I haven't looked back. All the songs on here will rock you. Even Damone, which is hidden right at the end of MX, is worth fastforwarding to (and that is saying something given that you have to hold down the button for at least 2-3 minutes solid!)<br />All I can say is, you can find yourself in three categories of emotion towards Deftones: Love, Hate or Tolerance- but if you know what is good for you, you will buy this album NOW and love it for the duration of your rock loving life!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Let me first say that I am a 40 year old man, so proabably have no business buying this cd. But I did so here are my thoughts. I bought it because I liked the first cd &quot;Let Go&quot; so much. I do like this cd. It just gives me a bit a headache. The first three songs she's angry yelling at these guys who are not meeting her expectations. I do like the songs melodies though. They have a heavy metal sound, sort of slow - reminds me a bit of  Evanescence.  Her voice is very produced and there are muli-layers of here voice singing, harmonizing with herself. I like the harmonizing - I like her voice. &quot;He Wasn't&quot; has a &quot;Sk8er Boy&quot; energy to it. I like this one. &quot;How Does it Feel&quot; sounds a bit like &quot;I'm with You&quot; only not as good. She repeats the chorus a lot and then there's a lot of filler &quot;ah ah ah&quot; throughout. But I like it when her voice goes up real high at the end - that's a nice touch. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; another breakup song - catchy chorus. &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is good, nice melody, her voice sounds good on it. I like &quot;Forgotten&quot;, it has an interesting melody - but once again she's kicking some guy's ##ss. I like &quot;Who Knows&quot; has a positive message - nice energy. I like when she sings &quot;...find yourself, be yourself&quot; and she goes up high. I always like that when she does that.  &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; is another breakup song, but this time she's a little more vulnerable - I like this one. &quot;Freak Out&quot; is kind of stupid, but maybe it will appeal to the younger set. &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is a good power ballad, I think it's better than &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;. We're seeing a more mature darker Avril. She's says she writes her material for her age group. And I think she would be right about that. I preferred her first cd...I liked the energy in it more. I thought the songs were better and I think it had a more universal appeal. She was cute, now she's angry and yelling a lot. She's in the terrible two's stage.  I'm looking forward to her next phase, where she relaxes a little.
B000268QB2|4.0|I keep reading many reviews where people compare Keane to Coldplay. While I do see the simmilarities, you don't have to like Coldplay to like Keane.<br />The only song I love by Coldplay is Yellow. The background music in many Coldplay songs is wonderful, but the melodies bore me. In Keane however, I find both the vocals and instrumentation beautiful! Keane's songs are a bit more upbeat than most Coldplay songs.<br />So why didn't I give them five stars? I only give my very VERY favorite CDs five stars. I wish I could have given them four and a half stars, but that wasn't an option.<br />So don't look over this CD just because you're not a fan of Coldplay. Listen to the clips and give it a chance. You'll probably be glad you did!
6305841861|5.0|ED2 has got to be one of the baddest, coolest Horror flick ever!<BR>Bruce Cambell kicks ass in this movie!  <br />The DVD is good too.  But the movie was what you're looking for.<BR>Im not gonna explain the story but I will say this is a very UNDERRATED FLICK!  The story is original and the acters are pretty good.  <br />It's much more funny than scary.<br />But a word of warning: This film is brutaly violent.  Just watch when Ash has to sacrafice his arm and you'll know what I mean.<br />This is an over all Awesome flick to watch at home with the lights off.  I personaly enjoyed this better than the first.  This is also one of my favorite horror flicks.<br />GET IT!!<br />Later.....
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Subliminal is a good album. But where's tha hate of Slipknot?? If I wanted to listen to Stone Sour, I would bought a Stone Sour album! It seems that Corey and his bandmates let the industry took them down. Come back to the Hell, guys!
B000002KHH|5.0|This CD makes me messy. I love it and all, but I get myself all brushed and neat in the morning, and then I put this CD on, and an urge to bang my head comes on, and I get messy. But you can see why I have this headbanging urge. This is one of the essential metal CDs. It would be impossible to not bang your head while listening to such metal classics as 'Iron Man', 'Paranoid', and 'War Pigs'. It was also Black Sabbath's highest-charting album in the US. And I can see why.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This is by far the worst of the Terminator series. It has almost no story, no character development, horrible humor (the gay strip club scene made me cringe in horror), it was just a piss poor movie. With out James Cameron at the helm it went downhill fast, the story (the little tiny bit there was) was just one 2 hour long chase scene, the acting by everybody but Arnold was piss poor, the special effects weren't as good as in T2, again this is a very bad movie, do not buy this movie.<BR>Anybody praising this movie has no idea what makes a good movie, period. I'm sure if you liked T3 you probably also loved New York Minute with the Olsen twins, and any Barney movie.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was the best film I saw that came out in 2003, maybe coming in close to &quot;Monster&quot;, however by the time that film opened in my city it was '04, but maybe that doesn't count. Other reviewers called this movie boring or pointless, but you just have to enjoy the fact that this movie isn't really complex, but instead its simplicity is what makes it so good. Instead of all the C.G.I. blockbusters out there now, it's nice to see a movie that completely focuses on human elements. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is really just about a relationship two people develop at semi-confusing times in their lives, and how that relationship develops into something important to them. If you think you could find yourself interested in this very simple but captivating storyline, you'll love this movie. Sofia Coppola relies on shots of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson kissing each other goodnight or looking at each other to make you interested rather than creating tons of computer-generated monsters. Sure, people go to movies for an otherworldly cinematic experience, which is always nice, but this film proves that movies don't always have to go to insane levels to be great. However, even though some of the people who knocked this movie seem very closed-minded, I'm a 16 year old male who usually doesn't care to see movies that don't have action or violence, and I still loved this movie.

B00025ETIW|2.0|If you liked their first album, 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love', reconsider buying their second album.  It isn't a bad album, but after 2 years their style has changed.  It lacks the punch that the first one had, and it also has a more mainstream sound that a lot of bands have adopted.  Perhaps their lyrics still have the same meanings, but even their single 'I'm Not Ok (I Promise)' sounds like a cross between a Christmas song and some pop-punk band.  Overall, buy it if you are willing to accept their new style and seemingly new guitar style.  If you were hardcore a My Chemical Romance supporter, be prepared to be dissapointed.  I sure was.
0156027321|5.0|This book will make you rethink your relationship with God, whoever it, he, she is if indeed it, he, she exists, with animals, and most importantly with yourself.  I own a very, very large dog, the sweetest animal on earth, and I found fascinating the descriptions of Pi's interaction with the animals on the boat as they effectively mirrored the beginning stages of my relationship with my dog, whom I rescued.  When I rescued him, he weighed over a hundred pounds and was a very sick street dog.  It took us 6 months to get to know each other, for him to realize that while he was welcome in my home, my bed, my heart, they all belonged to me, as did he.  I now belong to him, much as this book belongs to me and I to it.  My relationship with Sasha was and is much the same as the interaction between Pi, the lifeboat, the animals.  A rarity of a book in that it is easy to read yet NEVER simple; it makes you ponder everything, all the while bringing a smile to your face; it is sad and filled with loss yet replete with joy and hope.  How could you not enjoy it?
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this album is amazing.  the whole feel is something of early beatles, but with more...well, it's got something i've not often heard.  the variety of mood throughout the album is great, as there is a clear contrast between \\"cold hard bitch\\" and \\"timothy,\\" but other songs maintain a happy medium between high and low energy (a prime example of this being \\"lazy gun\\").  All in all, the best thing i bought since Boston's debut album.
B000069AUI|5.0|Though the lyrics are kept simple, the songs in AROBTTH are perfect and have full of meaning. There, as many people say, is an unusual, unique sound existent in every song on this album that has the ability to hook you and make you listen to each one at least 10 times. <br />-Politik- begins loud and thought-provoking and ends with something like a plea from Mr.Martin. <br />-In My Place- has this crooning effect that even though, somewhat irritating to some, it still has that click that forces you to listen to it over and over again. <br />-God Put A Smile Upon Your Face- is an extremely catchy, feet-stamping song with lyrics that question you from all sides.<br />-The Scientist- is sort of a power ballad, but has to be the saddest song in the whole album. It's lyrics can make you cry even if nothing in them applies to you. <br />-Clocks- had this awesome, dreamy, surreal feeling and takes you on this unforgettable ride that you want to take over and over again. Eventhough its been over-played like Yellow, it is still a worthy listen.<br />-Daylight- is hypnotizing and dare i say it, somewhat psychedelic. It gives you the feeling of taking a drug, like Heroin, but you'll wake up from it unharmed.<br />-Green Eyes-, though i don't really listen to it, is a slow, gentle song, like a soft wind. Eventhough it does build up in the chorus, it maintains a lazy, leisurely pace. <br />-Warning Sign- is a song that has Mr.Martin wailing in the chorus, and the end is my favourite part. The end gives you a feeling of fear but at the same time comfort, which i find very alluring. <br />-A Whisper- takes a swift turn and crashes into a whole mess of guitar riffs and loud bangs, but is still a very uplifting song.<br />-A Rush Of Blood To The Head-, the title track, is possibly the most perfect and beautifully written song of the whole album. Its one that you want to close your eyes and tuck into with, and listen a million times no matter how controversial it is.<br />-Amsterdam-, somewhat of a follow-up to AROBTTH, is also one stunning song that hasn't gained its deserved recognition. It builds up at the end and i find, really sums up the whole album.<br />Overall, one great, brilliant album from a very skilled band. Enjoy!

0671042858|3.0|This book was definitely a slow mover and not what is a normal Stephen King novel.  Though, I have to admit, I had to finish the book because I needed to know if and how the little girl gets out of the woods.
0385507755|5.0|If you have ever felt need beyond yourself, this book will resonate in your soul.  If you have ever looked back at everything you have shattered, this book will resonate in your soul.  If you ever ask yourself &quot;why?&quot;, this book will resonate in your soul.  As you read, you will curl up in a ball and hurt, cry, curse, mutter.  You will feel sick, not from what you are reading, but from what it stirs up inside.  Still, you will not put it down.  If you feel sick from the words and imagery of the book, then you will not understand it.  If, despite the pain, you look forward to a better tomorrow, then this book is for you.  I could not more highly recommend this book.  Pure genius.

B00006SFLV|4.0|I LOVE this show.  I didnt watch it when it was on air, but I was flipping channels &amp; came across it.  I had heard about it so I decided to watch it. And now im addicted!  This show is just really well written, &amp; the preformances by all the actors are amazing. I LOVE RAYANNE!! but I wish this dvd would be cheaper.  i think 40 dollars would be good.  By the way, if you cant wait until you buy this, they show it regularly on NickNoggin.

0671027387|4.0|Well written as usual.  Fast paced and hard to put down.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|There is evil here. Darkness in claustrophobic Boston apartments. Not all the accents were right, but the apartments were. Great acting, great writing, great direction. Great minor characters, those two in the bar with Tim Robbins, I've known guys like that. And one mother, a minor character standing between rooms, whose evil is shattering. You will not forget this movie.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|There is always controversy about Britney's image, her lip-syncing etc. This album she at least co-writes half of her song, and takes full credit for the beautiful ballad &quot;Everytime&quot;. I personally don't especially like the Ying Yang Twins, but the song 'Boom Boom' is quite good. With Brit's first single &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;, it unfortunately bombed on the charts, but the remix on the album makes the song a bit better to listen to. Every song on this album has some unique sound, which is somewhat rare for Britney's last couple of albums. My favorite songs would be (1)Everytime [beautifully written and goes wonderfully with Britney's voice] (2)Toxic [one of brit's best singles] (3)Showdown [amazing chorus] (4)Shadow [excellent ballad] (5)(I've Got That)Boom Boom [great chorus and beat]
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Prior to watching this film, some understandings of the Japanese culture is highly recommended.<br />In the Japanese language, there's no pronunciation to distinguish between the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; sounds. They do not roll their tongue when speaking so the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; sounds come out to be the same. The Japanese term for &quot;to cover&quot; can also mean &quot;to close&quot; when translated literally.<br />The most common S&amp;M fantasy in the Japanese adult video involves a woman role-playing as a victim who is continuously struggling, moaning, and yelling out &quot;stop!&quot; as the man removes her clothes.<br />A Japanese talk show with a whacky and goofy looking host is called a &quot;variety show&quot;. It's a type of unstructured, anything-goes TV program that usually offers various contents geared toward viewers of all ages.<br />In Japan, people often tie folded notes to a &quot;wish-making tree&quot;. It's the Japanese version of a wish fountain.<br />Hot-Pot is a popular way of Asian dining (especially during winter season) where customers cook their own food in a boiling pot and then dip it in sauce that's mixed accordingly to their own taste. The benefit of cooking your own food in a restaurant is that there's no clean-up afterwards.<br />&quot;Lost in Translation is by all accounts a huge film. Telling of a 50-something married man and a 20ish married woman - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship. It is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human. Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals, this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals. Lost in Translation will speak most loudly to anyone who has ever experienced the love which could never be.&quot; (IMDB)
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is alot better than hybrid theory to me. The song &quot;Faint&quot;is what made me buy this cd. Most of it has the same hopeless,sad,and painful feeling to it like hybrid theory only more intense and enraged. Maybe LP will stay on the harder rock side. After a while you'll get tired of it, but still want to play it every now and then. And don't even listen to what other people say they obviously aren't real LP fans. I say if you love hybrid theory, go buy this cd as soon as possible.
6305603847|5.0|hey! dont bad mouth the film just cuzz u dont get it. Its not supposed to have plot. Its about a guy whos mind is messed up cuzz his dad died. Most pplz minds wouldnt make sence if that happend to em. Its like music videos of the soul. If u dont get it, then shut up! Ur not supposed to make fun of sumthing u dont get. God. Can somebody tell me what war his dad was fighting in? by the way, if u understand it, its a great movie. If u dont, its pretty trippy, so watch it! Especially the exploding bird.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Ms. Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman. Like her peer Christina Aguilera, Britney equates maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but since she's not as dirrty as Xtina, her spin is a little different. Where Christina comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is the girl next door cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since this is the first time she can indulge herself. And that's what In the Zone is -- Britney indulging herself, desperate to prove that she's an adult. She has been freed from her musical parent, Max Martin, who is absent for the first time from a Spears album, choosing instead to play the field and work with a bunch of different collaborators, including Madonna, Moby, the Matrix, Trixster, Roy \\"Royality\\" Hamilton, Bloodshy & Avant, and R. Kelly. Since she's so determined to be a woman, not a girl, she has completely shed the sugarcoated big hooks and sappy love songs that drove her stardom, concentrating on music that glides by on mellow grooves or hits hard with its hip-hop beats. It's all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern -- it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums -- in particular, Moby's \\"Early Mornin'\\" has a sleek feel, Mark Taylor's \\"Breathe on Me\\" is alluring, and the Bloodshy & Avant productions, \\"Showdown\\" and \\"Toxic,\\" are irresistible ear candy in what is surely Britney's most ambitious, adventurous album to date.
B000068TPN|2.0|I will admit right now, I am no fan of Mel. He is very talented as an actor and film maker; there is no doubt about that.  But I think he's always had an extreme Christian-right leaning agenda that he managed to keep somewhat hidden for decades, and in this film, his veil of secrecy is clearly removed.  Forget about the whys and morals of that particular war, he indicates.   You get from Gibson that the real point is that war is bloody hell and we may as well win while we're at it, and we have plenty of practice with it.  And to hell with all those peace loving naysayers.  So in effect, his film throws our society back another 30 years.  Stick with the real Vietnam films like MASH, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket.  Even Hamburger Hill made more sense than this piece of junk.
B00003CXCT|3.0|3 stars since the movies are great.  But I am one of those fans that thinks Lucas is ruining the Star Wars legacy.  I don't mind minor changes to make the effects look better, etc...but when you change the basis of the characters and add to the storyline with your \\"improvements\\", we have a problem (Greedo shooting first, Han's meeting with CGI Jabba).<br />Some people will say, \\"It's his film...he'll do what he wants.\\" Certainly.  Nobody's denying that.  But I think the main point people forget is that it's the FANS that make movies great.  Not to suggest that box office take is suggestive of artistic appeal, but if the FANS hadn't eaten up the original trilogy, Lucas would be broke.  Now that I think of it, if Lucas was broke again maybe that would encourage him to get back to the basics of filmmaking and make some good movies again!  But I digress...<br />I WILL be buying this DVD set, but I will always prefer the original untampered classics, and I will always be a supporter of getting the originals on DVD someday...even if it never happens.  Every time Lucas opens a magazine article, or reads a review, or whatever the heck he does during his free time, I want the disgruntled fans staring him in the face saying, \\"You've RUINED Star Wars!\\"<br />Once a film is made, it's made.  Stop living in the past.
1400032717|5.0|This book has a brilliantly captivating opening. A boy finds his neighbour's dog dead with a pitchfork in it. Who killed the dog? He holds the dog to show his sympathy... then the neighbour shows up and asks what he'd done to the dog. \\"The dog is dead,\\" is all he can say. The boy is autistic... his ability to express himself and read others is very poor.<br />Throughout you are trapped in his viewpoint screaming to get out and give him a hand. You want to guide him, defend him... even just get him to say he didn't kill the dog!<br />The killing of the dog sets the boy off on an investigation that changes his life. Through his adventure you explore the world of this young Rainman - where 4 read cars mean a great day and 4 yellow cars mean you need to jam your head in the corner of the room and groan. In him we can see normal human quirkiness taken to the extreme.<br />Warning for parents: This is more of an young adult easy reader than a kid's book. The book touches on sex, affairs and divorce plus some of the language is RA.<br />\\"Let go of the dog,\\" she shouted. \\"Let go of the f*cking dog for Christ's sake!\\"
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Lavigne hasn't only shed her trademark ties for thrift-shop skirts, she's essentially ditched the sound of Let Go too, bringing herself closer to the mature aspirations of fellow young singer/songwriter Michelle Branch. Since Avril is still a teenager and still a brat, it's livelier than Branch. Even when it sags under minor keys and mid-tempos, it's fueled on teen angst and a sense of entitled narcissism, as if she's the first to discover the joys of love and pain of heartache. In a sense, she comes across as Alanis Morissette's kid sister, especially now that the Matrix are gone and the hooks have been pushed to the background for much of the record; it's the teen spin on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, where she's self-consciously trying to grow as an artist. Naturally, this means that Under My Skin is less fun than Let Go since there's nothing as giddy as &quot;Sk8er Boi,&quot; even if much of it is written from a similarly adolescent vantage. Lavigne's collaborators, Kreviazuk and Evan Taubenfeld chief among them, have helped streamline her awkward writing, and her performances are also assured, which almost makes up for the thinness of her voice, which sounds far younger than the meticulous arrangements around it. So, Under My Skin is a bit awkward, sometimes sounding tentative and unsure, sometimes clicking and surging on Avril's attitude and ambition. But it's telling that the one song that really catches hold on the first listen and stands out on repeated spins is &quot;He Wasn't,&quot; the fastest, loudest, catchiest, and best song here, and the one closest to the spirit and sound of Let Go -- it's not that Lavigne hasn't matured, but it's that her talents are better suited on music that's a little less contemplative and deliberate than Under My Skin.
0451191153|1.0|The ultimate kindergarden philosophy posing as something worthwhile.  Nothing is as shallow as the written dialogue between Roarke and anyone he speaks to.  Plus Ms. Rand is expecting us to idolize a rapist.  What a bunch of hooey.  Read anything else and you'll be smarter.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Not more of decriptions or religious skepticism. I have listened to many kinds of music trough over 35 years. I'm particularly fond of Classic, Jazz, Blues, Prog Rock and some Folk. My CD library is around 3,000 albums of these generes combined.In all styles, GOD is the biggest inspiration, and that includes all forms of Art and Literature. In short the best Works Of Art, are of religious matter. Just review Bach, Haendel, Beethoven, Michel Angelo, etc.. etc. So Why should we listen to the detractors? Does anybody thinks that the artists create for everybody? All I can tell you is:buy this album and listen to the geniality of this major composer and be proud you did it while He is still in this world. You don't care for GOD?just proyect THY to Someone you love, and feel the efect of the music. I'm glad it is controversial because is waved the waters of the music scene. You don't have to be a believer to believe in this album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This britney cd is the best cd of hers yet and i think she'll just &quot;try&quot; to get better.
0743244257|1.0|I enjoyed Libra-- or remember enjoying it.  I enjoyed the idea behind The Players and some of his other devices-- the Hitler porno tape in one of his other novels. Though I haven't been lured into Underworld (nor will I after reading Cosmopolis), I had always respected what De Lillo was trying to do.  The vague here-thereness, the disturbing clipped descriptions, the flat menace made all the more menacing for its ordinariness...great stuff!<br />Until I began flipping through Cosmopolis.<br />Sigh.<br />When you dispense with a meaningful plot or characterization and settle solely for atmosphere and dialogue, you've created at best the literary equivalent of white noise--his own creation.  De Lillo has become one of those Important Authors that no longer has to entertain or enlighten or anything.  He's reached the logical end of his journey as a Post-Modernist author and as such created a work that is...what?  An ennervated American Pyscho?  A Bonfire of the Vanities for those afflicted with ADD? <br />Skip this bigtime.
B000003TAB|4.0|This may not be Nirvanas best album but it has great catchy songs like Dive,Sliver and others. All the tracks on this album are demos and b-sides. Some songs were worked on Bleach and Nevermind albums so they technically didn't have a home until 1992. So I give this album 4 stars. This was the last Nirvana album i bought and was totally blown away by most of the songs on this disc.The only complaint I have about this great disc is the original liner notes are not present in the booklet. Der Kommissar you must not know much about Nirvana Krist has always been the bassist in NIRVANA duh! You fool why would you say that?
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie was just a great great REALISTIC movie of what really happened. I didn't really care or thinl about the passion he did until I saw this movie. I give it a 5 on the account. I think Mel Gibson did just a remarkable job, and people should give him more credit.<BR>~ lpcb
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD if Chritstina is one of the best CDs of all! my Favorite songs are impossible, walk away, fighter, make over can't hold us down, infatuation, the voice within, beautiful,underappreciated, and my ALL TIME FAVORITE Dirry. This CD had so much emotion and compassion. I think everybody should buy this CD.
B000002JSP|3.0|This album perfectly illustrates (as many have taken note) a band on the verge of collapse. Previous albums in the Zeppelin catologe, on more than one occasion, have showcased the group's weakness and limitions (Houses of the Holy; though still a great album). And &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot;, along with such pedestrian preddeccors' as &quot;Presence&quot;, and even to a lesser extent, their masterful &quot;Physical Graffti&quot; (probably their best album, second only to their debut) have illustrated the main flaw in Zeppelin's catologe - (most apparent in their later releases), and that is alot of their songs wind up over-playing themselves to the point of over-repition and monotany (and people think Sabbath were repetive - they at least employed various, unpredictable (progessive), unorthodox time changes to such later lambasted releases (Technical Ecstasy &amp; Never Say Die) Zeppelin on the other hand would constantly play, and play (most notably on this album) at mid-tempo, until the song ends at it's tpyically, predictable dead end finale. And anybody looking for some of the typical Zeppelin bombastic rock, should steer clear of this album. As it's nothing but pop/synth stylings... But, for the more open-minded (or die-hard Zep fan) the album will provide a many interesting moment. Not the best, but certainly not the worst album ever made. In Through The Out Door, though, certainly makes Zeppelin's previous effort, &quot;Presence&quot; seem both more pedestrian, yet more inspired all at the same time.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is an excellent cd if you are a teenager. We can totally relate to a 99.99% of the lyrics. Avril truly knows what shes doing!
B00009RGBS|5.0|Catherine Zeta-Jones looks superb and gives a sterling performance in her role as one half of a vaudeville act with her deceased sister (whom she killed because she caught her sleeping with her husband). Renee Zellweger is captivating as the young wannabe who aspires to be something like what Zeta-Jones is in the movie. They both meet up in jail however, because Zellweger kills the man whom she ends up hating, and Zeta-Jones is in jail for killing her sister. They both employ the assistance Richard Gere, the expensive fast-talking successful lawyer, to get out of jail. In the process, they each try to win the favours of the media and grab the headlines of the papers.<br />First, the score, the singing, the dancing are so good that I can watch each scene over and over and still feel the magic in it! Secondly, the acting of course, by each of the actors featured in the movie, is superb. Thirdly, the set production and the costumes were dazzling and so well-coordinated. The director evidently put in a lot of hard work into this and it pays. This is no Moulin Rouge. In this film, the director has done to me what I think Baz Luhrmann couldn't do in Moulin Rouge - which is to successfully blend aspects of film with aspects of musicals seamlessly. The acting is dramatic but each actor fits the role so perfectly that you hardly suspect they're acting... you'd think they are really like that in person! And the music is so well-composed and played, that anyone who watches this will want to dance to it. My daughter is barely 2 years old, and she loves this film like she loves the other film about dancing : Strictly Ballroom. Great entertainment! (unless you're not into musicals...)
B000002MUW|5.0|This Cd is the best. Thats all I have to say. I have no words on how great this CD is.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I heard a couple of her songs while listening to a local station here in Las Vegas that is considered &quot;the old person's station&quot; - I'm 30 and love the music they play, a lot of standard vocalists. Her version of &quot;Slow Boat to China&quot; made me sit up and take serious notice -and even more so when the DJ said she was only 14!!! How could that be?! Such mature talent for such a young age!!! So today I bought her cd and there is not a single song that isn't good - that's a difficult statement to make considering a lot of contemporary artists only offer one or two desirable pieces on their albums. Her interpretations of many of the the songs are impressive. Her vocal talents are incredibly impressive, period. I'm so happy to have found her and to be able to enjoy her voice (I'm currently listening to it for the 4th time in a row! Yes, it's THAT good). Apparently this young lady was influenced by Celine Dion since she was a young child - although, it's interesting because I haven't picked up any Celine-oriented influences, thankfully, because I do not like her singing whatsoever.<br />Anyway, anyone that loves standards and jazz REALLY will be pleased with this cd. I'm proudly adding this cd to my collection of Sarah Vaughn, Shirley Horn, Lena Horne, A.C. Jobim, Diana Krall, etc.
6301773551|5.0|Ah, c'est la vie, the best movie of the trilogy, followed closely by \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  \\"Star Wars\\" is a classic tale of friendship, loyalty, and bravery.  Full of action.  Ah, and this version has no CGI Jabba.  Han shoots first.  Jawa scene where they unload R2 and 3PO.  A lot better than Lucas' pile of dog sh*t the so-called Special Editions.  Go, original theatricals.  Nothing stops these movies in their 1977, 1980 and 1983 debut.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Tom Cruise is John Anderton, a cop in this futuristic thriller. Together with Burgess, they developed PreCrime, a state-run programme which utilises biological and technological advances to predict crimes even before they happen. Three &quot;precogs&quot; (human &quot;mutants&quot; with extraodinarily acute psychic-like abilities) are at the center of this technology. One day at the swimming pool, John's young son is abducted by a mysterious stranger, whom John has never been able to trace. Through a string of premeditated circumstances, John ends up killing a man who was responsible for abducting and (he assumed) killed his son. He gets put away, but that is not it. One of the &quot;precogs&quot; keeps having flashback memories of a woman getting killed, but nobody has been able to trace the killer. Eventually, (I don't want to spoil this for you!) justice is served :)<br />This movie is about the future, but it does make you think : what if one day we can all predict everything that's going to happen,and change them before they happen? Can that be a good thing? I think not. Life is full of choices and possibilities. Once these choices and possibilities are taken away from us, then really, why should we even bother to live it? <br />Premeditating the future is an interesting idea but imagine if someone told you you're gonna kill someone tomorrow. Given the right circumstances, you end up at the point where you are going to kill someone but haven't yet. If you recognise the fact that life is about choice, you know you can prove the prediction wrong by not killing. But if you do not recognise the fact that you can choose what you do and change what they predict about you, then you have really lost the plot - i.e. you'd be just a pawn in someone else's game.<br />Great sci-fi thriller. Very fast paced, very meaningful theme, you never really know what's gonna happen, and great special effects.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|First off I would like to say that this CD is better than Let Go. Avril's voice has matured, her songs sound more personal, and they have more meaning to them. My favorite song on the CD has to be #12 Slipped Away, it was decated to her grandfather who passed away. My other favorites were #2,5,6,7. If you liked Let Go then you will definitely like Under My Skin.
B00003CXXI|4.0|Shrek is nice little story. I think the voice actor choices are excellent.  The plot is centers around an Oger who is sent to rescue a princess, by lord Farquad.  Along with his sidekick, Donkey, they go on a incredibly journey with the princess that knowbody could forget.  Rated PG, for Mild language and some crude humor.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Their realistic lyrics and new york city music are a breath of fresh air. Simple yet deep. Julian's voice is orgasmic and you can't help but to fall in love with the rest band and their obvious talent. They pulled it off wonderfully.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|The cd is much like the first, with many catchy tunes you'll pick up and enjoy. There are many good ones and the only disappointing thing is they may be too similar.
068484267X|5.0|I haven't read a better book and may never. It's not a put-down book. Your eyes won't want to stray from a single word. It's something you'll want to read over and over again. Frank's life is truly something you can't help but to drop your jaw at. It's filled with every emotion only each amplified. Without a big booming ending it made it's success in the mind haunting, beautiful details. It will make you take a trip to Ireland and pretend you're Frank McCourt in Limerick again. I'm glad he shared his life with us.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I prefered the Monty Python movie - The Life of Brian on the same subject. For all the pre release publicity about The Passion being an anti Jewish movie, I didn't think Gibson portrayed the Jewish,/Roman class of cilizations very well.<br />In Gibson's film, the Romans with the exception of Pilate and his wife come off as sadists. In real history, the Romans were bringing civilization, the rule of law, civic order to backward, chaotic region of the world and the Jewish people were just another group of people resisting the progress of Roman civilization. This theme was presented very well in the Python movie The Life of Brian.<br />The Romans considered Jesus of Nazareth to be a very decent, honest Jewish religious teacher, one of the few honest people in this backward, insignificant part of the Roman Empire.<br />Was Jesus the real Jewish Messiah? In real history, the Roman's didn't really care too much, it wasn't something that should shake the entire Roman empire - which it eventually did do.<br />Back to Gibson's movie. I found it to be almost 2 hours of non stop torture,  what's the point?<br />The one very good part was Gibson's depiction of Satan as this transexual creature always \\"lurking\\" in the crowd, lurking in the mob. That was a nice touch.
B00002DEH3|4.0|I read, in a book on string quartets, the statement: \\"More than half of the best string quartets had been written when Schubert died in 1828\\".  I agree, but would put the percentage at more like 75 or 80%.  The author went on to include all of Schubert's, even those that he wrote as a teenager.  I was surprised by this comment, but now, having now heard his complete string quartets, I have to agree.  Even his early ones are superb! <br />To the recordings: I was just a bit disappointed.  The sound seems a bit harsh in places, not as warm as sets I have by the Quartetto Italiano (Beethoven), Melos Quartet (Mozart) and Aoelian Q (Haydn).  No doubt they are technically very correct, and show real liveliness - the violins just sound a bit scratchy in places.<br />The only other complete set seems to be the Auryn Quartet recording, highly recommended by the Penguin guide, but twice as expensive.  Naxos offers 12 or the 15 quartets on 5 separate CDs.  I'd liked to have heard the Auryn recording before I'd made the decision to purchase this one - who knows, I might have made the same decision anyway.
B00005JMR5|5.0|the beauty,grace, and syncronozation of these two men dancing from such different backgrounds and styles was magnificent. The love, trust, and faith under such difficult situations was indescribable. The story with its action and psychological background kept me riveted to the screen (5 OR SIX TIMES OR MORE!) When do I order my dvd?!!!
B000002UAO|5.0|The thing that amazes me most about The Beatles during this period was not their great songs, but just how far they had come creatively in such a short time.  Three short years ago had them singing \\"Love Me Do.\\"  Now here they are with \\"Rubber Soul,\\" complete with sitars and fuzz basses, not to mention some French lyrics.  The Beatles may not have been the first pop band to use such items on their records but their ability to be open minded about such things put them in the forefront of new ideas.  Now about this CD:  Ironically, the disc starts off with a wannabe rocker that fails to impress.  \\"Drive My Car\\" is a fair song the boys seem to want to move us with, but really, it's just not happening.  Harrison's rather weak solo doesn't help matters either.  \\"Norweigian Wood\\" is a min-masterpiece by John.  Aided immeasurably by Harrison's stinging sitar, which literally under underscores Lennon's disciplined singing and aggresive guitar playing very well.  \\"You Won't See Me\\" is just a fabulous tune with great vocals by the boys.  This is the kind of song that you can't get out of your head for days after you've heard it, its really good.  Lennon scores big again with more introspective lyrics on \\"Nowhere Man.\\"  Again, more ideas The Beatles were using helped their songs here and there---listen to the high amount of treble on this guitar solo.  It certainly takes the song out of the ordinary.  More great vocal work insues on this number as well.  The Harrison-written \\"Think For Yourself\\" is up next.  The fuzz bass simply dominates the track (Harrison, certainly no stranger to new ideas, his last composition \\"I Need You\\" featured the tone pedal).  The lyrics, possibly the best Harrison's written to this point, are matched perfectly by low tone in which he sings them.  \\"The Word\\" features some good harmonies and a good beat.  \\"Michelle\\" is a beautiful song that has Paul doing a some social climbing by putting a little French into the lyrics.  \\"What Goes On\\" has Ringo doing the countrish number from this set.  Obviously the weakest song on the set, but really only notable for the first song with a Starkey byline attached to it.  \\"Girl\\" has John excelling again lyrically. This time the backing vocals carry the song to its deserved heights.  \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" is Paul's baby. Good lyrics and an even better tune.  \\"In My Life\\" could very well be the best song The Beatles have done (so far).  The opening riff is almost celestial, then carried on by melancholy lyrics that are expertly sung by Lennon.  Everything is done right.  The icing on the cake is George Martin's piano solo in the middle  \\"Wait\\" is probably the disc's only filler cut.  \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is George's second number on the disc.  This is a much lighter, and much more poppy piece than \\"Think for Yourself.\\"  \\"Run For Your Life\\" is saved from obscurity only by Lennon's peerless vocal.<br />Starting with this disc, The Beatles were to start a run of creativity and brillance that would not end until they did.ng the countrish number from this set.

B0000AR8NK|5.0|This is definitely the best album David Bowie has put out since Let's Dance in the 1970's. It sounds a little bit more like his 70's-80's era stuff than 2002's pretty badly done Heathen. I like David's voice on all of the songs especially 'New Killer Star' and 'Pablo Picasso'. This is a great pop/rock album, probably the best in the next five years.
B00005JN0A|2.0|Call me sick but I thought Michelle Trachtenberg was going to show off some skin. And I do mean T&amp;A. I went out and spent money on this thing to see that and only that, but I was let down. Both ways!!! All this was, was another American Pie rip-off.
B00006879E|5.0|Words can't describe this album. I'm so serious. You have to listen to it to understand.   Every song is perfect.   The vocals melt your heart.   The music makes you feel at least 3 different emotions.   The lyrics make you think about love and life.   Its just something you have to experience.
B000001Y5J|5.0|There are several things about this EP you should know if you're thinking of purchasing it. If you love the sound of the Fragile, you might not like this. The Broken EP is the loudest, angriest and hardest of the Halos. Now that that is said, it is also one of the best Halos and should be in every NIN fans cd collection. The songs are as follows:<br />Pinion: From the first listen it sounds simple, just a minute long build up to the next song. This, however, is one of the most well made songs on the cd. The music video for it(found on Halo 12) is kind of sick, but worth a watch.<br />Wish: The most popular song on this cd (won a few awards as i recall) but, not the best. Very fun to listen to and you'll find yourself with the lyrics stuck in your head. (nothing too special about the video but, still worth a watch)<br />Last: The only song on the Broken EP that doesn't have a music video. Used to be my favorite on this cd with the lyrics. Doesn't get old, but, other songs get better. The ending is the best.<br />Help Me I am in Hell: The most boring track but is needed to get the entire effect. The video is that of just a man eating in a room of flies.<br />Happiness in Slavery: The best song on the cd. It catches you from with the intense screams in the beginning, to the creative lyrics thru the middle (&quot;don't open your eyes you won't like what you see, the blind have been blessed with security&quot; is one of my favorites) into the mechanical sounding hell at the end. There aren't words to describe how great this song is, so listen. Also, the video to this song is really really good, but will gross out some people. Very well made and just art.<br />Gave Up: Nothing too special about this track except for the great lyrics. Is unlike any other song on this cd and is a great way to finish the Broken EP.<br />The next two tracks are not actual songs on the Broken EP but hidden tracks that originally came on a seperate cd.<br />Physical: an Adam Ant cover. Fun to listen to every now and then but nothing really special. Great cover, though<br />Suck: Great lyrics, but, that's about it. I like the part with the lines &quot;I'll heal your wounds i'll set you free, I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy&quot;.<br />As a whole, this cd runs for a total of about 32 minutes and is a great buy if it's the type of music you like. However, as I sayed earlier, it is the hardest Halo and some of the language may offend you. Should be in every NIN fans collection though.
0812550706|5.0|Not being an overly avid science fiction reader, I had some doubts as to the level of profundity and entertainment that could possibly be derived from a book that is entitled Ender's Game.  Ender, I soon came to learn, is the featured protagonist, a 6 year-old boy quite unlike any other living in Greensboro, NC.  Quite unlike any other in the sense that he exists with the superlative distinction that he is, without doubt, the genius of geniuses.<br />Being tested from the start by being picked on by older boys, Ender makes a rather indelible impression on the reader from the first chapter -- one of supreme courage, wit, and.....well...genius.  To make the book enticing without giving anything away, I will succinctly state that Ender is drafted into the I.F.(International Fleet) army and thrust into learning not only how to win complex and immensely challenging Battle Games, but also valuable life lessons along the way.  In a book that succeeds on multiple levels, you find yourself highly entertained and wanting to find out what happens next -- as well as learning from the daunting adversity that Ender incessantly faces and the ingenious methods and strategies that he uses to masterfully overcome it.<br />In closing, I recommend Ender's Game to anyone from 9 to 90.  Not only can kids learn a great deal from this book, but adults can, without a doubt, as well -- especially from a leadership or management perspective.<br />\\"Winning is everything because without it there is nothing.\\"<br />- Mazer Rackham
B00020HEG6|5.0|I haven't heard the album but I saw the movie and loved the music. But to answer and earlier question, the song was &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; and I believe John Williams scored it for one of his earlier films.
B0001A79JO|5.0|Excellent. Sometimes during the day I feel a serious NEED to listen to this. The Horrorpops are amazing and so is this CD. I saw them in Chicago and theyre just as perfect live.<br />Basic Info: Rockabilly-Psychobilly yea yeaa obviously<BR>            With Patricia on upright bass (amazing custom King)<BR>            Kim Nekroman of the Nekromantix on guitar<BR>Plus: Karsten, neidermeyer and the gogo dancers.

B00005JLEU|4.0|Take the Ghost of Walt Disney sit him down in a Tokyo bar paired up with Roger Waters, a couple of Saki's, and a night on the town and you have mish-mashed together Fantasia and The Wall.  That would about sum up Hayao Miyazaki's visionary work in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;<br />Though it does trace elements of Alice and Wonderland, it left me wondering, who the audience really is...the child or the adult?  Like great works of animation, I believe &quot;Spirited Away&quot; transcends age and crosses over to both audiences.  It may be too deep and too dark in parts to truly appeal to the younger of age but there are fantastical threads all the way through that may not connect with those too far removed from childhood.  There may be some cultural perspectives that some of those in American audiences may find unfamiliar, but for those willing to expand boundaries, &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; is worth the stretching.  Keep an open mind and imagination and you may find yourself caught up in the beautifully hand-drawn animation.  It is the work of an artisan.<br />The story is centered around a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new house with her mother and father.  Along the way they get spirited away to an alternate reality world in which Chihiro is renamed Sen, her parents are turned to pigs, and her redeemers are a river god and a six-armed curmudgeon that stokes the furnace.  Sound unusual to you?  Well it is.  If you give it a chance, the story mixed with the animation will draw you in and enable you to celebrate the creativity that went into such a unique work.<br />I would say if you are a fan of anime or just animation in general, this is a movie you wouldn't want to miss.  If you are a general movie fan, it's a good watch, but I wouldn't call it a &quot;must watch.&quot;  If you are looking for something different, liked Fantasia, The Wall, Heavy Metal, get &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;<br />--MMW

B00015HVI8|5.0|After the Season 5 debacle, I was unsure about what to expect with Stargate SG-1's sixth season.  I was afraid that year 4 would be the peak and that the show \\"jumped the shark\\" in Season 5.  Fortunately, that was not the case.  Hopefully, the mediocrity (if that's a word) of last year was an isolated incident.  Anyway, the season begins with SG-1 still trying to find a fourth man.  Ever since the death/ascension of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), they have been unable to find a suitable replacement.  Refugee Jonas Quinn (Corinn Nemec) has expressed a desire to join, but Col. O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) never seemed to warm up to the idea.  Also, Anubis (David Paffly) has found a machine created by the Ancients that uses one stargate to destroy another, and he used it to attempt to destroy Earth.  Using the new X-302, a craft capable of aerial combat and intersellar travel, O'Neill successfully avoids disaster, but the Antarctica gate is destroyed.  After that, we don't see Anubis for a while, but the threat of his powers is always hanging over the heads of the SGC.  Anyway, with Jonas as the new member of SG-1, the team embarks on another year of amazing missions.  This year, we see the end of the exiled System Lord Niirti, known for her attempts to create a superior human host through genetic experimentation, we are introduced to some technology of the Furlings, one of the members of the intergalactic UN group who rallied against the goa'uld, Earth's first interstellar capital ship, Prometheus is unvailed, the Replicator threat is ended (I think), and, in one of my favorite episodes, Gen. Hammond (Don S. Davis) discloses the existence of the SGC to representitives of the UK, France, and China.  This year did have a few problems, but the season as a whole made up for them.  Some great episodes include \\"Redemption Pts. 1 and 2\\", \\"Descent\\", \\"Nightwalkers\\", \\"Abyss\\", \\"Shadow Play\\", \\"Allegiance\\", \\"Prometheus\\", \\"Unnatural Selection\\", \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\", \\"Disclosure\\", \\"The Changeling\\", and \\"Full Circle\\", the best episode of the season.
B00028HBKC|3.0|The passion has a double face ; the film turns around the last twelve hours in the life of Christ. But I emphasize the initial point ; inner passion and outer passion.<br />In this sense the outer passion runs before your eyes and literally catchs you without no mercy . But beware with the inner passion ; isn't equally important to suggest it?<br />Because if you don't, the balance falls in one extreme and doesn't keep the demanded sense of the passion conceived as a whole process.<br />The outer passion is brilliant depicted , the overlong cruelty of the  images is absolutely unobjectable ; but there are however five aspects which deserve be mentioned.<br />The apex sequence of the film is about the devolution of the thirty silver coins. The pictorical effect reminded me inmediatly to Rembrandt's painting.<br />The another winner sequence concerns with the journey to the Golgota, the camera looks like shy , filled with sorrow and it becomes in another viewer of the painful fact.<br />But the picture has several demerits.<br />The opening sequence was filmed with a clear sense of overshocking the viewer  , you don't feel the logical and progressive sense of anguish and unavoidable fate presence ( Watch Dryer's Joan of Arc, for instance), it is made melodramatically, trying to imposse you feelings that must derivate from the inside to the outside , and the movie goes in opposite direction.<br />The next point to review is the absence of commitment in Monica Belluci's performance , she looks overacted , and lacks of emotional disturbance sense ; Barbara Hershey in this aspect (The last temptation), overpass her.<br />And finally the last sequence in which the camera shows the last moments lack of vivid and expecting realism ; it looks effectist and  show a dissapointed sense of tragedy. In this fact, the death of the hero must offer us an extreme sense of universal earthquake, uncomfortable loss of majesty. cosmical sadness, and a great background of failure mythical inmersed in a ravishing sensation, all the universe must scream, and I emphasize this aspect because the tragedy is a fundamental piece of the universe. The effect is not to the dramatic level expected, the heaven teardrop seemed extremely weak in its inner meaning. The death of Christ demands in this final much more.<br />Gibson made a worthy effort with this movie but he never climbed the high peak of Braveheart.ravishing sensation, all the universe must scream, and I emphasize this aspect because the tragedy is a fundamental piece of the universe.

B0000033P0|5.0|This album is like nothing I have ever heard before. It twists music in ways never thought possible.<br />It starts off with the 20Minute+ &quot;Tarkus&quot; which is the obvious highlight of the album. It keeps the same feeling throughout the song, and just as you are asking for more of it, you get it! I find often in the newer Progressive Rock that they don't like to come back to their starting tune. But this is not that way, they are willing to come back to it often, to remind you that you are still listening to the same song! But don't get me wrong, it is very detailed and changes up much often.<br />The other songs arn't too special. But they are good quality and fit the album well. This was the first full album by ELP that I have heard. And I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys Progressive Rock or anyone who likes ELP!
1878424114|4.0|This book is excellent in its endeavor to empower the reader through principles which are not new, but nicely packaged. While there is much to appreciate here, the principles are neither profound nor overtly Christian in their presentation. <br />Christians would do well to supplement this work with Biblical, insightful and Spiritually-centered principles for success. One of the best in this genre is 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity' (previously &quot;The Mizraim Principles&quot;?), which teaches thirty-two principles for success. These two books together will furnish a wealth of insight into successful and practical living.
B00008EYA5|1.0|Is it possible? I'm still not sure, but I think I just witnessed a movie actually suck the cool out of Samuel L. Jackson!
B00005JM02|5.0|I rented this DVD to amuse my 7 year old nephew and 3 year old niece, but ended up not watching it until after they had left.<br />And maybe missing them helped me really appreciate how incredbily Pixar captured the nuances of children's facial expressions, ways of speaking and interacting, even their gestures-- and when you consider that those gestures are having to be made with fins and not feet, that's amazing!  <br />My niece had a stuffed Nemo doll and now I see why she loves him-- when little Nemo swam off to touch the \\"butt\\" because his father embarassed him, his expression was JUST like her \\"pre-tantrum mad\\" face.  The way the baby turtles cuddled up to Dory when she got Marlin to tell the story of his journy was JUST like her \\"paying attention, settling in\\" stance.  And Nemo also reminded me of my nephew too, especially when he was being brave and resourceful... and when he was figuring out how things worked, ahead of the adults.  <br />Lots of people have raved about the animation, and it is unbelievable-- and after watching one of the \\"extras\\"-- a 25-minute documentary about how this was made-- I realize just HOW much work it was.  Is it any wonder Nemo was better than most live-action films, when you consider how carefully, and over how much time, it was constructed?  Yes, it's a work of genius.<br />But what I loved about it the most was its storytelling which was funny and always touching.  Even the little prologue in which Marlin and Coral his wife discuss their new home-- the way she discussed the neighborhood and her glee at their ensuing parenthood was in every respect a new mother having moved way out into the 'burbs (she discusses the schools, the neighborhood)... and so her death was very sad (in my opinion, this is the part that would be the hardest to take for little ones, but it goes by very quickly and is not so brutal as Bambi).<br />You don't have to have kids to love this DVD-- but if you've been around any lately, you'll appreciate it even more.  (and it may come in handy to distract the kids you know from Spongebob, who also lives under the sea....)  Sweet without being treacly, this is an out-and-out delight.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This ic an awesome CD. Buy it!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD is pretty good. There are some songs that don't really stand out. Take Me Way, Together, Don't Tell Me, and a few others are great.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I myself love this CD. It's a reflection of times past and times new. Alot of people have hatred for some of the songs on the album and their &quot;soft&quot; side. What's so soft about it? Acoustic? That's pretty stupid. If you call yourself a &quot;Maggot&quot; and are up on the slipknot scene...you would of known that Slipknot has said they're going to be experimental and completely new with their next album. And this is exactly it. This is similar to their first CD. The melodies are back and so is the fun. Before I Forget and Duality, remind me so much of Me Inside and No life from their self titled CD. Which everyone pretty much loved. You can't sit here and critisize them for re-inventing themselves and changing their style. Staind, Korn, Mudvayne, Metallica, Nirvana, A Perfect Circle, and other great bands...have changed their style to let people know they don't and can't just do 1 style of music. This was their chance to prove they have actual talent and can do more than just scream and wail on guitar strings and bang drums. I'm extremely pleased with the result of Vol.3. It sounds like stone sour? Slipknot has been playing and doing metal and thrashing about since 95 (which doesn't qualify them as nu-metal, morons), and i'm glad they changed it up a bit, even if for just this CD. And for the comment about you wish they had the same thump and sound as they do live for pulse of the maggots....I suggest you stop listening to it on 1 inch laptop speakers and hook it up to a REAL stereo. Solves that problem. Now onto the whole cursing thing. Are you serious? Do you really need every curse word screamed at you just to enjoy music? Then you really need to get a life. You have no taste in music and you should just attend jerry springer shows until your eyes bleed. Anyway, All around..... This album delivered the old catchy melodic hooks with the same intense metal sound they've had for 9 years. I'm proud to be a maggot. And I'll always be a maggot. Thank god for Slipknot!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Her album is spectacular even better than the first. Its a women take charge, just got dumped, cd. It fits how you can love someone to death, and how horny guys can be. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes Alanis Morisette or Kelly Osbourne. Avrils songs are a mixture like her one song my happy ending sounds like Alanis, and her He Wasn't song sounds like Kelly. Highly recommended this is one of the best ones yet. I can ramble on about how great it is or you can just buy it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm for one am sick of reading all the bad things that people have to say about Slipknot's \\"Vol.3: (The Subliminal Verses)\\".  People bitch and complain because they feel that the album is different and that Slipknot have changed their style.  Hmmm...let's think about that for a second.  Changed their style?  Slipknot doesn't have an album that's like the other!!!  All of Slipknot's albums are at least a little different from the other.  You guys are complaining but what you need to realize is that you can't expect Slipknot to base their music on the style of one album.  You can't expect them to make another IOWA or another album like their self-titled.  Appreciate the album for what it is, don't hate it for what it's not.  Your doing the same thing that you did with Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\".  All arguments aside, \\"Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)\\" is a great album with a little something for all fans of hard rock music.  To Slipknot, I say this: Keep up the good work guys.  Peace.

0805062971|5.0|This book was an awesome read. I picked up in a bookstore one day, looking for something to fill my time on vacation. I had seen the movie, but I was like &quot;what the hell, books are always better than the movies.&quot; And its true. Even for as kickass a movie as fightclub. So watch the movie. And then read the book. For your good.
1594200106|5.0|have I been left with such a feeling. I started the book around six in the evening, read until my eyes burned - went to sleep and when I awoke, didn't stop until I had finished the book! Like other reviewers, I felt like many of the characters had become members of my own family. I missed them greatly as the book was finished, so I have started reading it again. I will tell everyone I know to read this book, and if it doesn't win high honors and praises in the world of literary prizes, I will be greatly diappointed.<br />I find it astonishing that the author was able to achieve with his readers the exact passion and experiences with his book as Daniel (the main character) has with Carax's. This work is a masterpiece, the likes of which I have not experienced with other writers. I can't say enough great things about this book!
0156027321|5.0|I cannot really remember what led me to pick up this book, as even in retrospect, the dust jacket blurbs failed to spark my interest.   Nevertheless, I was stunned by my visceral and intellectual response to it.  At its basic foundation, the book deals with the issue of spirituality.  As an atheist and someone who would be loathe to call himself &quot;spiritual&quot;, I would not have anticipated enjoying this book as much as I did.  Mr. Martel is masterful with his prose, constructing vivid imagery while employing a simple conversational style and subtle, uncontrived humor.  For this reason alone, the book was a pleasure to read.  However, it is the conversion of Pi's story from simple entertainment to allegory that really elevates the book beyond being a well-written distraction.  It is a book that forces you to consider it well after you have read it, and for some, could even effect a more meaningful transformation.  While I would not consider myself in the latter group, I have a great deal of respect for what Mr. Martel has accomplished here.  As a matter of fact, it is the only book that I have read in the five years that I have used Amazon which actually inspired me to write a review.  I hope that others enjoy it as I have.
B0000AVF29|5.0|I've had this eratic--but brilliant 1967 masterpiece in one form or another (both vinyl and cd) for most of its 37 years of existence up to this point, but never have I heard it sound anywhere near as good as does this 2003 remaster on Repertoire.  Both the Polydor and One Way cd reissues were marred with tape hiss which, combined with a relatively low recording level, made for somewhat muffled, muted sound.  No such problem here: The sound is strong and crisp...obviously first-generation.  That said, a few additional thoughts:<BR>     This is the first, and (in my humble opinion) the best of the four original albums by the revamped, psychedelic Animals line-up Eric Burdon formed in late 1966.  This band actually made its debut on record in the late winter/early spring of 1967 with the terrific &quot;When I Was Young&quot;/bw/&quot;A Girl Named Sandoz&quot; single.  They performed at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival in June, and it was during that time period that the songs for this album were being written and recorded.  I really cannot think of another album from the psychedelic era which runs as wide a gamut as does this one: From the rollicking, electric Hendrix answer &quot;Yes, I'm Experienced&quot; to the downright eerie, solemn &quot;The Black Plague,&quot; from the brooding self-deprecation of &quot;Poem By The Sea&quot; to the back-to-R&amp;B roots rough edge of &quot;It's All Meat.&quot;  Now, if you are endeavoring to read this, you probably know about all that, but you may not know about a couple of the bonus tracks on this edition of the album.  The mono single versions of Good Times&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Nights&quot; (notice the difference in the title) are not really all that different from the stereo versions, save for perhaps offering Burdon's vocal a tad more prominence.  However:<BR>     The two UK B-sides offered here as tracks 13 and 15 are both Killers!  First, &quot;Ain't That So&quot; calls to mind some of the raw, three-chord grungy blues the earlier Animals were doing after leaving Mickey Most and signing up with Decca.  If you dug songs like &quot;She'll Return It&quot; and &quot;That's All I Am To You,&quot; you're sure to dig &quot;Ain't That So&quot;: Not psychedelic at all, just tough-guy, in-your-face garagy rock.  An then there is the cd's closer, &quot;Gratefully Dead.&quot;  This song could easily be mistaken for an out-take from the Are You Experienced? album sessions, with the same Stratocaster sound popularized by the master himself jumping down your throat from the songs' opening note.  Again, it's a basic three-chord blues, but it's The Experience as well as The Experience themselves could play it--right down to Barry Jenkins' drumming being a deadwringer for Mitch Mitchell's sound and style at the time.  The song even features a great false ending, where the tape suddenly slows down to a dead stop . . .and after perhaps a second-and-a-half of silence, the music just explodes back out your speakers.  Through all that, Eric shouts his lungs out, and provides an extra track of low vocals periodically through the track which calls to mind Hendrix's spoken vocal on &quot;Third Stone From The Sun.&quot;  Apt to say, these two B-sides alone are worth the price of this cd: they're two of the best, hardest-rocking recordings by _any incarnation of The Animals.<BR>     About the only possible complaint I can render about this reissue is the failure to include the above-mentioned two songs from the first single by this latter-day version of the band: That would have made this package absolutely perfect!  As is, the dramatically improved sound quality on the original album, those two priceless B-side bonus tracks and pretty decent liner notes (especially by comparison to older versions) make this cd an absolute must-have for any Eric Burdon fan or any fan of late-Sixties psychedelia.  Also recommended: The Repertoire reissue of The Twain Shall Meet: Not quite as good an album as this one, but good enough, also boasting superior remastered sound, and the mammoth raw single version of &quot;Monterey&quot; as a bonus track.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros is not the &quot;usual&quot; kind of music. The majority of the negative reviews here state they are either pretentious, or that they cant get into the long songs and jibberish sung over the songs. <br />The absence of liner notes, lyrics, song titles, and vocals which are meaningless in contemporary terms just enforces the belief that music is for listening. As has been stated by another reviewer, the only message they want to convey is emotion, and no other band i have come across can convey so many different ranges  of emotion on such a consistant basis. It is for this reason, although they are my favorite band of all time, i dont listen to them very often. Mogwai, Godpseed, Explosions in the Sky, all have &quot;similar&quot; styles in music, but no one pulls it off better then Sigur Ros. This third album (Von being their first, and Agaetis Burjym being the second) is alot more relaxed than their second (and the one that made them known). <br />For those who can't sit through the cd...Sigur Ros is not a band you blast in your car as you drive, or play at a party. It is the kind of music you listen to yourself on headphones, or when you walk by yourself on your discman. Thus, it is not for everyone. If you are more used to or would prefer more radio friendly songs, Agaetis Burjyn is probably more for you, but you might not be able to stand that either.<br />Regardless, Sigur Ros deserves a serious listen from everyone out there.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I'm a huge Resident Evil fan, and have trouble disliking anything related to the series (I even thought that RE survivor for PC was pretty good). This movie on the other hand was a let down for me. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, the feeling of suspence, and the over all fright factor the game created for so many. This has instead been replaced with a slick sci-fi-action movie with some sub-par acting and some reasonable special effects. The movie follows the game's story VERY loosly (there are still zombies, there are still guns, there are still STARS comandos, there is a high-tech lab, and they threw in the Licker monster from RE2....thats about it), which is one of the main reasons I was disapointed with this film. Many of the fans know and love the twisting, mysterious story of the orrigional game, and it has been replaced with a movie that is remanesent of Starship Troopers (not that this is particularly bad, but it is a huge change from the orrigional story). All-in-all, this was not a bad movie by any means, and is a fun action flick that you should at least rent, however, I believe RE fans will be some what disapointed. If you have no idea what Resident Evil is, or have never played any of the award winning games, you will probably enjoy the movie a lot more.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I would go with \\"something\\", but Superhero is a close second.<br />Just when you think you've seen every plotline under the sun, along comes the most brilliantly tweaked teen angst film in over a decade.  Donnie Darko is a highschooler living in upper middle class suburbia circa 1988.  He has all the usual problems with parents, siblings, teachers and friends that are standard elements of any story about teenagers, but just to top it off he's a bit of a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  One night he sleepwalks out the front door and down to the golf course at the command of a new imaginary friend \\"Frank\\".  A few minutes later a stray piece of a jetliner falls from out of nowhere and crashes right through the roof of his bedroom.  Donnie realizes that since Frank has saved his life, he is now bound to serve Frank's will.  Oh, and Frank also predicts the end of the world in 28 days.  <br />I think that what makes this weirdness work is the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhall.  He was a relative unknown at the time this was made, and I think this allowed him to pull off a very believable performance as a basically decent guy who just happens to have this weird personal rabbit-alien thing telling him to do disturbing things.  Donnie is a kind of secret superhero.  You see this tall, solidly built teenager who is good looking enough to have been popular with the jock-and-cheerleader crowd, but who is too much of a free thinker to care about that sort of thing.  He stands up to bullies in an almost detached manner, hangs around with all kinds of kids and cares for his family.  He is charming in an off sort of way.  You would almost forget that he has a dark side at all if you didn't see this slow, twisted smile creeping across his face at key moments.  <br />I would love to delve further into the meaning behind the plot, but that would make for a real spoiler. <br />It's been a long time since I've enjoyed such a quirky, cult-classic-to-be movie.  I loved the social caricatures, the creepy mood and the punctuations of raw emotion in Donnie Darko.  See this movie if you have an appreciation for unusual psychological thrillers, science fiction, a nostalgia for 80s culture and maybe a little bit of weirdness in your own mind.  You will come away thinking about Donnie's universe for many days afterward.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B000060P79|1.0|This has got to be  the worst album EVER made next to a good charlotte or limpbizkit album! The singer sounds like someone kicked him in the nuts! For good music stick with bands like Machine Head, Nothingface, Opeth, Venom, Slayer, Soulfly, Cradle Of Filth, and the ultra heavy In Flames!<br />Peace out!
0446530891|5.0|Secret service agent Sean King will never forget the day a presidential candidate he was guarding is gunned down. Eight years later another agent, Michelle Maxwell find herself in the same hot water when the candidate in her charge disappears. She seeks out King to help her unravel the mystery. The narrative that follows is filled with unexpected danger as it becomes unclear as to who is tracking whom. As usual with Baldacci's plots it is hard to figure out who is the pursued and who is the pursuer. Another hit for this talented author.<BR>Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge, Ruth Fever and Jena's Choice.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|WHEN STONE SOUR CAME BACK I KNEW THE RETURN OF SLIPKNOT WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING.  AND BY GOD IT WAS MORE DISAPPOINTING THEN I THOUGHT. ACOUSTIC SLIPKNOT?? WHAT THE HELL? I THINK I REMEMBER THEM SAYING BACK IN THE 90'S THAT THEY WOULD NEVER SELL OUT AND CHANGE THEIR STYLE TO SELL RECORDS. WELL LIKE MOST OTHER BANDS (A.F.I., BLINK 182, NEW FOUND GLORY, METALLICA, KORN, LIMP BIZKIT, I COULD GO ON AND ON...) THEY DID. ITS SAD HOW MONEY AND POPULARITY WILL PUSH A BAND INTO GOING AGAINST THEIR VIEWS IN ORDER TO MAKE A DOLLAR.
B00008AWOD|3.0|Placebo was my favorite all time band only three years ago!  I adored everything about them: how beautiful Brian Molko was, his voice, the clever yet catchy lyrics, and just the entire beautiful sound.<br />This CD feels like they are trying to return to the beauty of \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\".  The songs have a similar feel to them, but something is missing.  Originality?  Beautiful lyrics?  Yep.  Mr. Molko sounds bored with his own songs half of the time!  All of the lyrics on this CD are extremely repetitive and sound cliche, like he recycled parts of lyrics from all the old songs from \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" and made them horribly boring.<br />Now, that being said, it's still a good CD on its own, but compared to \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" and their debut album \\"Placebo\\", which are both excellent, it is a failure.  There are still some good songs on it like \\"This Picture\\", \\"The Bitter End\\", and \\"Protect me from What I Want\\".  It's good, but it isn't amazing.
B00013F38K|5.0|I did not mind the shortage of each episode to save time or to fit on disc. They have did an excellent job on keeping of what Caine was teaching through his actions and what he said. For the reviewer who said it was boring. You are missing the point. The series have a plot and a lesson to teach in each episode to the series characters and as well to the audience. If it had kung fu action all the time in the series it would not last as long that as it did. My own words of wisdom: Ignorance and a closed mind leads to ones downfall, also makes one a fool. Another words not being part of the universe and stuck in the material world. Contemplate on it; everyone will agree with me on this one. They did not have many Asian actors in those days either due to racism (ignorance).
B000031EGV|5.0|This is a great movie!<BR>Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play,  and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|this album has been named &quot;album of the year&quot; many times, and i don't think they are far off. <br />the best songs are obviously &quot;matinee&quot; and the catchy single that got them noticed: &quot;take me out&quot;. this is a totally different kind of music than has been around recently, but this change is good! they show that the uk can actually produce good artists, not complete rubbish, like the stuff that has been released recently.<br />i can't wait for their next album to come out. excellent!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|\\"Mystic River\\" was robbed at the Oscars. Aside from Sean Penn and Tim Robbins winning, the picture itself should have won the Best Picture award. These people actually have souls and you can feel the intensity in every scene. A traumatic childhood experience separated three young boys and the murder of a boy's daughter brought them back together. I don't need to explain anymore because you have to see it for yourself. The film is powerful, perfectly acted and directed with a quiet, subtle superiority. Clint Eastwood is a genius and continues to shine as a gifted director. The film relies on strong storytelling through its characters and the acting is again, perfect. \\"Mystic River\\" is an excellent picture, enough said.
B00005QFE5|5.0|OH OH OH OH OH OH OH,MY GOD ,WHAT IS THIS ,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,VERY BEAUTIFUL,THIS IS MY FAVOR,YIMOU ZHANG THE BEST FILM MAKER IN THE WORLD.HE DID A GREAT WORK
B00020HEG6|5.0|PoA has simply the most beautiful music.  I bought the cd two days before the movie was out, and though i had no idea how the music was to be matched up in the movie, i was simply overwhelmed with the music.  Each theme was shouting &quot;John Williams&quot;, and that in itself means much. How he managed to combine jazz, modern music, a little folksy stuff, and classical together, i don't know, but the music is amazing.....unbelievable........<br />My favorite tracks were Buckbeak's Flight,  A window to the past, and Double Trouble.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee is fantastic!  Her music is jazzy and bluesy and so what if she is singing about &quot;love stuff&quot; and is only 14!  She is a talented entertainer and will go far!  Great job Renee!  Keep it up!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West talks about the real stuff in the music industry and in real life. He talks about his rise to fame and he also talks about his stuff but not enough that you get overwheled by the fact that he has a lot. <BR>Jesus Walks is my favorite song and it's religious but not in that hard core way.<BR>The whole CD is really great. All Falls Down is a great song, and so is Through the Wire. <BR>Get this Cd I'm sure that it'll be a great buy.

B0000VCZK2|4.0|Here's the big question regarding the Alien series:  do you spring for the massive 9 disc boxset, or do you save a little cash (and time) by only picking up the two good movies in the series?<br />Folks, the first two films are inarguably classics of their genres.  But the last two films are pretty disposable.  Especially 3, a movie that just exists for no explainable reason.  If you haven't seen it, consider yourself lucky, as it basically makes mince meat of everything that was great about the first two.  The fourth one is good by comparison, just because there wasn't getting much worse than 3.  <br />Why do we need 9 disc sets?  Why do we need alternate cuts of movies?  I'll tell you, it sure is nice to finally be able to have the vastly superior Theatrical Cut of &quot;Aliens&quot; rather than the unnecessarily bloated extended cut.<br />Two movies are classics, two movies are crap.  But- and this complicates matters- part four is ENTERTAINING crap.  But these features, man- I can't bring myself to wade through three hours of features about a classic, let alone three hours of features for a crappy movie.
B0000524CY|2.0|Undoubtedly one of the most horrifying films ever made, but one of the most terrifying? Nah!!! Almost everything that could be said about this cinematic milestone has long come to pass. I've just dropped by to impress upon all the prospective buyers of this masterpiece to stick with the original. For the lucky ones out there who have yet to experience this film, STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. The New Director's Cut, while having a superior sound mix, falters in comparison. With the exception of the now famous SPIDER WALK, the re-edit takes away the mystique. For the uninitiated, Mr. Friedkin doesn't let the experience creep up on you, instead(&amp; I would guess it's aimed at the ever-shortening attention span of the younger film-going public)he bashes you over the head with it. Dommage......
B000089RVX|5.0|These Guys ROCK.All The Tunes Kick Ass! A Must Own. Can't Waite<br />Till There Next Album
B000002C1V|5.0|this is the blackest of the black sheep that roam the pink floyd catalog (&quot;more,&quot; &quot;atom heart mother,&quot; &quot;ummagumma&quot; among them).  for those who listen to pink floyd to marvel at the weird sounds employed in some of their songs and space out at the lights at their shows, this album will disappoint.  however, for everyone that can look past that and see that the floyd is fronted by a man with actual feelings will be astounded at the depth and vulnerability of roger waters on this album, which was totally unprecendented in his songwriting career.  this album came to me at a particularly ugly time in my life, and the cold, downtrodden nature of songs like &quot;the gunner's dream&quot; and &quot;your possible pasts&quot; hit home for me; not necessarily in subject but in the general feeling with which it is injected.  during the time preceding this album, pink floyd, one of rock music's most enduring bands, more or less fell apart.  roger waters was entering middle age and finally confronting the death of his father, eric fletcher waters, through his art directly; something he had only devoted short passages to before.  david gilmour's work with the floyd in the 80s and 90s, though unique and incredible, pales in comparison to this bleak masterpiece.

B000000WA4|5.0|This is definately the Smashing Pumpkins at their best.  I love all of their albums but this one's my favourite.  It has a little bit of a lot of genres and i'd recommend it to anyone xcept for you rap and r&amp;b fanatics, i pity you.  I love every song on the album with the exception of Take Me Down, but im not really fond of any James Iha's work, i find it much too sappy, this song also just really doesn't seem to fit in with the others. This is also one of the only albums in which the songs are perfectly ordered. the is an album that i think almost everone would like at least part of it.  I HIGHLY reccomend it!<BR>(CANT WAIT 4 BILLY'S SOLO ALBUM:)
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Of the three soundtracks, this is the one that I love the most.  All of our favorite themes are represented.<br />A Storm is Coming-a wonderful display of the theme for the Ring.  Got to love the silly &quot;hobbitish&quot; interlude.<br />Hope and Memory-Prokeffiev all the way!  I love the part that is in 3/4 meter.  A beautiful melody!<br />Minas Tirith-now it's all about the theme for Gondor.  A slow intro leads to one of the most heroic statements of this theme on the album.<br />The White Tree-Yeah!  Low brass finally get the theme!  This is the best version of the Gondorian theme on the whole CD!<br />The Steward of Gondor-Perhaps the most modernistic piece on the album.  Pretty flute solo followed by a nice solo by Billy Boyd.<br />Minas Morgul-one of the most fun pieces to listen to on the CD!  Cool version of the Sauron/Orc theme followed by a quotation of the Mass for the Dead.<br />The Ride of the Rohirrim-all about the Rohan theme.  The beginning rythym is transformed again and again, with particularly nice solos from the Norweigan fiddle.  A nice pan flute solo and a heroic end!<br />Twilight and Shadow-georgeous solo by Renee Fleming.  Beautiful writing for the strings.<br />Cirith Ungol-nice oboe solo. Good version of the Sauron theme.<br />Anduril-Elvish motive is beautiful!  The choir writing adds an atmosphere of mystery.<br />Shelob's Lair-one of the most bombastic pieces for orchestra ever written!  The creepy tingling effect achieved is truly awe-inspiring.<br />Ash and Smoke-nice effect with the boy's choir.  Only part I can play on a violin because it's the only part where you are allowed to play out of tune!<br />The Fields of Pellenor-nice drum parts.  I love the triple tounging near the end!<br />Hope fails-quiet opening.  Love the dramatic organ effect near the end.<br />The Black Gate Opens-nice opening before one of the best statements of the fellowship theme ever.  The flute solos bring tears to your eyes, as does the quotation of Intothe West at the end.<br />The End of all things-amazing choral writing, with nice solos from Renee Fleming.<br />The Return of the King-the longest cue.  Most of the major themes are played, ending with the capracious hobbit theme.<br />The Grey Havens-GEORGEOUS!!!!!  Nice &quot;small orchestra&quot; with the most beautiful and wistful choral effects on the album.  The ending Into the West quotations brings me chills.<br />Into the West-You gotta love Annie Lennox!  Her far carrying voice is perfectly suited to this melody of the beautiful piece.  The orchestral ending is georgeous, reminding you Silmarillion fans of Valinor.
0380002930|5.0|There is very little I can offer to the many heartfelt reviews of this classic, moving book. One thing I can suggest is that if you have children, encourage them to read it by their early teens. While they may not know it at the time, the experience of this novel will be a watermark in their adolescence that will stay with them through life. This book is magic, and subtle enough in its power to reach into our lives many years past the reading.
B0000542D2|5.0|This film shows the Beatles as they were when they were young and fresh and charming and before they had started to take themselves seriously.  The story of a trip to London to record a TV show gives ample opportunity for the larking about they did so well,as they sing and play and joke their way through the film in their inimitable way.  There is a wonderful perfomance from Wilfred Brambel as Paul's malicious old Irish grandfather, doing his best to stir up trouble throughout the film, and fine performances too from Norman Rossington as their long-suffering manager, John Junkin as his bemused assistant, and Victor Spinetti as the show's harassed producer.  The highlight of the film comes with a mad chase scene as the Beatles are pursued through the streets by a horde of policemen.  And then there's the bit where Wilfrid Bramble comes up through the floor in the middle of the show, oh it's great.  Sad to remember how they changed when they turned into hippies and started taking drugs and spouting drivel.  Particularly strange to look at that sweet fresh-faced boy Paul, and think of what a pompous pretentious prat he is these days.  Never mind.  Forget what jackasses they became later, just enjoy this wonderful film.
B000068OSK|1.0|this album is beyond terrible. i just don't see what people seem to like so much about the white stripes. everything on here sounds the same, with little variation here and there but not much. jack white's voice becomes stunningly annoying at about the 10 second mark of the album and the music is uninspired, boring and just plain bad. if you want to avoid making a bad decision start here and don't buy this terrible mess-terpiece of a record.

It also makes you think twice about giving it up.<BR>He Wasn't- My favirote song on the album, it just deals with guy problems and getting bored, you know thats the bulk of problems for teenage girls.<BR>Freak Out- Great song, catchy lyrics, a song about being yourself<BR>Compared to &quot;Let Go&quot;, you can see Avril has really matured musicly and in her lyrics.<BR>You won't find any songs like &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, they are just as catchy and fun but there's meaning in all the songs.<BR>I would reccomend this cd to some one in High School because I myself as a High School student can identify with many of the things Avril is saying. A great cd for a teenager dealing with life!

0671027387|4.0|The first spotlight review was terrible! This book was great! A:<br />&quot;DECEPTION POINT takes place in a parallel America with only passing resemblance to the real thing. In this parallel America, the top-rated show on television is a documentary program about Earth's oceans, and a presidential candidate can surge to the top of the polls by publicly bashing NASA's budget overruns. Clearly Brown's more interested in the thrill-a-minute set pieces he's arranged for his characters to endure than in providing an even slightly realistic backdrop.&quot;<br />&quot;DECEPTION POINT demonstrates that no clich&eacute; is beneath Brown's consideration. The novel has everything: scheming politicians with a history of infidelity and dishonest financial dealings, wisecracking scientists, killers who can never seem to kill the heroes even when there's no escape, and villains who'd rather talk about their plans than dispose of their enemies. Perhaps if Dan Brown were trying to create an AUSTIN POWERS-like satire of technothrillers, DECEPTION POINT could be considered a success. As it is, the novel is a flailing mess even before it reaches its howlingly far-fetched conclusion.&quot;<br />Clearly, you dont understand this was a book not real life.<br />b:<br />STOP COMPARING THE BOOK TO MICHAEL CRICHTON, Ideas are reused, GET USED TO IT<br />Great book, read it anyday
B00009W0U4|4.0|French films ... what can I say about them?  They can be raw, violent, timid or just weird.  Irreversible is a VERY interesting film, simply because it is thought provoking.  When was the last time you saw a film which engrossed you so much, but at the same time you wanted to switch it off?<br />Right from the beginning, IRREVERSIBLE pulls you in and while the initial camera work is annoying, it helps create a mood of sheer eeeriness.  When the siren-like music begins, you know it's not going to be a pleasant ride.<br />The film makes you question human behaviour, and the total disrepect that humans can have towards other humans. The film is shown backwards and it really works in this format.  You know what is going to happen to the characters, before they do.  This of course will make you cry because the main characters do not deserve what happens to them.<br />SUMMARY:<BR>IRREVERSIBLE is a very sad film which shows the disgusting side of human behaviour, while in so many ways it is a beautiful film.  The two awful scenes are what everyone is talking about.  However, if you can get through these scenes, you will be rewarded ... simply because beyond those scenes, the film has much more to tell.
0312995423|2.0|I thought this book was terrible. Not because of the supposedly incorrect information, but because of the terrible plot and storyline. The book was terrible! Constant pointless killings helped the plot continue, and a very stupid ending puzzle at the end totally killed the book! Anyone who graduated grom middle school saw this one coming a mile away. Angels and Demons was great, Deception point equally great, and I have not yet read Da Vinci Code. I think Dan Brown should be ashamed for publishing this book.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George Harrison is, and always will be, my favorite Beatle.  Not only was he insanely talented (and too often overshadowed) but he was unpretentous.  He never tooted his own horn or acted like he was the king of everything.  I miss him terribly and I am so glad that I will always have his beautiful music to keep me company.<br />This concert DVD is enough to convince you of George's brilliance.  You can tell how much he touched the lives of all of the performers.  And a large picture of George hangs over the stage throughout, reminding you why all of these wonderful people have come together.  I'm very gladthat no one tried to steal the show.  This could have easily become the Eric Clapton or Paul McCartney show.  But both men let George's songs stand as they were originally written.<br />This concert accomplishes many things all at once.  It is one of the most touching tributes I have ever had the pleasure of hearing, but it is also uplifting.  The show isn't about crying and feeling grief.  It is about celebrating one amazing man and remembering everything that he did.  The show starts off with an amazing Indian section.  First, Ravi Shankar's daughter Anoushka plays a glorious sitar solo.  I was stunned at its beauty and at her talent.  Then Jeff Lynne and Anoushka play George's &quot;The Inner Light&quot; together.  Finally, an entire orchestra of Indian musicians play &quot;Arpan&quot;- an offering Ravi wrote just for George.  It is beautiful and a wonder to watch.  <br />And, just as George was many different things, the mood changes entirely.  The Indian music was haunting and lovely.  It is followed by the Monty Python cast singing &quot;Sit on My Face&quot; and the Lumberjack Song.  Both are incredibly funny and they work somehow.  Finally, we reach the Western music portion of the show.  Almost every song is a work of art.  The only songs I did not enjoy was Tom Petty's whiny version of the incredible &quot;Taxman&quot; and &quot;Horse to the Water&quot; because Jools Holland sounds like she is yelling.<br />However, every other song is touching and lovely.  I especially enjoy Billy Preston's &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton's &quot;Something&quot; and the riveting &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.  I'm so glad that George's brilliance is so evident in this concert.  He is just as, if not more, talented than John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  You should buy this DVD right away because it is a wonderful experience and it will remind you of all of the great songs given to us by George.<br />God bless you, George and I hope you enjoyed the show.
B000059H98|5.0|Ok, it's not &quot;The Godfather&quot; or anything.  Nothing much went into the acting or such things.  It's just another crappy mid-90's action movie.  Or is it?<br />Not even close.  &quot;Tank Girl&quot; is not about quality, it's about attitude, and Lori Petty has attitude to boot.  Her constant puns and jokes could come off as annoying, like they do in the Batman movies, which have ended up aging about as well as milk, but Petty really pulls it off, with her Gwen Stefani style, dirty mouth, and a seemingly endless stream of energy.  <br />Plot (not like it matters) is as follows: 2033, there's nothing but endless sand.  There's even a shortage of water!  All that's left is in the hands of a huge, evil corporation.  So, as it has been and always will be, wherever there's power, there's protest.  Tank girl and her friends are out to bring down the company, but a surprise attack forces Tank Girl alone to go up against all of her oppressors.  <br />The style never ends.  From the awesome soundtrack (including 2 Bjork songs, and Portishead's &quot;Roads&quot;) to a very cool animated sequence,  &quot;Tank Girl&quot; is sure to dazzle viewers who enjoy funny, campy, avant garde films.  GO TANK GIRL!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this album is one of the best albums i have heard in a long time it has the songs you can dance about and sing along to songs to relax to songs to drift away with you can listen to it when ever and what ever mood you are in and you will still love it. (...)
0743243315|5.0|You know you are dealing with an acclaimed book when the critical praise blurbs run to four pages at the beginning of the novel. Monica Ali's BRICK LANE made it to no fewer than ten &quot;Best of 2003&quot; lists, including a nod from the editors of the New York Times Book Review. It won the 2003 Discover Award for Fiction and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. All of which makes it slightly intimidating to review. What if the emperor has no clothes?<br />Luckily for me and the rest of the book buying public, the emperor is not only wearing clothes, it's an all-Prada outfit, complete with a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos.<br />At the novel's outset, however, the protagonist, Nazneen, is about as far from Prada and Manolo Blahnik has one could get. BRICK LANE begins with her birth in what was at the time East Pakistan, soon-to-be reborn as Bangladesh. Born into a small Muslim village, a premature baby who wouldn't eat, Nazneen was Left To Her Fate. Frequent retellings of the story dictated the capitalizations; her Amma (mother) refused to take her to the hospital, leaving Nazneen's life in God's hands.<br />Nazneen's fate becomes the central spoke of the novel as her parents arrange a marriage to a much older Bangladeshi man and pack her off, sight unseen, to London. Her husband, Chanu, who sees Nazneen as an &quot;unspoilt girl from the village,&quot; is himself a mass of tics and insecurities, as full of puff and blather as he is devoid of social graces. The walls of his flat are covered with his framed certificates of achievement. &quot;This one is from the Centre for Meditation and Healing ... Here's one from the Writer's Bureau ... This is not actually a certificate ... it's just directions to the school, but that's all they gave out.&quot; As is seemly in her culture, Nazneen submits herself silently to his theories and his many needs, including using a razor to slice the corns away from his toes. Not surprisingly Nazneen spends time forcing herself toaccept this new way of life. &quot;Every particle of skin on her body prickled with something more physical than loathing. It was the same feeling she had when she used to swim in the pond and came up with a leech stuck to her leg or her stomach.&quot;<br />As time passes and the two weather various crises, Nazneen learns to view Chanu with a bit more acceptance. They have two daughters, one of whom (Shanana) battles constantly with Chanu, mainly over her assimilation into British culture. The other daughter, Bibi, craves stability and acceptance. &quot;It was like walking through a field of snakes. Nazneen was worried at every step ... It was up to her to balance the competing needs, to soothe here and urge there, and push the day along to its close ... It took all her energy. It took away longing.&quot; Adding to Nazneen's worries is the fact that her sister Hasina still lives in Bangladesh, and Hasina's letters present a life even harder than Nazneen's.<br />In an attempt to earn a little money, Nazneen agrees to take in some sewing projects, turning out garments in a sweatshop-like arrangement. Her projects are arranged by a young man, Karim, with whom Nazneen launches into a torrid love affair. She moves outside her passivity and forgets her fate. &quot;It was as if the conflagration of her bouts with Karim had cast a special light on everything, a dawn light after a life lived in twilight. It was as if she had been born deficient and only now been gifted the missing sense.&quot;<br />Living in a post-9/11 world fills Chanu with conflict. He worries simultaneously that his daughters are becoming too English and too Muslim. His solution? Move back to Bangladesh. But can Nazneen accept this as her fate?<br />Ali's characters are a study in subtlety. It is to her credit that she can create such a vivid world with someone who rarely even speaks as its centerpiece. It is a tight, compact story that adds a new dimension to the immigrant experience, evoking the linethey all walk between two cultures, between fate and responsibility, between duty and freedom. Nazneen, above all, understands this.<br />&quot;Bibi always asked for stories. She wanted the words because the words stitched her mother close.&quot;<br />&quot;Tell us the one about How You Were Left To Your Fate.&quot;<br />&quot;Not that one,&quot; groaned Shahana. &quot;It's boring.&quot;<br />&quot;True,&quot; said Nazneen. &quot;I'll tell you a better one.&quot;<br />   --- Reviewed by Shannon Bloomstran
0812550706|5.0|What a book. Ender's Game was recommended to me by a friend who thought I might enjoy it and it's safe to say that I did. I've always been into books that make you think, that indulge the mind of the possibilities and scenarios in the near future. Ender's Game was no exception. Since devouring the Harry Potter Series, I was looking for another book or a book series to take its place until the rest of the Harry Potter Series was finished. Today, I have ordered the box set with Speaker of the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind to further my reading into the Ender's Game Series. If you haven't picked up a copy of Ender's Game, do so. You won't reget it.<br /><br />Update *8-19-04*<br /><br />I've now read the entire series thru shadow puppets<br /><br />After you read this, I would highly HIGHLY recommend the rest of the series! :)
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Well, my favorite band didn't give me what i really wanted to hear.  I thought that Corey (#8) would be dropping F-bombs and stuff, but he just doesn't.  He wanted to get out of what they had made themselves- he said.  They wanted to become better artists, than what they had been.  U can still be artists, and cuss all the time.  The cussing just gave the other albums more feel to them.  Plus, Corey hasn't got all of that Stone Sour crap out of him.  I really dont feel like listening to the acoustic guitar, especially when im listening to SLIPKNOT!  I don't mind the Xylophone though.  This album is more melancholy, and dull, compared to the previous two.  Those were just full of hate and rage.  Well, the 9 angry guys just finally softened up.    <br />This album is groing on me though.  I still do like to hear all the screaming, and the fast rap which still does include hatred, but not enough.  Vermilion pt. 2 is acoustic, but im starting to like it, even though im dissapointed that slipknot is doin that.  In that song, to me, i think when Corey says &quot;She isn't real, i can't make her real&quot;, i think that he is talking about &quot;Love&quot;.  I think this cuz, in all of his albums, he has never talked about how he has liked anything, besides &quot;Hate&quot;.  I love Corey's attitude, and cuz of his badass attitude, slipknot has had great success.  Pulse of the Maggots is an awesome song, dedicated to all of the pathetic people out there.  Im not pathetic, but i love it.  I love the rest of the cd too i guess.  I need to get used to it more cuz Slipknot won't be makin another cd for a while.      <br /> I am still a HUGE slipknot fan (aka MAGGOT).  The best part too them is their MASKS.  They are so cool to look at.  Mick's mask is my least favorite, but it is still cool.  Shawn's clown mask is still cool, even with the bandage around it.  I miss Sid's gasmask, but oh well.  And Corey's is awesome, like before.  I hope their next cd, which wont be coming soon, will have a PARENTAL ADVISORY sticker on it.  Then i'll know Slipknot is returning to old habbits along with their new ones.  <br />SIC
B00005JN0A|5.0|Eurotrip is insanely funny. One of the best parts of the movie is the song &quot;Scotty Doesn't Know,&quot; sung by guest-star Matt Damon, which is in itself, reason to get this movie. But the story goes, that Scotty and Mieke, his German pen pal have been pen pals for a long time, and when Mieke hits on Scotty, he basically tells her off. By the time he realizes Mieke is a girl's name, and that she's insanely hot, she's blocked his account. So he decides to hop the next plane to London on his way to Berlin. What ensues is a wacky series of twists and turns. The movie was excellent, and not unconditionally crappy like other goofy teenage raunch flicks. Starring Michelle Trachtenburg (Buffy's Dawn) and newcomers Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Travis Wester, with cameos by Matt Damon, Kristen Kreuk, and Lucy Lawless.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|Why care from what band this man formerly wrote for and was the driving force behind. If you're a classical music afficionado, then you'll love these suites from a contemporary and \\"young\\" composer.<br />From a strings for orchestra standpoint, he's begun to out perform Samuel Barber and Vaughan Williams. <br />Unfortunately, Mr. Banks is trying to out perform the 80's to present film composers. <br />Fortunately, these suites do out perform those composers for one reason: The music is for people who can apply it to their own dramas in their lives and develop their own stories and end their stories the way they want to. Profoundly different from a movie/film score. These 7 give listeners their own score to decide on how to see and live out their own dramas: this thing called life.<br />Now that Anthony George Banks is done with this great work, he can move on to the next logical step: the piano concerto. Every great work he composed for Genesis and his Great solo works was nothing more than a great piano concerto composition and drama, with some outstanding, histrionic and, sometimes, meaningful lyrics. But who needs lyrics, when we can write our own stories in our own minds.<br />So keep up the hard work Mr. Banks and get to those piano concertos!!! It seems as though you were born to out perform every piano concerto ever written. Only you will ever know. <br />In the mean time classical music buffs, get to know this man and his music! Start with this one and move backwards, you won't be disappointed! He's been just a throwback all along.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a great CD. You can really see the changes in this album from Avril's first one. Personally I think &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; and &quot;Freak Out&quot; are the best songs on the CD but they are all awesome. I think Avril has more than proven that she can rock and that she deffinately has staying power. If you don't have this CD yet what are you waiting for? Go Now! Get It!
B00008WG3U|5.0|Bashing bush while delivering the same hard core melodies and lyrics in previous records while throwing in a hint of comedy. All in all this record is a must have.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This has to be the best sea-faring movie ever put on film.  The special effects are completely breathtaking, and the story follows as closely to the book as I believe is possible.  The warmth Captain Aubrey feels for his crew is made very real by Russell Crowe.  I believe this to be his best performance yet.  The crew of children are portrayed as they should be, by children.  Their fears and trials are shown, as are the superstitions and fears of the older crew members.  Nautical terms are used without apology.  If you don't know what they are referring to, get a dictionary.  You won't find them dumbing down for the lubbers who have never become learned in the ways of early seamen, or with British Naval history.  It is very authentic, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
B000065U1N|5.0|To those people who say the international community should not have been in somali business are kidding themselves. 300,000 people died of starvation. The news was on every major news station and magazine: CNN and BBC, and the New York Times the most prominent. The warlords were deliberately taking food for power grabbing. It was an obligation to go in and do something. Some people obviously didn't remember 1993, just the aftermath and critical reviews about the UN mission in general. As for the movie, I thought it was outstanding. Ridley Scott did a phonomenal job as best he could. It's sometimes stupid to think whether it was pro-this or anti-that. It shows how close minded some people are and how they lose perspective instead of focusing on the bigger picture. This whole event is based on good intentions gone wrong. No matter how history judges, people should proud that least the world tried to do something to help instead doing nothing at all like in Rwanda.
B00006M183|2.0|It seems Pearl Jam are desperate to become the new Neil Young these days, even though deep down we all know they'd be doing a lot better if they were to embrace thier inner Aerosmith and not consistently deny those anthemic qualties that made everything released by the band up to and including 1998's Yield so delightful.<BR>  Pearl Jam have always recieved mixed reviews, but since Binaural there has been cause for this beyond journalistic bias against the group, and I have to say that Ed and the boys keen-ness to go down a darker direction (musically, thier lyrics have always been cut from darker cloth) ill fits a band that can craft such effortlessly satisfying stadium rock when they allow themselves to trade in major key's and open mixes, as opposed to the thick classic rock sludge that songs like &quot;Cropduster&quot; and &quot;1/2 full&quot; wallow in here. The frustration here is that B-sides such as &quot;down&quot; and &quot;otherside&quot; showcase preciseley the hooks and power that is so dismally lacking on Riot Act.<BR>  As long as Pearl Jam try so persistantly to surpress thier own natural instincts they are setting themselves on a steady path toward mediocrity and irrelevance, shame.....

B000003TA4|2.0|2 1/2 stars.  I don't mind listening to this album, it's ok...but I have never understood why so many people have gone to such great lengths to make this band, and particularly this album, out to be something bigger than they are.  There is nothing terribly original (Meat Puppets retreads, and that's just one example), and they are only moderately talented musicians.  Cobain has always been overrated as a singer and a songwriter...teen angst songs, how original!!  Again, listenable, but VASTLY overrated.  Certainly not a top 20 album of all-time (Rolling Stone magazine stopped mattering about 15 years ago).  Not even top 1000.  Critics make some poor assumptions in concluding that Nirvana were a great band.  Critics assume that because Nirvana was at or near the forefront of the grunge movement, all other grunge bands were copying them, and therefore they must be great.  But the fact is, all grunge bands sound pretty much the same, not because they were all copying Nirvana, but because grunge was a very limited, uninspiring style to begin with.  And I don't recall anyone screaming about &quot;greatness&quot; while Cobain was still alive.  If he hadn't been so weak and pathetic as to kill himself, Nirvana would be a struggling, forgotten band (can you say Pearl Jam?), just like grunge was a short-lived, ultimately meaningless movement.  Don't believe the hype, these guys are average.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|If you loved the movie you will really enjoy the soundtrack. Originally, I just wanted the funny Billy Mack christmas song because it was stuck in my head, but I quickly found that every song on the CD is a keeper.<br />I've had the CD in my car for a few weeks now and still haven't tired of the selections. This is a very uplifting, rich, and well rounded selection of music. Not just for Christmas, either...
B00000DHRZ|1.0|Everything from Americana up to their latest album &quot;Splinter&quot; just sounds like macho frat-boy rock... and this is coming from someone who loves Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay in the Hombre! On Americana Dexter makes cracks like &quot;I don't care if I'm insensitive&quot;. Now, don't get me wrong, he doesn't have to be needlessly happy or sweet, but with lyrics like these, he's just being an ass. On any of The Offspring's newer albums, you are guaranteed NOT to hear songs like the following: Jennifer Lost the War, Out on Patrol, Baghdad, Dirty Magic, LAPD, Forever and a Day, Genocide, or Gone Away. If that's a relief for you, then I question how much of a fan you are, because you obviously like their newer, hokey, testosterone-filled music that is marketed towards boys 15 and under. Back in their heyday, The Offspring used to sing about the child victims of war and abuse, police brutality, hating people but &quot;loving them more&quot;, and sincerely mourning the loss of a loved one. Now they just sing about having hangovers, getting it up the back in prison, and other guys who get cheated on and have a &quot;b*tch&quot; who refuses to get freakin' job. There are more important things in life to sing about, guys. You of all people should know that.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (&quot;No One Else&quot;), the joys of high-school love (&quot;Buddy Holly&quot;) and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (&quot;Undone - The Sweater Song&quot;). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.<br />So why should you pony up the extra dough for the &quot;expanded&quot; edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (&quot;Jamie&quot;), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled &quot;My Evaline&quot; that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.<br />If you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and &quot;Pinkerton&quot; will get the same royal treatment.
0792843584|1.0|.<br /><br />...then buy Unforgiven.<br /><br />Let's just set the Heaven's Gate plot aside for a moment (all 3 hours and 40 minutes of it).  Even granting this self-indulgent, obtuse epic a pardon, the DVD still deserves to be tried, convicted, and buried in the cheap seats on Boot Hill.  The Heaven's Gate DVD is, without question, the WORST DVD that I have ever had the (dis)pleasure to view.<br /><br />Why?  Well let's start with the video quality, which is horrific.  No, I'm not referring to the Director's color palette.  Yes, the chosen sepia tones are annoying, but I defer to the critics and assume that it was an inspired choice.  No, I am referring to the film transfer....which was apparently done on someone's five year old PC using film reels stored in the trunk of an abandoned car that has sat in the desert for the last 20 years.  The transfer is awash with reel change markers, dirt, scratches and random purple spots, which appear throughout the film.  Furthermore, the quality varies SIGNIFICANTLY between reels.  Okay, let's assume that you can tolerate the transfer.  Can you still enjoy the film?  Sure...if you can read lips.<br /><br />The sound is horrid.  The mix is insanely poor.  The center channel is low and muffled.  In fact, it is so poor that we stopped the movie and played every game that we could with the surround sound system, television, and the DVD player...all to no effect.  I'm not talking about trying to tweak a less than perfect 5.1 soundtrack - we were just trying to understand the actors!  The sound is so muddied and overwhelmed by supporting background noise that much of the dialog is completely unintelligible.  It was so bad that we even tried to turn on the subtitles.  Unfortunately, my high school French is rusty and my friend's Spanish more so.  Yes, that's right - no English subtitles.<br /><br />I am not even going to address the plot.  Nope.  I'm not even going to say that it was obtuse, meandering, and in need of serious editing.  Whoops, I guess that I did.  I mean, what the heck?  Nearly four hours and no background on the motivation for the Harvard types to move West.  No background on the relationship between \\"the association\\" and the state and federal governments...or perhaps the main characters?  Well, I suppose that, given time constraints, all possible interesting back stories had to be shelved...and understandably so.  I mean who has time for such trivia when you need to dedicate ten minutes to a roller skating musical number...or 15 minutes to a drunken college graduation ceremony?<br /><br />Run from this movie.  Run and hide.  It may (and I emphasize MAY) be tolerable with a better transfer, but I suspect that even a fan of this \\"masterpiece\\" would be amazingly disappointed with this DVD mastering..

B000063147|5.0|this cd is amazing, it is one of the most original cds ever. it has the perfect mix of punk and metal. M Shadows has an amazing voice, he can go from a chilling scream to a melodic singing voice. this cd ranges from times where its as heavy as any metal band to times when its just punk ( mainly the song streets). every song on this cd is amazing you will not skip a single song. even the ballad (warmness of the soul) is pretty good. and its about time that bands make songs longer then the 2 minute punk song and the 3-4 minute metal song, with the exception of to end the rapture (intro) every song is around the 5 minute mark and sometimes longer. so whether you listen to punk , metal, hardcore, screamo, whatever you need this cd. you will not be disappointed
B00005JLEU|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli, but I'm sorry this one is not as good (by far) as others he's done.<br />Animation is feeble and clunky at times, and the story... well, the story is not only mostly pointless (in the sense of not having a point) but also gets lost easily along the way with too many stuff going on. Most people won't even get what the movie is about.<br />I'm glad that he finally got some recognition, but it's a shame it had to be with this movie. You're far better off watching some of the older movies from Miyazaki. Laputa, Kiki, Totoro, Princess Mononoke or my personal favourite Porco Rosso... Even the quite old Nausicaä holds better than this Spirited Away.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|When someone mentions Tim Burton, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; usually pop into anyone's head. But &quot;Big Fish&quot; is not like that. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is a creative story about a father and son who have broken apart after three years, and only the father's (played brilliantly by Alber Finney) failing life bring them together. But through his father's stories, the son eventually comes to understand who his father really is, and who he always has been. Ewan McGreggor playes the father in his younger years brilliantly. This is a story about a father and son and the strength of their bonds no matte what happens. <BR>     This is truly Tim Burton's masterpiece. It still retains some of the darkness one would expect with one of his other films, but it is a film that captures the stories of people's lives, no matter how exaggerated they may be.
0140366725|5.0|Treasure Island is one of my favorite classics of all time.  I was first introduced to this book in the eighth grade (I'm 22 now) and have loved it ever since, even keeping the copy given to me in class, telling my teacher I lost it so I wouldn't have to give it back.<BR>What makes this book so fun?  Overall, it is an fun adventure, making it a fun read.  The main characters are fleshed out well.  For example, we the reader feel just as betrayed as young Jim Hawkins when he learns of Long John Silver's plot to steal the treasure.<BR>The story itself is broken into nice sections and flows together from start to finish.  There is never really a dull moment in the book.<BR>Treasure Island is a great read and a classic novel.  Just don't confuse it with Pirates of the Carribean.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Upon hearing &quot;Duality&quot; for the first time months before this album came out, I was a little confused. It sounded too much like Stone Sour. I decided to wait until I heard the full CD, and was amazed by what I heard. This was not the normal Slipknot. This was not pointless swearing and screaming that I had known from Slipknot. This was better. I heard this and I realized that Slipknot had finally grown as artists to the point where they could do anything. I really admire the simplicity of &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermillion Pt. 2,&quot; the albums two acoustic songs. The reason many fans are really upset with this is because of the corner Slipknot had put themselves in by sticking to the heavy stuff for their first two albums. By continually playing songs like these, people would react when they heard these. And they did. Slipknot had now successfully gotten themselves out of that corner, whether or not their fans were happy with it, they had done something different, which worked for an album such as this with amazing melodies in the vocals on all the songs, while also retaining the pounding riffs that they are known for. Worth every cent.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie is a must see for all fans of anime, and for people who love exceptional movies in general (even those who don't generally like anime). In the early 80s some friends of mine from Toronto, Ontario had great connections with anime fans in Japan and were able to get a copy of the original on videotape. It was purely in Japanese... no subtitles... I wandered in about 15 minutes into the movie and was utterly captured. It was one of the most moving and beautiful films I had (and have) ever seen, and every animated feature I have seen since has been judged against it. I have read the graphic novels, but I've been longing to see the movie again in its original form, and August 31st can't come soon enough for me!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Wachowski brothers really tried to make this an epic trilogy similar to the likes of &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; and &quot;Star Wars,&quot; but really they should have stuck with one revolutonary film rather than attempt three and fail miserably. Reloaded was a pointless mess of a film, however still entertaining. Reloaded was a buildup to the war that in Revolutions. The third film is a revolution, however. It is a revolution in overused special effects and dry acting by all but the minor characters, such as Hugo Weaving, Mary Alice, and a short but great appearance by Bruce Spence. The plot relies on you watching Reloaded, but it doesn't really rely too much on understanding it. Revolutions is just a war movie with a lot of excessive special effects, kind of like &quot;Lord of The Rings,&quot; but LOTR had a plot where the effects didn't get in the way. If we had just stuck with the orignal, everything would have been fine.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|OMG!!!...this is an amazing cd...i've only had it for 3 days and i already know all the words to every song...its better than her first one...its less popish...amazing!!...if you don't already have this cd, buy it...it talks about everything teenagers go through..some of the songs are kinda sad...but they have a really good message...
B00005JMEW|5.0|I must admit that I had underestimated Quentin Tarantino as a film maker without having seen any of his films. I find myself eating my words after seeing &quot;Kill Bill.&quot; I had never really known that a film could have a plot like this, be so stylish, and have just about everything else as well, all fit into two hours. The fight scenes (albeit bloody) are amazingly entertaining, and the characters are enjoyable. Some of the dialogue is a bit dry (&quot;Silly rabbit, trix are for kids) but they do fit the scene. It has comic relief in there right when it is needed. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful leading lady performance as she takes out her various former associates who attempted to kill her, ultimately leading up to the point where she will kill Bill, the head of the organization, known as DIVAS (Deadly Viper Assasination Squad.) Not for the feint of heart, however.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|I thought the movie was beautifuly filmed- amazingly detailed,but I think needed something more. I found the pacing to be very draggy at times, some segments could've been trimmed to speed it up a bit (the 20 min. of deleted footage on the extras might have helped the movie out by adding more interest?)<BR>It might not sound like it but I do like Master And Commander and I'm thinking about buying my own copy.I'll be getting the 2 disc widescreen special edition for all of the extra's it contains because they sound really good, and will make it even more worth owning for not a lot more money.
B000002MP2|5.0|It is simply a great CD. Green Day is simply a great, innovative, PUNK band.
0812968255|5.0|This is my favorite translation of the meditations, an opinion further solidified yesterday when I went to the book store to get a last-minute graduation gift for a young man, and all they had was &quot;The Emperor's Handbook&quot; by the Hicks brothers. It was good, but I think it lacked the manliness and concise clarity of  the Hays translation. I have not read the original Greek, (trying to learn some now!), so I'm no authority, but I imagine this is how a man like Marcus Aurelius might write to himself in this circumstance.<br />As for the greatness of the original work itself, all I can add to the other fine reviews here are two quotes I have always loved from Clifton Fadiman's &quot;The Lifetime Reading Plan&quot;:<br />&quot;. . . during the last ten years of his life, by the light of a campfire, resting by the remote Danube after a wearisome day of marching or battle, he set down in Greek his Meditations, addressed only to himself but by good fortune now the property of us all,&quot; and, &quot;Through the years The Golden Book of Marcus Aurelius, as it has been called, has been read by vast numbers of men and women. They have thought of it not as a classic but as a well spring of consolation and inspiration. It is one of the few books that seem to have helped men directly and immediately to live better, to bear with greater dignity and fortitude the burden of being merely human. Aristotle one studies. Marcus Aurelius men take to their hearts.&quot;
B000002P5R|5.0|The 5 stars I've given to this disc must be understood in context.  These are not the same kind of 5 stars I gave to Are You Experienced.  Then again, Jimi was alive and involved in the mixing and production of AYE and he wasn't for First Rays.  As a long time Hendrix devotee, I knew he'd considered naming his next LP with this disc's title.  I knew all about what was going on in his life at the time he died and how he wanted his music to evolve.  The reason this disc warrants 5 stars is because the people involved in bringing this project to completion did the best they could to make Jimi's vision a reality.  This is love, pure and simple.<br />A stripped-down, analytical view of this disc, song by song may not arrive at the conclusion above.  Clearly, the studio work was not finished on many of these songs.  The story of the making of these songs is a tragic tale.  Jimi's last album of original studio recordings had been released in 1968 on Electric Ladyland.  Since that LP, a compilation entitled Smash Hits had been released, as had Band of Gypsys, a live recording of new tunes as part of a legal settlement with one of Jimi's former business partners.  Band of Gypsys, although excellent music in my opinion, was not what the majority of the record-buying public wanted to hear from Jimi.  They wanted Purple Haze II, or something similarly familiar and comfortably psychedelically rocking.  But Jimi had been around that block too many times and was in need of change.  First Rays was to be the answer as he saw it.<br />Now, don't get me wrong here - I love this music.  But not all of it was finished to Jimi's normal standard.  He certainly planned to get it done and was considering a change of management and producers as solutions to get past the barriers he saw in his way.  But lack of completeness can't hide the brilliance of his vision.  Just consider two cuts as examples - Hey Baby (effectively the title track) and Ezy Ryder.  Hey Baby shows both lyrically and in its arrangement where Jimi was headed.  The opening section is one of the most beautiful guitar lines he ever wrote, combining so many of his roots into a statement so uniquely Jimi, it's immediately recognizable.  The words tell me just how badly he needed to move beyond the constraints that had imprisoned him for all too long.  Ezy Ryder shows that Jimi was still a rocker.  But he was changed.  Since taking over the production of his music, the orchestration had become more complex and synergistic.  The lyrics show, as do the lyrics of other songs on this disc, that Jimi was struggling to make the message fit the rythym.  But that's nit picking - these are great tunes.  I am hugely appreciative that the Hendrix family got the right people together to make this happen.  It's a must-have.n its arrangement where Jimi was headed.

630575067X|1.0|Come on people. I was a kid when the the REAL star wars movies came out. Now I show them to my son and they rock...we have a blast and the darn things are almost 30 years old. This recent garbage from Lucas shows he SHOULD NOT be directing adult films!!!! They are flat and lack ANY of the emotional buy-in needed for a legend film series. The orginal series was so good that it became part &quot;religion&quot; to many people. They were so good, you had a frenzy when these new movies were coming out. The orginal movies were made for adults with a story so compelling, you didn't need 100 million in special effects to pull it off. Lucas should have done what he did with the first series...let other people direct them! What a disgrace to the orginal Star Wars trilogy. I think that's the point...the original Star Wars was an adult film that was good for some kids too. The new Star Wars is simply a kids series that seems laughable when it tries to get serious for a few minutes.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this is a must if you want a cd that has more than just 1 or 2 great songs-every song is great on this album!Avril did an amazing job creating these songs and if if her debut abulm &quot;Let Go&quot; blew your mind, then you are in for a suprise!
B00002MZ12|4.0|I love No Pressure Over Cappucino after her rousing performance on Alanis Unplugged. You Learn, Head Over Feet, Uninvited and Ironic are excellent live. The only thing that irks me is that sometimes her voice doesn't hit the notes we hear on the album versions. Besides that, it's a great CD.
B000002H2H|4.0|This album was the breakthrough where Metallica found the sound they wer meant for. The more thrashy style of Kill 'Em All was good, but it wasn't really what they wer known for. Songs off this album, such as &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade to Black&quot; are some of their biggest hits, and those two don't even follow the formula of many of the songs on their other albums. BUt their diversity on this album makes for one of the greates thrash-metal albums out there. The quiet and peaceful intro to the first song, &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; is brilliant, while 30 seconds later they pound you against the wall with their lightingn fast guitar riffs and their lyrics and Hetfield's amazing vocals that talk about subjects that are still (and more) relevant today. The title track begins with a very memorable riff that's uniqueness is what makes it stand out compared to some of the other songs on the album. This was Metallica as they were rising to their peak at &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; but this is the equivalent to &quot;Puppets,&quot; to understand the real Metallica, you must listen to both of these albums and notice that these two are the only ones where Metallica as a group are consistent between albums. &quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;Puppets&quot; are so similar in their sounds that you really understand what Metallica should have continued with regarding their music. Although some say consistency like this isn't good, for a band that has gone WAY too diverse over the last 15 years, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot has definately taken a different turn on this album, but I believe its for the better.  I didn't think IOWA was that impressive, as the innovation of their first album seemed to be weighed down by a directionless sludge of anger...and shortly after Slipknot realized this and went on hiatus.  With Subliminal Verses, Slipknot have combined the best elements of their first album, taken out some of the heavy sludge of Iowa, and yes...melody too.  There is still that aggression that made slipknot famous, but its more intelligent now.
0743454529|4.0|Can you imagine having to go thru this ordeal?  This book takes the perspective from all members in the family-parents, brother, dying sister, donor sister and even the lawyer and social worker.  Found the book very interesting-well written (it takes a while to get used to the chapter break up-each one is the perpsective of a separate character and keeps coming back-can be confusing as to which view you're reading now but doesn't take away from the story).  I'd recommend it due to the rarity of the subject matter and the ending which is really good-such a twist (that's a rarity in its own...many books that i've read lately end as if the author just got tired of writing and said, I'll just end it here....)<br />Enjoy the book and yet another good one by Judith Picoult!  You must read Plain Truth if you haven't already......
B00006879E|5.0|I purchased this CD around the middle of 2004 because of heavy airplay of the group's econd single &quot;This Love&quot;. I must say that this is by far the best pop/rock CD that I have purchased ever. I've always been more of a hip-hop/R&amp;B connoisseur and didn't start branching out to other brands of music until last year. This album is the epitome of smooth rock coalesced with smooth R&amp;B, a combination which is effectively felt. Adam's voice is incredible and the band itself is musically impressive. When I initially purchased this CD, I couldn't get past &quot;Harder To Breathe,&quot; &quot;This Love,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; and &quot;Not Coming Home.&quot; In some form or fashion, it's still like that. Every track, however, is just as good as the last and this CD will remain in heavy rotation in my stereo. This album is definitive and I will wait on pins and needles for their sophomore release.
B0001UZZWW|4.0|Ok, for those of you who were disappointed with how 'short' it was, stop complaining. Shrek 3-d is actually a ride at Universal studios in florida, except for there, it is called shrek 4-d because of all the special effects (like the ground shaking, and water squirting). if you werent observant enough to see how long the DVD was, then i guess you deserved to be disappointed. anyway, i hope this helps people who werent sure of the quality of the video b/c of the length. i enjoyed it, and i hope some other people can, too.
B0000028RR|5.0|First of all let me just say that this album is one of the greatest political and 90s album of our time. Zach de la Rocha is a great and talanted rapper who is strongly capable of expressing his ideas and issues in song. All these band members work so incredibly well together to make one of the greatest bands ever, and in such a short time being together. <br />To music lovers who want a review for this album it is important to not listen to the guy on the top of page 11-20 of 429. He claims that this music is pure communist, anarchist, and that they hate democracy! He says thsi because they complain about some of the many conspiracies invloved in the U.S government. Does this make them commusist -no, anarchist, no, does this mean that they hate democracy -no, it simply means that they are letting others know about these concpiracies to make the listeners think. I come from Canada, we have a little military. Oh NO! Just by saying that i must hate Canada! I must want to end democracy all around the world! i love my country just as RATM still cares for their country the United States of America! All they want is change! <br />This album is great! Nice combination of metal, rock, rap and funk! Terrific lyrics, despite what some others say. Do not miss out on this album, nor any of their other albums!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne, a 17-year old hottie from Napanee, Ontario, Canada, stunned the world with her debut realse album Let Go in 2002.  Now, the punk-rock babe is back, and ready to stun the world even more with her newest album Under My Skin.  In 2002, Avril became the first hard-hitting female teen to give new light to girls, to stand up for themselves.  In this new lbum, Avril is going even deeper with meaning for teens.  With already smash hits like her album's debut single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, this Canadian native is ready to go all out to give her fans exactly what they want.  Not only is this 19 year old beautiful, but she has the voice of an youthful angel, and is ready to project it to the world.  Other songs, like &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;Together&quot; open the cd with amazing guitar riffs and fully head-banging melodies that with have everybody singing and dancing to her music.  On top of it all, every single track on this stunning album is written solely by Avril herself, which makes every song just as personal as the next.  If you haven't picked up her album yet, you are missing out!
B0001L3LUE|4.0|On the plus side, this film offers great insight into McNamara's experiences from WWII through the Kennedy years and the Cuban Missile Crisis...riveting stuff.  Great presentation by filmmaker Errol Morris.  McNamara was a very controversial figure in his time and had enemies on many fronts.  This film does a nice job giving this seemingly mythical figure and his time ethos.<br />The only disappointing thing for me was McNamara's refusal to discuss the Vietnam War in depth.  On one hand I admire McNamara's dedication to his president.  But this is the same president who asked him to resign because McNamara was urging Johnson to stick with Kennedy's plan to get US troops out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.  Of course, Johnson ignored his and other expert advice.  McNamara rationalizes his \\"speak no evil\\" position by suggesting the Vietnam situation was far more complicated then anyone really knows.  Great, drop a bomb like that and then refuse to elaborate.  I was very disappointed in his stance.  This is it Mr. McNamara, you're in your twilight years, why not lay it out.  Truth is far more important then protecting the legacy or office of the president.  Maybe he just simply comes from a different generation and bashing his Commander-In-Chief would seem inappropriate.  Too bad, I think we can handle it.  Suggesting that Johnson was a slow-witted buffoon quick to act with no plan is no secret.  After all he even lied to Congress to elevate the war.<br />Still, I was riveted to this DVD and found much of it very interesting.  In the end, McNamara has most admirably resolved himself to trying to rid the world of disease using his influence from his days with the World Bank.<br />Good film of a most interesting man.

B00008K7AM|2.0|Rating System:<br />1 star = abysmal; some movies deserve to be forgotten<br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br />4 star = very good; what a movie should be<br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: Through coincidence a high-school beauty and an idiot criminal switch bodies when they happen upon magical ancient Egyptian earings. Now starts the &#34;comedy&#34; of how they and their friends cope to the sudden change.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) Much of the humor was in the same vain as the Scary Movie trilogy = silly to the point that you still find yourself chuckling at how stupid it all is<br />2) Not a movie I'd recommend for kids as some people will find it offensive that the movie touches on (and seems to encourage) homosexuality, cross-dressing and marital unfaithfulness.<br />3) The cast did their job and must have had fun at such a ridiculous comic romp.<br />4) The story was predictable and no new ground explored here nor old ground handled in a fresh way<br />5) Adam Sandler's bit part (he produced the movie it appears) were as dumb as they get. Don't know why he even bothered appearing in the movie other than to help boost viewership.<br /><br />OVERALL: It got enough chuckles out of me that I didn't find it a total waste of time but it was close. I'd rather go back and watch Liar Liar or Happy Gilmore for some true original laughs.
B000001FKY|5.0|This album is one of the greatest 1980's albums of all time.  Def Leppard has had their share of tragedies.  For one their old guitarist, Pete Willis drank himself out of the band and then to top it all off when drummer Rick Allen took a break from the Pyromania Tour the week after Christmas and he was in a big car accident and it took his own arm.  And this album was the return of that of him on drums.  They got a replacment guitarist for Pete, but they couldn't fire Rick.  He had the confidence to get back on drums.  Hysteria is a big mix of professional guitar work, excellent vocals, and awesome drums.  A must-have for any Leppard fan or anybody who loves any of the things I just mentioned above.
B0001AP14E|5.0|If you liked &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; track 7 from College Dropout, be sure to check out the CD it was sampled from called &quot;Walk With Me&quot; (ASIN # B000000JM4) from the WORLD famous The ARC Choir.  ARC stands for Addicts Rehabilitation Center and it has been operating in Harlem area of New York City for over 40 years.  All of the members of the ARC Choir are former drug users who have been through the center's program. More than half the singers are in the program still, and live around the corner in one of two ARC residences where, at any one time, 400 addicts are seeking a cure.  Great music and a great cause by buying their CD.
B000000H57|5.0|October Rust is by far THE BEST Type O Negative album in my opinion.  If you have yet to purchase a TON album, I demand that you buy this one.  Unlike some of their earlier stuff which is more &quot;punk&quot; sounding, this album is more melodical and evocative of emotion, yet still has that hard and deep sound that TON is known for.  The majority of the songs are about love and loss.  It is a great &quot;mood-lighting&quot; album for rock/goth music fans.  BUY IT!

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Oh my (...) god this is a masterpiece.  For all those who say it sucks you can (...) Slipknot has totally blown away all my pre concieved notions about them.  I liked the 1st 2 Slipknot albums, which lack musical talent, but they got boring after I became a musician.  They proved they have the musical talent to be one of the greatest metal bands ever.  Sure it has slow, even acoustic songs but they have a Slipknot kind of creepyness about them.  They guitars are amazing.  The vocals are skilled and lack the vulgarity but if thats a problem for you you need to grow up.  The thing that caught my attention the most was the drumming by Chris and Shawn which finally has musical credability.  All in all Vol. 3(The Subliminal Versus) is just an amzing album by talented musicians who finally grew up.  Easily worthy of the 5 stars i give it
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the best bands ever.  The music is complex and interesting, the lyrics are deep, and the overall sound is excellent.  <BR>   For some reason, some people do not like this band.  Those people are either classic rock fans, who enjoy basic beats(besides Led Zeppelin, who rocks), or pop music fans, boy band lovers, rap loving fools, and head bangers.  I hate these people.<BR>    If you have friends that do not like Tool, then hit them and force them to listen to it nonstop, also A Perfect Circle.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Richard Donner usually does good movies. Not today. This is another example of a good book that was made into a terrible movie.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Okay, I went to see the movie, expecting the same variations of &quot;Lumos&quot; on this track--slow variations for scary, fast for happy--I was wrong.  Other than the previous two movies, using just &quot;variations on a theme&quot;, this one actually made me feel for the movie.  For once, I wasn't making fun of the series' music. I especially liked hearing VOICES for once instead of just instruments.  My favorite track would have to be &quot;Double Trouble&quot;.
B00007KQA3|1.0|I read the book right before I watched the movie and I mean RIGHT BEFORE. I finished reading the book and then put the movie on like a half hour later. There are a number of really, really disgusting parts in this movie. The dialogue is really hackneyed. The book is good. This movie is just about a travesty.
6305633177|5.0|I bought this and Cunning stunts not too long ago.  I was disappointed with Cunning stunts, but this one was awesome.  The songs here are much better played, and this was when Metallica was in it for the music not money!(Like they seem to be today, although I like some of their new stuff too).  All the songs are great played especially &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot; &quot;Sanatarium&quot; &quot;Fade to Black&quot; &quot;Creeping Death&quot; and &quot;From whom the bell tolls&quot;.<br />The quality was much better then I expected due to how horrible people said it was.  Of course the quality isnt the best audio and video vise but the songs are AWESOME and thats whats matters!(James said a similar thing too).  Also there is a funny interview with Cliff and James where they talk about people thinking they were sell out.  Cliff said &quot;We are doing what we want to and if they consider that selling out then whatever&quot;<br />Cliff seemed like a pretty cool guy and he was very talented , much better then the bassist that Metallica have today!<br />I think this DVD shows how talented Metallica were in the 80s.  In my opinion they were at their best then.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|A fantastic movie!  Beautifully directed, wonderfully acted, and a great story!  <br />If you enjoyed the movie, read the original by James Cain.  There are a few things about Mildred that the movie didn't tell - it may surprise you!
B000063UR2|4.0|I am adding this version to my Wish List today while I contemplate whether I want to pay 17 buck to see Tom Cruise in tights. I watched this movie (US version) over &amp; over in high school &amp; just loved it (except the cheesey soundtrack, which is not as bad as the one for &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;). I also viewed the UK version when it came out on laserdisc &amp; it is over the top! If only Ridley Scott could issue the drugs he was on when he made this bad boy, we could all know where he was coming from. It is very freaky &amp; vastly enjoyable. I have told so many people about this movie, because whenever Tom Cruise's acting history comes up, this never gets mentioned! Why not?! He's playing some sort of woodland boy-nymph &amp; skipping around with unicorns, fer chrissakes! Plus, Billy Barty is in it, Tim Curry is the personification of evil (his prosthetic chin is bigger than Bruce Campbell's real one), and Mia Sara (aka Sloane from &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; &amp; Jean-Claude Van Damme's wife from &quot;Time Cop&quot;) is a flighty princess who has a serious come-to-Jesus meeting with Darkness. I have suspected for years that this is the movie that paid for Tom's new teeth, because they are quite snaggly here &amp; it is not makeup.Too bad it didn't make him any taller. Anyway, I do recommend this movie highly, but as camp fun. If you have to roll a 20 sided dice to decide whether to buy it or not, just go ahead. You'll love it.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Despite a few cliches (spunky but poor Irish immigrant family; preternaturally mature child narrator), this film does a beautiful job of addressing the central question for anyone who has suffered the death of a loved one: how to endure the enormity of that loss without squandering the gift of life itself.  The film doesn't bludgeon the viewer with excessive scenes of the parents' conflicts and grief over the death of their son, but rather emphasizes more quirky and original aspects of the family's experiences from the two girls' points of view.  Without giving away the plot, I can only say that the device used to introduce the family's downstairs neighbor works well in this case to underscore the film's main theme.  Wonderful acting by all the principals, and the little girls are exquisite.  Joy and sadness are perfectly balanced -- perhaps a little too perfectly -- but with delightful results.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is one of the best moives I have seen in a long time. Uma also makes the movie, this has to be one of her best movies ever!!! If you are a fan of hers you must see. Its just a great movie!
B000062Y98|5.0|I think this is even more Epic,and amazing than the amazing Nightfall in middle earth.Although the musiscianship is about a tie.I also think some people might shy away from this album because of the fact that it is so epic.Most of those people are the ones expecting a more hardcore sound.Mainly Iced earth fan's,Angel dust fan's,and maybe nevermore fan's.It's all good though.Unless they try to pick on Rhapsody.A band that I think is just as good as Blind Guardian if not better.They're certainly faster,and have a better sounding choir.Now I'm not trying to harp on Blind guardian because I own about six of their album's,and I think they're great.I just hate it when people say that Rhapsodie's cheesy,and Blind Guardian's not.I think they're both kick a**.Except they should do away with Rhapsodie's narrator.He causes about 99 percent of those review's.And if you really want to no a band that's really worth listening to,try some Mid career Helloween.They're my all time favorite Power metal band.Plus they were extremely instrumental in being the forefather's to all Power metal.Check out their Tribute album's.You'll find group's like Dark moor,Sonata Arctica,Rhapsody,Steel Attack.And many other's.Although there was no Blind Guardian on that album.Blind Guardian's early stuff sound's alot like early Helloween,or Gamma Ray.<br />I'm sorry though,I can't stand Kia Hansen's voice,I really prefer Michael Kiskes Legendary vocal's.He sound's alot like Timo Coltipelto from Stratovarius or maybe Fabio Lione from Rhapsody.Except much better.Anyway's this album is loaded with amazing epic masterpeices.My personal Favorites are-And then there was silence-,Under the Ice,and Battle Field.Now some People don't get this music.And chances are,if you have something against music that has anything to do with fantasy.You will probably not like this.That's okay though,just listen to you'r mediocre group's that the POP radio feed's you,like good little atomiton droid's.You know the ones with hardly any talent,like Korn,and Godsmack,and just think they're the best thing since beer.The truth is,I've heard alot of them.I mean to say that I've been there,and done that,and I think alot of them are way overrated.Because most of them are seventy percent attitude,and thirty percent talent.Except maybe Metallica,but still,even they're overrated.I know because I use to own just about all of their album's.Ride the Lightning,Killem all,Justice for all,I mean,you name it.And I listened to them alot.I've listened to metal for about twelve year's,and they could use alot more speed,and double base.I'll tell you,I'm beginning to think american drummer's are just lazy.Plus there's practically no harmoniizing giutar solo's when it comes to Metallica.Which is the norm for power metal,much like speed ,and double base is.Heck the group brainstorm,especially on their second album.Deliver's guitar solo's where you'll never here a single guitar,it's alway's two.Anyway's,I'm getting off the subject.I think if this is you'r cup of tea then buy this album.I don't think I can describe this type of music anymore than I have.I can say however that I really enjoy it...
B00003CXCT|4.0|Even though the trilogy has been pasted up by more epic, up to date works, such as Lord of the Rings and Matrix, Star Wars is still the  first standard bearer of the level of quality that can be accomplished in this genre of science fiction and fantasy. <br />The development of the heroes, classical archtypes such as the rogue, the father/son religious complex all have been used without much degree of success in successive generations of movies, until lately.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Sophomore albums are always the hardest because you want to make it better than your first.  Well, Avril has definitly accomplished that.  With her first album &quot;Let Go&quot; we have annoying pop songs with cheesy lyrics, and on her latest album, we have more personal, vunberable, and heart touching lyrics.  The opening track starts off as a &quot;Get me the hell out of here song!&quot; But it is catchy.  Then the album shows us Avrils vulnerable side.  And it is pleasing side.  Not to mention that all 12 of the tracks on this album are extremly catchy.  So cheers to Avril for having a NON annoying and NON cheesy album.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Well, I didn't even know this had been released until 3 months afterward, and I decided to check it out, hoping it'd be as good as Hybrid Theory or their demos. I was a bit disappointed. Nevertheless, there were some redeeming gems that kept it from completely sucking. Without further adieu, here's my opinions, track by track:<br />Foreword - Just a really short opening track, not necessary at all (D+)<br />Don't Stay - This would have been better as the opening track. Even so, it's not too bad. (B+)<br />Somewhere I Belong - Okay. I don't think it's as good as some of the other tracks, but it's at least better than Numb. (B)<br />Lying from You - They're trying to do something new with the string instruments in the background. Nothing too special. (B-)<br />Hit the Floor - More rock-like than some of the other tracks. I liked this one. (A-)<br />Easier to Run - No, it's not a ballad like some of the reviews are saying. Still, it's a nice emotional rock track, fortunately less whiny than Numb. (B)<br />Faint - Out of all the songs from this album that were on the radio, this is the best. (A)<br />Figure.09 - A bit like &quot;By Myself,&quot; in my opinion. Another favorite of mine. (A-)<br />Breaking the Habit - Mellow, but too whiny. (C)<br />From the Inside - Like Easier to Run, but worse. (C+)<br />Nobody's Listening - Woodwinds, guitars, and rap? Oddly enough, this is pretty good, and it's become one of my favorites. (A+)<br />Session - DJ instrumental that was used on the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack. I like it, but I guess you'll only like it if you like this type of music. (A+)<br />Numb - AUUUGGGH!!! This song is overplayed and is the whiniest song ever!!!! (D-)<br />In conclusion, if you're expecting something as good as Hybrid Theory was, you're gonna be a bit disappointed. But, this CD is still good enough to buy, in my opinion.
6305696071|1.0|There are a lot of things to hate in this movie, but I'll be brief.<br />If you want to take a delightful fairy tale like Cinderella and update it, don't turn Cinderella into a streetwalking prostitute--and, if you insist on trashing the poor girl, make her a REAL prostitute, not the &quot;nice&quot; version America's Sweetheart does in PRETTY WOMAN.  There's something seriously wrong with a wholesome, perky hooker spreading her storybook love to a nation of naive girls.<br />Think about it.<br />This movie came out in 1990, five to six years after the AIDS panic first hit this country.  That there wasn't a decontamination scene worthy of SILKWOOD makes Richard Gere's character look like a complete reckless moron.  He doesn't so much as give Julia's Hollywood Blvd streetwalker a tick bath.<br />Give me a break.<br />Have you ever been to L.A.?  Just read a book called YOU'LL NEVER MAKE LOVE IN THIS TOWN AGAIN.  There are TONS of heart-stopping hot chicks all over that town, from the girls serving you burgers to the knock-outs who wrote the book I just mentioned.  A guy like Richard Gere, whether he had money or not, would not have to troll the streets of Hollywood and he DARN WELL wouldn't have to pay for it.<br />I liked the silver Lotus though.  Cool car.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was looking forward to this film to be released on dvd and rented it about three weeks ago. Amazingly, it still remains in me memory of certain distaste. The music by Kevin Shields was nice and so was Tokyo. The rest of the film (story, characters and cal) tried desperately to appear deep and dimensional, but it just didn't work. Maybe it was because the film was from Hollywood and I thought the colours were just too rich in contrast to the slow, boring mood in the film. Somehow i got the impression that the Coppola wanted to achieve those moods and... a story about people being meaninglessly stupid and fearing their own loneliness (although they brought it upon themselves). If true, well done fooling us! <br />Just dont bring any expectations when watching Lost In Translation, but rather have your own voice and emphaised with the characters when you wish to.
B00000JLWW|1.0|A word to the wise; if you want to see the movie, rent the VHS version, you're not missing a thing.  No special features!  We had to see this movie saturate every aspect of pop culture and they couldn't even add a music video or making of special, special effects anything or SOMETHING to the DVD?  If you like the movie, rent it.  If you want cool special features, you're better off with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.
B000002UAU|2.0|I love music. I always give a new sound a good listen before I discard it and this album was no different. I was constantly surprised to see it voted &quot;Greatest album&quot; in all time lists and was intrigued to see what all the fuss was about. It turns out all the fuss was about nothing. It is a weak album by anyone's standards, let alone the Beatles who have created Revolver, The White album etc. A Day in the Life is an amazing song, everything the Beatles' music stands for... and most of the rest of the album? Utter widdle. &quot;When I'm 64&quot;??? That is a poor excuse for a song if ever I've heard it. It makes sense listening to that how Paul could possible have put his name to that Frog Song. It's music for kids. It is NOT music for those of us who want an experience to come from our lyrics and sonic scapes. <br />I quite understand why many claim this to be the best ever; because many of those who do were around when this came out, and it reminds them of a time in their life when it was great to be a little cool and hippy. That's all well and good, we all love some stuff (that some people just don't &quot;get&quot;) because it takes us back to a happy time. Well, for goodness sake keep it to yourselves. This is a supremely poor album, end of story. If you don't see passed the gimmick that this band was peddling at the time this was released you are blind. <br />Then again, I think the Beatles were generally somewhat overrated, certainly Lennon was. The Stones were much more &quot;real&quot;, that much is clear, even to a 23 year old like myself. I don't claim to be the biggest Beatles fan, but they have written some absolute classics. This album contains one classic, a few good tunes and a whole lotta widdle. Avoid unless you wish to relive the '60's and all that was bad with music back then. There were so many classics from that era, try them instead; I suggest The Band, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; or &quot;The Band&quot;.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Jude Law is excellent in this film, and Nicole Kidman is good also.  But they just do not click together.  Their \\"passionate\\" scenes feel staged, and they are both such good actors, that most of the time it goes unnoticed.  Rene Zellweger finally got her Oscar, having been passed over two years in a row for \\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\" and \\"Chicago.\\"  She lost the Oscar for \\"Chicago\\" to Nicole Kidman who won for \\"The Hours.\\"  To me, it seemed like sweet revenge to upstage a rival in every scene she has in this film.  There is one other thing that recommends this film, and that is its splendid cinematography.  Otherwise, the plotting feels very similar to another of Director Anthony Minghella's films, \\"The English Patient,\\" only this story is set during the Civil War.  Also, there are some obvious plot devices that had me shaking my head.  One I remember is when Jude Law and Philip Seymor Hoffman are making their way through the wilderness when they just happen across a large, two-handled saw.  Hmmmmm, I wonder if this item will come into play in a future scene?  I didn't have to wait very long.  There is also an over-abundance of nudity.  Being a guy, this is a rare thing for me to complain about, but it just feels gratuitous here;  like it's used more for shock-value than for any specific reason.   Overall, this really isn't a bad film at all.  Rene Zellweger shines, as does the cinematography, but all else is merely professional or sadly forgettable.  Thank you.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|1. Prelude - Excellent first song...on the soft side but sets the tone for the album, check the lyrics out sometime, I love the way it goes into song two.<br />2. The Blister Exists - Old school Slipknot...jump in the pit and murder someone.  Drums at the end are a nice touch.<br />3.  Three Nil - Everytime I hear this song I hear something else in it that I didn't hear at first, like on headphones, different cars, in the house stero, etc..  I love the lyrics.  The bass towards the middle is so deep it vibrates my whole car.  Again a powerful song.  \\"See the great big mouth shut up and apologize\\".<br />4.  Duality - The best song on the cd period, I don't car what anyone says.  I love every part of it and could care less if it is on the radio.  Everyone in the group has a part on this one and it shows.  Listen for Clown hitting an empty keg with a large wooden bat throughout the song.  That's freakin' awesome.  I saw him do it on Jay Leno.  The end is really stomppy.  I'd jump up in the pit for this one.<br />5.   Opium of the People - This one sounds like a few other bands and then sounds like Slipknot again.  As soon as the song hits two minutes though it grows on you and gets more powerful.  <br />6.  Circle - This one starts out like it might blow up on you but stays the same way throughout the song: soft.  The bass however is awesome and the whole song has a good feel to it.  The first few times really loud in the car it gave me that feeling in the back of my neck.  That don't happen a lot.  At this point in the album I can definately deal with this song.  I believe it might have been written a while ago and finally put out.  Drums at the end are totally unecessary but that's still cool.<br />7.  Welcome - Okay this is perfect to go after the last song.  Old school again.  Get in the pit and lunge and someone in the neck then have your friend get dragged out for jumping in and eventually everyone gets booted out...nevermind.  The sampling towards the end is good and oh yeah...mmm...double-bass.<br />8.   Vermilion - I don't like the way this one starts out but it's growing on me.  Make it through the first two minutes again and then the song gets so much better.  I could dig with the harmony singing as well.  This one is pretty good overall....only really really loud do I get the chills but it still happened for a while.  Lyrics are good too.  <br />9.   Pulse of the Maggots - Here we go again, perfect song to follow the last.  Love the sampling and a good, solid, stomppy, song.  <br />10.  Before I Forget - Old school beat on this one.  Sounds like Prong at times to me.  \\"Another Worldly Device\\".  Anyhow, the middle musically is awesome.  Overall good song.  By this time the album is going great....better than the last album.<br />11.  Vermilion, Pt. 2 - This is the one that causes the initial pain.  First..I don't picture these guys in costume singing this one.  Anyhow despite that it is so so light it's basically a copy of track 8 just a million times lighter.  Every group has to have one of these.  Even SOAD w/ Roullette and yak.  At first I was like screw this one but again, as everything else is grows on me.  Still a little too soft for my taste.  No percussion at all either.  :(<br />12.  The Nameless - Good thing this one is next cause by it being that way it makes the last song better.  Classic, classic Slipknot.  Double-bass galore.  I like the switches in the middle a la Mudvayne and the scratching.  Jump in the pit then catch your breath before you start wilding out again.  Good track, I liked this one right away.  Carnival yak in the middle is cool too. <br />13.  The Virus of Life - I like the way this one starts out and ends but the middle gets me yawning.  The sampling is awesome.  THE CD SHOULD HAVE ENDED HERE.<br />14.  Danger - Keep Away - This one is annoying but I listen anyway.  It stops at 3 minutes then goes to dead air with some buzzing at the very end.  That's gay to make me wait that whole timefor buzzing.  Anyhow this one is the worst so it leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  Should have ended with track 13.
B00005T30L|5.0|From a first glance, &quot;Ghost World&quot; appears to be your ordinary teen comedy/drama when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a strange and very well made film that is touching, funny, sad and twisted.  One of those rare gems that did not fall victim to a &quot;Hollywood&quot; formula.  I don't know why it took me so long to finally watch this, but I'm glad that on a day when I had nothing to do that I decided to pop this into the DVD player.<br />Based on the underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the story focuses on two characters who have just graduated from high school, Enid and Rebecca.  They love to snoop around in other people's lives and find ways to humiliate them for their own amusement.  When they play a practical joke on an isolating loner, Seymour, Enid can't help to feel a little guilty--which is something she never feels in similar situations.  She ends up forming a strange and open relationship with him after that, and that's when things become complicated for Enid.  While Rebecca has more of a focus on where to go next after finishing high school, Enid doesn't have a clue about her future.  She feels trapped in a dead end town that offers no sanctuary for her.  All of this makes way for a drama/comedy that sticks out from other films.<br />I had been told many times that this was a movie that I had to see, and now I finally understand why.  It was completely different from what I thought the movie would end up being.  It's funny and sad at the same time, which is a very difficult task to accomplish without it ending up being corny.  The movie is very well written (co-written by the very man who did the comic book), with very realistic dialogue and characters.  The movie doesn't really feel like a movie, because it feels like real life.  You feel like you know these characters and have seen them before.  We all went to school with people like this at some point.  That's when you know when something really works--when you feel like you are there.<br />One of the great things about the movie is that there is not a big payoff in the end.  There's on grand finale or an ending that lets you know that everything is going to be all right.  I know this was a disappointment for some people, but I couldn't envision the film ending in any other way.  It's a realistic and beautiful moment.  And to me, that was the greatest payoff you could find.  It also shows you that this film refuses to conform to Hollywood standards, which is always refreshing.<br />The DVD has a few things to offer--&quot;few&quot; being the keyword here.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the features that were included, but I was hoping there'd be a few more goodies for a standout movie like this.  The picture and sound is very good, so no problems there.  Extras included are deleted and alternate scenes, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, trailers and a music video.  I think a great opportunity was missed here, as this is the perfect movie that screams for a commentary from the cast and crew.  Despite the fact that it isn't loaded with a ton of extras, it's still a very nice package.<br />&quot;Ghost World&quot; is a phenomenal achievement in filmmaking, in my opinion.  True, it is not something that everybody will be head-over-heels for, but those who end up loving it will really appreciate it for what it is.  It's a film that takes risks and never falls into a basic movie formula.  If you're looking for a movie that is different from the rest, this is an excellent choice.  A superb film on all fronts. -Michael Craneyou feel like you are there.<br />One of the great things about the movie is that there is not a big payoff in the end.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|Tomb Raider is good fun and good for a rental.  The Movie itself will eventually be forgotten.  Angelina Jolie does good, and the plot it okay.  The effects are good, as well as the settings.  The movie is only okay.  See it if you love action.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Before I bought Elephant,I had always thought that The White Stripes were just another overrated band with a lotta hype.But when I bought the CD,I was taken aback cuz the album is soooo good.Ive become a huge White Stripes fan now.I'm sure you'll like this album if you like The Strokes,Vines and the Hives.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album has the best songs ever. A total must-have. If u liked the first one u will love this one.The songs in it are total hits that vary from powerful lyrics like \\"Forgotten\\" and \\"My Happy Ending\\". To more mature lyrics like \\"Nobody's Home\\" and \\"Together\\". It has more mature meaning unlike Let Go that only talks about boyfriends and growing up. This album talks about fear of growing up (Nobody's Home) Teen Spirit (Freak Out) to sexual abstinence (Don't tell Me). This is a total award winner and should be album of the year. Avril keep up the good work.
B00008CLOA|5.0|There is little that can be added about this CD, that has not been already said. It is Floyd's best (And one of the best CDs in ANY Genre of all-time), with tremendous lyrics, such as in &quot;Money&quot;, and &quot;Us And Them&quot; (Only The Wall of ANY Floyd CD comes close), and of course, outstanding instrumentals. It is a shame that you cannot find rock groups of today that are in the same class with Pink Floyd (Let alone Zeppelin or The Who). This is a CD that should be in ANYONE's collection, because it is classic rock at its best.
B0000062FJ|4.0|This debut is first rate all the way.  Carlos Santana provides some super guitar solos with a cutting edge latin flare.  Often overlooked are Greg Rollie's piano, organ, and vocal contributions.  His singing on Persuasion, Shades of Time, and You Just Don't Care are very strong.  I simply adore the keyboard touches on Treat.  That instrumental is a super underatted gem.<br />I can't overlooked the percussion and drumming either.  Its these compelling rhythms that separate Santana from many of the jam bands of the late sixties.<br />Anyway, this is a fine debut which almost rates on the same level as Abraxas and Santana 3.
B00005UK1F|3.0|The idea of using an entire album for one song or concept isn't new. Rush did it on their 2112 and Hemispheres albums back in the 1970s, Mountain's live album features a 23-minute long rendition of &quot;Natucket Sleighride&quot;, Yes's &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; also occupied an entire side of an LP. More recently, Dream Theater's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Change of Seasons EP also features very lengthy tracks. Why the comparisons with the past? Because according to some reviewers here, Green Carnation's Herculean effort of &quot;Day of Darkness&quot; is the best thing since sliced bread. It isn't - the band breaks no new musical ground at all, delivering a functional, adequate gloom-metal album that's listenable but nothing more. There are some decent highlights, such as the softer passages, or those with the chanting choir. And thankfully, the vocals aren't growled and can actually be discerned. But the general level of musicianmanship is only average, so comparisons to the likes of Dream Theater or other viruoso-based bands is not possible. It's certainly worth a listen but my criteria is always whether the tunes eventually stay in my head long enough for me to at least hum along. Applying this criteria, Green Carnation falls short.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This is a trained baritone voice??? What? No. This is pop at its worst. This is sub-bocelli. Opera singers prenounce their lyrics correctly and don't just slob their way through the Italian or THE ENGLISH! If he tried to sing in an opera with that wimpy, breathy, and poorly trained &quot;baritone&quot; (i say baritone but its more of a tenor with poor range.) no one would hear him. (Because in opera the singing is unamplified.)And his italian is so poor that he wouldn't be able to keep up with the fast baritone arias.<br />His voice loses pitch when he sings high notes because of his bad english pop sound just like Bocelli. His facial expressions while he &quot;sings&quot; are comparable to Mel Gibson's on the rack in Braveheart. He'll make a decent broadway star altough I always prefer a nice &quot;full&quot; and supported voice.<br />  Bottom line... Its not opera,its bad manufactured pop. You want opera? Get Lucianio Pavarotti or Placido Domingo. You want real baritones? Get Sherill Milnes and Bryn Terfel. And if you must get Bocelli.<br />Just please don't Groban or if you do don't call it opera.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Empire(1990). Queensryche's fourth studio album.<br />Back in the early 80s, one band from Seattle began its conquest to form a uniquely sounding heavy metal band. Queensryche was this band. They almost initially got tacked onto a major record label with the countless glam metal acts, but thankfully EMI Records, which was a smaller record company, picked them up and gave them producer James Guthrie, who worked with Pink Floyd previously. This enabled the band to have a lot of room for artistic growth, and thus developed Queensryche into something greater. Queensryche started as a heavy metal band on their debut EP(1983). Eventually though, the band began moving into more epic songs on The Warning(1984), and creating a matured, futuristic cyber-metal sound on Rage For Order(1986). However, it wasn't until the band hired producer Peter Collins (who worked with Rush) for Operation: Mindcrime(1988) that the band had finally achieved great success. Mindcrime was also the band's most realized effort, being that it was a dark concept album revolving around a complex story. At this point, Queensryche had moved away from the heavy metal sound and became more of a melodic progressive hardrock band.<br />Now we arrive in 1990, at Queensryche's MTV breakthrough album, Empire. The title of my review says it all. You heard me right: A BAND THAT MAKES TRULY OUTSTANDING MUSIC GETS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE ON MTV. This is one of the only two times in the 90s that this happened, the other time being with the band Tool. After Mindcrimes rather heady story which required complete attention, Empire sort of takes the band into a more mainstream territory, but still employing intelligent themes into the individual songs. This is similar to how it was done on Rage For Order, though the songs here are far more commercial in nature. Peter Collins is back to produce again, and with him Queensryche managed to craft 11 excellent songs. The production is HUGE and crisp, much like the two albums he worked on with Rush previously in the mid-80s. Some have said that this was Queensryche's sell-out album, and while in certain ways it was true, I don't believe it really affected the quality of this album one bit. The band hadn't let MTV syndrome get to their heads...yet. That is yet to come.<br />Onto the album. It starts with the BEST opener on any Queensryche album, 'Best I Can'. This uplifting anthem really hits home for me, and it's probably one of the best rockers I've heard in a while. Next is the melodic 'The Thin Line', followed by the BIG radio hit 'Jet City Woman'. I love the base line that leads into the song. If one thing is to be noted, Geoff Tate's voice is beginning to show signs of change. It's not a hindrance yet, but here is where it's first spotted. 'Della Brown' has a cool melodic pacing to it, and it's one of my favorite tracks. 'Another Rainy Night' reminds me of Iron Maiden the way the first riff breaks in. The title track is a dark pounding anthem with killer vocals, as is the amazing 'Resistance'. This song bears an Aerosmith-like quality to it, but somehow I enjoy it. Next is the power ballad hit (you heard me right) 'Silent Lucidity'. A decent ballad, though a bit overrated by some. 'Hand On Heart' has one of the greatest melodies to it during the entire song and thus it stands out. Then there's the slow rocker 'One And Only', followed by the accoustic album closer 'Anybody Listening?'. On the new remastered edition are three extra Empire B-sides. 'Last Time In Paris' is a heavy pounding anthemic rocker, followed by the experimental waltzy track 'Scarborough Fair'. Different but awesome. 'Dirty Lil Secret' is simply a bouncy rocker which rounds off the album nicely. Of all the remastered albums, Empire has the best extras as all three songs are easily just as good as the rest of the album itself, so it's very worthwhile to seek out the remastered edition.<br />How does Queensryche's mainstream breakthrough album fare? Well, it's certainly notas daring as the previous albums, but at the same time, it does feature 5-star quality commercial songwriting. There isn't a single bad song to be found on the disc. In actuality, I believe it's just as good as the previous albums, only in different ways. Rage For Order is still my favorite, but Empire definitely ranks up there. It pleases me that a well written album gets the praise it deserves. Unfortunately it's all downhill from there, for in the years after Empire, Queensryche degraded into an MTV sellout alternative act and they would never recover again. If you're just getting into Queensryche, any of the first four albums will do, though Empire might be a good first pit-stop. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other similar albums:<BR>-'Rage For Order' by Queensryche<BR>-'Transcendence' by Crimson Glory<BR>-'Awakening The Guardian' by Fates Warning
B00014TJ6Q|4.0|My favorite George Harrison album is &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;, and the 1979 &quot;George Harrison&quot; album follows after that. It is regarded by many Harrison fans as one of George's lesser albums, but for whatever reason it really struck a cord with me then, and still now.<br />I still view &quot;George Harrison&quot; (11 tracks, 43 min.) as having the vinyl A and B side, and on that score, I rate the A side 5 stars and the B side 3 stars. Indeed, the opening 5 tracks are as close to perfect as you can get. The opener &quot;Love Comes to Everyone&quot; is a classic Harrison &quot;love&quot; song. &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is a song written in the latter Beatles days (which incidentally you can preview on &quot;Beatles Anthology 3&quot;), and just beautiful. &quot;Blow Away&quot; is one of George's best tunes ever. The B side is not nearly as good. &quot;Faster&quot; (an ode to Formula 1 racing) is the better of the lot, but the Spanish-tinted &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; misfires badly. The closer &quot;If You Believe&quot; is another classic Harrison tune, though.<br />This remastered edition comes with a demo-version of &quot;Here Comes the Moon&quot;, a nice touch but not essential. The liner notes are great, with George commenting on how all the songs came about (extracted from his autobiograpgy &quot;I Me Mine&quot;). In all, a great album.
0385486804|5.0|This is an excellent read!  But more than that, it is one of most moving and human stories you will ever have the pleasure of encountering by an author such as Krakauer, a splendid naturalist with a true ear for epiphany.  Krakauer has a style unlike any writer this side of the twentieth century, and makes his way honestly and earnestly into the psyche of the reader, unexpectedly portraying a very real and true, almost unspeakable understanding of the young adventurer, Chris McCandless.  If you are American, you absolutely must read this book!  It should be cannonized.
B0000A1RJI|1.0|Come on, people--A film can only be carried so far on 'star' power before we eventually have to come to grips with the fact that it really was an AWFUL MOVIE, and the soundtrack was even worse.  Klaus Badelt himself only worked on the thing for thirty days, and it shows!  There's nothing 17th-century about it whatsoever--Everything is completely synthesized and cheaply (and hurriedly) made, with no orchestral backing and no thematic pirate elements at all, which all amounts to a soundtrack completely out of place for the genre of the movie it's supposed to be supporting.  There's not even any original melody in the music--It's all just cues from The Rock, Gladiator, and Disney World's own silly pirate ride!  Anyone who owns the soundtracks from Zimmer's other movies should easily be able to tell where they've just been cut and sewn together to form this grating mess of synthesized drums and cellos.  I honestly can't fathom why Amazon.com's readers are giving it such good reviews, except maybe that they just want to support Johnny Depp--but Filmtracks.com gave it one star out of five (their average user rating is 2.75 stars) and after comparing it with John Debney's magnificent score for Cutthroat Island, often considered the greatest soundtrack in the history of film, I completely agree with the professionals.  To the bottom with this wreck!
6305252521|4.0|This movie has two true modes of representation: how television perpetuates through society and how people treat celebrities.  First of all, Truman is no more a victim than a result of circumstances.  His fate was ultimately chosen by a dictatorial creator (played brilliantly by Ed Harris, who deserved an Oscar nomination rightly so).  But as Truman discovers the truth about his pre-ordained life, the &quot;audience&quot; becomes captivated.  The people in the bar console each other and try to rationalize Truman's decisions.  The real truth about television is revealed at the very end when the two security men say &quot;What else is on?&quot; after Truman escapes.  We, as Americans, have so readily counted on television as a main source of not only entertainment, but solace.  We live our lives through the medium of the character.  So, in a way, this movie is a &quot;movie within a movie.&quot;  <br />Additionally, the movie symbolizes in some small way how we idolize celebrities.  Truman is a celebrity.  The people in Seahaven are all aware, but do not tell him he is on T.V.  Rather, they all &quot;act.&quot;  This is somewhat interesting because in a way, the actors may want to keep Truman on the island, not only for their jobs' sake, but also because he is an idol.<br />The truth is, however, that television has a commanding grasp on the American public, and that is the point of the movie.  We lift the minority of celebrities (Harris as the director, the media, etc.) on our shoulders.  It's almost as if we are brainwashed by T.V.  <br />Harris's character is most intriguing.  You don't know if he is helping Truman or hurting him.  Harris plays a somewhat symbolic father.  He believes that since he gave Truman &quot;a life to live,&quot; that he knows what is right for Truman.  That knowledge also gives Harris the ability to destroy him, as exemplified by the storm scene at the end.<br />Overall, this movie is unique and ground-breaking, and I recommend it to all.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Comedy, like technology, just can't be un-invented - once it's known to exist, it exists.  The best stuff spreads quickly, ad nauseum, and this assuredly is a classic comedy.  In typical u.s.-style, we didn't just one-up the competition, we ten-upped them to the point where their comedy/technology was rendered quote/unquote laughable.  So to speak.  Peter Sellers was one of the best, and he certainly knew how to leverage comedy.  :-)  A comedy about the ugliest cold-war techs, heck, why not?
0060001941|5.0|A tree Grows in Brookly will always have a special place in my heart, it along with Maggie-now was given to me by my late grandmother when I was younger. The reader is rooting for Francie and her family to make it through all their hardship that comes there way. The family sticks together and always come through in the end. What a great book. It is perfect for middle and highschool kids to read, it don't have all the bad behavior that's in so many coming of age stories today.
B000068PQ0|5.0|My God! This CD is absolutely amazing. I am a massive fan of these guys and The Soft Bulletin and Clouds Taste Metallic are a  couple of my favourite CD's...but nothing prepared me for this. This album is their crowning achievement. Like many great albums (Radiohead's 'Ok Computer', Wilco's 'YHF', Pavement's 'Terror Twilight') this album takes a few listen's to truly appreciate. But please, I beg you, be patient...it is worth it. There are some tracks here that amaze with their pure magical brilliance - The Morning of the Magicians and Do you Realize make me feel the way that I felt when I first heard The Beatle's 'Revolver'  - this is something special that will last forever. And that just about sums it up - this CD is mind blowing and will last forever. Take the trip...you will never be the same.

B000094HLA|5.0|I just watched Hannibal again last night and dug out my fave version of Bach's variations, so's I could feel all Lecter-esque (feline and visceral and utterly present) as I was writing into the morning...<br />I prefer this to the Glenn Gould versions (both his early and later releases). It is just a matter of preference. I like my variations played intimately, slowly yet with depth and emotion- Schiff weaves his way through these like a nimble dancer.<br />It's a slow, languid, mesmerizing preformance and the audience is nothing short of the platonic ideal of what an audience should be- I can't hear a single thing from them and it doesn't sound as if the producer had someone edit out background noise. If you're looking for an epic rendering of these tunes- this is where i would have you go.<br />Still one of the only good things about existing in our world and age is that there are myriad versions of this out and about and you could have them all at your fingertips! Find your own fave. Dig in. The Goldbergs (Goldbugs I called them back when my teacher tried to make me learn 'em when I was young) are beautiful enough to warrant multiple copies. There are at least 25 or so different recordings (you can find countless ones here in amazon if you look- there's a great listmania that enumerates many of them...) of these sumptuous pieces by so many pianists that I'm daunted by the task of hunting them all down.<br />Still one aspires to rise to the occasion...
B00005JLPK|4.0|Such a good movie in the cinematic sense. It was beautifully done, but I felt it lacked the depth of Frida's character. The relationship between she and Rivera was so much more than the movie made it out to be, but the two did excellent jobs portraying Frida and Diego Rivera. THe music was especially good in this soundtrack, I bought it too!

B00005QG9J|4.0|This CD has some good moments, but Incubus seems to have finally gone more mainstream. Drive was a great song, and this CD has a bunch of good songs on it, but it is nowhere near the masterpieces of SCIENCE, Make Yourself, and A Crow Left of the Murder. I like a lot of these lyrics, but the whole sound is a lot more mainstream and less Incubus-like.
0806930152|1.0|I have bought many drawing books and have been able to gleam at least something from each that I thought warranted me keeping the book. After going through this book, I can find nothing useful. Before buying the book I read the reviews and after reading and trying to use the book, I can't imagine what the reviewers who had anything good to say, were talking about. Save your money. In this book the author just gives you a bunch of disassociated illustrations.
B000148KK2|5.0|I love this album; granted, it was not love at first sight: at first I wasn't sure what to think of Diana's deviation from the jazz standards she had us used to. After all, I love all of her previous albums (with exception perhaps of &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, which I think is her weakest) and I always liked Diana's take on jazz, as well as her beautiful interpretations. When I first listened to this album I felt disoriented, but changed my mind the second time around.<br />Her new album certainly takes a different direction, as Diana is not singing the usual jazz standards, but has chosen new material and added her own creations (in collaboration with husband Elvis Costello). The result, in my opinion, is a very refreshing album that is still 100% Diana Krall. Her voice is charged with emotion and beautiful as always. The arrangements are just right, not excessive (as in &quot;The Look of Love&quot;) nor too bare. <br />Her choice of songs shows an artist that has range and doesn't stick to the established formula. I especially like &quot;Temptation&quot;, &quot;Stop This World&quot; and &quot;Black Crow&quot; from among the covers. As for the songs written in collaboration with her husband, I love the album title track, &quot;Narrow Daylight&quot; and &quot;Departure Bay&quot;.<br />In brief, I think Diana's &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; is a beautiful piece of music that shows her growth as an artist. If you don't like to stick to formulaic music and loved her previous albums, give it a try. I know I did and am enjoying every minute of it.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Jack's Jack (again), Keanu Reeves is still the worst actor in the history of cinema, and Diane Keaton's over-the-top performance is an embarassing study in ham-handed vanity.<br />Frances McDormand's brilliant, but underused.  Oh yeah, and this silly little ode to ego is, like, five hours long.  Enjoy.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenge Sevenfold is bringing together True metal, Screamo and Hardcore.  The riffs are amazing, the basslines actually important and the drumlines are fast and hard.  And yet unlike most bands with gifted musical talent, they actually have decent vocals.  No more of the old metal lyrics that are lacking in meaning and sensarity.  I first found out about this band through my drummer, when she saw them in drum magazine and then again in guitar magazine.  this band is definitely sumthing to check out.
0385512104|4.0|It is a new experience to have read this book. The story teller is an autism, who apart from his lack of social ability, you'll be surprise at what he knew and could do.<br />I think this book made me somewhat more aware of my surrounding and gave me clues what to do if I ever end up in his situation. It also brought back some memories from high school (what an intriquing math problem).<br />Just read and feel the new experience by being a autism genius.
0425170055|4.0|Actually, I was being mildly facetious in my review title. Rainbox Six is the code name for John Clark (as the Six designation in military radio protocol indicates the leader of a given group) and the Rainbow group is an elite group of NATO special ops soldiers set up by order of President Jack Ryan. No sooner is this group set up that they get their first call - a bank robbery at a Swiss bank. Their takedown is executed perfectly, with no casualties to good guys or innocents. Well - you get the idea. Ding Chavez is head of Team Two (the Rainbows are split into two teams of eight men each) and each member of Team Two is profiled and fleshed out, giving the reader a chance to connect with them. Unfortunately, the Team One members are treated like cardboard cutouts, set up to be knocked down. Most are not named and the few that are are barely described. This plot point is so evident in the early going that it's clear Clancy wants to spare the reader the pain of reading about a well-liked character getting killed - which I thought was a bit irritating. He did no such sparing of feelings in \\"Without Remorse\\" and the novel was the better for it.<br />The evil enemy in this one is a group of environmental extremists who plan to exterminate the entire human population of Earth - except of course, themselves and others they deem worthy. I thought it unseemly that Clancy's right-wing tendencies show through so clearly in this novel that he portrays environmentalists on the same plane as Islamic terrorists or Nazis. Certainly Clancy must be aware that even the far left has within its ranks people who are genuinely concerned for human life and would never contemplate such an act. The climax (or anti-climax as described by some reviewers) is deliciously ironic, and even though it isn't the flash-bang of a major battle with automatic weapons fire going in all directions, it was to me a very satisfying and enjoyable conclusion to the novel - it all makes for an entertaining, if somewhat implausible read.

0441172717|4.0|Having been a science fiction fan for only a short time, and mostly through the works of Robert A. Heinlein, I felt compelled to read Dune as I considered it my &quot;duty&quot; if I were to repectably describe myself as a Sci-fi fan. <br />What I found in Dune was a richly detailed description of that universe's politics, commerce, warfare, and all the intrigue and scheming that ultimately tie them all together. However, there is at times a tendency toward a sluggishness of plot that can make certain parts of the novel a chore to get through, but it is all rewarded in the end. <br />What was intriguing, however, was that, as a sci-fi novel, Dune pays scant attention to the supposed advanced technology that we 21st-century folk would expect from humans in the year 10,191 A.D. I had expected to find descriptions of how the ornithopters (aircraft that flap their wings like birds) and personal sheild belts (which generate a force-field around the wearer that deflects fast moving projectiles and swift sword swings, but curiously lets in slowly-guided knife thrusts) work, but it seems Herbert expected the reader to take it at his word that such things were as commonplace and therefore as unnoteworthy in the 102nd century as jet aircraft and automatic firearms are in the 21st. I found it curious that warfare in the 102nd century was conducted in much the manner it was in the 13th century, where the soldiers' standard weapons were swords and lances. <br />The story itself revolves around the character Paul Atriedes. At the book's beginning, he is a mere lad of fifteen, heir to his father, the Duke Leto Atriedes. The Atriedes family is ordered by the Emperor to take over the planet Arrakis, a desert planet regarded as a wasteland and valuable only because it is the source of the spice known as Melange, which imparts on its users a form of ESP. The incumbent Noble House on Arrakis, the Harkonnens, are loath to give up a huge source of profits without a fight, and through intrigue and scheming, manage to launch an attack on the newly-arrived Atriedes, killing the Duke Leto and casting Paul and his mother into the desert to die. Paul eventually comes to be the leader of the desert people known as the Fremen, and through his skill and training recovers his rightful place as Duke. <br />WHile this book is widely considered a masterpiece of science fiction writing, I found that the climax felt, well, anti-climactic. There wasn't the feel of tension before the final battle, being built up over several chapters, as was the case in the Lord of the Rings saga, and is this were written as a stand-alone book, it didn't feel like it. In fact, it felt as though it was deliberately setting the reader up for subsequent novels of Paul Atriedes and his Fremen hordes.
B000002KIE|5.0|Say way you want about this album- but it truly changed the course of modern music, and it's place in history is concrete. This album changed recording, deal making, radio air play list, marketing,press ... you name it- it changed it all. There are two histories in rock music-before the Sex Pistols -and after- period!   Now about the music-it is not great, it is not talented ,it is not polished, well thought out, difficult,clever, or original. It is Cords and Emotions only... for those of you to young to know -just what rock and roll had lost- a purpose( emotion). Rod Stewart is a great singer, David Bowie is a great singer, but they can't touch Johnie Rotton for sheer emotion, hatred, anger, or disgust for the passer by.     Buy this record and let some stress off.      Before this record it wasn't cool to sing with an accent remember that?     Bodies stands as the greatest anti abortion song ever!      No feelings stands as the greatest anthem for misguided youths ever!\\" I look around your house/ you got nothing to steal/... I kick you in your head when you get down and kneel/to prey/ to prey your god/prey to you god/ no feelings/ no feelings/ for anybody else/except for my self/ my beautiful self\\"    New York an example of lost admiration for an idol -john Lennon     God save The Queen -a slap in the establishments face from the non-working class \\" God save the queen/ she ain't no human being/ and theres no future/ and englands dreaming!\\"     Hoilday In the Sun wow!      \\" See my face/not a trace/ no reality/ I don't work/ I just speed/ thats all i need/ I'm a lazy sod/ I'm a lazy sod/ I'm a lazy sod/ I'm so lazy I can't even be bothered / LAZY     if you like the carpenters and both of your parents are still married happily, if you make good grades, and are popular, and like your life...GET this record and join the rest of the people save your self!
B000001DWG|5.0|I cannot listen to &quot;Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns&quot; without getting chills.  &quot;Stargazer&quot; and &quot;Stardog Champion&quot; are quite enjoyable too.  I own no Pearl Jam CD's; I consider the forerunner to be far superior.  Andrew Wood was a very insightful artist.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The cover is a copy of Elvis Presley's first studio album -showing that the Clash meant to change things.The Sex pistols divided the history of rock and roll in half, and this album meant to set the record straight- the the next era of rock and roll was personal. I think no other album has had such lofty sights (since sargents peppers), and no other recording has taken itself higher. Sorry Beatles, this is the greatest album of all time bar none. Joe strummers voice is amazing,as it mixes with the more polished Mick Jones, it set a new standard for dueling rock singers. London Calling sets the record off \\" London Calling to the far away lands/ now war is discovered and battles coming down\\" The hopelessness of 30% unemployment in london, and the threat of nuclear war on the youth of the world, with out a say in their own future is stated right here. \\"london is drowning/ and I live by the river\\"   I remember putting on album one and was still in my room (at 16) 7 hours later listening to this gem of a recording.   By favorite tracks are Hateful- about a drug addict and his dealer.Clampdown about apartied in South Africa(years before MTV and Paul Simmon thought it was cool to deal with).All lost in the supermarket about feeling lost and out of place in your own world.Revolution Rock- great raggae song. Spanish Bombs ,and Lovers Rock- about taking responsiblity for your sex life.  All pretty heady subjects for a rock group, but the clash took their fans seriously and with respect. Listening to this album was a revolution battle  cry for the 80's of Reagan and the arms race at any cost.
B000003S09|5.0|When this album was released in 1969, it was to change the whole face of rock music as it was then known. In `The Court Of The Crimson King' by King Crimson almost single handedly invented what was to become known as progressive rock, and with first track '21st Century Schizoid Man' had a fair hand at putting heavy metal music on the map.<br />The strange thing is that 'In The Court Of The Crimson King' started life as a bit of a curiosity. I bet that half of the first lot of people to buy this album did so due to its cover alone, relying upon the intuition that anybody who would put such a face to their music, inevitably had to have quite some spirit of adventure. They were - of course - correct.<br />King Crimson had a very auspicious debut year. Their first few rehearsals were held in January; their debut live performance was at the Speakeasy in London, April 9th, followed by a support slot at the Rolling Stones free concert in Hyde Park in July. Their debut album was released to great critical acclaim in October and reached # 5 in the British Charts and # 28 in the American Billboard. This led to touring America in November and December prior to splitting up before the end of the year. (After the American tour McDonald, Giles, and Lake left Fripp, claiming the standards he required were impossible to maintain. Greg Lake was persuaded to return for the recording of follow-up album 'In The Wake of Poseidon' (1970), and McDonald did eventually play with Crimson again on 'Red' in 1974.) There is always plenty going on in the Crimson household.<br />Today, after over 33 years, King Crimson is still very active and highly regarded, producing some of the most creative music in existence, just as they always have. Under the collective banner of King Crimson and always led by main man Robert Fripp, who is now in his seventieth decade. The man in black still commands the stage from his seat at the back of the stage. Grim faced he plays his guitar one minute with the violence of an axe, the next with the gentleness of a feather, but always with determined concentration.<br />There have been sixteen studio albums, every one reaching the upper regions of the charts all over the world, countless live albums, and compilations. Twenty one people have been in the recordings and live works ranks (not counting guest musicians). They even had a hit single with 'Catfood' back in 1970.<br />As the lineup has changed many have gone on to more fame and fortune. From the first lineup vocalist Greg Lake went on to form super group 'Emerson, Lake and Palmer'. Ian McDonald was an original member of `Foreigner', whilst Mike Giles went on to be one of the most respected drummers in the session world. Other groups came and went, but Robert Fripp just carried on in his own sweet way, oblivious to anything that does not concern him, demanding only perfection from his fellow musicians.  During its lifespan King Crimson has gone from this lineup, which had vocals with the basic trio of drums, bass, and guitar, with additional saxophone, flute, keyboards, mellotrone, synthesizer, and harmonium, to today's more basic lineup of vocals with two guitars, bass, and drums. That's quite unusual in itself, as bands usually add instruments rather than strip them away.<br />The album opens up with the brutal '21st Century Schizoid Man', which was actually this dogs first introduction to King Crimson, as this track was released on a compilation album by Island Records to showcase all the artists on their roster.  This was an album set called 'Nice Enough To Eat', containing twelve tracks from various bands on the label, all for the price of fourteen shillings and sixpence (about forty five Baht), just within range of this at the time 13-year old dog's pocket money.<br />After the loud entrance of the `Schizoid Man' (although it became a bit of an albatross round the old King Crimson neck, it was only dusted down and rehashed as an encore number by Robert Fripp last year), you are swept away by four more rock epics. The shortest called 'I Talk To The Wind' clocks in at just over six minutes, while 'Moonchild' - with all its beeps, boops, and whistles still intact - comes in at a massive 12 minutes. Hardly surprising then that Crimson was never really considered a singles band.<br />Musical standouts, if you had to pick some from this faultless album, would have to be (apart from all of Schizoid) Ian McDonald's flute playing in 'I Talk To The Wind', Greg Lake's singing in 'Epitaph', Ian McDonald's groundbreaking keyboard work in 'Moonchild', and Robert Fripp's simply staggering guitar work in final song 'The Court Of The Crimson King'. If you think that it is only studio trickery that lets them play this immaculate music, think again. The proof is the live album 'Epitaph' recorded on this lineup's tour of America at the Filmore East. The encore recording of the band rollicking through 'Mars' from Holzst's `Planet Suite' has to be heard to be believed.<br />After thirty odd years this album is still King Crimson's biggest selling album, a true all time classic. But do not worry, my friends, old Robert Fripp is still trying to top it. He nearly succeeded in his efforts in 2003 with 'The Power To Believe'. If you have never heard this album go out and buy it; if you have fond memories of it from before, I hope this little epistle will remind you to push `Purchase' when surfing through www.amazon.com.<br /><br />Mott the Dog<br />Re-Mastered by Ella Crewast year), you are swept away by four more rock epics.

B000089RVR|1.0|The answer is no. I like many different types of music, covering most genres. Dido's songs, however, are an exception. It amazes me that people purchase these records after hearing her music on the radio. To say it's wet is an understatement - her songs are so soft when listening to them I feel like someone's pushing a marshmallow in each one of my ears. The emotion is pathetic and not only pathetic... it's fake. Have you ever seen her interviewed? She's as common as nostrils. If you do purchase this album (which I didn't and never would, unless I knew I could make a profit from selling it) I strongly suggest you seek treatment for your emotional frailty - either that or get youself a new set of ears. There's no depth! Boring and wet.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride is a powerhouse.  You could run the Eastern Seaboard on her voice.  She takes even the most redundant songs (seen here in &quot;There You Are,&quot; &quot;Happy Girl,&quot; and &quot;Life #9&quot;), and makes them not only listenable, but flat-out enjoyable.  She's probably one of country's best singers (male or female) of all time.<br />Now there's this album.  Not all of it's high class stuff, of &quot;Independence Day&quot; caliber.  &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; tries, but after hearing it a hundred million times on the radio, it's not so moving (at least, not in a good way).  And &quot;Blessed&quot; is just so blissful, you gotta wonder about where that happiness is coming from.<br />But other tunes stand out in a good way.  &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; is a toe-tappin romp; &quot;Valentine,&quot; a duet with pianist Jim Brickman, is beautiful; &quot;A Broken Wing&quot; lets Martina's voice soar like no other song on here.  &quot;When Got Fearin' Women Get the Blues&quot; is not only an opportunity for Martina to get in a little snide kick or two at society, but it also showcases Leslie Satcher's superb songwriting skills.  &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; has some of the best instrument work done in a nineties country song, while &quot;Wild Angels&quot; just forces you--probably at gunpoint--to sing along.<br />&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; features, predictably, some of Martina's greatest hits (although, if I am to understand, &quot;Strangers&quot; was not a single; I still don't think it should've been included here, though, as it isn't too memorable).  My personal song preferences may not coincide with yours; you have to admit, however, that Martina McBride could sing a cookbook on a sweltering August day, and you'd still say it was the best show of your life.  Buy this album, if you want proof that there really IS talent on today's airwaves.
6305909326|4.0|By skimming the huge number of reviews, you'll quickly see that viewers tend to either really like or really hate this movie. There are apparently plenty of reasons to do either, and both.  But the truth is that this is an intensely layered story, and it assumes that members of the audience are either going to catch a lot of its subtleties or they are just going to see it as a flick on satanic intrigue that offers only mediocre thrills and chills.    As to the satanic veneer of this story, it should be taken more as a metaphor for how mainstream culture views gnostic, mystical, or magical spiritual paths, while also snickering at those who take satanism too literally. All the satanists in this movie are shallow buffoons, and it is the one guy who has no metaphysical pretensions (Dean Corso/Johnny Depp) who actually acquires the end that all the others were either seeking in vain or had despaired of ever finding.    Now let's dive beneath the surface to understand that it's a kind of dark \\"Don Quixote\\". The first half-hour of the movie is almost saturated with images and even references that establish the parallel. The major difference is that Corso isn't intentionally setting off on a noble quest, and instead thinks of himself as nothing more than an opportunistic and somewhat unethical businessman. His quest is inititally just for money, but in the process he demonstrates a passion for solving mysteries. There is no turning back for him once he realizes that he is on the trail of perhaps the biggest and most significant mystery of existence, even if it takes his life.    Much of the movie's hidden messages and meanings are revealed through obscure symbolic references.  Without a knowledge of Kabbalah, Tarot and alchemy, much of it will be quickly glossed over as superfluous occult imagery and \\"mumbo jumbo\\".  The first key is the whole idea of \\"nine gates\\", which can easily be thought of as a Kabbalistic allusion to an ascension of the Tree of Life. The ancient bookthat serves as the central prop of the story contains nine engravings, each of which has elements that are instantly recognizable to those already familiar with the imagery of Tarot and alchemy.    One layer that a number of other reviewers have found is the theme of the guardian angel. There is a great deal of Gnostic and Hermetic significance in the way this theme is played out between Corso and \\"the girl\\" with blond hair and green eyes. Perhaps it suffices to say that initially Corso only catches fleeting glimpses of her and is distrustful, but in time their relationship builds to one of greater cooperation, trust, and intimate compansionship. He comes to see her as his guide, protector, and lover.     The entire story could also be analyzed in terms of Jungian psychology.  Corso is of course the persona, the girl is his anima, and his shadow is played by a Black man with white hair, fitting in its reversal of Depp's white skin and black hair.    We could go into a lot more detail on each of the various layers already examined, but then what would be left for you to discover? ;-)    The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because I would have liked just a little more exploration and explanation of the story's depth for those who don't have an extensive background in esoteric, occult, and mystical studies.
0783114222|4.0|This HBO production, executive produced by Tom Hanks is not without it's flaws.  At times when it seems like the episodes should be searing, and dramatic, they instead wax sentimental.  The music is also rather unremarkable, with the exception of Brad Fiedel's fine contribution to the installment &quot;We Interrupt This Program.&quot;<br />For all of that, Hanks, and company manage to pull off the gargantuan feat of illustrating for us, the trials, and the victories that were Project Apollo.  Considering the amount of material that had to be covered, they do so with finesse, and unwavering aplomb.  No space historian would want to miss having this docudrama in their library.
B00005R87K|5.0|Of course this is a haunting film, certainly on everyone's short list of the greatest silent films in history.  But which version to buy?<br />The Alpha Video DVD, like all of their silent DVDs, has an appallingly poor video transfer.  You can watch it, but you wouldn't want to if you didn't have to.  It seems like all of Alpha's old films are too dark on the left, and too bright on the right.  When a character wanders to the left of the screen, he disappears, when he goes to the right, he is almost washed out.  Intertitles can only be read clearly from the middle to the right margin.  All the figures are grainy, like you need to adjust the sharpness, but can't.  I could only recommend a Alpha Video silent DVD if absolutely no other option is available.  I am a cheap guy who loves a good deal, but I think Amazon should seriously consider whether or not to even sell their shoddy products.<br />The Image Entertainment has by far the best looking cover and artwork, as I find they do for most of their products (compare their cover for The Thief of Baghdad with Kino's).  But the soundtrack options are quite poor on Nosferatu, and are nearly as distracting to a proper enjoyment of the film as Alpha Video's terrible image quality.<br />The current winner for Nosferatu is certainly the Kino version.  The image quality equals the Image Entertainment version, but the music is much better.  Its not a long shot, however, as the cover art is inferior to Image's.  And I still agree with the reviewer who wrote that all of these versions are running too fast.  IMDB lists the running time as 94 minutes,  but all of three of these versions clock in just over 80 minutes (10% too fast?).
0393324818|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: this book is *not* about baseball. Being a baseball fan I suppose it's easy for me to say this and having heard and read this work endlessly discussed by baseball fans and pundits over the last 18 months it would be simple to conclude the opposite.  But make no mistake: baseball is incidental here. Mr. Lewis' work concerns itself much more with metaphysics.<br />For the uninitiated, metaphysics is (generally speaking) the science of existence: what *is* vs. what *is not*. This book is a beautifully written example of how a few men use ideas based on what *is* to consistently triumph over those who ignore and belittle these ideas. Because this book illustrates this dynamic with a popular sport and some colorful personalities--thereby spreading the gospel to an even wider audience--I would give the book six stars if I could.<br />The chief colorful personality is baseball executive Billy Beane, who runs an obscure and relatively poor (money-wise, thus the ironic title) team known as the Oakland A's (Athletics). To the astonishment--and occasional frustration and envy--of everyone from everyday fans to the commissioner's office, the A's consistently win more games than teams with several *times* their player payroll, reaching the league playoffs several years in a row. Beane accomplishes this extraordinary feat by acquiring players whose qualities other teams ignore. Leaving aside some crushing detail, these qualities are relatively simple: they've been *proven*--rationally, logically, statistically--to help a baseball team win games.<br />So given Beane's track record why don't more teams follow his lead?  Lewis makes the answer plain: baseball doesn't function by reason. Teams routinely sign high school players to huge contracts--though history shows a frighteningly small chance of them ever reaching the majors. Scouts grow emotionally attached to prospects with \\"great stuff.\\" Managers call certain plays not because they will help the team win, but out of fear, to be seen as \\"doing something\\" and not be second-guessed later. And the list goes on. Beane's counterparts display a consistent and vapid ignorance of metaphysics. They don't care what *is*; they play by baseball's century-old mythical and emotional rules. Using a more rational approach, Beane--incidentally a pretty emotional guy who admits to Lewis that he constantly fights being \\"subjective\\"--runs circles around them.<br />Michael Lewis entertains us with this tale so well that he often has to remind us of his central premise. But remind he surely does; probably the best aspect of the book is his relentless emphasis on the creativity and courage shown by Beane and his cohorts. Rather than simply relate the results, Lewis takes us into the A's locker room, giving us player and management interviews under almost every conceivable condition.  He even listens in on a player and a few coaches questioning the team's system--thereby showing Beane's approach has hardly stifled debate. Even better, Lewis has done his homework: he shows how Beane relies heavily on an analysis method ungainly known as sabermetrics, initially developed by Bill James in the 1970s and later expanded by Voros McCracken and others.  This rational approach to baseball analysis is nearly as historically rich as it is radical.<br />The only quibble I have with Mr. Lewis is perhaps an insufficient emphasis on the sheer novelty of sabermetrics--especially compared to the downplayed methods employed by baseball's richer teams. In a new afterword added for the paperback edition, Lewis explains how he was genuinely shocked at the reaction to his book among the sport's oligarchy. His response is hilarious--dubbing the baseball establishment \\"The Women's Auxiliary Club\\"--but he might have known better. Showing how one team (now up to a few, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, new employer of Beane's ex-right hand man, Paul DePodesta) bucked decades of subjective irrationality to become a resounding success was bound to ruffle some feathers.<br />'Moneyball' was a pleasure to read on many levels and while I rejoiced in the triumph of its rational premise I'll admit to my own subjectivity.  I've been an Oakland A's fan for over thirty years and I can't help feeling positively giddy about my favorite team--poor, undervalued, and scrappy though they are--consistently beating the sport's arrogant royalty (including the clueless commissioner) at their own game. I'm eternally grateful to Mr. Beane for building the team and to Mr. Lewis for showing how it was done. A sincere 'bravo!' to both.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi was a Book Club pick, one that I had no opinion about, certainly not a book I wanted to purchase.  When my friend loaned me her copy, I was finished with it in 2 days.  I have since recommended it to everyone I know.<br />I loved this book.  I was drawn in immediately.  Pi is a wonderful, sweet, sympathetic character, wide-eyed and open to God in any persuasion.  He is a young man devoted to his family and his land.  I loved Mr. Martel's descriptions of India.  It's like being there.  <br />When I gave my husband a rough summary of the book, he remarked how boring it must be to read an account of a boy and a tiger, on a lifeboat in the Pacific for 227 days.  You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.   This book is never boring.   It's incredibly hard to put down.   My only complaint are the few extremely fanciful chapters involving a Frenchman and an island of sugary algae.  What was involving became incredulous and was never dealt with in a satisfactory way to me.
B00003CWRX|3.0|&quot;Issues&quot; liberals may be people of conscience with good intentions who give of their time, energy and money for a variety of causes to better society, usually by helping disadvantaged kids or the afflicted. Hooray for them. They cannot get too much applause for that. But they jumped on the anti-tobacco bandwagon, which is in my view real hypocrisy. First, Hollywood always displays macho men and femme fatale women smoking cigarettes and looking cool. Tobacco has been around for centuries. It is a legal product that people want. The fact that it is bad for you is simply common knowledge, yet trial lawyers, the biggest Democrat special interest group, file nefarious multi-million dollar class action lawsuits and tort claims against tobacco companies, as if some plaintiff who smoked for 50 years before getting lung cancer was forced by the company to do so.<BR>   During the Clinton years, the Democrats jumped on this issue like there was no tomorrow, actually making government ads against legal American tobacco corporations and the tobacco industry in a move that cannot be legal, civilly and maybe Constitutionally. These ads typically show a couple of (always) white tobacco execs plotting to poison kids, then laughing about it. Turn this ad around and direct it at anybody else and the hue and cry would be endless. These companies contribute enormous taxes and employ thousands. I myself was addicted to chewing tobacco (Copenhagen) for 16 years. I knew I had to quit, tried several times, but went back to it. I knew the dangers of snuff and that it was a disgusting habit. Nobody dragged my arm. I chose to do it, chose to quit, girded my will power and accomplished this task. Period. Just like George W. Bush when he quit drinking.<BR>Speaking of alcohol, this is worse than tobacco. It causes drunk driving deaths and has to be as unhealthy as smoking cigarettes, but it is not a target. On top of that, the real kicker is that if you go to Hollywood parties, or hangout at certain industry hot spots in Studio City, Universal City, Beverly Hills, or Santa Monica, you will find movie executives puffing on huge cigars like the one Bill Clinton asked Monica to use as a phallic. Such hypocrisy.<BR>Russell Crowe played a tobacco exec a few years ago opposite Al Pacino in &quot;The Insider&quot;, a film that never got anywhere. The crux of the film was that Brown &amp; Williamson, a tobacco road company with a long, venerable tradition in old Carolina, had...shock...hid the fact that cigarettes are bad for people. For decades.<BR>Really? Bad for people?<BR>Basically they went out and advertised their product like any other capitalist organization, in an effort to get people to buy it. People buy tobacco for the same reason I used to buy it. They know it is bad for them. They joke and call them &quot;cancer sticks.&quot; Oh, but kids are being duped, they say. There is no group of individuals on Earth more acutely aware of the danger of smoking than kids, to my knowledge. When my daughter was six or seven she was all over this issue. These same anti-tobacco crusaders are the same ones who will argue six ways from Sunday that marijuana should be legal, too. Let them stop abortion before stopping smoking.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM

B00008G9JO|2.0|Ian Anderson talks the talk--&quot;we hear at last on CD the sparkling detail of the original master tapes fresh from the vaults&quot; (from Anderson's liner notes)--but the product simply does not bear this out. It may be telling that Anderson says he learned from the original session engineer Robin Black &quot;everything I needed to know about engineering music in the studio.&quot; Frightening words.<br />There's no mastering credit here, and this has all the hallmarks of a &quot;mastered at home&quot; album, from the sucked-out top end, which sounds like it was de-hissed and then egregiously re-equalized to try and put some of that &quot;sparkle&quot; back in, to its flat, dimensionless bottom end and two-dimensional midrange. Acoustic instruments suffer the most, but right across the board the voices sound thin and sharp and the high-hat and cymbals are brash and hashy and instead of crisp, detailed, and rich in the harmonics the analog master ought to reveal. And the snare? What snare? It's been reduced to a hard punchy mass of high frequencies.<br />For one thing, this recording is not as good as earlier efforts were. But you'll still do *much* better with almost any LP pressing, or, if you have to have it on CD, pick up the original CD pressing, which you can now find quite cheap (Amazon's ASIN is B00000K44W). The original CD isn't great, but it puts you closer to the undoctored master tape than this one does. To its credit, the new mastering does not compress the master to death dynamically--that's the only respect in which it's better than certain other &quot;remastered&quot; CDs.<br />This release *does* include two bonus tracks, but they're far from highlights on an album that's already strong out of the gate. If you're after the kind of stellar, luscious sound quality found on the DCC gold disc version of *Aqualung* (ASIN B00000018N), don't bother with this pup.
B00003CXB7|5.0|At the same time, Robert Altman's \\"M*A\\"S*H\\" came out. It, too found an audience, and truth be told many who enjoyed \\"Patton\\" enjoyed \\"M*A*S*H\\". It was just plain funny, and the anti-military theme was subtle. Altman walked a brilliant tightrope between a pro-American and unpatriotic premise. There is no doubt that Altman intended it as an anti-Vietnam movie. It was written by former Communist Ring Lardner, Jr. Lardner had been Blacklisted, and this fact featured prominently in the politics of the film's aura. It was based on a sexy paperback novel about surgeons in Korea. The film was set in Korea, yet made every possible attempt to convey the image that it was actually Vietnam. Many of the movie's set pieces were deliberately Vietnamese in nature and costume, for that very purpose. To the extent that it was unpatriotic, it subtly described \\"regular Army\\" officers as unyielding, intolerant Christians, utterly blinded by stupid jingoism. The draftees, however, are funny and attractive as they drink and love their way through a bevy of good-looking nurses, all while saving lives in the style of comic Galahads. Altman showed genius as a filmmaker. The movie avoided real controversy because it was just so darn good. <BR>\\"M*A*S*H\\" spurred a television show that ran for years. In the 1970s it played for its time and audience. Re-runs, however, strain its credibility beyond Altman's original themes. Two doctors played the \\"bad guy.\\" The first was a complete buffoon. Frank Burns was prominently identified as a Republican. He is given zero good qualities. He is ugly, a bad doctor, a coward, a racist and all-around mean SOB who cheats on his wife with Major Margaret Hoolihan, who at least is given some character. She is half-Vixen, half-Fascist, naturally Republican, a patriotic American in the \\"worst way,\\" who worships the idols of war. Over the years the writers gave Margaret a little development. Very little. Burns was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a BostonBrahmin, naturally a Republican whose father \\"knows Truman. He doesn't like him, but he knows him.\\" Winchester, like Hoolihan, is allowed a touch of humanity when the liberal writers felt charitable, but generally was available for all possible bashing. Two hero-doctors anchor the show by showing their intelligence, medical skills and tolerance as direct contrasts to the war effort. The CIA is lampooned, and a military effort that in reality featured MacArthur's Inchon campaign, perhaps the most brilliant invasion in history, is also played as foolish. In the end, the TV show and the film avoid being really and actually unpatriotic because they do feature an emphasis on the basic goodness of the American spirit under stress, but you will not catch me tuned in to those old re-runs(...)
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This review is about this full screen single disc edition. I got it only yesterday. I love it. I've seen &quot;Shrek&quot; several times through rental and watching it on a VHS dubbed in Spanish in a Spanish class. Seeing as how that was even funny, I decided to watch in Spanish for myself through the DVD simply because it's good learning. About the film itself, viewing it for the first time makes the viewer astounded. Shrek is a not-all-that mean but loveable green ogre,<BR>the Donkey is adorable and the most comical character, Princess Fiona is absolutely gorgeous even when she becomes an ogre like Shrek, and Lord Farquaad is quite droll and persistent as the &quot;bad guy&quot; who seems to get a big head and wants to become king. Of course you might know about the &quot;I'm A Believer&quot; finale; that is the worth waiting for. The &quot;Shrek In The Swamp Karaoke Dance Party&quot; seems to pick up where the film left off originally. Thank goodness this little treat was included. It'll have you singing along and laughing! The voice talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow are perfect cast picks. Personally, nobody could've done Donkey like Eddie Murphy. Perfect! About the DVD; flawless! When the menu comes on and the fairy tale charcters are standing around and Donkey hops up and down saying &quot;Oh, pick me! Me, me, me!!&quot;, you could easily let that play forever. It's funny. There are more special features than those listed on the page. They include the filmmakers' commentary heard when you watch the movie, an HBO documentary, sketches of outtakes as the artist run through them, technical &quot;goofs&quot; (hilarious!), interviews with the characters (neat-o!) and more. The entire DVD is worth it. Wonderful music, neat scenery, and the humor of the loveable, memorable characters are such sumptious formulas. The scenery especially makes you want to be there. You'd also want to appreciate the characters and their feelings as if they were real. &quot;Shrek&quot; is such a fabulous movie for all ages. If it's not in your video library by now, what are you waiting for?
B00005LC4B|5.0|In &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, Marty Scorsese introduces a Fourth of July parade scene rife with sluggish Americana. The scene is slowed down, given morbid music, and depicts patriotic icons with bland expressions, going through the motions while an unenthusiastic crowd masks a black-and-white cancer. It also chooses to make Bob DeNiro a really dangerous Christian who quotes Scripture, speaks in tongues and preaches while he commits his acts of violence.

B0001GL3K4|1.0|I was looking forward to a film with such a great cast.  However, I was so distracted by the anti-American sentiment that I couldn't actually enjoy or believe the story. The director/writer clearly used the film to broadcast England's dislike of Americans.  Purposely, he begins the film by making reference to the American tragedy on September 11, claiming that love actually increased in England after the event and was apparent at London's Heathrow Airport.  It was as if he was claiming the event for himself. The director stereotypically characterizes American girls as ignorant, slutty cowgirls which is a stereotype that is old, tired and unbelievable.  The speech by the Prime Minister to the President clearly makes a statement of England's indignant and unsupportive view of America.  It was difficult to finish watching the film after this.  I certainly hope none of my dear friends in Hartfordshire and London would succumb to believing this narrow, ignorant view of Americans. Maybe it would have been a funnier story to me without the backdrop of the World Trade Center still clearly visable in our culture. The director cannot fully fathom or appreciate the horrific act of war committed on American soil in 2000.

Stone, like Coppola's &quot;Patton&quot;, tapped into a part of America he really wanted to discredit, but instead glorified. Based on the go-go stock markets of the Reagan '80s, it is loosely based on inside arbitrageurs and junk bond kings like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation. Fox must violate SEC laws and get inside information in order to do business with the &quot;big elephant&quot; Gekko. Gekko's star fades when a big deal-gone-bad has personal ramifications, and Fox turns a dime on him. The film is supposed to show that America is a greedy place that &quot;produces nothing&quot; in a &quot;zero sum game&quot; in which the rich only make money on the backs of the poor. Gekko's (Stone's) statements about economics are pure, unadulterated economic lies shown to be lies simply by...observing factual things. Where Stone may have had second thoughts was the reaction the film got. As the years went by, he and others were approached countless times by Young Republicans and Wall Street execs who told him the depiction of the exciting world of finance led them into that very career, which they thanked him for! Stone had hoped to create an egalitarian class. Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos. They in turn fueled the dot-com boom. It was not unlike the Democrats who hoped to expose Oliver North and the Republicans in the Iran-Contra &quot;scandal,&quot; only to discover that millions thought Ollie and his White House pals were doing God's work in fighting Communism.<BR>Res ipsa loquiter.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM
0380796090|2.0|I have to say I bought this book with great expectations - maybe this was the reason for my big disappointment. <BR>I've watched a TV series based on Keyes' book Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married and enjoyed it so much that I was sure her other books would be funny/interesting as well. But this book was boring. It took me about 3 months to finish it, and I started reading a different book while still reading it, because it was too boring for me. Only a director with a lot of imagination could turn it into a lovely TV series...
6305511055|4.0|Robert Redford made a clunker called \\"The Way We Were\\" with Barbra Streisand that desperately tried to explain, apologize for, justify, glorify and approve of being an American Communist during McCarthyism, but just plain fails. He made the 1973 classic \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" (1973), with Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunnaway. He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he \\"kidnaps\\" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC. The message is that The Company murders innocents, the U.S. is a warmongering empire, and tool of capitalist greed. It is Redford's answer to Guatemala, Iran and Chile, where the people killed were generally Communists. Redford would rather show the CIA killing Chinese- and African-Americans and other non-threats.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I've been waiting for Avril's second album in full-bloom anticipation. Her first album was of a unique sound and expressively individual.Consequently, I was expecting no less from her second album. Now after listening to it for a couple of weeks already, there are only three songs I really like : Forgotten being the best, Take me away the second, and How does it feel as the third. The others,well,they aren't bad,no,but they're not as good, in comparison to her songs in her previous album.<br />Honestly, I think her first album was less commercial and market-conscious. At least it didn't reflect in her songs. Those like 'My world' and 'things i'll never say' are more personal, true, more pleasant and uplifting. These are the songs that allow us to truly understand the artist. On Lavigne's newest attempt though, it was anger,anger,anger, and then sorrow, sorrow,sorrow.The songs nearly pained my heart.I presume it was a problem with proportion.You can't apparently stand an album which contains mostly of unhappy thoughts, can't you? Though the songs themself are fantastic. The perfectly mixed, perfectly executed, and perfectly produced sound is great, musically. Perhaps Lavigne might need to brush up her lyrical side. Initiating such negativity in her lyrics kind of put me off.But generally,if you liked her first,you'll most likely enjoy 'under my skin'.
6305313687|5.0|\\"American History X\\" may not have have accomplished what it set out to accomplish. The film centers on a white supremacist in the once-pleasant, now-crime stricken Los Angeles beach enclave of Venice. Edward Norton plays the racist, but the dialogue is sharp and intelligent. While there is no question that Norton is not in the right, and that his racial hatreds have taken him down a perilous personal path, he makes certain biting commentary about race and society that are entirely true and worth agreeing with. Whether the filmmakers wanted whites (and blacks) in the audience nodding in agreement with a guy they would like to show to be a monster is not known. He is charismatic, and intelligent enough to see the light after being stigmatized in prison. With the help of a black teacher, he turns his life around, but sees the damage he has caused to those around him. Heavy-handed political bias cannot be helped. Norton's sidekick is an utterly reprehensible, stupid white racist of the worst stereotype, who blathers about those who do not agree with him as \\"Democrats.\\"<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM

B000002VCE|5.0|The Outlaws were definitely a concert band, so this cd (or &quot;album&quot; for us old folks) is a hot item.<BR>In 1979, there were so many of us who wanted to travel 3 hours to see The Outlaws at Tanglewood (on the New York border of Mass.), that we chartered two greyhound busses, plus tons of carloads.  Though the weather was clear and warm, it had rained for days before.  So when more beer was in people than in the kegs, the fights broke out -- many fights even right in front of the stage!  The place turned into a mud bowl.  The band kept a playin.  I remember most of it.  <BR>It's amazing how merciful God is to let so many of us live through our 1970s foolishness.  Now maybe it's time to hear the music all over again with a clear mind, and blessed to be alive.
B000022TSH|5.0|The mid-1970s saw a spate of &quot;government conspiracy&quot; films, all with liberal themes that emanated from Watergate. None of them were about Kennedy stealing the 1960 election. Hmm.<BR>&quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) may be the best screenplay ever written. A historical look at 1930s Los Angeles, it actually condensed events from the 1900s with events that, uh, never happened but made for good drama. Written by L.A. native Robert Towne, directed by Roman Polanski, produced by Evans and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunnaway and famed director John Huston, it told the story of how Los Angeles became a metropolis. In Towne's version, Huston &quot;owns&quot; the L.A. Department of Water &amp; Power with a character based on actual L.A. City engineer William Mulholland. Mulholland had orchestrated the political deal which built the aqueduct that brought water from the Owens Valley into the L.A. Basin, allowing millions of Southern Californians to keep their lawns green to this day.<BR>The Mulholland character is &quot;sacrificed&quot; at the altar of greed, embodied by Huston, who secretly buys the San Fernando Valley, knowing that once the water deal is set, it will be incorporated into the city, making him a gazillionaire. It is rather cynical, although nobody suggests the L.A. &quot;city fathers&quot; were boy scouts. The same old theme is that capitalism and American political power are corrupt. To make sure the audience is convinced the corruption is beyond redemption, Huston is in the end found out be an insatiable, incestual monster. He plays the role so well it brings up minds-eye imagery of his real daughter, Angelica. The film is utterly beyond any criticism, regardless of political colorization. For decades, film students and screenwriters have studied it. It spawned an artistic quest to lace the screen with symbols, metaphors, backstory, and twists.<BR>&quot;Chinatown&quot; seems to be the apex of the American film period, the mid-1970s. The period from1960 to 1979 is unparalleled, but the backstory of the people who created these classics is a telling tale of why the genre leans to the Left. In the 1960s, film schools became popular. Four schools emerged, and have held their place as the place to learn the craft. In Los Angeles there was the USC School of Cinema-Television. Their first big alumnus was &quot;Star Wars&quot; director George Lucas. UCLA combined their film school with their drama program, so as to bring actors, writers, directors and producers together. Coppola went to UCLA along with a future rock star named Jim Morrison, who would form The Doors with another UCLA film alumnus, keyboardist Ray Manzarek.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM
B0001Z363W|1.0|I've been a big BLS Fan since Sonic Brew came out, which was an outstanding heavy metal album.  I bought Book of Shadows and Pride and Glory and loved both albums.  Zakk's vocals and guitar playing was both thoughtful and impressive.  This new album should not even be compared to Book of Shadows, though.  The lyrics are unprofound, the solos sound forced, and Zakk's vocals are not impressive.  He does not sound like the same vocalist on the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; album.  He sounds more like Ozzy. Anyways, I feel ripped off for spending 20 bucks on this, so just a warning.  Still a BLS fan for life
B00003CXAA|5.0|&quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) was a stylized masterpiece. Its auteur director, Coppola, laced it with the subtlest Leftist message that may have avoided the radar of even longtime fans who have seen the film 10 or more times. When interviewed by producer Robert Evans, Coppola said he wanted to make a movie that was a metaphor for capitalism in America. Evans told him what he could do with his metaphors, but Coppola was brilliant and an authentic Italian, a Hollywood rarity at that time. His ethnicity was considered necessary in the making of a Sicilian mob picture.<BR>In the classic Tahoe scene of &quot;Godfather II&quot;, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tells a Nevada Senator that he is just as corrupt as he is. In the first film Pacino tells Diane Keaton (Kay) that his father is no different than the President, in that they are both powerful men who have other men killed. The &quot;family&quot; is depicted as a corporate empire that must change with the times like a car company, only the stock in trade of the mob was the transition from prohibition booze to heroin (although Michael's goal is eventual &quot;legitimacy&quot;). What gives Coppola's work authentic panache, as opposed to so many heavy-handed liberal messages, is that in &quot;The Godfather(s)&quot;, his messages have the ring of truth.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM
B00006WL2B|2.0|Strong woodwind playing and vivid recording of the brass & percussions but a whimpy treble string sound.  I found the treble string playing to be clean and precise to the point of being completely and utterly monotonous and boring.  In the 1st and 2nd movements I expected to hear a silvery sheen of strings; instead I get detached playing that leaves me in the cold.  There is essentially no tension generated in the first two movements. The 3rd movement is too slow and ruins the conversation between the winds and the horns.    To me the 4th movement is the key to any recording of this symphony. The aggressive singing in the centerpiece 'Ode to Joy' chorus conjures up a soundscape of barking dogs. Even more so in the last chorus.  On the brighter side the soloists are good.    Why did this recording get the SACD treatment? Maybe because of the brass and percussions. For those who are in love with pristine digital reproduction of sound, go ahead and buy; for those who think music is more than the written note, forget about it.

B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Doggy Dogg took us on a journey in this record. He goes everywhere. All of the songs are great, and some don't get the props they deserve simply because they are next to the songs that are so revolutionary. Dr. Dre's beats and Snoop's style were a combination that has never been duplicated. The bar is set so high that Dre and Snoop haven't even been able to get back to this rare air. <br />A cocky young Snoop Dogg with a smooth style is your tour guide. This is the best Snoop. This is the realest Snoop. This is Snoop minus the bullsh *t He has no cornrows, no straightened hair, no funky experimental rap styles - only the Dogg. He does it so well. Not only are the songs some of the best ever, but Doggytyle's videos changed the rap music in a way that The Chronic's really didn't. <br />Back in '94, Snoop penetrated with &quot;Gin and Juice&quot;. The song and the video are some of the best ever. I half-heartedly looked for the CD with no success. Nonetheless the song had a powerful affect. The video, even more so. The chorus and the beat is smooth as hell, and Snoop puts it down flawlessly. While it's just a party song, it's a fu* king anthem. Additionally, the video is still hilarious to this day. Snoop comes off as the ultimate g. It's also the first appearance of Lil' Bow Wow. (I only wish it were the last). I'm not going to diagnose it for you. If you don't get it, I don't know what to tell you.<br />&quot;Murder was the Case&quot; is the song where Snoop goes a bit further. The song is one of the greatest ever. It's my favorite song on the CD, and I would argue that Snoop never made it past this level. The beat is so ominous and the lyrics are tight. The ominous voice from the beyond and Snoop's cocky youthful rapping make this song one for the ages.<br />The &quot;Who Am I (What's My Name)&quot; video and the song come together as a package deal with the album. Using technology in a rap video was a huge step. This is one of the first truly advanced rap video. It features Snoop turning into a dog, and him running from the 'Doggcatchers'. The flashy in your face beat along with Snoop's mocking taunts puts him on the map. The song's beat is one of Dre's best ever (I just LOVE it), lyrics are meaningful, and the rhyming is tight as hell. This is simply an amazingly definitive song. <br />Those are all of the absolutely mind blowing songs. Other songs that would be considered major efforts if they were on other albums are: &quot;Tha Shiznit&quot;, &quot;Ain't No Fun&quot;, &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot;, and &quot;Serial Killa&quot;. When I put this CD in I just sit back and let it play. It's an experience and it never gets old. This is my, rap_lunatic's, favorite album of all time. I look forward to so many tracks. There is never a time when I want to skip a few tracks ahead to get to the track I really want to hear.<br />I think this is stronger than Dr. Dre's &quot;The Chronic&quot;, overall. I prefer this album to most anything. While there are absolutely no social value in this album, you can't blame Snoop for it. Snoop is not a political rapper. If that's what you are looking for on a Snoop's record, you don't feel him.<br />Doggystyle is just possibly the greatest album ever. All I can do is stand back and applaud this record. I still hear it blaring out of my car to this day. <br />So, if I have to tell you why you sould buy this album, you must be on an isolated island eating through raw fishes.<br />P.S. Snoop's underrated but very tight album, &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, is also not to be forgotten.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|In 1970, two films juxtaposed each other. \\"Patton\\" was an unlikely winner of eight Oscars. The pacifist Scott for all practical purposes took his Buck Turgidson character and refined him into the real-life Patton. In interviews, Scott said he found his research of Patton revealed an unbalanced man, but on screen Scott nailed him as the vainglorious, brilliant, driven warmonger he was. Steiger was offered the role first but turned it down because it glorified war. Vietnam was absolutely at its apex. It was very surprising that Hollywood would make such a film at that time. But director Frankin Schaffner had served under Patton, and after making \\"The Planet of the Apes\\" had the clout to call his shots. The film did not get America behind the war, but it did cause Nixon to start bombing Cambodia because the Patton story convinced him to get tough. The screenwriter, oddly enough, was Francis Ford Coppola, who may have done himself a turn. Coppola was no war lover, and wrote \\"Patton\\" as a man obsessed with war (\\"God help me, I love it so\\"), deluded by visions of Napoleonic grandeur mixed with Episcopalian Christianity and karmic reincarnation. The intent may have been to show a psychotic military man, to de-mask his heroism, and this may have been what prompted Scott to play it. From page to screen there are virtually no changes, but if Coppola was trying to put down the military by showing Patton's human warts, the result was a brilliant work that now is one of, if not the most, conservative pictures ever made. Watching \\"Patton\\" stirs wonderful pride in two countries (Great Britain is prominent in the film) that were tough enough to stand up to the Nazis when the rest of the world cowered in victimhood. Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is Patton's perfect foil, as is the Bernard Law Montgomery character. The film saved Coppola, who was about to be fired as \\"The Godfather\\" director. When he won the Oscar for \\"Patton\\", it gave him too much clout to get the axe.   <br />(...)
1400032717|3.0|The most interesting aspect of this novel is that it is told from the perspective of Christopher, a 15-year-old autistic boy.  You will be intrigued by how his life is ruled by logic and order, but saddened by the lack of emotion and human contact he allows.<br />The story begins when he discovers the body of a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork.  He cradles Wellington and is mistaken for the killer by the dog's owner.  After a harrowing night in jail, his social worker suggests he write his experiences in a journal, which becomes this book.  At times heart-rending (discovering letters from his mother) and at times tedious (an especially detailed trip to London) this book does give readers an insight into the mind of an autistic person they have perhaps not had before.  Christopher is exceptionally gifted in math and some of the math puzzles will be a bit overwhelming yet interesting.<br />The mystery of the dog's death is solved long before the end of the book, allowing the last quarter of the novel to be rather flat and anti-climatic.  However, if you're looking for something with a different slant and completely out-of-the-ordinary, this may be enjoyable for you.
B000002H6C|5.0|After the death of bassist Cliff Burton, Metallica releases an album that retains their classic thrash-headbanger style but with longer and more technical songs full of message and emotion that ties &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; as their best album. The songs are darker, heavier, longer, and the lyrics focus more on dying than killing. I've heard it said that the procuction is bad and that the drums sound bad, but I totally disagree. In fact, these are the best-sounding drum tracks I've ever heard. Also, LONG SONGS ARE AWESOME!<BR>The album starts with the coolest introduction to any CD I've ever heard. &quot;Blackened&quot; is a fast song with environmentally-oriented lyrics (I think). The next song, &quot;And Justice for All,&quot; targets corruption in justice. It's slower and kind of keeps on jamming forever. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; crunches out as one of Metallica's best. &quot;ONE&quot; IS THE GREATEST SONG EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Exploring the feelings of a wounded soldier who longs for death, this song is so perfectly written it cannot be described in words. It has the best melodic riff and the song changes into a double-bass drum thrash at about 4:30, and then the guitar joins. If you don't know what I'm talking about buy the CD and listen to it at the highest volume possible. The video for this song is by far the most powerful music video ever-if you don't get chills, check your pulse! They should have left a few minutes of silence after &quot;One&quot; so you can catch you're breath and kind of reflect back on the song in awe, but unfortunately they didn't. The next three songs are all as good as any (the introduction to &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; is pretty tight). &quot;To Live is to Die&quot; would be an incredible instumental by itself, but it isn't an instrumental because there are eight lines of spoken lyrics near the end. What makes this song even better is that the lyrics were written by the late Cliff Burton (he helped write the song itself too). The solos and drum fills inserted all over the place also help this song one of their best. The final song &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; has a cool title which has nothing to do with the lyrics, but it is the best song after &quot;One.&quot; If you're not chanting &quot;DEAR MOTHER, DEAR FATHER!&quot; by the end of the song, you're deaf. Fast, tight, and angry, it's impossible not to be impressed. What a great CD.
B0000696I1|4.0|The first Turtles movie was great in the fact that it took on the tone of the comics rather than the TV show (more grim, more adult). The second, after much backlash from parents, went in the total opposite direction and turned it into camp. This installment is a nice ballance of the two.<br />Granted, the costumes are not up to par with the first two, and the plot is not the most original (nor feasible), but they take a back seat to the jokes. The first two TMNT movies focused more on plot and action with an occassional joke to keep things light. Writer/director Stuart Gillard's time travel story, while not the strongest, opens the door to many jokes and gags, which is what makes this movie stand out among the others. It's a nice change of pace, in my opinion.<br />Kudos to Elias Koteas in this film (he deserves to be the first in the credits). His 15th century counterpart isn't the best, but he makes up for it when Casey Jones is forced to &quot;babysit&quot; four ancient Japanese warriors in modern-day New York (favorite bit is still the hockey scene).<br />For those who were more interested in plot, this is not the best place to start in the series, but if you enjoy a good line of jokes and gags, I'd definitely recommend this one!

B000002MX7|5.0|Reviewer: kprovo@hotmail.com<br />EPIPHANY - The Best Of Chaka Khan, Volume One (Warner/Reprise) Review by Kirk Douglas Provo<br /><br />Just check out Chaka Khan's stellar performance of the standard \\"My Funny Valentine\\" on the \\"Waiting To Exhale\\" film soundtrack. It rings through loud and clear. Khan has claimed her rightful place at the front of the line for Queen of Soul divas in waiting! With an immensely impressive body of work to support her, Khan is perhaps the most qualified contender for Aretha Franklin's long-held moniker. (The only other serious potentials who come to mind would be vocal powerhouses such as Gladys Knight, Patti Labelle, Stephanie Mills, and a few others.)<br /><br />Listening to these recordings, mostly from the 70s and 80s, it strikes one that Chaka Khan's contribution to Rhythm & Blues/Soul, as well as pop music at-large is as immense as her astonishing vocal rage. The wonderful jazz meets funk flow of \\"The Melody Still Lingers (Night in Tunisia)\\", and the tailor-made \\"What'cha Gonna Do For Me\\" are just two testaments of the unique vocal prowess she has been treating record buyers to since the early 70s.<br /><br />\\"Never Miss The Water\\", the first single release of five new cuts, re-teams Chaka with producer David Gamson (Scritti Politti). It is a funky romp, recalling their \\"Love You All My Lifetime\\", from the Grammy-winning \\"The Woman I Am\\". Musician Me'Shell Ndegeocello's strategically placed raps lend some street authenticity to the tune, and maestro Frankie Knuckles' smokin' club re-mix should go over quite well with the under-thirty-five dance crowd.<br /><br />Elsewhere on this collection we find, \\"Through The Fire\\", from '84's \\"I Feel For You\\". This beautiful ballad is a stunning reminder of just how sweet 'n girlish Ms Chaka can be when she puts her mind to it. (Remember \\"Sweet Thing\\"?!) On the other hand, we find Rufus' awarding-winning swan song \\"Ain't Nobody\\". This song, with its space-bound keyboard turns, hook-laden lyrics, and straight from the street vocal, is just as hip today as it was when initially released back in '83. The countless remakes of this tune of late don't hold a candle to the original funk masterpiece.<br /><br />Of the new cuts, \\"Every Little Thing\\", is a playful little ditty that keeps sounding better and better with repeated playing. It jams; it swings. Some of Chaka's best scat-singing is featured here - while the bass playing is to die for! \\"Something Deep\\", is a much-welcomed, heavily bass-driven, sassy low-down groove thing from the team behind some of Brandy's most memorable early dance jams. Khan really spreads her wings here, encompassing, as only she can, straight from the heart soul diva lovelorn wailing, then sliding effortlessly upward into razor sharp jazz-scale phrasing of a class that seems to get better with each new recording.<br /><br />\\"Everywhere\\", the surprising but logical re-make of a Fleetwood Mac song, is done here with a warm Caribbean treatment. Diehard rock fans may flinch at the new direction this song has taken. Yet, all-in-all, it is business as usual for Ms Chaka, as she flaunts her bountiful interpretive skills on the tune.<br /><br />The compilation says it all: Chaka Khan is The Voice.

D12 World is thoroughly entertaining and will satisfy anyone who likes commercial pop-hop, to anyone who likes ghetto, hardcore underground rap, the album has something for everyone. The one critism of the album, is that D12 are not doing themselves any justice as being recognized as plausable MC's because there is barely a track on the album that is not headlined by the white superstar. I like a good Eminem album as much as the next rap fan, so this should not be mistaken as a bad album, but as a masterpiece that will be pushed aside in the commercial world (which is exactly what the rap scene needs right now), and once embarrasing songs such as My Band are pushed aside, there is the basis of a hell of an album with amazing mixtape cuts of tunes such as Keep Talking, and a personal favourite '40oz'. Definatly worth buying, if you do not agree please email me and tell me why, i am very intrested!!! happy buying!
630027120X|5.0|Not for the squeamish, &quot;The Mission&quot; explores the duality of Europe's presence in South America -- the salvation brought by the Jesuits and the condemnation brought by &quot;civilization.&quot;<br />Roland Joffe, the director, pulls few punches.  The film opens with the dictation of a letter to the Pope by a prominent religious figure, Altamirano, who has just undergone the events that will transpire in the film, and we learn that these events are not pleasant:  &quot;the local savages are now free to be enslaved by his Holiness . . .&quot;<br />These events &quot;were brought about&quot; by the horrifying martyrdom of a Jesuit priest, who had journeyed to the &quot;uncivilized&quot; lands of the Indians above the falls (and what falls!).  The local Indians, apparently rejecting his Christian teachings, crucify him and toss him into a river . . . a river that soon flows to the falls, and the descending cross is one of the most haunting images you will ever see on film.<br />In response, another Jesuit priest, Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) heads above the falls, and uses his music (score by Ennio Morricone of &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; fame) to win the trust of the locals.  Soon he is preaching the Word of God among them.  <br />Unfortunately, the slaver/mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) is hunting the Indians for slavers.  He ominously warns Gabriel about the futility of building a mission among the Indians, and he seizes several.<br />On his return to &quot;civilization&quot; below the falls (the dusty town stands in marked contrast to the lush greenery above the falls), Rodrigo learns that his beloved Carlotta does not love Rodrigo, but has fallen for Rodrigo's younger brother, Felipe (Aiden Quinn).  Rodrigo, far from a reasonable sort, kills his brother shortly thereafter in a trumped-up quarrel.  Distraught, Rodrigo eventually agrees to do his penance above the falls with Gabriel and his fellow Jesuits (including a young Liam Neeson).<br />Following a tortuous climb above the falls with his lodestone of arms and armor, Rodrigo finds salvation and seeks to become a Jesuit.  The mission above the falls takes shape, and all seems to be right with the world.<br />Of course, this is not to be.  The slavers need their slaves, and they exert enormous pressure against the church -- the Catholic Church is not as strong as it once was, and the militant Jesuits are becoming a nuisance by sapping the supply of slaves (apparently it is too inconvenient to enslave Christians, so the slavers argue that the Indians are monkeys without souls -- nice).  <br />Altamirano agrees to visit both the local mission (a gorgeous, mammoth structure complete with farm and Indian priests) as well as the more primitive mission above the falls . . . which is even more impressive despite (and perhaps because of) it's remoteness.  <br />But, politics being politics, the missions are doomed and the Indians will be enslaved.  Rodrigo and the younger priests decide to fight, leading to one of the more disturbing battles you will see on-screen.  It's not &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in its horrors, but it is emotionally wrenching to see the Jesuits and the Indians fight such in such a foregone conclusion.<br />Even more gut-wrenching is Gabriel, who chooses a non-violent response.  In a pitch-perfect performance, Irons emobodies the Jesuit commitment to the simple words of Christ . . . not that it does him or the Indians much good in this world.  <br />A haunting spectacle and far from a feel-good movie, &quot;The Mission&quot; deserves full marks for its depiction of a common conflict (Europe versus the New World) in a different setting.  A top-notch cast and a wonderfully shot film make this one for the video library.

B000055Y0X|5.0|In 1964 the first of the \\"bomb\\" movies came out. Kubrick further earned his place in the pantheon of film greats with his all-time classic \\"black comedy,\\" \\"Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Love the Bomb\\". Explaining how a movie that ends in the world obliterated by nuclear (actually hydrogen) holocaust is a comedy leads me to suggest watching it. Only then you will know. The iconoclastic Kubrick made an iconoclastic film starring the extraordinary Peter Sellers in three roles. He plays the President, a lily-livered liberal in the mold of Adlai Stevenson. He plays Mandrake, a British Royal Air Force officer, and he plays Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist based on Werner von Braun, although some of have suggested that they see in the madman Henry Kissinger. Kissinger was not well known when the script by Terry Southern (who later wrote \\"Easy Rider\\" but died destitute) was turned in.<BR>The premise is that an Air Force General, Jack Ripper (most of the characters are given descriptive names), played by the Communist bohemian and Sausalito weed smoker Sterling Hayden, goes mad. He is convinced that because water is fluoridated the Communists have conspired to deprive red-blooded Americans of their \\"essence,\\" their \\"vital bodily fluids\\"...their semen. For this obviously stupid (believed only by right wing wackos) reason, Ripper overrides Air Force protocol and orders his nuclear attack wing to bomb Russia back to the stone age. Of course this is meant to show that the military is filled with lunatic fringe elements with their hands on the button. In an interesting bit of terminology, the words Soviet Union are never uttered, only Russia, presumably to \\"humanize\\" all those agrarian reformers. Thought I hadn't caught that, huh? Anyway, real-life pacifist George C. Scott, playing General Buck Turgidson, discovers Ripper's plan. He is another Curt LeMay take-off, bombastic and filled to the brim with sexual testosterone that seemingly can only be released by his bikini-clad girl Friday, or by bombing the Russkies to smithereens.<BR>A plan is hatched to inform the Communists how to shoot down the wing, in order to prevent nuclear holocaust. Turgidson thinks that is a terrible idea and that as long as the boys are on their way, they should drop their payload on the bastards. The Russian Ambassador, however, puts a crimp in those plans by informing the President that this would set off a Doomsday Machine, guaranteed to destroy all life on Earth. Turgidson laments the fact that there is a \\"gap\\" between the Soviet possession of such a device, which the Americans lack, no doubt due to liberal malfeasance. Forced by the Doomsday scenario to avoid holocaust, the Americans and Russians work together to shoot down all the U.S. planes, save one. Meanwhile, Ripper kills himself and his aide de camp, Mandrake/Sellers, discovers the recall code. But the last plane, piloted by good ol' boy Slim Pickens, is as Turgidson/Scott describes, wily enough to evade radar, while damage from a heat-seeking missile has rendered it unable to receive the recall. They make their run. Pickens makes his cowboy speech about going \\"toe to toe, nuclear combat with the Russkies\\" and emphasizes the crew, including a young James Earl Jones, is due commendations \\"regardless of race, color or creed.\\" With Pickens personally releasing and riding his bomb into a Valhallic destiny, the deed is done, leaving the Doomsday shroud to envelop the Earth. All is not lost, however, because Dr. Strangelove/Sellers, messianically saluting the President as \\"mein Fuhrer,\\" describes how mineshafts can be converted into underground government societies for the next 100 years. The boys all smile when Strangelove says that in order to further the human race through procreation, many more attractive women than men would have to be recruited to do \\"prodigious sexual work.\\" Unfortunately, monogamy would have to be a thing of the past. The end.<BR>\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" may be one of the 10 greatest movie ever made, but its comic message was clear: The military is not to be trusted, nuclear weapons serve no good purpose, and the Soviets are likely to be victims of our aggression. Like a number of movies, however, its political message is stilted. Reagan said it was his favorite(...)
B0001N5IHG|5.0|I truly loved this film.<br />I am an avid movie buff and love foriegn films, the majesty of coloration and settings in films like the Kill Bill series, odd momentum of films and settings like in Lost in Translation, and the directing in Mystic River. Recently, despite these films, I have felt curiously jaded as a movie-goer until I saw In America.<br />This film captures your hopes and your heart. It is in the tradition of grand old movies and one of the best I have seen in years.<br />The other reviews have told you the story of the immigrant family facing a loss retreating to America to salve their wounds/guilts and instill hope in the future. The acting is phenomenal. Samantha Morton as the mother is exposed emotions. The Bolger sisters as sisters in the story are remarkable. Their acting so facile and believable. Mateo (Housou) is a true presence. Bravo to director Sheridan( My Left Foot, In The Name OF The Father) for another winner.<br />I understand the dedication at the end of the filmm was for Sheridan's own 10yearold brother Frankie which makes the film even more poignant.Maybe it will be maudlin for some, but it was my cup of tea.<br />A must see film. Highly recommended.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I concur with many of the other reviewers who mention that this score is a departure from the others -- though still very much in the John Williams' genre of music. In fact, listening to some of the tracks (&quot;Buckbeak's Flight&quot; for example), I was reminded more of the soaring themes of &quot;Star Wars&quot; than of either of the two previous HP movies.<br />I own all three scores, and have no complaints against the first two, as a matter of fact. Lovely music. The score for &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; however, breaks new ground from the first two, and the result is a masterful and varied collection of music -- from the familiar &quot;Lumos&quot; to &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (featured in advance advertisements) to the haunting strains of &quot;A Window to the Past&quot; and so on, through the rest of the score, Williams has upped the ante to create a truly remarkable musical journey. This third volume makes me eager to see what kind of music Williams could create someday for the complex and emotionally-laden &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West has been lingering in the depth and darkness of the ROC production team for a few years now, but it seems that the minute he took to the mic, we now cannot get rid of him, as he is popping up everywhere doing tunes with such acts as the Dilated Peoples and even Brand. Slow Jamz was intresting, but my GOD he should not have released that as it does not truely show the amazing potential that this album has. It is well constructed and produced, and it makes a difference that a rapper who has his foot firmly in the door of commercial hip-hop, has decided to make an album that brings some different issues to the game other than just rapping about money, bitches, gunz and death. I actually find it hard to critisise this album, all I would say is that it is a lighter album that you would not be able to compare to say an Straight Outta Compton by NWA. If you do not buy this album you are missing out, because Kanye West has not released his best tracks off of the album trust me!!! BUY IT NOW, DONT JUST SIT THERE, GO NOW!!!!
B000003TSP|5.0|I turn on the CD player and I am wearing a slinky black dress, my mouth rouged with blood red lipstick, a trail of cigarette smoke wafts in the stale air, and I'm shadowed by a sinister figure down a seedy alleyway. I'm cornered in some dive but it's just some swaying, slobbering lush wanting to know where Albert is. As if I knew...as if I cared. My secrets are too tortuous to endure much longer.<br />Beth Gibbons voice is creeping emotion sputtering out those secrets in the twisted cabaret in my head. The mood is dark, the atmosphere thick with betrayal and yearning, strangers with glassy eyes litter the joint while their own desperate desires join the din of bereavement. All flesh is cold to the touch and no one speaks above a raspy whisper. Whiskey is the drink of choice and everyone is melting into their chairs.<br />While trying to escape the drunk, I stumble over someone who falls out of his chair. Another liquor-soaked refugee from planet Earth, I think, but no - it turns out to be a mannequin. Ahhh, that explains so much - those lifeless eyes, the cold skin, yet it still whispers, it whispers to me: &quot;where is Albert?&quot;
0767830555|5.0|In 1976, Martin Scorsese directed &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, starring Robert DeNiro. Calling this a &quot;conservative&quot; movie is a stretch, but it is a prescient look at New York attitudes that preceded the age of Giuliani. Paul Schrader wrote it. His story is a hoot in and of itself. He and his brother were raised in a strict Calvinist Pennsylvania family, emphasizing the strictest tenets of Scripture and absolutism. The Calvinists are big on pre-ordained destiny. Released from this environment, he came to Hollywood and tried everything. Naturally, he was a mess; a drug addict, an alcoholic and a heterosexual so confused he tried homosexuality just...to try it. Given the assignment to write a screenplay, he was holed up in a downtown L.A. hotel for weeks, then months. He had little social contact except occasional taxi rides to restaurants in and around L.A.'s skid row. He began to see the world from inside the taxi, and came up with a character and a plot revolving around the concept.<BR>DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in &quot;Death Wish&quot; (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.<BR>The message of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is that peace comes from strength. It was a popular theme in a number of flicks. Hollywood seemed to fail to grasp some important realities about its marketplace. Time after time, movies that veered away from &quot;touchy feely&quot; liberalism and gave teeth to conservative characters (Eastwood's &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, Bronson, DeNiro, and others) madeboffo box office, yet the industry has never come to grips with itself. They return time after time to premises that insult conservative audiences, and wonder why the lines get shorter.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM

1594200106|5.0|You've probably already read Publishers Weekly's take on this book:<br />\\"Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n strives for a literary tone, and no scene goes by without its complement of florid, cute and inexact similes and metaphors (snow is \\"God's dandruff\\"; servants obey orders with \\"the efficiency and submissiveness of a body of well-trained insects\\"). Yet the colorful cast of characters, the gothic turns and the straining for effect only give the book the feel of para-literature or the Hollywood version of a great 19th-century novel.\\"<br /><br />Don't believe it. For reasons that I cannot comprehend, the Publishers Weekly's reviewer obviously did not understand this magnificent book.<br /><br />It is a book of tragic love, utter despair, madness, redemption, loyalty, and revenge. It is a book about the very nature of the human spirit. It is a book about our love -bordering on obsession - for books (which you will find yourself unable to put down).<br /><br />It is one of the few books of recent years that I would dare to compare to the masterful eloquence of Steinbeck's 'East of Eden.' I cannot think of a single book written in the 2000's that even comes close to this book. For someone to call it 'para-literature' makes me wonder if they understand literature at all.
B000009DUY|4.0|John Williams' score for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; has less of an ability to stand on its own than any other collaboration of the celebrated composer and director Steven Spielberg.  This is primarily because the Spielberg movie, with its devastating opening scenes of the assault on Omaha Beach on D-Day (sixty years ago today), does not use musical underscoring for the action sequence: as the picture changes from the eyes of the old James Patrick Ryan &quot;Revisiting Normandy&quot; to the young Captain Miller about to hit the beach, the music ends and does not pick up again until Miller's eyes take in the view of &quot;Omaha Beach.&quot;  This is totally appropriate for making the film effective because it is the memorable images and the sounds of battle that are compelling, not the music.  However, this means that as a listening experience the soundtrack for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is somewhat devoid of the emotional resonance that makes the film unforgettable.  The music is not really associated with what we remember from the film and which we experience every time we watch it (I know I am not the only one who spent today watching the film).<br />The exception that proves the rule, of course, is the opening track, &quot;Hymn to the Fallen,&quot; which is the musical highpoint of the album and gets reprised at the end of the album.  Between those two tracks this is a somber musical score and it will take you a while to be able to recognize the individual tracks between the two hymns as being distinct pieces of music.  Again, this is not to say that this approach is inappropriate, just that the music enhances the images and without the images the music is lacking. The sense of peacefulness of the music represents the quiet before the storm, providing temporary respite from the horrors of war.  This was the score that Spielberg requested for his film, and the best way to enjoy the music is to listen to it in the context of the film where it performs its function.  Except for the opening and closing credits there is no moment where the music really commands our attention more than the images.  That is not usually the case with Williams' music (I still have not listened to any other orchestral score as much as I did the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; double-album), which is why this one has such a unique place in his distinguished career.  It makes perfect sense to me that this score was nominated for an Academy Award but did not earn Williams his sixth Oscar.ts function.

B00004RF83|5.0|One year after \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", John Frankenheimer was back at it with \\"Seven Days in May\\", screenwritten by \\"Twi-Light Zone\\" creator Rod Serling. Serling's \\"Zone's\\" were a masterpiece of semi-liberal social conscience. Frankenheimer seized on another 1950s novel based on the real events of 1934, in which Republican industrialists recruited Marine hero Smedley Butler to orchestrate a coup d'etat against FDR. The novel and Frankenheimer's film fictionalize the event. It was, again, one of the best movies ever made, but completely liberal. Frankly, I have to ask why in 1963 the decision was made to examine a political conspiracy from 1934 when the worst political crime in U.S. history, the stealing of the 1960 election by Kennedy over Nixon, had occurred just three years prior. The answer to that question, my friend, is blowin' in the wind.<BR>After JFK's assassination, \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" was pulled because it hit too close to home, but in June, 1968 RFK was staying at Frankenheimer's Malibu home the night of the California Primary. He was tired and wanted to stay there. The enthusiasm of his victory that night convinced him to make the long drive on a twisting, turning Pacific Coast Highway, up the Santa Monica Freeway to downtown Los Angeles, where Sirhan Sirhan was waiting for him with a gun at the Ambassador Hotel. <BR>Kirk Douglas is the Butler character In \\"Seven Days In May\\", an upright Marine whose politics are explained early by a fellow officer who says to him, \\"I though you'd be an ACLU lawyer by now, protecting the great unwashed.\\" Douglas describes this officer as the kind who would be better suited for an army that goosesteps. Good dialogue, though. Burt Lancaster is the right wing Air Force General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is modeled after Curtis LeMay, although the Lancaster swagger and charisma make him far more appealing. Frederick March is President Jordan Lyman, an ardent liberal who has just signed a peace treaty with the Soviets that presumably dismantles much of our nuclear arsenal. Lancaster does not trust the Soviet will honor their end of the bargain. Therefore he is convinced they will strike and America will be lost. A U.S. Senator is in on Lancaster's plot to take over the Presidency. They make him from California just to make sure he is affiliated with Dick Nixon. Nice touch. The public is solidly against the President, fueled by a right wing radio host in a prescient script device. In the end, the \\"protector of the great unwashed,\\" Douglas, foils the plot and March's speech to the D.C. press corps is met by a standing ovation. Oh, those evil militarists and Republicans.<br />(...)

Some kids had brought the cat over in a rubber boat and put it on me. I liked the cat, although he dug his claws into my belly because he was frightened. I became a bit frightened of the cat but I didn't want to push him off. If I tried, I expect he may have turned vicious. But I wanted his company too. So in my own small way I have lived the life of Pi, and had some very deep thoughts too as I floated along. It's no news that this is a rewarding book. I loved it.

Along the way his mother's ghost walks with him to keep him company. It's a weird and moving true story and great motivation for me to keep on my new diet

B0000CDL93|5.0|What really has set the Left back is not just the failure of this film medium to accomplish their goals, but also the lack of faith accorded college professors, school textbooks, and mainstream news. So who is left to tell the real story?<BR>Weeeeeell, my friends, we are out there. We have been waiting in the wings all these years, gathering the facts in silence, not showing our hand, waiting for judgment day. The day of reckoning is upon us. Let freedom reign.<BR>As for \\"JFK\\", it is a complicated piece of fiction that would require some real research to effectively discredit all of its lies. What it did in the theatre was have one asking, \\"Jeez, did that really happen?\\" or \\"My God, is this true?\\" or \\"Holy cow, I can't believe this could be.\\" It is major sensory overload. Innocent civilians who knew things are killed. Deception and murder are used to cover up the sordid deeds. The film requires several viewings, and frankly time, probably years, to unravel it. What happens is that various reviews, reports from historical figures and historians are read and pieced together. After a while the discovery is made that a particular \\"witness\\" never existed, a certain \\"police officer\\" is a figment of Stone's imagination, smoke in the trees, conversations, special ops guys with the inside scoop (particular \\"Major X\\" played by Canadian Donald Sutherland) are invented out of whole cloth. A proposition is one thing, but \\"JFK\\" is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", a \\"riddle wrapped inside an enigma, tied by a puzzle\\" or whatever it is Joe Pesci says. It is exhausting. <BR>So who killed JFK? Oh, maaaaan! Stone's answer, as best I can tell, was Lyndon Johnson, in league with the joint chiefs, because Kennedy wanted out of Vietnam and they wanted in (because American industry needed the war?), working with right wing Birchers, who were part of rogue elements of the CIA (?), who were a \\"track,\\" whatever that is, that could not be stopped because it was an inexorable connection starting in Guatemala (\\"good\\"), Iran (\\"good\\"), and Bay of Pigs (\\"not so good\\"), that had become dominated by Cuban exile \\"Republicans,\\" working in league with the Soviets (KGB?), who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald, who learned to shoot in the Marines, who lived and married in Russia then came back, who promoted Marxism but was funded by Birchers (?), who was a patsy for the Dallas Mafia, who had Oswald-lookalikes say incriminating things, who worked with JFK, who worked with La Casa Nostra (who turned on him?), who were tied to Naval Intelligence (?), who operated out of a corner in New Orleans in which the Feds, the NIS and somebody else all had offices, who were tied to right wing homosexual businessmen, defrocked priests, gay prostitutes and guys with tempers like Ed Asner, whose activities were known by corrupt New Orleans lawyers and politicians, who were in league with the New Orleans International Trade Mart or something like that, protected by Dallas strip club owners, who hatched a plan that involved Cubans training in the Florida swamps or Latin America by gay militia commandos, who bought a bad Italian rifle with a bolt action release via mail instead of purchasing a better weapon through the black market or a store, who gave it to Oswald, who may or may not have fired at JFK but could not possibly have hit his mark from the Texas Book Depository, who with Secret Service agents working to kill the President had assassins disguised as police officers and bums in the bushes, a car wreck lot and a grassy knoll, and created a triangulated cross-fire that killed the President then got away.<BR>Now, friends and neighbors, after all of that, at no time does Mr. Stone suggest that the assassination was the work of a fellow he later visited and said was a great man, named Fidel Castro, who is the most likely suspect. <BR>Res ipsa loquiter.<BR>Castro and the mob? Maybe. The confusion of Stone's plot twists is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect that with which the real killers want. Stone's film vastly hurts the attempt to learn the truth. He raises plenty of legitimate questions, mainly regarding the so-called \\"magic bullet,\\" and he operates on at least one fairly solid foundation, which is that the Zapruder film seems to show more than one shooter. Saying Oswald was not a lone gunman is a premise I can give credence to, but beyond that God knows.<BR>One thing is puzzling, and that is that in all the years since nobody has \\"stepped forward.\\" Every so often somebody shows up on Larry King Live and says his father, usually a \\"Dallas cop,\\" was the shooter, but these stories always have the crackpot feel to them. I want a deathbed confession from a Cuban, one of Sam Giancana's guys, something solid. When all the smoke clears, you still have a Communist sympathizer, Oswald, killing a President who just humiliated Kruschev over the Bay of Pigs, is a threat to Castro and is building up troops to fight Commies in Vietnam. It is plausible he had help and they were on the Grassy Knoll, they got away and Jack Ruby killed Oswald to shut him up. Maybe a little too convenient. The Warren Commission report came out only one year later, not enough time to sort out everything. The Church hearings were too open to get the real stuff beyond salacious sex. Secret CIA/FBI investigations might have been the only real answer, and who knows, maybe they were conducted, and maybe the gullible public cannot handle the truth. Who knows? Not Oliver Stone.<br />(...)

B0001MDP36|5.0|I read these reviews before I saw the movie,  and one reviewer mentioned that the movie was haunting.   That is true,  I find myself still thinking about it after several days.   Several reviewers mentioned the difficulty in believing the love story because Ada and Inman \\"barely knew each other.\\"   That might be because the characters themselves both mention how few words have passed between them.   We have no trouble believing in the \\"love\\"  of other movie couples who have one scene and jump into bed,  why shouldn't we believe Ada and Inman?   People have clung to less to get them through trials.   Anyway,  this movie had so much more to say-about the friendship between women,  the relationships of fathers and daughters,  the kindness of strangers.   And perhaps most important,  the pain and destruction caused by war,  no matter how necessary that war may be.    And the music was incredible,  I bought the soundtrack and keep listening to it.    Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B0000029DD|2.0|Sorry folks. The guy is dead I know. I read all the reviews thinking this was going to be one to add to the CD collection.. and I was truly disappointed. I appreciate great ballads, screaming,wailing, depths of despair stuff.. but, this guy's voice did nothing for me....It was irritating in fact.<BR>The tracks.. one after another are moaning, groaning, wailing, monotone, relentlessly boring and morose.<br />Sorry but this was a waste of money built on a great amount of hype, and rather than feel a grand catharsis after listening to it, I almost opened a vein myself.
B0000085N4|4.0|A five is nearly impossable to get .So with that in mind I have to say that any unbiased smart listener will know this cd to be what it is , And that happens to be ROCK!!!!!!!!!!! In your face!!!!!!a great listen!!!!!Who can ask for anything more ?To nick &amp; pick an album like this is just plain stupid .Put it in and hit play .Thats all there is to it and have a good time .
B00008ADPF|4.0|i want to start off by saying this is a great nickelback cd. if youre more a fan of silver side up than the state or curb, i cant garuntee (i know i spelled that wrong) you'll like this CD. the long road is weird..its rock played by a bunch of hicks. you can, to some extent, hear their redneckness coming through in some songs. its not anywhere close to country, you can just kinda tell they grew up in a small hick town like mine. this cd isnt as fast and heavy as silver side up. there are a few exceptions, like the songs i never listen to, like number 6 and..9 i think? anyway, check this cd out. its very emotional, something nickelback hasn't delivered in the past. i gave it 4 stars because even though there is a bunch of awesome songs on here it just lacks the intensity nickelback had.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The biggest name in pop culture Britney Spears releases her 4th effort to an aging fan base of teens.  Now with the competition of christina's dirty pop and avril's so called &quot;real music,&quot; pop's former princess needs to reclaim her crown.  After her &quot;growth&quot; album, the appropriately titled &quot;britney,&quot; departed from standard teen pop, Britney is ready to continue her growth and does so brilliantly on &quot;IN THE ZONE.&quot;  As the controversial entertainer set forth to record a monumental LP, something that she so desperately needed since she has not garnered a #1 single in nearly 3 years, she decided to get in her &quot;zone&quot; and write a record that's as true to the commercial &quot;Britney&quot; that we all know.  The album shines with profound, and for a first, distinct works such as &quot;Breathe On Me,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Touch Of My Hand,&quot; and &quot;Everytime.&quot;  &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; brings britney to a dreamland of synths and heavy breathing.  &quot;Toxic&quot; captures the classic britney and all of her intoxicatingly catchy verses.  Britney can still churn out a red hot single.  Nobody can resist the bareness and sincerity of &quot;Everytime.&quot;  Red Zone's productions are a definite mixture of pop's booming choruses with hip hop's dancy beats:  &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; and &quot;The Hook Up&quot; demonstrate this theme.  This is a club record.  &quot;Early Mornin',&quot; &quot;Showdown,&quot; &quot;Outrageous,&quot; and &quot;(I Got That) BOOM BOOM&quot; serve as club ready anthems that don't need a remix in order to be played.  The album even includes bizzare yet incredibly interesting tracks such as &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Brave New Girl.&quot;  Britney reaches for electro-pop programming for editing on &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and she drums up the power-ballad strength on &quot;Shadow.&quot;  Britney's &quot;IN THE ZONE&quot; is full of excitement and the best production thatcan be heard on a commercially released disc.  Put on your diesels and pop this into the player cuz it's going to be a long hard night of hardcore dancing.
6305841861|4.0|Well, we've got a comedy here my friends. Lotsa people like to throw around the term horror-comedy when describing this, but I don't think that's quite appropriate.  While it uses a horror setting, it virtually never seems to be trying to work on a horror movie level, so I'm not really comfortable using the term horror in the description.  On the other hand, calling it a spoof or parody doesn't really decribe it either, as too much of the humor seems to be unrelated to the horror setting.  But, all that aside this is a pretty funny movie, and a rather 'cool' movie as well, for lack of a better term.<br />Unlike everyone else in the world, this is not my favorite of the series.  In fact, it's my least favorite.  However, it still stands up quite well, and is definitely worth your time.  Despite the fact that it shares the setting of the original, this one has far more in common with Army of Darkness then the original, as it focuses on fast-moving and ridiculous comedic setups.  It's largely a means for Campbell to do physical comedy and ham it up amusingly, and showcase lots of intentionally dated, but still cool special effects.  Sadly, Ash isn't quite as amusing as he'd become in the next film.  He's not nearly as angry/surly as he'd become, which I always thought was more important to humor of the film than the physical comedy. But he's still pretty damn amusing.  Raimi's visual flair is as good here as ever.  The 'force' shots are much improved from the already superb ones in the original.  The famed scene of it endlessly chasing Ash around the cabin is especially noteworthy.  He also does some nice stuff with the sky as well, particuarly a great shot of Ash in front of a ridiculously enormous sun.<br />The film starts off with a simplified recap of the first film, concluding with Ash's burial of Linda and his being assaulted by 'the force'. The briefly possessed Ash is exorcised by the rising sun, but the bridge is still out, and there is no other apparent means of escape, so he is forced to wait it out in the cabin.  The first half of the movie, before the other characters arrive, is the better part.  Most of the stuff involving Linda is quite amusing, particularly her stop-motion animated dancing out in the moonlight.  The best part, however, has to be the scene where Linda's decapitated head attacks Ash.  It's simple, mindless physical comedy, but his frantically running around trying to smash it off is just great. Probably the best scene in the film. I'm also especially found of how the head just spontaneously falls on him from above, without any explanation of how it could've gotten in the cabin, or up above his head, for that matter.  The stuff with his evil and later severed hand is quite amusing too.  The fact that it is inexplicably talking all the time is the real kicker to the whole set-up.  The laughing house scene is quite cool as well, particuarly the disturbing deer head.  It's not really funny or scary or exciting, but it's very, very weird, and works quite well.<br />The arrival of the other characters hurts the film a bit, partially because I find some of them to be rather annoying.(Most notably Jake, and, to a lesser extent, his girlfried, Bobbie Joe.)  Of course, I think he's meant to be a bit irritating, but that doesn't really make him much more enjoyable to watch.  Fortunately, he's largely redeemed by an extremely amusing death scene.<br />Despite not being quite as consistent or energetic as the first half, the second half still delivers.  The fight with Evil Ed is a nice sendup of Shelley's death from the first film, and the final confrontation with Henrietta is delightful.(Film makers really need to use stop-motion animation more often these days)  The fight with the rotten apple head isn't quite as good of a climax as I'd have liked, but it's still pretty decent, and does a good job of raising the stakes in terms of sheer ridiculousness.(particularly when Ash plunges his chainsaw into the creatures eye, and it sprays out hideous blue blood)<br />A few closing notes.  First of all, as others have mentioned, although the DVD comes with both widescreen and fullscreen, the widescreen version just appears to have the top and bottom matted. (i.e. you see less in the widescreen version, not more) Since the Anchor Bay release comes with both it's not much of a concern, but it's good to know.  Secondly, this movie has a reputation for being very gory, which is not exactly deserved.  It's just too ridiculous to even be desribed as being gory in the conventional sense, as it generally uses ultra fake blood that isn't even red,(with either incredibly thick or incredibly water texture) and silly, incredibly plastery limbs.(That, and there just isn't all that much gore in it anyway) To say this is very gory is like saying that old Warner Brothers cartoons are very violent. You're technically correct, but you probably give completely the wrong impression to someone who's never seen the piece your talking about.<br />Anyways, this is good. Check it out.creatures eye, and it sprays out hideous blue blood)<br />A few closing notes.

B00006V9A0|4.0|I would probably recommend this album to a newcomer to the band, but there isn't anything new that isn't on the old albums, except for the first track, which may make it worth it to buy the whole album. But they're one of my favorite bands, so for anyone who wants to learn about them and get into them, I would reccomend this. But I give it four stars because I think four albums is too few to compile a &quot;best-of&quot; album from, so like I said, not much new here. Plus the album doesn't really flow, which isn't unusual for most &quot;best-of&quot; albums. Nirvana is still king of '90s rock, and yes, track 1 is maybe the only reason for already-fans to get this C.D. Overall good choices to throw on the greatest hits album, they're all worth a listen, except for maybe track 4, (I didn't like it, skip over that one).
B000002LND|1.0|This totally sucks!! Full of corny songs from the 80s yukkk!!!
0446677450|1.0|This book was a total waste of time and money! It contains nothing but the author's boastful stories and is very light on any useful content. What a scam! <br />I should have read some of the negative reviews before buying this book, and I could have saved some money.<br />Do yourself a favor, if you are looking for financial education, look somewhere else.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I'll start by saying that Nightwish gets better by every album they release, they develope the albums, not staying the same, but still being Nightwish. Tuomas has again done a great job composing with a little help from Emppu and Marco.<br />This one (Once) is more soundtrack'ish than the previous ones (they're accoimpaned by a full orchestra on most songs), still not forgetting the fast heavy-metal songs which in this album are for example Dark Chest Of Wonders, Wish I Had An Angel (great duet with Tarja and Marco), both have really heavy, even murderous guitar riffs By Emppu.<br />I'll review some of my favourites on the album:<br />3. Nemo - Released as a single, usual Nightwish style music, more popular-sounding than the others, still really good, great chorus *****<br />5. Creek Mary's Blood - A long, epic song. I especially love the Native-American Indian chanting and Tarja's singing is supreme *****<br />9. Ghost Love Score - Also a long, epic song, AMAZING chorus which sends chills in my spine. Great slower parts in the middle of the song. *****<br />10. Kuolema tekee taiteilijan - A song with only orchestra, piano and solo cello with Tarja singing in Finnish. The lyrics are sad, almost prayer-like, but really beautiful. I'll translate the lyrics for you into English, so you can understand the meaning (there may be errors, sorry for that)<BR>Original Finnish lyrics by Tuomas Holopainen.<br />\\"A Death Makes An Artist<br />Only once my dreams<BR>I got to see<BR>Didn't feel the smallness<BR>under the stars<BR>Once I got bars on my cradle<BR>As a prisoner I write a letter from there<br />My Creator, let me come to you<BR>as what my child thinks I am<br />In you the beauty of the world<BR>From which death made me an artist<br />My Creator, let me come to you<BR>as what my child thinks I am<br />Created my own heaven here<BR>Let me get away\\"<br />The meaning of the word suffered a little in the translation. Hope you get at least the idea.<br />All in all a reallygreat album. I really recommend you should buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I never did like Quetin's movies, but with all the hype about this movie, I felt it was worth checking out... why I dont know?<br />What is so great about this movie? Tell me?<BR>All I could see, was a kung-fu movie, but instead of it beeing a plot about ancheint ninjas in Japan who have an enemy who disgraced the secret dojo, they have a woman who's seeking revenge for all the people who hurt her.<br />For starters, what the heck is with the Mask Of Zorro henchmen? There about as threatning to look at as Lucy Lu's 10 minute long motionless stares into outerspace. Then there's the blood shed, it's not gross, it's just plain bad, everytime someone looses a limb, there blood comes praying out like jet streams from a shower...which is most likly the way the effect was done. And poorly I might ad.<br />The plot dragged on and on and on, and did not thrill me or get me interested in the plot at all. Uma Thurman's best role? I dont think so. She's done better then this over hyped garbage. It's an old 70's style kung-fu movie with a budget. But at least those old Kung Fu movies where watchable. This Kill Bill however went no where. So the vengfull Uma Thurmans charactor wakes up from a coma, magicly recovers her walking ability in a few hours after beeing in a coma for a few years, and seeks the people who put her in the coma. Travels accros the world, kills a couple of hundred henchmen, and then we wait for the next movie. Well, I wont be bothering with the next one. <br />If the movie had cut out the long boring staredown constests that went for too long, they probably couldve shortend the movie enough to fit whatever they have filmed for Kill Bill 2 into this movie. But instead, everytime they go for a sword, they take a stare at it, then stare at each other, useless dialog, a quick combat , then splatter..... all through the movie. How ever did such brillinace get thought of? Lucy Lu's charactor was annoying, it played like an old video game where you have to kill a thousand bad guys before you get to the boss.<br />I'm all for woman becoming action stars. And I hope more woman become just as big a name as any previous mega hit action star. But this movie is not the step to follow. It's riduclues martial arts antics of jumping around and making those stupid &quot;whoosh&quot; sounds when the flip or move there weapen did not fit well into this movie. It could have been alot better, yet, probably 30 minutes of the movie is a staring contest which is the most annoying thing of the film. Lucy Lu was the worst of them. For someone who was supposed to be such a great leader of the &quot;Mask Of Zorro In Suits Gang&quot; she sure didnt act threatning in any way. I wouldnt say its the worst of the martial arts movies around, but it's by far anywhere near as great as all this hype has been about it. <br />So the &quot;people to kill&quot; list continues in Part 2. You wont find me veiwing it.

0920668372|1.0|We received this as a gift when our daughter was born and tried reading it to her when she was about a year and a half.  Both my husband and I were deeply disturbed by the words and images in this book.  Even though our daughter seemed to like it, we felt uncomfortable reading it to her and couldn't figure out why she liked it.  The only thing I can think of is that she was interested in the son's misbehaving in the early part of the book -- kids are fascinated by other kids who are \\"naughty\\".  Any way you look at it, this is an inappropriate book for young kids (in my opinion, it's inappropriate for everyone!).  At best, it is showing them a child acting naughty, potentially giving them ideas they hadn't thought of (e.g. messing up the toilet paper roll) and at worst, it is forcing them to think about the death of a parent and face emotions that they shouldn't have to deal with until absolutely necessary.  I'm glad I got (and got rid of) this book before she was able to ask the kind of questions she would now, because I would hate having to answer anything about this book.
0316168815|2.0|I really wanted to like 'The Lovely Bones', but I honestly don't know how this book managed to get the rave reviews that it did. I was very disappointed. <br />The concept is interesting, but hardly groundbreaking: Murdered girl's spirit watches as her family slowly comes to terms with her death, and people hunt for her killer.  Hmm - haven't we seen this plot before, in the film 'Ghost'?  I also seem to remember reading Narinder Dhami's 'Angel Face' some years back, which dealt with a similar theme.  (I thoroughly recommend 'Angel Face', by the way.  It's for young adults, but it's an excellent read.)  <br />Nevertheless, the opening chapters of 'The Lovely Bones' are promising.  The initial portrayal of a family trying to assimilate the news that their daughter has been killed is very believable, as are the efforts on the part of the murderer to disguise his tracks.  The actions of the police officers are also believably frustrating, as they come painstakingly close to solving the mystery - only to be misled once again.  I also liked the depiction of the small town which formed the backdrop for the 'earth' part of the story. Sebold really demonstrated the way in which an entire town can be rocked by the death of one child. The reports of the murders of the ten-year-old Soham school-girls were still fresh in my mind as I read this book, adding extra poignancy to the text.<br />So, when does it go wrong?  Well, for starters, I was never really satisfied by the depiction of heaven.  Unfortunately, heaven is a theological construct and to place it in a less-religious context raises awkward questions.  Sebold never explains what heaven is for, whom it is for, why the characters do what they do, etc.  If this was a comedic novel (as Angel Face is), none of this would matter.  However, because the book is serious, the questions really should be addressed properly.  Instead, the reader is delivered the childish notion of heaven as being a place which is accessible to almost everyone; a place where wishes come true.  It's all right, but the concept itself could have been explored more.<BR>Perhaps more importantly, about halfway through the book the narrative begins to lose its way.  The characters become less and less credible.  The plot becomes far-fetched to the point of being ridiculous.  A great writer can invite their reader to take great leaps of imagination and can make it seem as though nothing is out of the ordinary.  Sebold can do this to a certain extent, but details let the writing down.<BR>Would a father, for example, truly encourage his second daughter to break into the house of the man whom he suspects of murdering his first daughter?  Would it not go against every paternal instinct in his body?  And although I understand that 90% of parents split up after the murder of a child, I cannot believe that Susie's mother would have an affair with the detective assigned to the case.  Rather, I cannot believe that the detective would have an affair with Susie's mother.  Even small-town officers, I am sure, are trained to cope with the emotions of a distraught parent.  It's just not credible.  Similarly, the character of Ruth also rings hollow.  Another reviewer on here notes that she turns into a Sixth-Sense-style, 'I-See-Dead-People' kind of figure, and I have to say that I agree with this analysis.  A lot of work needs to be taken to flesh out that sort of character, and I'm not sure that enough was.<BR>My biggest single problem with the plot, however, was Susie's leap into Ruth's body.  First of all, it was a borrowing from numerous other stories including 'Ghost', and even the 'Point Horror' novels. Secondly, there was nothing in the narrative which led up to the event.  In other words it was a poorly-executed cliché, seemingly contrived in order to allow Susie to have sex.  Which leads me to:  Susie's Sex Scene. Now, let's just think about this for a minute.<BR>Susie died in the 1970s at the age of 14.  It is now eight years later, but ultimately she hasn't aged.  *She is still 14*.  By the time she dies she has shared a single kiss with Ray, and her one sexual encounter has been the brutal rape she endured before her murder.  This is her first experience back in a human body, and it's also her first time in a woman's body, rather than the girl's body she is used to. Nor is she is expecting the transition from the spiritual to the physical world.  On top of all this, the body she enters isn't even her own.  Meanwhile, Ray, hanging out with his friend Ruth, suddenly discovers that Ruth is actually his long-dead friend Susie, who's popped down from heaven to say hello.  They say hello...and then immediately proceed to have sex, which is perfect and mindblowing; complete with all the adult emotions of a perfectly-balanced, well-adjusted couple.  At no point does Ray ask Susie about her murderer, and Susie makes no attempt to reveal the truth about her death.  It is here that the novel loses its last shred of credibility.<br />The final chapter redeems the book to a certain extent.  Haunting passages draw the novel to a close, and Sebold ties up the loose ends quite nicely.  Mr. Harvey is also taken care of, at last!<br />It's such a shame that this novel falls apart so badly in the middle (for this reader, at least).  The opening chapters had me hooked, but unfortunately they could not sustain the entire book.  Disappointing.
B00005JKC3|1.0|From the moment I first saw the trailer to this movie, i thought the CGI looked extremly bad. And as soon as I saw it, i knew there would be a long drawn out boring interveiw with someone at I.L.M bragging about how there latest computer desighn was the best they have ever done: and I was right! Not more then 2 days later there was a thing on TV about the making of this movie, and sure enough, theres the guy raving on about how realistic this charactor of the Hulk looks. How wrong they are.<br />If it wasnt for my old man buying it ex-rental after I told him 100 times not to buy it, he bought it, and I suffered through watching it, just incase I was wrong and it was an ok movie? But my hunch was right, i should not have watched it... If your a fan, or remember the original TV series of the Hulk, then dont expect this movie to have anything to do with that, it's like how they took Godzilla and changed that in the latest one they made. The Hulk stars Aussie EX-comedian Eric Bana, who at one point was one of the funniest people on Australian T.V with his performances in stand up and sketch comedy which are the way I wish to remember him. This movie, however, was completly boring, had plots just going no-where, the most boring dialog, and as i said, the worst CGI effects of the year!<br />Dont just take my word for it, just look at how many second hand copys there are currently selling right now? and how much for?!<br />I wouldnt recomend you even watch this movie for free. It's not even worth renting! And above all, I cant beleive there going to make a seaqull to this god awfull, terrible movie!<br />If there going to make all the old super hero's make a come back? then why not go for somthign with them all in it? like that cartoon Justice League? Make that a movie, that would be somthing intresting, instead, here is your classic exsample of Hollyweed completly dry out of ideas, and recycling old ideas, old shows, old movies, and putting CGI to them expecting it to bea hit.... well, it didnt work for me, they need to learn to stop worrying so much about CGI effects and think about how to give a storyline a great plot.<br />I'd tell you about the extra features, and if there's any egg's...but I hated the movie so much, i didnt even bother to stick the second disc in to look at it!
0385336810|5.0|this was an amazing book.. it really showed the hardships of just starting out in your career. i could identify with every word as Emma dispaired over her family situations and how her cousin always manipulated her parents... and i could identify with how she was shy at telling people how she really felt... this was an amazing story with a great plot that people, especially young women can indentify with. I liked it better than Kinsella's shopaholic series and i hope she makes a sequel to this book.
0156027321|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; was a rewarding read on several levels.  The basic plotlines are that a young boy in India who calls himself Pi (in order to save himself schoolyard ridicule stemming from his real name) grows up as an inquisitive and intelligent son of a zookeeper.  The first part of the book describes his and his family's life in India, and alot of information about the animal kingdom is dispensed, as well.  To be honest, I remember being a little bored with the beginning of the book, but it serves a purpose to set up the rest of the story, which is phenomenal.<br />The family decides to move to Canada, and on the way their ship goes down, leaving Pi and assorted zoo animals as the only survivors.  The bulk of the story is about Pi's adventures in a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker.<br />I would like to highlight three areas in which this book excelled and won me over:<br />*Adventure: The story of Pi and the tiger reads like something from Hemingway or London (which is good, to me.)  The sea becomes a character in the story, and Pi utilizes his savvy and intellect to overcome several obstacles, not the least of which is cohabiting a 36' boat with a carnivorous beast.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout.<br />*Humorous narrative:  I laughed out loud several times at the humorous way Pi interacted with tiger, and even at his thoughts to himself.  Martel has a gift for subtlety that he wields deftly to great effect.<br />*Thought provocation:  On so many levels, I found the gears in my head working overtime.  Martel touches on religious and philosophical issues that form a central theme throughout the book.  And the ending galvanizes one of the issues at the base of this central theme -- the struggle between faith and logic.<br />I will not give too much away about the ending, but it is in the same vein as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; in the movie world, in that I want to re-read the book to pick up any clues to the surprise at the end.<br />I am giving the story my highest ranking, despite my boredom at the beginning, because the book was highly entertaining, was very thought provoking, and it provided a good hour of discussion between my wife and me.o the surprise at the end.<br />I am giving the story my highest ranking, despite my boredom at the beginning, because the book was highly entertaining, was very thought provoking, and it provided a good hour of discussion between my wife and me.
B000002B7O|5.0|Released in 1981, Diary of a Madman is Ozzy Osbourne's second album, and the last to feature guitarist Randy Rhoads.<br />After the Blizzard of Ozz tour, Ozzy and Co. were soon about to embark on another tour. Desperate to have new material for the tour, Ozzy hurriedly recorded and released Diary of a Madman. Despite the band being rushed, Diary of a Madman proved to be one of Ozzy's strongest efforts to date, and in my opinion, his shining moment. Featuring the ever-maturing Neo-Classical Electric Guitar playing from Randy Rhoads, his far-reaching talent for mind-bending solos and addictive riffs has made him a legend to this day, and he is rivalled only by Kirk Hammett(Of Metallica) for the Grand Title of the Best Guitarist Ever. Since this was Rhoads' last album(He was on Blizzard of Ozz and Quiet Riot's First 2 CDs also), it is hard to bear just thinking about what he and Ozzy could have done in the rest of the 80's, but sadly that was not to be because of his death in a freak plane crash. Also, the production is much better on Diary of a Madman, as Ozzy's vocals, Tommy Aldridge's Drumming, and Rudy Sarzo's bass all seem much more pronounced than on Blizzard of Ozz. After Diary of a Madman was released, it immediately capatilized on the success of Blizzard of Ozz and shot up the charts to Number 16 on the sucess of the singles &quot;Flying High Again&quot;, &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, and &quot;You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll&quot;. Even today, you still hear &quot;Flying High Again&quot; and &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; frequently, while &quot;You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll&quot; has kind of faded out of the airwaves. And for all those people out there who need to get their daily dose of ballads, you certainly get the needed doseage with such songs as &quot;You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll&quot;,&quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. But don't fret hard rockers! You still get classics such as &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, &quot;Flying High Again&quot;,&quot;Believer&quot;, and many more to deafen your ears. Weighing in at a mere 8 tracks, Diary of a Madman still manages to clock in at 43 Minutes and 26 seconds, which is a lot more than you can say for a 12-Track Blink 182 or Good Charlotte album! Below you will find Track-By-Track reviews for each song to see just why this album is so great.<br />Song Reviews:<br />Over The Mountain-10/10:Like any first song on an album should do, &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; gets and holds your attention. With Aldridge's drumming at the beginning and Rhoad's killer riff to start it off, Ozzy immediately takes over and steals the show with his great vocals. The Solo from Rhoads' is one of the best you will ever hear!<br />Flying High Again-10213910293012/10: BEST OZZY SONG EVER! Ozzy's ode to a certain type of drug manages to never get old even though I've listened to it millions of times!Rhoads'superb riff, Ozzy's sarcastic vocals, and Sarzo's insanely addictive bass beat all combine to create the best song on the album. Randy Rhoad's solo is once again tremendously good, and you'll be singing right along with Ozzy to the chorus!<br />You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll-10/10: Ozzy is really the only guy who can even serve up a decent ballad, and once again he doesn't fail to please! Rhoads' soulful acoustic guitar playing and Ozzy's heartfelt vocals might even bring tears to the soft-hearted eyes.One of the best chorus' on this album and probably the best lyrics. Rhoads' solo is insane!<br />Believer-10/10: This song starts off with Sarzo's catchy bass beat that I can't get out of my head! Rhoads' kind of spooky guitar playing and Ozzy's brooding vocals make this song sound very creepy! Perfect to play when all the Trick-or-Treaters come to your door! As usual, a good chorus and a masterful solo by Rhoads!<br />Little Dolls-9/10: Almost a ballad in a way, this song is a hard rocker with very soulful vocals by Ozzy and a very soul-searching chorus. Aldridge's drumming is especially good on this song, as is Sarzo's bass beat. Gets downgraded because Rhoads' solo is short and fairly unremarkable, but his riff is as addictive as ever!<br />Tonight-10/10: Once again Ozzy serves up a great ballad, where the guitar and drums take a backseat to the keyboard and synthesizer, and most importantly Ozzy's melodramatic vocals that seem to match the song perfectly. Don't fret though! There is still a solo from Rhoads, and it happens to be great!<br />S.A.T.O-10/10: Aldridge and Rhoads truly are playing top-notch together on this song, and 2 minutes in they team up to do a 1-Minute instrumental that combines Rhoads' insane solo with Aldridge's precise drumming. After that Ozzy comes in and delivers some great vocals.<br />Diary of a Madman-10/10: The 3rd ballad on Diary of a Madman, it starts off loud with Rhoads' unforgiving riff but soon switches to Ozzy's brooding vocals that are truly a standout on this album.Rhoads' acoustic playing is great here, along with his solo which is certainly no slouch either. The chorus is great, and the song sounds very creepy!<br />Overall, this album is a masterpiece and is probably Ozzy's strongest. As you can see, every song on the album has great vocals and great solos from Ozzy and Randy Rhoads that truly make this Ozzy's best album. This album will satisfy any tastes in rock music, and if you're a fan of Metal, Classic Rock, or even Modern Rock you'll enjoy this album to the fullest.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! RECOMMENDED FOR ANYBODY WHO LIKES ROCK MUSIC IN GENERAL! ALONG WITH BLIZZARD OF OZZ, DIARY OF A MADMAN SHOULD BE THE ALBUM TO GET IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET INTO OZZY OR RANDY RHOADS! REMEMBER TO GET THIS VERSION INSTEAD OF THE SORRY &quot;EXTRA TRACKS&quot; VERSION! Thanks for reading!ood on this song, as is Sarzo's bass beat.

B0000VAFO0|1.0|I bought the movie thinking it was going to be a great action movie, YEP, it isn't. The wolfmen are ridiculous, it's always night in the movie, it's claustophobic. And the plot is involved. The script it's very weak and Kate Beckinsale doesn't look like a vampire, in fact, the vampires are the less resemblance to a vampire.
0765310015|4.0|Erikson gives you no time to get your bearings in this book -- it starts with a short prologue of background and then the main story starts up in the middle of a decades-long conflict played out both in the mortal realm and among the various deities (Ascendants).      The plot is deceptively simple: on the continent of Genabackis, Darujhistan, the last \\"Free City,\\" is targeted for conquest by Malazan Empress Laseen.  But Laseen wants not only conquest but to purge the Empire of her enemies -- the warriors who fought for and were loyal to the Emperor she deposed in a coup less than a decade ago.  Thus, the conquests serve a dual purpose: expansion of the Empire, and trap for her perceived enemies.  Against the Empire are enemies ancient and new -- the mysterious otherworldly Tiste Andii, the various tribal warriors on the continent who seek to retain their independence, and certain deities who bear their own grudges against the Malazan Empress.  Meanwhile, to defeat her enemies, the Empress will risk unleashing massive destructive sorceries that have lain dormant for thousands of years.    This series logs the lives of Erikson's characters, and those affected by them, during the various wars of the Malazan Empire -- thus the \\"Book of the Fallen\\" concept that is essentially a Black Company-like annals of the people who die, are killed, are raised to divinity or lowered to squalor in the wars of Malaz.  Nonetheless, there is a looming evil that threatens all of Erikson's world -- barely hinted at in this volume but explained later.    Erikson is straightforward in his writing, not much excess wordiness, because there is a lot of story he is trying to tell, and he is working on a broader, more far-reaching story than any author of the serial fantasy genre, Jordan and Martin included.  His previous life as an archaeologist seeps from the pages as Erikson hints at societies and populations of creatures both human and humanoid that existed eons before the time of his story.  Nonetheless, despite the huge storyline, Erikson peoples his story with memorable characters who are noble, ignoble, interesting, heroic, normal, superhero-esque, tragic and demonic, and often a mix of those qualities together.  The forces of \\"Dark\\" and \\"Light\\" are, however, not delineated because no \\"side\\" is clearly defined.     This series is work (and not just in obtaining copies of the books, which now FINALLY are being published by Tor, even though the series is five books strong in the UK and Canada with the sixth due out in July 2005). Each volume is more than 700 pages (paperback) and filled with graphic details of the horrors of supernatural war, difficulties of superhuman effort, the evil of complete betrayal and (especially in Deadhouse Gates, volume 2) the enormity of heroic sacrifice. Gardens of the Moon is therefore \\"thicker\\" than its 700+ paperback pages (although Tor mercifully squeezed the text into less than 500 pages in hardcover). Nonetheless, it is very interesting, well-written and highly imaginative. A fine addition to the genre and a welcome title in Tor's vast SF&F library.
0743454529|5.0|I read quite a bit and was not familiar with Jodi Picoult's work at all.  I have to admit the cover and the title intrigued me so I picked it up.  Could not put it down!  Beautifully written and I love the way each chapter brought another family's point of view to the story.  I recommend this book highly and it is one that goes on the shelf for my daughter's future reading.
006054094X|1.0|That Europeans invented things like eyeglasses to improve vision, the clock, Greek Fire, etc. all before the year 1421. He very wrongly makes Europe out to be twice as primitive as it actually was. Screwed up book indeed.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I had never really heard of incubus until a couple of months ago when my guitar teacher told me he was a big fan.  I got this album and sort of tossed it off into the pile of low life hard bands that are all over the media today.  Then i listened to it a few more times and realized that incubus had created a masterpiece album.  This album is somewhat of a mix of many different styles of music.  From hard songs that rock you, to songs that make you feel like your floating in the ocean, and then songs that just make you feel like your off in outer space.  Incubus in alot of ways breaks the rules.  Alot of their time and music scales are much different from what we are used to.  In the end I believe Incubus are musician's musicians and not everybody would be able to understand them.  This album is a musical masterpiece.
0783233477|5.0|well at first when I began watching the movie, it looked pretty boring. Then in the coffee shop scene, the movie got a lot more interesting I have no idea why i guess I like to see people flirting. Some time after that the movie gets less exiting but not boring. Then finally towards the end the excess amount of crying makes the movie pretty sad, and it is a really sad movie since the guy knows he's gonna die, and the girl thinks she's about to lose her new love. Also it's nice how at the end the girl realizes that joe was death and she still liked him. It's a really really good movie overall.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Although a lot of people hate this movie, I thought it was great. The special effects are amazing, such as a battle between the machines and humans who are fighting in giant robots, which was pretty cool. The real problem with the series is that it needed another movie, either a prequel to the original Matrix or something between the first one and Reloaded. If you saw the first and second, you have to see this.
B000002I99|5.0|This just is'nt the best Alice Cooper album of all time, Its not just the best concept album of all time, its the greatest album of all time!!!. This really is my fav CD in my collection, the whole thing is Genius from the title track to &quot;Escape&quot;. You'll listen to it over and over again its that good. Alice plays the characters superbly.<br />This truly is a masterpeice, I wish I could give it more stars.
6305897786|2.0|An amoral dealer in rare books (Johnny Depp) is hired by a wealthy collector (Frank Langella) to track down and compare the only three extant copies of a book supposedly written by the Devil himself.  Of course, the purpose behind this is not immediately clear, and the major strength of this film is the way in which it follows Depp as he begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Director Roman Polanski shoots this in a way that allows us to make the discoveries right alongside him.  By the end of the film, however, numerous details have accumulated without amounting to much.  I was left in the dark about the true nature of Depp's mysterious female guardian (Emmanuelle Seigner), and  the significance of the film's final shot was lost on me.  What began as an intriguing mystery ends as a confused mess./
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye is an awesome producer. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to come through as much in this album. For me, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; alone merited my buying the whole album. I love the fact that he is addressing issues of insecurity and materialism within minority communities. I think Kanye has brought a bit of a reality check (much like Chris Rock) and providesa lot of social commentary.<br />The track w/ Jay-Z is tight.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|It's pretty hard to follow up on a movie as good as The Matrix, but Reloaded does a good job. Although the beginning is somewhat pointless, and seems to drag on, the movie starts getting good as soon as they leave Zion. The Matrix movies also really make you think, because a lot of things aren't explained and the possibilities of a &quot;real world&quot; is very interesting. The fact that machines have taken over the humans is also relevant to the world now, as we depend on computers ( I can't go a day without ESPN or AIM) for almost everything, and it's quite possible that we will create robots that are too smart for us. Anyway, the car chase scene is great, as is the scene when they enter the restaurant. Watch this series.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I bought this album together with Brave new world and to beggin with i didn't think that the album was anything special, I liked Brave new world better. It was good for sure but i thought it missed out somethings that I especially liked at that time, like really great choruses. But after about three listenings I started to find out that this album really was something special. I started to like almost all the choruses gitar solos and the instrumental feel of it, especially in songs like Montsegeur and Dance of death. In my opinion this is just as good, if not better than many of the earlier Maiden albums.
0066620996|5.0|There is a silent revolution occurring in today's workplace, and one of the prime movers in this revolution is Jim Collins' book, Good to Great.   Sectors ranging from public schools to professional sports teams have all flocked to Collins credo that &quot;Good is the enemy of great.&quot;   At last count, almost 1.5 million copies of the book have been printed and sold, according to publisher HarperCollins, and it's expected to pass 2 million copies by year's end.  <br />So what is the secret behind the phenomenal success of Collins' work?  In a word, versatility.  Collins and his team of graduate students based the book on five years of research and analyzed over 1,400 public companies to first distinguish the &quot;great&quot; companies from the &quot;good&quot; companies and then attempt to explain how the great companies made the leap.  Collins' team ultimately identified 11 firms as sustained great performers over a requisite 15 year timeline.  <br />Collins succinctly identifies the distinguishing characteristics of these high-flyers.  First, all great companies analyzed by Collins' team had Level 5 leadership  A Level 5 leader is characterized not by ego and self-aggrandizement, but by humility coupled with an iron will.  Michael Eisner and Lee Iacocca, for example, are seen as brilliant business leaders but clearly not Level 5 leaders.  Abraham Lincoln, by comparison, is cited by Collins as the consummate Level 5 leader.<br />Having a Level 5 leader is only the beginning though.  Collins also stresses the importance of &quot;getting the right people on the bus&quot; and once you have the right people on the bus, getting them in the right seat.  To illustrate this point, Collins recounts the work of Hewlett-Packard when upon expanding, began a frenzy of hiring candidates based not solely on the individual's academic record or job experience, but based on their talent.  According to this philosophy, a firm should first and foremost hire talented people and then worry about defining roles rather than the roles defining the individuals.<br />Collins also speaks of the importance of identifying a &quot;Hedgehog Concept&quot;.  Simply state, this means an organization focusing one the one thing they can do better than any other company.  When companies begin to focus their efforts on a hedgehog concept, the company begins turning a &quot;flywheel&quot; which gains momentum with each push.<br />Just as important as his clever catch-phrases, Collins' work is backed up by meticulous research.  It is obvious after reading this book that Collins and his army of graduate students did their homework not only in identifying the good to great companies, but also analyzing what factors contributed to their increased performance.  Hard empirical data and practical solutions, not gooey platitudes and empty rhetoric, are the earmarks of Good to Great.<br />By any measure, Good to Great is a fine read and a significant addition to the body of business research.  It should find itself among the classic management books of our generation as it combines first-rate research with an element of practicality that few others can match.
630027120X|5.0|In The Mission one can see that religion played an important role in the conquest of the indigenous people.  This film is depressing due to the fact that the Guarani indians were betrayed by the white man.  We can also see that Christianity had a great impact on the new believers.  One example of this is when one of the fathers stays behind and prays with the Guarani indians just to be killed by the soldiers.  the indians believes are also strong ones because even though they were being betrayed they died believing in Christianity.  Rodrigo played by Robert DeNiro fights against his own white people because he knows that what white man is doing is wrong.  this film shows us that any man who has more kowledge of the world can conquer a world where their is people who know very little about the world that is beyond their own.  I rocomend this film greatly, so that one can see the injustice of the past eventhough it is useless now because the past has stayed behing and their is nothing we can do to change it.
B000063DI8|5.0|This cd is rally about 4.5 stars but I think i's worth 5 stars. To begin with I don't know why people don't like this album. As long as I have liked Maiden I have liked this album. I think most of the songs are really good, Tail gunner,Fates warning, Holysmoke, No prayer for the dying, Public enema number one and Bring your doughter... are the best songs but the others come really close after. If you like songs with great choruses, great guitar riffs and cool texts you should really buy this album, it's really that good.
B000003TA4|5.0|yo people! this is a great CD. I love all the songs on it. I don't have it yet, but my friend does and he lets me listen to it whenever I'm over. I think it has good words combined with good music makes great songs.YEAH!!! <br />Rock On eveybody!!!!
B000063DFN|5.0|I really like this album, It's really one of the best early Iron Maiden albums, every song is really great and they are all 5/5 rated by me. I think this album is a little better than all the earlier albums, but somewhere in time and Seventh son is just as good as this one.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|Jessica Alba plays Honey, a sweet and sunny girl who teaches hip-hop to kids at the community center even though her mother tells her that she should be pursuing a career in ballet. <br />Honey is spotted by a director of music videos (David Moscow), and before you can say &quot;That flava's hot!&quot; she is lead dancer and choreographer. She is just about to achieve her dream of putting her students into a video starring Ginuwine when it turns out that the video director is interested in more than her dance skills. She turns him down and he fires her. Even worse, he fires the kids and makes her tell them. <br />She doesn't mind losing the job except that she does not know how she will get the money to buy that building she wants to turn into a dance studio so that she can give kids an alternative to thug life. How can she raise the money? Hey, let's put on a show! <br />Alba has a lovely smile and Joy Fisher (Antwone Fisher) adds some verve to the sassy best friend role. Hip-hop fans will enjoy seeing favorite performers like Tweet, L'il Romeo, and Missy Elliot. And the movie is very short, less than 90 minutes. This is the good news. The bad news is that it is just dumb, way past cheesy-but-fun into the realm of &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;-level you-must-be-kidding. Its efforts to be hip make it as instantly out of date as if the characters used words like &quot;groovy&quot; and &quot;out of sight.&quot; When Honey is under pressure to improve her choreography for one video, she gives the dancers a (presumably very expensive) break and goes for a pensive walk, where she draws inspiration from the moves of kids playing basketball and jumping rope. I'm not kidding. It wouldn't be so terrible that the plot, dialogue, and performances were so poor if the movie's reason for being -- the music and dance numbers -- had more energy and style. Worst of all, the movie fails to take advantage of the talents of performers like the glorious Lonette McKee (Jungle Fever) and Mekhai Phifer, who pretty much stand around looking embarrassed.
B000003TAW|5.0|Oh man this album is rockin' to the MAX.  I'll tell you a story.  One time my mom and dad took me on a trip to Botswana to celebrate my great intelligence.  Now while we were going over there tragedy struck and cannibals attacked us and ate my parents but they spared me because I had a copy of the blue album in my back pocket.  The cannibal man felt that this object has super duper TOUGH powers so they all backed away and I was free.  I've cheated death with this thing many other times, and for good reason too.  Rivers Cuomo, one of the most unworthyingly adored singers in recent melody really creates some funky FRESH stuff that isn't lame like Matthew Sweet or any of that other 'power pop' crap.  This is power pop right here, it's filled with energy, enthusiasm, and heart and it has HOOKS too.  And by sounding fresh what I REALLY mean is that they managed to somewhat rip off Pavement with out looking stupid.  But this cd takes no time to get to business and start kickin' ass.  My Name Is Jonas starts out the album wonderfully, sending the album into full gear.  The next highlight is the emoey The World Has Turned And Left Me, that would be bad in the hands of other bands like say Dashboard Confessional, but they do a good job of making it sound tragic but not too overemotional.  But seriously there is not a bad track here, and Weezer really hit the mark, unlike later albums.  Other highlights include the singles Buddy Holly, Undone, and Say It Aint So.  Weezer sure were geeky in this album but at least they aren't uber-nerds to the tenth power without talent in Maladroit.

From the strong new melody to the poetic stringing of words and verses, simply untouchable! The boys should once again be commended for a all around great performance.

0471381985|5.0|This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.
B000002UAO|5.0|If not the best of all of the Beatles' records, Rubber Soul is certainly the best Beatles album pre-Sgt. Pepper.  The Beatles had always been relevant, but they weren't relevant in the sense that Bob Dylan was relevant.  The Beatles operated on a different plane altogether.  I think, however, with the release of Rubber Soul, The Beatles emerged as an artistic force that could be mentioned in the same breath with artists like Dylan.  The music became much more subtle, nuanced and slightly more challenging; Lennon's development into one of the greatest (if not the greatest) song-writers of all time is clearly evident.  Similarly present are the sonic experementations of Harrsion and McCartney.  In short, an album that won't dissapoint; a must-have for any music lover.
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx was one of the most enduring singer/songwriters of the late 1980's and early 1990's. This 1997 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation truly lives up to its title as it includes nearly every big hit Marx had during his successful heyday.<br />Mellow rock classics such as &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;, &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, &quot;Hazard&quot;, &quot;Angelia&quot; and Marx's signature ballad &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; are included here alongside the more aggressive hits &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot;, &quot;Take This Heart&quot;, &quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Should've Known Better&quot;.<br />While it contains most of his hits, Richard Marx's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is missing a few tracks that were worthy of inclusion. Both 1994's &quot;Nothing Left Behind Us&quot; and 1991's hit ballad &quot;Chains Around My Heart&quot; are not on this compilation but their ommission was probably due to lack of space that can fit onto one disc. Regardless of these two missing tracks, this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation offers the cream of the crop of Richard Marx's most successful output along with some great songwriting and dynamic vocals.<br />This disc is truly a trip down memory lane and is a definite must for the die-hard Marx fan and for fans of the '80s, period. If you don't own this one yet, buy it. You'll be glad you did.<br />On a personal note, Richard Marx's songs were an influence on my own songwriting in the early '90s. So from me to Mr. Marx, thanks for the great music and for being a continued influence.
B000002UVX|5.0|There is no denying Hendrix's vision or his raw talent.  His experementation in the studio and his dynamic stage shows had expanded the sonic frontiers of blues based rock.  There were many however, after the release of Electric Ladyland, who believed that Hendrix was losing his magic touch.  Indeed, Hendrix's frustrations in this regard, I think, are well indicated by the fact that over the course of Electric Ladyland's recording, Hendrix had all but dissolved his partnership with producer/manager Chas Chandler and subsequently disbanded the Experience.<BR>The need to fulfill a contractual obligation with Capitol records may have been a blessing in disguise.  Indeed, his resulting collaboration with bassist Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles gave Hendrix an earthier, more funk, blues oriented sound, a sound that anticipates much of the funk to emerge to emerge in the 70's.  If nothing else, Band of Gypsys illustrates the degree and depth of Hendrix's vision.  The weariness of the sometimes erratic Electric Ladyland is gone; the sound is fresh, dynamic and visionary.  Essential for the music lover.
0316666343|5.0|I like Alice Sebold's style of writing. Her heaven is a wonderfully unique idea and though the novel was sad at times I found it to be refreshing overall and believable. A perfect combination or balance of emotion. I've lent the novel to a grieving friend.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I can certainly see why one would not like this film. Its sentimentality is far beyond many people's tastes, and the film's moral is not particularly original. But then, nowadays, what is? <br />The film also follows Tim Burton's pattern of strangeness and anachronism, which is sure to turn away some audience members. <br />Burton, though, is blessed with the ability to manipulate an audience's emotions with ridiculous fantasies and absurd plot twists. <br />The one qualm I had with the film is its underutilization of its female characters. Jessica Lange is certainly among the greatest living actresses, and Alison Lohman is a truly talented young performer. I was also surprised with Helena Bonham Carter (who can forget &quot;Frankenstein&quot;?), who actually delivers this time, her performance reminiscent of her former Woody Allen days. Sadly, though, we didn't get to see enough of any of these fine female performers. <br />Still, the male leads were good. I was surprised by Billy Crudup, and Ewan McGregor has certainly worked on his dialect since &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and &quot;Down With Love.&quot; And Albert Finney, a far cry from his Daddy Warbucks, is as wonderful as ever.
B000001TVD|5.0|That's what one listener exclaimed upon first hearing Maggot Brain, the third album by the progressive African American outfit known as Funkadelic. Actually, I've heard quite a bit of Krautrock and while I think Funkadelic do it one better, I can certainly understand the comparison. It's difficult for me to improve on what has already been said about this masterpiece of psychedelic rock and funk music but this is definitely one of the better albums in the ever expanding, recently rediscovered style of early 70s AFRO PROG. Get this album now but by all means skip the dreadful song Back In Our Minds.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Julie Taymor's portrayal of the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo breaks away from conventional biopics and occasionally enters what seems to be the inside of the artist's surreal mind. Still, the film doesn't seem much different from most biopics.<br />Salma Hayek is fine as the famed painter, but she fails to play such a complex character on more than one level. However, she does capture Kahlo's beauty, and does well when her character is acting passionately. Alfred Molina is also adequate as the repeatedly unfaithful husband - you almost believe him when he says that \\"[sex] doesn't mean anything!\\". The film is also peppered with rather small supporting roles, all performed well enough: Ashley Judd as Italian expatriate Tina Modotti, Antonio Banderas as rival Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, Geoffrey Rush as the Russian exile Leon Trotsky, Edward Norton as greasy bourgeios American Nelson Rockefeller, and the exceptional Valeria Golino as Lupe Marin, Rivera's ex-wife.<br />Elliot Goldenthal's intriguing musical score plays over the absolutely gorgeous Art Direction and Set Direction by Bernardo Trujillo and Hannia Robledo, respectively. The film is a visual and audial cinematic triumph.<br />However, Taymor's direction straddles between avant-garde moviemaking and conventional melodrama. The screenplay, by a collaboration of writers, fails really to delve into the characters' inner-feelings, especially of the title character, despite the frequent, lively trips inside her mind. In short, we see in this film all that happened to Frida Kahlo in her life, and it's beautiful along the way, but most of us are still left knowing little about her true character other than her conventional descriptions as communist, lover, and painter.
0618001905|5.0|Researcher Adam Hochschild provides a lurid and surprisingly fascinating account of the brutal exploitation of the Congo under the rule of King Leopold II of Belgium and beyond.  With the real-life stories of Henry Morton Stanley, William Sheppard, Leon Rom, Joseph Conrad, Roger Casement and others as foundation, Hochschild is able to outline the rise of Leopold, and to paint a vivid portrait of his development from an unlikable and oafish young heir of the Belgian throne to a cunning and vicious ruler responsible for the death of approximately 10 million African men, women and children. More than that, this book is also the story of E.D. Morel, an Englishman whose chance discovery of apparent misdeeds in so-called \\"trade\\" with the Congo gave rise to the most extensive and politically powerful anti-slavery and anti-colonization movements of the century.<br />I recommend this title for its readability (few historians ever make their subject matter as accessible to general readers), its underlying - and savvy - political analysis of the brutality of European colonization across Africa, and its detailed account of what it took to launch, extend and sustain a human rights movement.<br />I recommend pairing this work with Michela Wrong's &quot;In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz,&quot; which details Congo's later struggles under dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
B00003CXFV|4.0|Erin Brockovich is a real woman with real problems and a real will to do something good. So what does she do? Something good. And, quite honestly, it's fun to watch her do it.<br />Brockovich (Julia Roberts, Oscar-winner for this role) has three kids, two ex-es, and a realy foul mouth. When she lands a job at the law office of Ed Masry (Albert Finney, Oscar-nominee for this role), she finds herself initiating the investigaiton of a local power plant, which has apparently contaminated the water of a small town nearby and caused numerous illness and deaths. Erin keeps pushing Ed and the townspeople, and ends up being a participant in a 333 million-dollar lawsuit, one of the biggest in American history.<br />Besides a heartwarming David-and-Golliath story, this is essentially a star vehicle for the winning Julia Roberts, as well as an ego trip for the real-life Erin Brockovich (who gained MUCH publicity... after the release of the film). The film is not perfect: it sometimes lacks a sense of coherence (one scene ends and the next begins without flow), and some performances are mediocre. However, Roberts finally frees herself from her previous stereotype of the candy-colored heroine and Finney is wonderful as usual, and also noted is a quite moving supporting performance by TV-veteran Marg Helgenberger, who plays Donna Jensen, a victim of the contaminated water due to the power plant's carelessness. Her performance, above all, makes you glad that the good guys win.
0316666343|3.0|When a patient dies, the family always ask when can they see the body. This is all about closure and saying the last farewell. Sebold's Lovely Bones builds a good climax after Suzie Salmon's rape and murder; her family's attempt with coping afterwards; her friends' lives being fulfilled as she watches from her Heaven. I can accept that not all murders are solved and that murderers keep on reoffending for years. However, I was very disappointed at the body swapping moment where Suzie merely came back to Earth through her schoolmate Ruth's body to only have a moment of physical contact with a boy she had a crush on. If I had the chance to come back from Heaven, even if only for a brief moment, I would go to my family who has been suffering, torn apart and who had to live with no physical evidence to support their daughter's murder, for the rest of their lives. I would attempt at any gesture or signal to give them some sort of closure and to say farewell and let them know that I am watching them everyday. Sebold's ending was just too sweet, that babies will grow up, flowers will bloom, fathers' broken hearts will mend even if they have to live out their last days not knowing how their daughter was murdered and where her body lies.
B000009RC2|5.0|This is the Mahavishnu Orchestra's first album. There was no better way to enter the scene than this. No one had ever played jazz at this loud of a volume before. Meeting of the Spirits, while one of there simplest songs, has to be one of the greatest songs ever. John McLauglin arpegiated chords and blistering guitar solos are enough to show that he is probably the best guitarist ever. Billy Cobham is certainly one of the best fusion drummers ever. All of these songs are brilliant. Whether it be the erie blues of the Dance of the Maya, the soft acoustic sounds of Lotus on Irish Streams, or the slower more mellow song You Know, You Know, its all here. This is certainly one of the most interesting bands ever. the last song even changes keys according to what astronomical sign each one of the band members was born under.
B000002UAO|2.0|So disappointing relative to the earlier Beatlemania sound of 1962-1964. Sometimes change is good.  In this case, unfortunately, it wasn't.  If you are just discovering the Beatles, this is one of the albums you can skip over.
0792151712|4.0|Perfect movie, one complaint-ending a little predictable (didn't James Cameron realize that everyone knows what happened to the Titanic?-I had the same complaint with the recent \\"Passion of the Christ\\").  Also, as a warning-this entire movie takes place on a boat so if you don't like boat movies I wouldn't recommend it.  Also I thought it was too much of an unexplained coincidence that all the character were on the boat together-a major plot loophole.  <br />That said, this movie literally knocked my socks off.  Seriously, I still can't find them and I watched this movie two days ago.
B000002UDB|1.0|No, many of the songs from this album did not &quot;dominate&quot; any radio play list of more than 500 songs. There are a mere 11 songs on this album and all but three are long forgotten.  A master piece (of medocrity) indeed.  Oh, it's true!
B0000CFW87|3.0|Being a formally-trained vocalist, of course I can hear the technical flaws. But really, he is not exactly going for the whole &quot;opera&quot; sound; therefore people shouldn't criticize him for it. Granted, I was a bit ashamed of &quot;Caruso&quot; (a bad song to begin with- regardless to who is singing it)- and it made me very nervous as to the direction he is heading in. Aside from that, he has a very PRETTY voice that is enjoyable to listen to 80% of the time. My only gripe is in the song selection- it is a rather pathetic compilation of mediocre ballads just screaming to be used as Show Choir numbers. Hey, if that is what you like, then go for it- I have to say there is something charming about them... when mixed with OTHER things.<BR>But this causes a strange dilema: should he continue singing what is good in his voice or try to do other things that would be- um- not so good. He could do more up-beat songs... but that would sound odd unless it were the right song. Or he could go the Charlotte Church route and give us all something to laugh at as he attempts opera (those who swear she is the end-all of sopranos need to have a swift kick in the face).<BR>My way of solving this: listen to a few songs from this CD and then put in something that is up-beat... otherwise it is just too much.
B00004RJ74|4.0|Directed by Robert Rodriguez with a script written by Quentin Tarantino who also co-stars in it, this film resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl: \\"When it's good, it's very, very good but when it's bad....\\" Not much of a plot. Two psychopathic brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) kidnap a fallen-away minister (Keitel) and his two children, commandeer their van, and head south to Mexico to do business with drug dealers at The Titty Twister roadhouse. As in El Mariachi (1992) and then Desperado (1995) which Rodriguez also directed, the emphasis is on interaction between and among characters to create intense moments which may or may not advance the plot, such as it is. Rodriguez is a master of creating a stunning variety of atmospherics (hilarity, menace, confusion, bravado, etc.) amidst truly inspiring posturing by his lead characters. Moments of delicious tenderness are suddenly obliterated by gratuitous violence, both verbal and physical. I probably should have seen it coming but I didn't: Those who frequent Titty Twister roadhouse (only open from dusk until dawn, of course) are vampires. The Gecko brothers and their companions find themselves in harm's way and then....<br />I always enjoy spotting veteran actors in subordinate roles. In this film, for example, Michael Parks (Texas Ranger Earl McGraw), John Saxon (FBI Agent Stanley Chase), Marc Lawrence (Old Timer) and Selma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium). At one point, as the roadhouse band performs \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\\" I wondered if Stevie Ray Vaughan was also in this film. (He isn't.) This film is obviously not for everyone. (For Rodriguez and Tarantino, that may well be a badge of honor.) The quality of acting is superior to the plot; the aforementioned atmospherics are superior to whatever \\"messages\\" Rodriguez and Tarantino may have intended to send to their audience. Almost everyone who sees this film will either enjoy it or stop watching it long before its conclusion. Whatever.
B000268QB2|1.0|People have said that you don't even notice that the guitar is gone and think that is a good thing. I just see it as another example of how mediocre this music truly is. If they had a guitar you would not notice if it was there. They play nothing interesting w/ their piano. Are they forever stuck w/ the same five keys? Their drumming is the saddest thing you could pull out of a drum machine. The singing and lyrics sound like the mutterings of the most bored nihilist I've ever heard. Ultimately, all the songs just run together with that same dry bored british whining, the repitive piano, and sorry drumming making me actually wish for the noisy and alteast distinct american whining of Nirvana.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I know everyone will say Ten, Nevermind,  or Murmor was a better album,  but OK Computer is definitely the best. Ok Computer is a saga of great music in which you have to listen in its entirety.  It is a great concept album where each song is different but yet the same. Rather than a whole cd of singles, OK Computer tells its own story.  Your mood goes up and down from a hard paranoid android to a softer Subterranean Homesick Alien.  When I listen to OK Computer I never change the tracks,  the album tells a story and you don't want to miss a chapter.  That's what makes OK Computer the best album of the 90's,
B000268QB2|1.0|This band has no edge what-so-ever. They sound just like Coldplay. And who does Coldplay try to imitate? Pink Floyd. Except something got lost in the translation. Edge. These guys should go back to an re-listen to The Wall or Animals and discover that Pink Floyd had interesting things to say, and sharp melodies, and some god-for-bid ANGER some times. I'd die a happy man if if the singer ever even RAISED HIS VOICE.<br />And yes the USA has had a raw deal with music for the last 10 years (except Radiohead and The Smashing Pumpkins) but that is no excuse for praising something so bland and uninteresting.
B00004RJ71|5.0|if you like long movies about the penitentiary ,family and so much more than you are going to love this movie.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|What's with all the sex first of all? There's no need for any of it. Secondly, what was the point of the movie in the first place, love? It was a bunch of couples cheating on each other! It was not a good movie at all and I recommend Lost in Translation over this! Don't waist your money!
B00003CXCT|5.0|There are few words that can describe the greatest movie series to ever appear on screen.  Awesome, Incredible, Magnificent, Amazing, Close to perfect... to name a few.  If there was ever a movie that started the hightech - special effects era, it was Star Wars.  Due to this and a cast that could never be matched, It has endured the test of time and is still as thrilling today as it was back in 1977.  Rarely do you find a movie series where the follow ups are just as good or very close to being just as good.  The Star Wars Trilogy delivers the same relentless excitement, tremendous story and superb acting throughout the entire series.<BR>Since today's generation sadly doesn't have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, DVD is the next best option.  I've seen each movie over 50 times each (big screen X times and VHS) and am still counting down the days until the DVDs come out!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Okey, let me start off by saying this, if you love great music then you will positivly LOVE gorillaz.<BR>Gorillaz have made some of the best music in the world.It is unique, catchy, amazing, and fresh.All the songs on the album are great!Dan the Automater is possibly a better producer than the Neptunes AND Kanye West put together( because he is better than each one of them alone ).The band is also interesting because they aren't actually really alive.What I mean is this, the people behind the scenes are real but the characters they play are not.Another thing about this is that there are more than just four members of the band( as the fake cartoon versions would have you know ).There are acually many more including the likes of:Kid Koala, Dan the Automater, Damon Albarn, Del Tha Funky Homosapien, Miho Hatori, Jamie Hewlett, Phi Life Cypher, and Ibrahim Ferrer.There are more like Tina Weymouth and U Brown but the list would go on forever.Lots of DJs have worked with gorillaz including:Kid Koala, The Spacemonkeys, Soulchild, and The Wiseguys House Of Wisdom.The really cool thing about gorillaz is that no one else sounds exactly like them, there are a few that are close( Deltron 3030, and Dr. Octogon )but no one ever actually can ever copy exactly the kind of magical feeling you get from listoning the gorillaz.<br />Here is a list of the songs and my ratings on them:<br />1.Re-Hash-***** Great, but repetitive intro to a great album.<br />2.5/4-***** Old school ska mixed with new age DJing. Unusual mix but still flies very high, in fact, this song was the fifth hit off the album.<br />3.Tomorrow Comes Today-***** It's a hit and you can tell! It's got kind of a trip-hop feel but Damon Albarn's lo-fi singing makes it something else.<br />4.New Genious(brother)-***** Sounds like Bruce Lee movie opening mixed with Dr. Frankenstein's lab. One of my favorites.<br />5.Clint Eastwood-***** Del's rap is great, Damon's chorus is great. Overall a great song( a bit over played on MTV and the radio though ).<br />6.Man Research(clapper)-***** It's dub reggae at its best!<br />7.Punk-***** It's old school punk at its best!<br />8.Sound Check(gravity)-***** Kid Koala really shines on this song, it has amazing DJ work on it as well as kick-@$$ voice samples. One of my favorites.<br />9.Double Bass-*** A miner flaw on the album but not TOO bad. <br />10.Rock the House-***** Del raps again with flying colours. Superb.<br />11.19-2000-**** Great song with awesome vocals but it kinda gets annoying after a few listons.<br />12.Latin Simone-*** Great music but I don't like Ibrahim Ferrer's vocals. The English version on the gorillaz album \\"G-Sides\\"is much better.<br />13.Starshine-***** Great, but repetetive.<br />14.Slow Country-***** I just love the piano part on this song and the lyrics are funny. Damon\\"s vocals again make this song perfect even apointless chorus is brought to life by him.<br />15.M1-A1-**** This song could possibly have the worst intro ever made. but once you get by it( if you can bear it )the song is good.
B000002H97|5.0|When this album was first released in 1991, many fans were angry at Metallica for straying away from their speed metal roots. But I feel they sound better like this, actually. It is one of my favorite albums, because I feel it has everything a good heavy metal album needs: Heavy guitars, thumping drums/bass, plus some growled vocals. This album gave Metallica 3 (yes, 3) Top 40 hits, all of which are some of the best songs on the album. They are: Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, and The Unforgiven. Buy this, u won't be sorry.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I was just reviewing the reviews on Amazon of Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; album (that's what we still call those discs) to get some info on something I'm putting together.<br />I see alot of people have just discovered this album in the last couple of years, at least judging by the Amazon.com hits/reviews. Great!<br />This was a HUGE LP when I was in H.S. (Class of '73)! And it was a great LP then and it still is. So, for those who liked that LP, have you tried &quot;Between The Lines&quot; by Janis Ian? Great lyrics &amp; musicanship! 'Course, she'll make you want to slit your wrists with that album. But, I still throw it into the CD player, now and then.<br />For those of you who are willing to venture far(very way far)afield, for melancholic, but great writing, try Sinatra's &quot;In The Wee Small Hours&quot; LP/CD, or his happier &quot;love&quot; CD (and also with great writing) &quot;Songs For Swinging Lovers.&quot; These two albums, like Carole King's, are also &quot;concept&quot; albums, wherein the whole album is like a &quot;story&quot;, or they are trying to evoke a certain and specific mood.<br />Later, in the mid Seventies, I discovered the probably ultimate &quot;concept&quot; album. That is Willie Nelson's &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; album. <br />Try these albums, even if you &quot;think&quot; you don't like these &quot;genres&quot;.
B000001FDK|5.0|This soundtrack album is the second biggest-selling in pop music history. The first is the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack. And both films starred John Travolta. Not only that,they were both originally released on the defunct RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) label. I went through 2 LP copies of this album,as I said in the review for the DVD movie. There are actually 23 different recordings on the album. Track 24 is a repeat of the title theme(track 1). The title theme was written by ex-Bee Gee Barry Gibb and performed by Frankie Valli of The Four Seasons. The song is heard during the playing of the opening and closing credits in the film. SUMMER NIGHTS is about the summer romance of Danny Zuko(Travolta) and Sandy Dombrowski(Olivia Newton-John). ONJ performs HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU,later recycled for her GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 album. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT is another duet between Travolta and ONJ,also appearing on GHV2. SANDY is Danny's ode to his sweetheart(he sings this after being abandoned by Sandy at a drive-in theater in the film). BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT is Frankie Avalon's advisory to Frenchy(Didi Conn). LOOK AT ME,I'M SANDRA DEE is sung by Rizzo or her portrayer,Stockard Channing. GREASED LIGHTNIN' is about the power of automobiles,sung by Travolta with moral support from Jeff Conaway(Kenickie). IT'S RAINING ON PROM NIGHT is OK,so is ALONE AT A DRIVE-IN MOVIE. Sha-Na-Na,as Johnny Casino &amp; The Gamblers in the film,performs BLUE MOON,ROCK &amp; ROLL IS HERE TO STAY,THOSE MAGIC CHANGES,HOUND DOG,TEARS ON MY PILLOW and BORN TO HAND-JIVE. MOONING,FREDDY MY LOVE and ROCK AND ROLL PARTY QUEEN are OK. Channing superbly performs THERE ARE WORSE THINGS I COULD DO(the song is heard in &quot;Connie &amp; Carla&quot; also,but not Channing's recording of it). There's a reprise of LOOK AT ME,I'M SANDRA DEE performed by ONJ. The Rydell High School seniors perform WE GO TOGETHER,heard in the final scene. LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING is an instrumental easy listening classic,heard in the very first scene before opening credits. This album is packed with still photos from the film. The one on the back cover of the LP and CD booklet is of the overall film cast. It would have been great if the title track was recorded by the Bee Gees. ONJ's manager John Farrar wrote or co-wrote some of ONJ's recordings on this album.
0316666343|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend yesterday, and literally could not put it down! It reminded me of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; but with more of a plot.  I will definately re-read this one in the future.
B00006B1HH|5.0|\\"'Grease' is the word that you heard,it's got a groove,it's got a meaning.\\",sings Frankie Valli in the theme song penned by ex-Bee Gee Barry Gibb. I can't tell you how many times in 26 years I saw this film. The first two times I saw it were in 1978,the year it was released. I was obsessed with this film then(I was then 6,nearly 7 years old). I went through 2 LP copies of the soundtrack and don't have either one anymore. A female friend and I would pretend to be Sandy Dombrowski and Danny Zuko,the star characters respectively portrayed by Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. This film was based on the broadway play of the same title. The play debuted in 1972 and the film was made 5 years later. In the film,set in 1959,Sandy and Danny began their romance before returning for their senior year at Rydell High School. Sandy tells her girlfriends and Danny tells his buddies in song,entitled SUMMER NIGHTS. Sandy and her girlfriends are the Pink Ladies and Danny and his buddies are the T-Birds. Memorable scenes include Danny and Sandy at a drive-in theater,newly reconciled and temporarily parted due to an argument(Travolta sings SANDY). Also Danny and Cha-Cha(sexy and beautiful Annette Charles Cardona) strutting their stuff at a dance in the school gymnasium(that made Sandy jealous). Sha-Na-Na as Johnny Casino & The Gamblers performing at the dance. Frenchy(Didi Conn) being visited by a guardian angel(Frankie Avalon singing BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT). Danny and Kenickie(pre-Taxi Jeff Conaway) racing in their cars. And of course,the Rydell High seniors singing WE GO TOGETHER at the carnival in the last scene. The late Eve Arden is the Rydell High principal,Sid Caesar is the phys. ed. instructor and Stockard Channing is Rizzo,Kenickie's girlfriend. This was one of '78's biggest films. Another film with a pop music soundtrack released the same year was AMERICAN HOT WAX which was a disappointment. This film was a hit largely because Travolta was still a teen idol and ONJ was a big-selling music artist. Travolta had a prior hit,SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER which grossed just as much as this film. Travolta's ABC sitcom Welcome Back,Kotter was still on the air at the time of filming but his role of Vinnie Barbarino was greatly reduced. After SNF,he wanted to focus on his film career. ONJ later starred in 1980's XANADU,a musical also. Travolta and ONJ re-teamed for 1983's TWO OF A KIND which flopped. Director Randal Kleiser subequently directed 1980's THE BLUE LAGOON starring Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. This film was re-released theatrically in 1998,in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of its original release. The re-release featured previously unseen footage. It also gave those born after 1978 a chance to see it in theatres.
B000002L7R|5.0|It is perhaps one of Prince's more underrated albums, but I found it an enjoyable listening experience, it's great tracks are: &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, the more commercial track on the album apart from &quot;Pop life&quot;, &quot;Condition of the Heart&quot; is one of the more introspective and slow tracks, showing more musical range and romanticism.  The Ladder is introspective and spiritual.  This is one album showing Prince at his best.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Avril, but it wasn't until I listened to Under My Skin in its entirety that I realized what an amazing artist she truely is.  She has shown so much growth since the release of Let Go.  Not only has her song writing tremendously improved but the her voice has continued to get even better.  I would definately reccommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Avril... and even if you were not before you may be after you listen to Under My Skin... It really rocks!!!  Highlights of the album are the first single Don't Tell Me, as well as My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, and Fall To Pieces.  The entire album however is truely great!
B00000J7JO|3.0|Californication has its share of lovely, rocked-out hits (the beautiful &quot;Otherside&quot; and the title song &quot;Californication&quot;), but not even all of the hits are very good. &quot;Scar tissue&quot; is very boring. It has a bit of a hook, but it doesn't go anywhere special (just like the guys going down a generic desert road in the video for the song). BUT since the Chili Peppers, have done so much for music in the past twenty years by fusing pure get-up-and-groove Funk with straight-up Rock, the mediocrity of Californication is forgivable. The only thing that isn't forgivable is their horrendous video for Californication, which features the guys in a horribly-rendered computer-generated mess. It was meant to look a modern video game, but the effects, which were done just five years ago, are awful. What a misstep.<br />My grade for Californication: C
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is awesome. The music is phenomenal and the acting is great. The story is original and set in the Eighties. At heart, it is about a boy and the girl that he loves. If you buy one DVD today, you should buy this. It is entertaining as well as funny and nerve-wracking.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I very much agree with those who say that this soundtrack is much better than John Williams's past efforts for the series. The music this time is darker and richer with great melodic variety. The children's chorus, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, in particular, is a brilliant stroke! Highly recommended.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|Franz Ferdinand's self-titled debuted album proves that garage rock has crossed the pond, and invaded the UK. One can easily draw comparisons of Franz Ferdinand with the Strokes, but while the two bands sound similar, its how that sound is used is where they differ. Franz Ferdinand create a drum and bass feel within a indie rock band, and in fact, their sound could be labeled as indie-rock dance hall music. Much of the time throughout the album (if not most of it), one can hear the hi-hats distinctive rhythm, along with the cruising bass line and drums as the accompaniment to the constant beat. That's not to say this is a bad thing, many times throughout the album you'll find yourself tapping your foot along. The opening track \\"Jacqueline\\", provides a classic example of garage rock, complete with strumming chord progressions, a steady bass line, drumming with a consistent rhythm, and vocals that define the tone of the album- rhyming and with a pulse. If \\"Jaqueline\\" is the garage rock anthem, then \\"Come on Home\\" is the dance theme, a song reminiscent of the Talking Heads in their \\"Life During Wartime\\" phase. Franz Ferdinand's debute is worth a listen, especially to fans of garage rock, but this album definitely isn't for everyone.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Where do I start? This is the best single album I've ever heard. Every track is a classic. As a diehard Beatles fan, I realize this CD only reveals their most successful tunes. For example, there is nothing on here from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; or &quot;Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot; But, &quot;1&quot; is perfect for Beatles beginners and for an entertaining driving companion. If I could give &quot;1&quot; seven stars, I would give it nine.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|when slipknot's self titled album came out it rocked.  when iowa came out it continued slipknot's tradition of extreme heavy metal beats and harsh lyrics.  then this crap comes out.  weak drums, merely ok guitar, and corey doesn't even sound the same.  there are only a few good songs on this album including blister exists and duality.  almost all other 13 songs are garbage.  what a let down.  slipknot please redeem yourselves by making another &quot;Iowa&quot; type album.  you cant even jam to this in concert!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|It has been a curiosity to me why Avril Lavigne has been compared with Witless Spears and \\"Don't' Call Me Britney\\" Christina.  Seems to me Lavigne has always appealed to a much different audience.  If in the future Lavigne begins to perform in nothing but pasties and a thong, I may change my opinion.  Until then I suspect she is more of a rocker than a showbiz child.<br />But this does point out one of the pitfalls of watching young girl performers turn into young women.  Examples abound of young women who feel they have something to prove once they sense they have crossed the river into the land of young adulthood.  The first thing that happens is they cut their long locks for a \\"cute\\" hairstyle they think makes them look more mature (usually has the ironic effect of making them look more childish).  Frills and lace give way to more revealing and provocative clothing.  Along with this follows the bejeweled navel and the \\"butt-hat\\" tattoo for added notes of daring.  Depending on the setting, our once precious angels will take up cussing and smoking for public consumption to strike a pose of defiance and independence.  Along with the changes in appearance and behavior, choices in songwriting strike further notes of worldliness.  \\"You Can't Tell Me What To Do!\\"  \\"I Was Such A Fool But I Know Better Now\\" and the ever popular tunes which boil down to \\"I've Had Sex.  Lots Of It And I Like It!\\"<br />In general we wish them well; but it would take a heart of stone not to sense there is something faintly ridiculous about this.  Communication is a highly overrated activity.  Generally a little talking goes a long way-as long as it has purpose.  Most of us, however, are given to verbal diarrhea thinking that if it is said once it bares being said a hundred times.  Failing accurate expression we let loose a verbal torrent hoping that somehow some heartfelt truth will come out.  Worse, we seem to think if we say it enough then it is true.  We shouldn't be too hard on young men and woman; but neither should we take their protestations of adulthood at face value.  Most of us latter learn that in spite of all this \\"noise\\" maturity actually occurs when our focus begins to drift away from ourselves.  Like happiness, maturity is a by-product of a long line of accomplishments and sacrifices.<br />In this regard, Avril Lavigne is more like Alanis Morissette than either Britney or Christina.  Like Morissette, Lavigne works in a rock and roll idiom where the music says as much if not more as the actual lyrics.  This works in her favor in that reading the lyric sheet makes one feel like you are reading the diary of a hyperventilating high school girl.  We are related tales of failed loves, loneliness, and new loves.  Concerning lost loves we see that from her point of view it wasn't just that the love failed: injustice was done to her.  Either the former lover was not who she thought he was or he turned out to be a jerk.  In any event, Lavigne is desperate for love and it is that very desperation that gets her into so much trouble.<br />The more cynical among us would say that so it is with all of us-older, more sophisticated folk just dress it up better.  Maybe so.  As music, Lavigne has nothing to be ashamed of.  Each song here has its moments of greatness and appeal.  That the guitar lines and rhythms are obviously beyond Lavigne's own abilities should not be held against her.  Rather it more directly speaks to knowing who to collaborate with to make the music she wants.  The music also has the virtue of not sounding like something out of a \\"rockin'-r-us\\" computer program.  Instead it has stylistic idiosyncrasies and expressions that breathe \\"originality\\" into all twelve songs to catch your notice and perhaps grudging admiration.<br />Lavigne just may pass into musical adulthood without embarrassing herself.  Whatever her faults, her instincts are good and sound.  In recent interviews, Lavigne badmouths Britney and Christina.  Good move.  Here hoping she doesn't someday admit to secretly wanting to be like Madonna.ping she doesn't someday admit to secretly wanting to be like Madonna.
0312995423|4.0|Lest you thought that your e-mails were private, think again. A pool of highly talented geeks and zillion-dollar gizmos at the U.S. National Security Agency's ultra-secret wing called the Cryptography division are reading it all - from fax messages to e-mail correspondence to even coded content. Nothing escapes the penetrating, yet stealthy gaze of the NSA. <br />Its job? To monitor global electronic intelligence data in the interest of national security. <br />The organization has spent a whopping $2 billion to build TRANSLATR, the world's most technologically sophisticated machine capable of cracking encryptions within minutes. However, the equipment is severely challenged when Ensei Tankado, an ex-employee of the NSA and a fierce advocate of digital privacy, [he believes that it is wrong on the part of governments to keep tabs on the lives of law-abiding citizens] creates a software that can write unbreakable codes - the `Digital Fortress'. <br />He has uploaded the encrypted version of Digital Fortress to the World Wide Web but has not disclosed the pass-key required to use it. This is the world's ultimate code, one that has crippled even TRANSLATR. Once opened, it will be the kiss-of-death for the intel community worldwide and be a godsend to hackers, terrorist groups, anti-social elements and individuals engaging in subversive activities. <br />When TRANSLATR fails in its endeavor to unlock Digital fortress, it becomes a life-and-death situation for the NSA to track down Tankado, clinch a deal with him and obtain the pass-key before it falls into the wrong hands. <br />But before the NSA can get to him, he is killed in Seville, Spain, by someone who is also waiting to lay hands on the precious pass-key. Moments before dying, he passes on a rather nondescript gold ring with a curious etching to a bystander.There lies the code that would save the NSA and its databank of highly classified documents from a total meltdown. The trail takes the NSA-deputed sleuth David Becker through the meandering alleyways of Seville, to a shady punk hub and the church of Santa Cruz. <br />Barring the last 100-odd pages which seemed to drag on for ever and ever, the book is a terrific page-tuner, full of suspense and surprises. In fact, it's the ending that will leave you totally breathless!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS CD I WAS VERY EXCITED BECAUSE I HEARD &quot;DUALITY&quot; AND I FIGURED THIS CD WAS GOING TO HAVE MORE VOCAL TALENT BY COREY,BUT COME ON! THIS CD IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS HEAVY AS THE PREVIOUS TWO. BUT AS A DEDICATED MAGGOT I AM NOT GOING TO BLAST THIS CD. THERE WERE SOME GREAT HEAVIER SONGS ON THE ALBUM( &quot;THE BLISTER EXISTS&quot;,&quot;THREE NIL&quot;, &quot;DUALITY&quot;,&quot;OPIUM OF THE PEOPLE&quot;, AND &quot;WELCOME&quot;). BUT THEN THERE WERE SONGS THAT THE CD COULDVE DONE WITHOUT(&quot;PRELUDE 3.0&quot;,&quot;CIRCLE&quot;, &quot;VERMILION PT. 2 AND ESPESCIALLY &quot;DANGER-KEEP AWAY&quot;.....THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM). I FALL ASLEEP EVERYTIME I HEAR &quot;CIRCLE&quot;. THIS IS STILL A GOOD CD, BUT MY LEAST FAVORITE SLIPKNOT CD(SELF-TITLED BEING MY FAVORITE). I JUST HOPE THEIR FOURTH CD IS MUCH HEAVIER.
B00020HEG6|5.0|If possible, this soundtrack is better than the previous two Harry Potter's. It is one of the best John Williams to date. Astounding how perfect the music is for the movie. Listening to this soundtrack gives me chills and I repeat in my head, &quot;John Williams is a genius.&quot;
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It was nice to see this movie. There we are, in Tokio with Bill Murray... This guy is one of the few good actors in Hollywood, a pit he has been so underestimated all these years! He has this thing that you just look and get engaged, what is essential for his role in this movie.<br />I think people is so used to watch &quot;easy-to-see expect-an-unintelligent-audience soap-opera cheesy-and-popcorn good-guy-gets-good-girl&quot; sort of movies, that they get a bit confused with this one. And it's not a matter of watching this movie with an open mind... just sit, eat your popcorn (this isn't any problem), and try to think 2 minutes after watching it... (no, it isn't necessary make a long reflection)... Actually, you can skip thinking 2 minutes too... <br />The very thing that I loved in this movie is that what everybody is expecting to happen at any time (sooner or later... probably later, in the end, as usual...) never happens...<br />I hope I'm not spoiling things here... But the story is very simple... nice guy (Bill Murray) meets a nice girl whose husband lets her too much time alone... Besides, the nice guy is far from home and isn't getting nice conversations with his wife in the phone...<br />Well, what does everybody expect to happen here? I'm not even say... <br />The real spoiler might be that... it doesn't happen! <br />And that's great that it doesn't happen... Seeing the trailer one can understand what this movie is really about...<br />The guys don't speak japanese and need translators.. but they suddenly share something that doesn't need translation, which is friendship! And that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Just friendship.<br />For people that think that they understand immediately the point of other people... I would say at this point.. You are wrong... <br />No I'm not saying that just because this movie breaks with a cliche this automatically makes it better than the others. I'm not even saying that it's better than anything. I'm just saying this is a good movie, I enjoyed it, I hope you enjoy too, and you get an enriching experience as I did. What's nice in the movie is the interaction among the characters and how people simply can't avoid feeling unhappy just because they're passing some time bored or a bit lonely, and don't have a nice way to kill time or some nice company...<br />The point here is: Bill Murray is married and have some children! He's passing for some kind of personal crisis, and his relationship is not wonderful, but it's no reason for him to get a divorce and begin another relationship, just because he's going  out with a nice young girl (that probably would turn out to be like his wife after some time engaged in a relationship with him...)<br />Let us face the facts, no relationship is perfect and wonderful all the time. The truth is that one wouldn't be necessarily more happy just switching partners every time things are not so good and one meets another &quot;nice&quot; one... Of course, I'm not saying that one wouldn't want, if possible... Well... I hope you get my meaning here...<br />The girl in the movie is just bored! <br />She's not enjoying things, she doesn't like japanese tv, doesn't feel anything in a japanese church, doesn't comprehend (nor wants to understand) japanese culture, etc.. And his husband is leaving her too much time alone... That's her problem... She simply can't avoid the feeling that she's not as happy as she wanted to be... Besides, she's not even considering the hypothesis that she might be passing for a rich moment in her life.<br />However, it doesn't mean that get involved with Bill Murray would make her life better, or make her more talented (other thing that she complains, that she's not very talented for her work...). <br />That's it... So what? <br />See the movie, and see what happens...
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|This movie is forced...the dialogue is forced...the images are forced...the cuteness is forced...<br />I like the point that the movie seemed to make:  listen to loved ones and their (annoying) stories because when they're gone they live on in our memories and through those stories.  However, the manner and course that this movie took to make this point wore me out.<br />My mother-in-law had heard many good things about this flick and grabbed it for us to watch as a family.  No problem.  When the movie opened, and I saw Tim Burton's name flash on the screen, I thought, &quot;Uh, oh.  It's going to be weird.&quot;  Then I realized the Ewan McGregor was in it, and I thought, &quot;Uh, oh.  This could be painfully cheesy.&quot;  Big Fish was on both counts.<br />I understand that part of the charm of the movie was to be the intricate web of details and colorful language of the father's stories...but...they just didn't seem &quot;real&quot;.  Yes, I know that there was supposed to be a blending of the real and unreal...but the stories felt more like someone was trying to be cute and artsy and clever with language instead of the down-home, fanciful, and folksy character of the father.  I couldn't by the &quot;way&quot; the stories were told.<br />This movie also lacked continuity...which was supposed to have been provided by the stories.  What does a car submerged in a river with a naked lady swimming by (whom I'm guess was the oft-referred-to Big Fish)...when the car then turns up in a tree after the storm the next morning...have to do with the rest of the movie?  Maybe I'm just a simpleton, but I didn't get the symbolism...<br />The most redeeming part of the movie is the very end, when the sons tells the story of how the father dies, weaving in all of the other stories of his life...but it wasn't worth sitting through all the rest of the forced scenes and subplots and one dimensional characters to get there.<br />Instead of wasting over 2 hours watching this flick, sit down with your parents or grandparents and listen to their stories.  Don't let the stories of their youth be a big fish that gets away when they're gone.
B000094HMU|5.0|This DVD of Puccini's opera &quot;Turandot&quot; is from a performacne at<br />the Met in April of 1987. First of all the casting is above<br />average, second the production is first rate, and the singers are<br />some of the Met's best. This DVD runs circles around the RCA<br />one that was recorded in Peking with Zubin Mehta on the podium.<br />will the RCA DVD has a lot going for it, the costumes and the<br />scenery are quite impressive, the singers and the chorus act like<br />they are just making a recording of the opera not performing it.<br />Here Placido Domingo and Eva Marton et al bring their characters<br />to life. The best part of this performance for me was the famous<br />&quot;riddle scene&quot; it has just enough suspense and drama to make it<br />memorable.  All in all a great performance of a great opera.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Gentlemen (chuckle), we can rebuild the seventies.  We can make the world's first Junk Rock Record.  The RAMONES will be that record! It will bet better than it was before: simpler, LOUDER, FASTER.  We will use Marshall amps and turn it up to 11.  We will abandon guitar solos and over the top jamming, as well as replacing every drum solo and fill with screwed up 4/4 signatures and cymbal crashes.  We will boil syrupy 70's schmaltz ballads in the battery acid of our amplifiers and make the record sound like the whole decade is being ground up in a garbage disposal.  We will pay tounge-in-your-girlfriend's- cheek homage to horror movies (Chainsaw), child abuse (Beat on the Brat), drug abuse (I Wanna Sniff Some Glue), political abuse (Havana Affair), dope fiend street hustlers (53rd and 3rd), romance (I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend), and the inevitable bust ups (Loudmouth).  We will also bookend this plate of punk with the ultimate gameplan (Today Your Love, Tommorow The World), and the epitome of glorious calls to trashing good fun in Blitzkrieg Bop.  We will crush everything the 70's has smeared on us or we will scare the record buyer right out of the friggin store..oops, we scared the friggin record buyers right out of the store and developed a rabid cult following instead.  Oh well, who needs those pinheads anyway!  Count it Dee Dee! &quot;1234.&quot;  Belt it out in your best Mersey-meets-Queens accent Joey, &quot;Hey ho! Let's go!&quot;
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the absolute best musical out there!  It is worth every penny! Kristen and Idina are wonderful!!!You will not be disappointed with this purchase. It is throughly enjoyable from start to finish.  You will fall in love with Elphaba and Glinda!
B000001FKY|1.0|That's what this album is all about. Taken by producer Mutt Lange to new astonishing levels of commercialism, Def Leppard completely sold out with this album. The electronic and annoying drumming, the &quot;let's rock, let's make love&quot; lyrics, all the cliches. Gone was the high raw energy of the band that recorded High 'N Dry and On Through The Night. Ok, the changes began in PYROMANIA, but here in HYSTERIA they threww all barriers to the wind. Money and huge sales was the only thought since the word go.

B00006JKOL|4.0|When I am in the mood for Tull, I will usually pull out &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; or &quot;Living in the Past&quot; first. I enjoy all of Tull's albums to one degree or another, but it seems like I will often forget about &quot;Minstrel&quot; and when I do stumble across it I always wonder why I forget about it after my last listen? What's nice about this is that &quot;Minstrel&quot; has not worn out it's welcome by being overplayed like &quot;Aqualung&quot; or &quot;Benefit&quot;. &quot;Minstrel&quot; is a great Tull album for Tull fans. If you are just getting into the band, I would recommend other disks before &quot;Minstrel&quot;. But once you have heard all that Tull offers as a band, you will really appreciate just what a great album this is! &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, the song, may be one of Jethro Tull's greatest songs. From the opening acoustic intro to Martin Barre's blistering guitar work on the song are amazing. And Ian Anderson's vocals are very strong here, and the chorus is so catchy and memorable it will continue running through head. &quot;Cold Winds of Vallhalla&quot; is another hard rocker, that took me a couple listens to get used to, but once I got it into my head, I couldn't get it out! Hammond's drumming is fantastic on this album!! The rest of the disk has a more acoustic feel, and &quot;White Duck&quot; is phenominal. &quot;Baker Street Muse&quot; has been reveiwed here to death, but it too is a very strong Tull song and worth a listen to. You just can't go wrong with 70's Tull!
B00001ZWTT|1.0|Wild Wild West is one of those movies that make you wonder just what were they thinking when this movie was being made.  One thing that is absolutely essential for enjoying a movie is the suspension of disbelief.  That is, you have to be able to believe that what's on the screen could really happen the way that things on the screen are happening.  The things that go on in this movie make that impossible.  Example:  there is a gigantic steam-powered spider.  Even with today's advanced technology, such a contraption would be just about impossible to build and get to operate properly, let alone in 1869.  <br />Once again:  What were they thinking?
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Well, since i see a lot of reviews having already been written for a DVD that hasn't been released yet, I might as well add my own take to this mostly wonderful film.<br />I saw this in the theater many months ago, so some of the film's details may be fuzzy. But the memory of the film's tangle of powerful emotions, as well as its great performances and tragic ending, have remained vivid in my mind.<br />While the destination is devastating and even chilling, the journey itself isn't perfect. For some reason, I never warmed to Clint Eastwood's music score---it sounded like a third-rate Aaron Copland imitation, and it was insufficient at highlighting emotions the way Eastwood clearly intended. I was disappointed that the solution to the mystery of who killed the Markums' daughter was so arbitrary, not to mention arbitrarily handled throughout the film. Yes, I understand that, in the final analysis, the mystery and its solution doesn't truly matter as much as the tangled emotions it arises in its main characters. Still, I found it a small disappointment (although perhaps that same solution is in Dennis Lehane's novel; I wouldn't know, since I, alas, have not read it). As for the subplot involving Sean Devine's wife---who is always silent whenever she calls him until the end---I concede that it is debatable as to whether it serves any justifiable purpose in the film, although I will also admit that I was hardly bothered by it at all while watching it.<br />Maybe that is an indication as to what a powerful film this is cumulatively. Despite the aforementioned missteps, Clint Eastwood gets the big things right: particularly the performances, but also the mood, the texture, and the elucidation of the major themes. Sean Penn may be the more flamboyant actor (not that his sheer power detracts from his performance here at all), but Tim Robbins has the pivotal role as the child abuse-scarred Dave Boyle (it is, the way I see it, the story of Dave's personal tragedy above all else), and he comes through with a heartbreaking performance that is fully worthy of the Best Supporting Oscar he won at this past year's ceremony. In fact, in its overall impact, MYSTIC RIVER was really the best of the five Best Picture Nominees this past year. Certainly it has more authentic humanity than anything in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy (impressive though they were technically, although really the two are not in contention).<br />In short, MYSTIC RIVER may not be perfect, but it is still a great and powerful film, one definitely worth seeing at least once.
B00001U0E1|4.0|Shakespeare in Love is a lot of fun to watch.  However, it is also flawed.  There are major inaccuracies in it.  For instance, if a troop of players did a play for  Queen Elizabeth I of England, it was a special performance at the palace only for the queen and her entourage.  This movie would have you believe that the queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater.  <br />I give it 4 stars out of 5 possible.  There really was no reason why the filmmakers could not have both made a historically accurate film that was also a lot of fun.
B00004W510|5.0|Levon Helm has one of the most honest,passionate voices in pop music and he delivers some of his best vocals on this classic LP. &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, &quot;Across The Great Divide&quot; and &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot; are the best known songs here and they remain popular for a number of reasons, the first of which is Robbie Robertsons vivid lyrics and the almost ramshackle delivery of the Band, on the surface it all sounds loose and unrehearsed, but listen closer and the intricate details and texture reveal themselves. The late Rick Danko delivers the impossibly pretty &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; in his rich, high tenor and provides gorgeous harmonies along with Helm on the Richard Manuel led &quot;When You Awake&quot;. Garth Hudson's flawless organ work and piano on &quot;....Divide&quot; and the juke-joint attack of &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; adds just the right touch of creepy woodsy ambience. A lot of modern listeners won't understand this music because of it's homespun, unpolished feel and the unconventional arrangements, but patience and repeated listens to this seminal masterpiece will be time well spent.
B000059HAI|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! is the single best movie ever made about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  It features excellent performances from such actors as James Whitmore, E.G. Marshall, Jason Robards and Martin Balsam.  The special effects are far more convincing than what's in modern movies.  It also has some of the best movie music of all time.  Best of all, the movie shows the sheer complacency on the U.S. side that enabled the Japanese to successfully mount the surprise attack.  <br />Tora! Tora! Tora! is far superior to any other movie ever made about Pearl Harbor.  In fact, it is one of the absolute best movies ever made about World War II.  It is a classic motion picture in its own right.<br />On a scale of 1 to 5, it really merits a 10.
1563899426|5.0|I've always loved Fairy Tales, but sometimes the ending of those tales just isnt enough. We all want to know what happens after \\"Happily Ever After\\", don't we? This series, in pursuit of that question, has seriously revitalized my love for comics! I love the characters - this work plays upon the well-known and not-so-well-know aspects of faery tales throughout the ages, and then expands, charting favorite characters in a New World, where they've been forced into exile from their Fable homelands. Characters once so different from eachother now must set old grudges aside to join forces and forge a community for themselves amongst ordinary New Yorkers. Some have changed for the better - others...well, as you'll see, they arent exactly the heroes and heroines they used to be. From a Marxist Goldilocks to wild child Rose Red (I was beginning to believe I was the ONLY one who remembered Red Rose!!) - this is NOT your Disney remake! <br />One thing I do like about Fables - its a series for almost everyone. Many comics I've felt to be strongly orientated for either just males or just females, but this has strong characters that capture the interest of both sexes. There's something for everyone here.
0792839730|5.0|The movie version of Cornelius Ryan's book A Bridge Too Far is a fully faithful adaptation of a war classic.  As such, it is a classic in its own right.  The movie includes the planning and execution of the flawed  Operation Market Garden, the largest Allied airborne operation of World War II.  It also includes several of the human interest vignettes from Ryan's book.  The movie is  consistently interesting throughout and is never boring.<br />A true classic.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I loved Mystic River, though I can see how it might not be a movie for everyone.  <br />I have seen a couple of negative comments about the music in Mystic River and I just wanted to add that I love the music.  I am excited that the 3 disc edition will include the soundtrack.  Now I will concede that the music is at times crude and unpolished almost as though Eastwood was speaking from the soul in a language that he couldn't quite articulate.  But I for one still got the message and I thought that the music was haunting.<br />I think that this is a movie that the less you know about it the better you will like it so maybe people that haven't seen it should skip some of these reviews that spell everything out.<br />The really great thing about Mystic River is the way that the tension builds.  Eastwood accomplishes this masterfully by creating very human characters that we care about and by setting mood with location, music, lighting and brilliant performances.<br />I am continually suprised by the negative comments about Mystic River.  When I walked out of the theater I overheard some other movie goers talking about how terrible it was and I was just baffled.  Had they seen the same movie I just saw?  Since then I have read several reviews by people that love great movies that call Mystic River the most over rated movie of the year.  Again I was suprised to read this given the moving personal experience that I had watching this film.  So I guess to be fair I would say that Mystic River is a movie that I very much loved and would highly recommend, BUT...  I would acknowledge that it is a dark, moody film with a somber, open-ended finish and that not everyone will love it as much as I did.
0743454529|5.0|I absolutely, positively loved this book.  I kept putting myself in the shoes of each character and wondering what I would do in a situation like theirs. Anna is displayed as a young girl with a good head on her shoulders and a lot of inner strength and love.  What a refreshing view of a 13 year old girl! I am planning on checking out other books by this author.
B00007BHOE|5.0|I've been a &quot;Maggot&quot; for about a year now. SlipKnot is one of those bands like Metallica, or Iron Maiden that when live, sounds almost identically to the studio version (Well Okay.. Corey's vocals can be a little blabbery at times). Here's how I'd rate the member's performence:<br />0 Sid (Turntable DJ) - Very interactive. He did a very good job. He mooned the crowd. It was cool!<BR>1 Joey (Main Drums) - Stunning... Kick-ass solo!<BR>2 Paul (Bass) - The true pulse of Slipknot!<BR>3 Chris (Custom Percussion) - Custom Percussion has greatly imroved. Good work!<BR>4 James (Guitar) - Not nearly loud enough. But good.<BR>5 Craig (Samples) - Not used as much as I thought. Sid did more.<BR>6 Shawn (Custom Percussion) - Same stats as Chris, Shawn is better though!<BR>7 Mick (Guitar) - Better than James, but the amps were still too friggin' quiet!<BR>8 Corey (Vocals) - Very good. He was enegetic through the whole concert. Really great job!<br />LIVE SONG INTEGRITY:<BR>People = (...)- Very electrifying. 5/5<BR>Liberate - Another good song. 5/5<BR>Left Behind - A favorite off IOWA. 5/5<BR>Eeyore - Heavy as Corey promises. 5/5<BR>Disasterpiece - Another hit. 5/5<BR>Purity - Nicely done. 4.5/5<BR>Gently - Not my favorite, but good. 4/5<BR>Eyeless - My second favorite! 6/5<BR>My Plauge - Iddentical to studio version!

1881273156|3.0|I agree with the reviewer who says this book is \\"helpful but unromantic.\\" I can't express it as well as that review does, but I agree that Chapman is too critical of romantic love. He is also unrealistic about the ability of any two people to create it between them, simply by choice. I read recently the book that review recommends, Solomon's Song of Love, and find, too, that it is a healthier approach to romantic love. I intend to read C.S. Lewis' The Four Loves, too, which was also recommended.
1561007323|5.0|This series is unstoppable. I am referring to the Un-Abridged Audio Cassette Book. What a way to make your commute more enjoyable. I hope Lee Child continues to write in this series. Jack Reecher is the man. I feel as though I connect on a level with this character that I have not experienced with any other series. The writer keeps the reader/listener focused on the main character, he does not jump around as so many writers do these days. You see everything from Jack's perspective. This is good and you must get this NOW.
B00004VWA7|5.0|When i first got interested in bass, I started reading about Jaco Pastorius and I really wanted this album.<br /> Finally, I had the oppurtunity to buy it and I absolutely loved it!  I usually listen to rock, brit rock mostly, but I really enjoyed this record. Jaco Pastorius is definetly the best bassist EVER!
B00020HEG6|5.0|This soundtrack is the best so far. John Williams outdid himself...The music is more varied and more complex than the previous 2 CD's. His use of instruments has expanded and the melodies are reflective of the darker and more powerful themes in Harry Potter #3. I rarely buy soundtracks because there are usally only a few tracks I enjoy, but I recommend this one highly...I plan on playing Double Trouble during Halloween next year...Too bad ther isn't an extended version of that tune!<br />Can't wait to see the movie again after listening to the soudntrack.This is fantastic!!
B0001I55OC|5.0|Was insanely cool! People keep talking down about the movie as if they left in the first hour. It is about 2 hours, and the second hour is amazing.<br />Yes this film is bad, but the action at the end is great. I mean, you can't connect with any character except Merrik or whatever. Honestly, that was the only name I picked up in the entire movie. That and Franceau, but they say his name alot.<br />   ----The sound is incredible----   . I have a pretty good speaker system and it is unbelievable! The castle siege sounds tremendously awesome, and it looks pretty cool when you get trebuchets hurling stones of fire at the castle. If you love sound or if you love great action scenes, i'd rent this movie. If it comes out on DTS, get that immediately.
0385510438|3.0|If I could, I would give this book three and a half stars, but I cannot so therefore I'm going to have to go with my heart and give it three.  John Grisham is quite an author as far as churning out engaging bits of prose goes, and that's what this book is, entertainment.  This doesn't have the characters or catharsis of the Rainmaker, the suspense and adrenaline of The Firm, or the gripping plot of A Time to Kill; the book is pure entertainment, the literary equivalent of a summer movie- it doesn't really go anywhere but it's fun just to enjoy it while it lasts.<br />  Typically I have a short plot description in my reveiws, but that's where I am drawing a blank.  You see, Grisham found a way to traverse over 300 pages without any real semblance of a plot.  This is more a story of 9-years in the life of a particular character, Willie Traynor.  The book is told from his perspective, in the first person, but yet it is missing the human element that was present in one of Grisham's previous 1st-person efforts, the Rainmaker.  Also missing, for the most part, are the humorous asides that protagonist Rudy Baylor made in that novel. Instead, the reader is privy to a dull monlogue of 9 years in Willie Traynor's life.<br />  Fortunately, Willie leads an interesting enough life for me to reccomend the book...he purchases a small-town newspaper in the town of Clanton, Mississipi (which contrary to the advertisements for the novel has been visited since a Time to Kill in &quot;THe Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Summons) and the book revolves around his newspaper, a murder trial in the town, and his relationship with an elderly black woman.<br />  Again, there is nothing groundbreaking here, but if you need some quick entertainment, pick it up.  It's loads better than &quot;The Summons&quot; or &quot;The Partner&quot;...but if you can, borrow it from a friend or wait for paperback, it's short and not good enough to merit seventeen dollars.
1558216847|5.0|A friend that we highly admire recommended this book to my husband and I. Although we read it years ago now, we still frequently mention it when one of us is grumbling about a problem and we brighten up and laugh. This survival story is truly amazing.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|This score has wonderful mixture of all the types of musical dynamics every decent epic should incorperate. Haunting, dramatic, horrorfying, magical, comical, beautiful, emotional, bittersweet, I won't continue (unless you would like me to take up all my thousand word limit). Firstly, I would just like to say a massive thankyou to Howard Shore for this truly beautiful masterpiece. I never tire of the pureness of this music, because it is just so emotional and beautiful. Throughout the 3 brilliant soundtracks, the music itself takes you on a journey.<br />Ok, enough of the mushy stuff (at least for now)!<br />The first Soundtrack covers the main pieces featured in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". This score won the 2001 oscar for Best Original Score. It represents the lighter stories of the film, including the fun at The Shire (\\"Concerning Hobbits\\"), and the havens of Rivendell(\\"Many Meetings\\", \\"Council of Elrond\\"). However it also plays some serious notes, describing the Fellowship's quest, and then the music becomes furious as it conveys Saraman and his blood-oozing orcs. The CD includes two stunning ballads by Enya (\\"Aniron\\", \\"May it Be\\"), who's music has always been closely related to Tolkien. In this you run the risk of sheading a few tears with some emotional twists in pieces including \\"The Bridge of Kazad-dum\\" and \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\", two of my favourite tracks.<br />The soundtrack for \\"The Two Towers\\" takes on a far more serious tone. At this point of the film, all the characters of the film find themselves in hopeless situations, and must rely on friendship, fellowship, and faith to guide them through the darkening days. There is a true element of heroism in this score and is very, very inspiring. Pieces in this fashion include \\"Forth Eorlingas\\", \\"Isengard Unleashed\\", and one of the gems of this soundtrack, \\"Samwise the Brave\\". However, my all-time favourite piece of this CD, and one of my favourites of the entire thing is \\"Evenstar\\" a swooning ballad, who's lyrics are in Elvish (much like many of the Choral instalments). To conclude the CD, is a haunting song called \\"Gollum's Song\\" which has a very unique melody. At first you feel slightly repelled by the piece, but after a listen or two it begins to grow on you. It's an amazing song with powerful lyrics.<br />And finally there is the \\"Return of the King\\", which received 2003's Oscars for Origianl Score, and Best Song. Here, the movie and music wraps up to an electrifying finale. Here, everything could go according to plan, or go disasterously wrong and the fall of all good would be swift and devastating. This is my favourite of the three as it is by far the most emotional. There are ALOT of tear jerkers in this one, including \\"The Black Gate Opens\\", a stunning peace depicting Frodo and Sam's crippling struggle up Mount Doom; \\"Twilight and Shadow\\", a fantastic piece which describes the emotions of the elf Arwen, and \\"The Grey Havens\\" which is a bittersweet, simply moving track, which would have to be one of favourite ultimate favourites of the entire thing. The best track on the CD is \\"The Return of the King\\" (fits doesnt it! :). Here, Shore, constructs a piece of music incorperating most of the differnt music themes of the trilogy: the \\"Fellowship\\" theme, the theme for \\"Gondor\\", beautiful choral themes of the Elves, and the loving melodies of the hobbits. It's a beautiful way to wrap up what has been a wonderful, legenderay and undoubtably heartwrenching adventure each character (and the audience of \\"Lord of the Rings\\") has been on these past three years. It features the flautest Sir James Galway and the singer Renee Fleming. The moving song by Annie Lennox called \\"Into the West\\" is a perfect ending to the 56-track masterpiece. This deservingly won the Oscar for Best Song.<br />In conclusion (OW my fingers are so sore!), these 3 CD's are filled with the best music ever, ever composed and will be remembered for years to come. So much determination and passion has been put into these scores, making the movie experience all the more unforgetable. From heart-lifting to heart-breaking, winner of 3 oscars, the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Soundtrack is by the best score ever created. IMPOSSIBLE TO MATCH! :)
068487217X|5.0|This is the kind of book that you devour so much it is interesting. The words aren't enough to describe such a beautiful story and writing. It is extremely sad but it makes your life like the one of a king afterwards. You won't be able to complaint. It's strong and the only thing to do after you read this wonder, is to grab Tys, the sequel. Also very interesting...
0064407667|4.0|It's difficult to say whether I liked or disliked this book.  Mainly, on the surface, the book seems too unrealistic and ridiculous, but when looking closer, Snicket conveys true, honest feelings and really loves his characters.  He often goes on for a few pages, expressing thoughtful, deep thoughts, that I truly appreciated.  It's funny...at times I find myself thinking that the books are a little too far fetched...but cant find myself putting the books down!  The books appeal is how different it is.  Snickets writing is so original, it is difficult to know what he is thinking most of the time.  What can I say?  The books are so unique...they're addicting!
0920668372|1.0|I recently found this book on one of our bookshelves. As it turns out, my MIL gave it to my husband when he was in his mid-20s. My MIL has always been too intrusive and clingy with my husband and this situation says EVERYTHING about this book.<br />There are a world of books out there that depict the bond between parent and child so much better than this book, ones without a creepy aftertaste. <br />I understand the idea of unconditional love, but this book really unnerves me. I even asked my husband what he thought about it. Turns out, he is really disturbed by the image of the mother who cannot and will not let her son grow up and who slinks into his life.<br />So why does he still have the book? Because of warm feelings about his mom? No. Because it makes him feel loved? No.  Because he wants us to have it for our son? NO! He says he would feel really guilty about getting rid of it although it disturbs him.<br />So this book lives in our house thick with feelings of unease and guilt. Yeah, that sounds like a good children's book.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Truly one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time.  Excellent, positive family entertainment.  Minimal language, no violence, sex, drugs or negative story lines added to give the crowd pleasing 'R' rating.  A definite role model film.<BR>Exciting....kept me bopping in my seat.  The bands are amazing!<BR>Brought back memories of my college days.  <BR>I loved it!!!
B000002I25|4.0|the doors would eventually record much better, more focused music in their career in my opinion.  this is a good album, no doubt; but what has propelled it into musical history is more the mystique of jim morrison himself rather than the sort of &quot;every song on this album is unbelievably good&quot; appeal that other classic albums have.  the doors would release an album or two like that, but what is interesting about this record is how many miles ahead of anything anyone else was doing it was.  this debut album blew a sizable hole through the surf music craze of the mid 60s, despite the handful of filler tracks (&quot;20th century fox,&quot; &quot;soul kitchen&quot;) that accompany a collection of some of the all time great songs that rock music has ever produced (&quot;light my fire,&quot; &quot;break on through,&quot; &quot;back door man,&quot; &quot;alabama song,&quot; and my favorite of all, &quot;the end&quot;).
B0000507QH|5.0|I think you miss the whole point of this movie if you are expecting a typical Hollywood &quot;brainwashing&quot; movie.  This movie is French.  The whole point of the movie is precisely that the woman is not slim and gorgeous like a model (as Hollywood would make you want to believe all woman should be to be desirable to men).  The fact that she is chubby makes the point precisely.  She is not beautiful in his eyes, she is plain and chubby but he is crazy about her, why? because he cannot posses her. (Apart from physical pleasure there is nothing he can give her to make her interested in him.)  And the farther away she is emotionally the more he wants her, and the more obsessed he gets with her.  It has nothing to do with the outer physical beauty --she has managed to possess him in every way, without the &quot;beauty&quot; attributes that Hollywood movies would want to instill in the audiences.  Her character has weaknesses as to the emotional and that is what drives him crazy about her.  This movie is a great awakening into the deeper psyche of men.
B000255LIY|5.0|I was certainly a pleasant surprise that this fast paced (not in action to be sure) intellectual game of intrigue and give and take could keep my solid attention for the full movie. The viewers attention is required to keep track of the plot twists and turns as we see King Henry sparring with his wife Elanor and his three woebegotten sons in the hills of France. <br />The greatest thing about this movie is that it depicts an interpretation of the life and times of King henry II, Richard and of course Prince John, an era that I have always felt were taken hostage by Shakespeare and Arthur and the knights of the round table...... <br />Certainly a great depiction/interpretation of historical value that would, for me in any case, be too troublesome to read. <br />I do give the viewer fair warning without any intellectual snobbery intended. The story is complex and chacrter development is long but thorough .... The action is of course limited and most, if not all the movie takes place on the set of the castle..... Unless you enjoy this type of human chess game, oddds are that you'll walk out after the first half hour ...
B00005JMCW|4.0|This movie was so hilarious!  Jamile Lee Curtis was totally hilarious playing her daughter's character when their bodies got mystically switched.  The best was her making fun of her son had me rolling.  Great fun!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I saw Jack Nicholson's last hyped movie 'Whats the Matter with Harry' or something like that and I was disgusted ... what a dog of a film .... My fears that this would have been the end of that fabulous real life cartoon Nicholson character have been calmed when I saw his perfomance in Something's Gotta Give .... <br />What a pleasant and enjoyable light hearted film poking fun at our modern 'divorce' society. The acting is superb and, contrary to most of the DVD garbage out there today this is a movie that will brighten up whatever rainy and dreary Sunday afternoon that you decide to play it .....
B000002X4T|5.0|This is definitely my favourite Airplane album by far. It's the final in a line of great albums, from Surrealistic Pillow and After Bathing at Baxter's to Crown of Creation. After this, things just weren't the same. 'We can be together' gets a lot of attention, but it's the lesser-known songs that I like most here; Marty Balin's vocal on 'Turn my life down' is just great, it's a perfect perky sixties morning tune to contrast with the darker material elsewhere. This was his last truly great vocal, the horrors of 'Miracles' were just around the corner! <br />Of course Grace Slick shines as usual, her 'Hey Frederik' conjures up images of Vietnam without being cliched - '...one more pair of loving eyes look down on you...' I also love 'Eskimo Blue Day' which also tackles environmentalism without resorting to treacly lyrics. By the way the live version on the Woodstock soundtrack is even better (even if she was so off her head from the night before's excesses)<br />Jorma Kaukonen shines here too, his version of 'Good Shepherd' is something he was born for, and of course Jack Casady's bass pumps and grinds throughout the album.<br />The centrepiece is 'Wooden Ships' which showcases the whole band's talents in one. The whole buildup and the way Marty, Grace and Paul's vocals twist around each other over Jorma's awesome guitar and Jack's bass with Spencer Dryden's great drumming underneath -is just brilliant, I think CSN &amp; Y could never match this version. <br />I even like Spencer Dryden's 'A song for all seasons' - it's meant to be tongue-in-cheek but it kind of chronicles the band's breakup (the following year Dryden and Balin were gone).  <br />The whole war theme is completed with the spacy 'Meadowlands' fading into the title track.<br />I don't know why people hate this album, the venom should be saved for the patchy 'Bark' which followed.
B000001OAA|5.0|I've had this cd for a long time now, obviously, but thought I would right a review since its one of my favorite cds. It really is worth the money, and I guarantee you'll enjoy it. Shirley Manson ( lead singer) is really something. All the songs of this disk bring something different, and all rock. Of course the most popular songs, \\"Stupid girl\\", and \\"only happy when it rains\\", are great, but try listening to all the other stand out tracks from the cd. ie: \\"Supervixon\\", \\"Queer\\", \\"Vow\\", and \\"Milk\\". Really is a great cd. One of Garbage's best so far!
0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my absolute favorite authors of all time. I was excited when &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; came out. Somehow I knew that it would be as good as the Shopaholic series. And I was right! It was a fantastically funny and touching read.<br />The main character, Emma Corrigan, is your normal 25-year old and somewhat-insecure woman. She is trying to get a promotion at work, has a fantastic boyfriend, and is very happy with life, or so she thinks. On an extremely turbulent flight back from a business trip from Glasgow, Emma's secrets unwillingly spill out to a total stranger next to her. She ends up telling this handsome American stranger nearly every secret she has, and then some. When the plane lands, she is embarrassed but figures she'll never see him again.<br />When this American stranger ends up being the owner at her job, Emma is mortified and determined to act like nothing happened. But Jack, the American stranger, has other ideas. Emma seems to have touched him in some way. And Emma, who thought she was totally happy with her perfect boyfriend, starts to wonder. <br />I recommend everyone to read &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; by Sophie Kinsella. It will keep you turning page after page until you finish it; Emma is a delightfully imperfect heroine that many can identify with. Make sure not to miss this fantastic book! Now if Sophie Kinsella can just write books faster...
B000002NJS|4.0|This cd takes you to another era of Madonna. It may not sound like any other of her albums, but trust me, that's not a bad thing, cause this cd is just as good! You'll love the electric guitars used on the tracks, and the mixes are brilliant! Madonna's voice also sounds amazing on this cd, since she had finished Evita before this, and had some voice lessons.<br />This cd is very special, and if you're not a Madonna fan take a chance on this cd, cause its different u'll probably love it! It truly tells a story!
B00006AW2P|4.0|This the American debut album of the group that now is known as the Greatest Rock Band in the World (which they clearly deserve, by the way), and it is indeed a great album.. It is easy to see why the Stones got so popular, as they are the total opposite of the Beatles' lighter and cleaner rock'n'roll - and I'm not saying that as a negative comment on the Beatles, I love them, I'm just stating facts. <br />This is a blues record, filled with fast-rocking songs like \\"Route 66\\" and \\"Carol\\", together with slower, but equally great, ones like \\"I'm A King Bee\\" and \\"Honest I Do\\". And I must say it is amazing how the Stones at such a young age almost reach the level of their idols, like Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. Despite their youth (they were all in their early 20's when making this record) all of the songs, in all their dirtiness and honesty, sound very adult and mature. The passion they were feeling for these songs really shine through, and its wonderful when you encounter artists with such affection for their material. And the band also plays remarkably well together, like they have been together for years. Just listen to how Charlie Watts (drums) and Bill Wyman (bass) already are on their way to creating a unique rhythm section in rock'n'roll, or the magnificent guitar weaving between Keith Richards and Brian Jones. And although you can sense the youth in Mick Jagger's voice, he stills sounds very provoking and sexy. The harmonica playing, split up between Jones and Mick Jagger, also deserves an honorable mention, since it is nothing short of great.<br />The songs listed from best to worst:<br />Route 66 -- 10/10<BR>I'm A King Bee -- 9/10<BR>Carol -- 9/10<BR>Honest I Do -- 9/10<BR>Not Fade Away -- 8/10<BR>Tell Me -- 8/10<BR>Can I Get A Witness -- 8/10<BR>Little By Little -- 8/10<BR>You Can Make It If You Try -- 8/10<BR>Walking The Dog -- 8/10<BR>I Just Want To Make Love To You -- 7/10<BR>Now I've Got A Witness -- 7/10<br />Rated on a song to song basis, this albumreceives an 8.3 out of 10 rating from me. As a whole, it receives a 9 out of 10 rating.
B000002LND|5.0|This cd contains all of, or most of Madonna's greatest hits from the early 80's to 90's. You're sure to find ur favorite songs of hers on here. Also includes two tracks not included on any other cd of hers, which are &quot;Justify my love&quot; (which Lenny Kravitz worked on, and its amazing), and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (great song). This is a MUST for your collection!!!!!
B00005Y1UX|5.0|This movie is definitely a treasure, beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, its the kind of movie that stays with you.  I can't say much about the movie that hasn't already been said except that I recommend the soundtrack also, the movie score is excellent.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I am no movie experte. I just can tell you I liked this movie, a lot. It is a sweet fantasy tale of love and of a son having the chance to reconcile with his father before he dies. My daughter (11) also loved it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|People should stick to reviewing the film and not spue forth their ignorance by saying things like Jesus never existed.Tell Him that when you meet Him on Judgment Day.The movie is magnificent on every level.Violence was not gratuitous but was necessary to show the greatness of Christ's love for us and how He willingly offered His life out of obedience to the Father.<BR>A masterpiece over the heads of so many of our psuedo intellectuals
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet's debut album \\"GET BORN\\" is one for any Garage Rock/AC/DC/Beatles/Stones/Who fans. They have everything from slow mellowish tracks like, \\"Look What You've Done\\" - a homage to classic piano/vocal songs of the Beatles, to \\"Lazy Gun\\" - which brings a melloish-kind of psychadelic feel to the song. More reviews:<BR>Last Chance / the opener. 3/5 because it's not their best song of course, but it has a good rythem<BR>Are You Gonna Be My Girl? 5/5 /EVERYONE has heard this song in one way or another. whether it be from the iPOD commercial, or the radio this song is the highlight of the album (this and Cold Hard B****)<BR>Rollover D.J 5/5 /I love this song, a good follow-up to Are You Gonna Be My Girl? It's a good little song to jam too<BR>Look What You've Done 4/5 /A VERY Beatles homage song, if you listen to it, and wouldn't know who the artist of the song was, you'd think it was an old Beatles tune. Amazing<BR>Get What You Need 3/5 /Not their best. I think they ran out of ideas when they got to this song. I think it shows their instrumental skills, still a good song<BR>Move On 4/5 /A where the album picks back up. A good song to listen to in a \\"let-down\\" mood. <BR>Radio Song 3/5 /This song gets a little repetative after a while, so it gets 3/5. I used to like it, but it grew out of me<BR>Get Me Outta Here 5/5 /From here to the end the album gets REALLY good. I love this song \\"I went down to the Duke 10 time a day\\" the vocals in the song are great.<BR>Cold Hard B**** 5/5 /This is the ULTIMATE highlight of the album. This song proves where they get their roots from. The Stones, Beatles, The Who and all the great rock 'n roll/Garage Rock bands. From their instrument parts, until they cut to Nick Cesters lead vocals when he goes a capella \\"Gotta leave town got another appointment. Spent all my rent girl you know I enjoyed it.\\" Then leads into their awesome music skills, this is the BEST song on the album.<BR>Come Around Again 3/5 /A slowish song, another one but even theirslow songs are great.<BR>Take It Or Leave It 4/5 /An AC/DC inspired (IMO) song. Another hard rock garage song on the album.<BR>Lazy Gun 5/5 /A VERY mellowish-60's rock 'n roll inspired song. This song is so awesome it's just great. I love listeining to this song.<BR>Timothy 3/5 /A weird song, takes you a while to figure out WHAT they are singing to or of. Not a good closer to the album, but it's still good.<br />All in All, JET - GET BORN is an AWESOME debut album for them. I listen to it EVERYDAY, ever since I bought it. A MUST HAVE for any rock 'n roll/Garage Rock Band.<br />Album rating: 10.10<br />BUY IT. NOW!!
0451528956|3.0|I've never read a novel or novella where there is so little of actual story as there is Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde; where there is so little done with such an amazing idea.  The story consists mainly of a few rumors and incidents and annecdotes that are all tied together by the &quot;full statement of the case&quot; at the end, and that's it.  For one thing I think this sparseness contributes to the eeriness of the story.  The book reads more like a police report that a horror story, leaving Mr. Hyde to lurk almost unseen in the shadows of its pages.  For another thing I think that this book has been popular through the years and passed through so many incarnations and popped up in so many different forms precisely because Stevenson did so little with Mr. Hyde.  It was like he left a blueprint for other writers to come along and fully explore the ramifications of this book's intriquing premise.
B00024BHTC|5.0|This album is totally excellent, perhaps the change of the genre of their music, their songs are completely great.<br />1. Dark Chest Of Wonders.- a great opening for the album \\"Once\\", those choruses in the back, and the voice of Tarja/Marco is great, possibly one of the best songs in the album. 5/5<br />2. Wish I Had An Angel.- one of the greatest songs on the album, their next single for the movie \\"Alone in the Dark\\". 5/5<br />3. Nemo.- when will they ever stop doing so great beautiful, enchanting, videos and songs? This song is totally a hit for this album. 5/5<br />4. Planet Hell.- This song is sung by Marco too with Tarja, and has cool effects, you can listen the change of genre very well... 5/5<br />5. Creek Mary's Blood.- A Native American / American Indian and a multi-instrumentalist called Mr John Two-Hawks performs a great song, together with Tarja's Voice. Great long song. 5/5<br />6. The Siren.- This song rocks! Heavier than others, with great composition. 5/5<br />7. Dead Gardens.- You can appreciate how great this song is from the beggining to the end. 5/5 You better listen the entire album.<br />8. Romanticide.- I'm getting tired of cataloging the entire album a five star one, but this song is not the exception. Great job nightwish! 5/5<br />9. Ghost Love Score.- The longest song in the entire album, 4/5.<br />10. Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan.- A song that is way light...\\"Josta kuolema teki minusta taiteilijan\\"...4/5<br />11. Higher Than Hope.- The weakest song in the album, every album has their point...3/5<br />But this album no matter what you do or want, this is sure a great buy for you to have. NIGHTWISH RULES!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The rating is more like 2.5 stars, but who's counting.  The main reason I didn't get or like this movie is because I've never been to Japan.  I can't feel for the characters because I don't know the culture, which I get that they don't either, but it still just didn't work for me.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is hot! I love Avril's lirics because almost anyone can relate to her songs. She is my role model and I love all her work. I love this album and you will too!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|i really liked the first 2 slipknot cds. they were very very hard and heavy. i also didnt mind the stone sour cd, it was cool, a little differant. so when the new slipknot cd came out, i was excited, after hearing the band say it was their best work yet. i bought it, and man did i feel lied to. i dont think i would have minded it so much had they just wrote stone sour on the cd cover. but to put out a mellow, fairly lighter end rock cd under the name of a band known for good hardcore stuff, just feels like being lied to. i was very dissappointed with this album, and think that slipknot should have called it quits after iowa.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|This stylish film is one of Otto Preminger's best. The French New Wave has influenced him in his opening shots, but only on a visual level. This is pure Hollywood on ever other level.  The melding of the two styles works perfectly and begins by setting  the stark mood in stunning black and white widescreen shots of 1958 Paris. The present is painted in shades of grey and silver, where Cecile portrayed by the beautiful Jean Seberg moves aimlessly thought her pointless upper crust Parisian life. Only when she encounters her father David Niven later in the evening does the past seep in on the edges of the cinemascope frame in vivid color and finally takes over moving us from the present to last summer on the Riviera. The device is used several times as we move from past to present and finally at the end of the film it creates a stunning effect once you know what suddenly happened to Cecile and her father last summer. The thing that changed everything forever and allows Preminger's camera to linger in the last frame of the film on Jean Seberg as she wipes away the make-up from her perfect face.<br />  David Niven is perfectly cast as Raymond the aging (...) father of Cecile. He has the cool style and humor of a man who can't commit to any woman and treats his daughter like a playmate rather than his child. His particular talents as an actor are that he seems to be playing the  &#34;David Niven&#34; character in most of his films but here in `Bonjour' as he often does in so many roles he makes a nice little twist on the &#34;character&#34;. He catches you off guard to wrench his and the audiences emotions and prove once again what a good actor he is.<br />  At first Deborah Kerr also seems to be playing her role by rote but it is just a ruse to set us up for her fall.  As does Niven she too digs deeper in to her persona as Anne Larson and carries the film to its surprise ending.  She is a joy to watch as a film actress and here she is particularly wonderful.<br />  The French actress Mylene Demongeout is delightful as Elsa, Ramon's summer plaything. She is in fact `Brilliant!&#34; in the role.<br />  Geoffrey Horne is decorative and serviceable in his role as Cecile's beau who awakens her (...) .<br />  Jean Seberg who with her short cropped spiked hair in certain shots reminded me of Sharon Stone has that kind of blonde goddess look that Miss Stone possesses.

B0000JCFPE|2.0|BASIC INSTINCT is easily the most over-rated film of the 90's.  I didn't like it in 1992, and watching the full uncut DVD version in 2004 I still feel the same.<br />BASIC INSTINCT tries to be a Hitchcock type film in many ways.  Firstly, it has an annoying 'suspense' music score that plays throughout the film even when a scene doesn't warrant it.  Next, the film reveals the killer but attempts to leaves you wondering if he/she is the real killer.  The problem with BASIC INSTINCT is that it is so obvious that Sharon Stone is the killer. Not that we really care, afterall the storyline is so sleazy, that you feel no empathy for any of the characters. <br />The film relied on lots of erotic images to sell the film, and there is a reason for that.  The Director must have realised from the begining that it was very ordinary storyline, and needed something to make it appealing.  Problem solved: include lots of erotic images and a naked Sharon Stone ... and people will go to and see it for that alone. Clever marketing.<br />DVD SUMMARY:  Basic Instinct has been released three times now on DVD, its first release way back in 1997.  The version I saw was the second version which sports a DTS soundtrack, and some interesting special features.  These include a &quot;comparison with TV and Uncut version&quot;, and a documentary on the &quot;making of&quot; which reveals the problems that plagued the film set in San Fran.  The DVD copy I have has a very soft film print which I would consider similar to VHS quality (it's that bad), however it is in Widescreen (five points for that).
0060730552|5.0|If you want to read a book that will capture your interest from page 1 and keep you reading day and night, I suggest that Touching the Void by Joe Simpson is the book for you. This book is action-packed with adventure, danger, and a story of friendship that survives life and the possibility of death.  It is a story that will involve you with the lives of two mountain climbers in the Peruvian Andes.  You will experience the intense emotions of these two young men as they climb through fear, physical trauma, depression, and hopelessness.<BR> Joe Simpson and his partner Simon Yates successfully climb a 21,000 foot peak in the Andes mountains and on their decent they are faced with a serious accident as one falls and breaks his leg. The two continue to struggle down the mountain until they are separated as Joe falls into a crevasse.  Fear and despair affect both of them.  Joe awoke after a night in the crevasse, \\"All that sobbing and shouting had been too much. Acceptance seemed better.  There was no trauma this way.  I was certain then that Simon would leave me for dead.\\" Simon also faced desperation the next day, \\"I had never felt so wretchedly alone. I could not have won, and began to understand the reason for my dreadful sense of condemnation in the snow cave.\\"<BR> The book is filled with incredible description and detail about mountain climbing and its effects on the human body. It is an adventure story not only about two men's struggle against the physical conditions but it is also about the inner struggle to somehow survive fear and desperation.  Both men are required to use their internal strength to overcome the conditions in which they find themselves.  This is a book that will engage you from the beginning and will take you on an amazing journey where you will experience excitement, fear, terror, sadness, and eventual relief. This is a story not to be missed.
0385484518|5.0|What if you could learn all of life's lessons early in life?  Do you think you would be better off?  A better person more in touch with your emotional side?<br />Mitch Albom got this chance and told his story in his memoir he called \\"his final thesis.\\"  Tuesdays with Morrie is Albom's story describing his weekly Tuesday visits to his college professor's house, except it is over fifteen years after he has graduated from college and his professor is on his death bed with ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gherig's disease.  <br />Each week they discuss different topics, including the world, death, the fear of aging, family, emotions, forgiveness, money, regrets, feeling sorry for yourself, how love goes on, marriage, our culture, and a perfect day.  Each week Albom moves closer to learning life's true values and lessons.  Throughout the memoir are flashbacks of Albom's college years and also important factual information relevant to the weekly message.<br />Albom learns to care and changes his life so it doesn't revolve around money, material possessions, and work.  Instead, he learns to value love, family, relationships, and the life he was given.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a touching, eloquent, and enjoyable book to read.  It is something everyone should experience, when only few receive the opportunity to.  I've never read anything more moving and truth than Tuesdays with Morrie.
0609610570|1.0|I picked up this book with high hopes.  But it is totally obvious.  For starters remember that CEO stands for CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.  The CEO is CEO because he/she knows something about how to execute.  Yet the authors state:  &quot;Execution is not only the biggest issue facing  business today;  it is something nobody has explained satisfactorily.&quot;  While this book may be helpful for some, I found it too basic to be of any value.
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is captivating from beginning to end, and makes an extroidonary airplane flight, bedtime, or long car trip read.  <br />It begins with the somewhat unorthodox religious practices and schoolyard rememberences of a young boy named Piscine (later shortened to Pi, for obvious reasons).  During this part of the book, a concerning quality can be observed about Martel's writing... That, though religion is interesting sometimes, it must be sustained throughout to have any meaning.  Pi finds good parts about many religions, and practices them all to an extent.  However, the connotations about these religious practices fall off dramatically when the main plot arises.  I wonder if these notions may have been better to leave out.<br />But, writing styles aside, not since Mutiny on the Bounty have I read such a good sea adventure.  When the ship Pi is riding on from India sinks, a managerie of animals and he cling to a lifeboat for safety.  A brutal epic of survival follows, pitting man against tiger, man against the sea, and tiger against everything else.  Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that so happens to fall into Pi's lifeboat, becomes an integral part of the story for many reasons.  Well, he would have to be, in such close quarters with a scrawny Indian boy, on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific.  The middle of this book, the tale of Pi and Richard Parker's sea hardships and adventures, is the most captivating writing I've seen in a while.  Keep an eye out for the part when Pi reaches the island of algea... wacky!<br />The conclusion is a little concerning.  Martel brings back the religious references a tad, but the audience is torn between two different accounts of the happenings of Pi and his Tiger.  However, in true sea adventure fashion, the audience is ultimately left with a sense of happy completion.  Go get this book and read it, it's well worth it!
B00006J3WH|4.0|When I first watched this episode, I had no idea what was coming. Seeing the different credits, my thoughts were along the lines of 'what the heck!' Then as Buffy started singing, I sort of winced. Not that she was all that bad or anything, but I have to admit my confidence in Joss and the cast wavered. I wasn't convinced that they could pull off an entire episode like this.<br />Was I ever wrong! This is just one more stand-out episode in a series famous for being creative in its presentation, like 'Hush' for example. I shouldn't have doubted. <br />I'm sure this will get some people's noses out of joint. But this is better than 90% of my extensive broadway collection. So either Joss Whedon is a genius surrounded by incredible talent, or broadway composers, and singers are overrated. I suspect the truth may lie somewhere in the middle, but I'm guessing it's closer to the former than the latter.<br />And sure, if you've seen the episode it helps put things in context. Ditto anything else out there. Still, it is remarkably coherent in it's theme and execution. As for the extra pieces included, most of them were pieces I'd wanted anyway.<br />If you liked the episode, or even just Buffy, I strongly recommend this. If you're going to become appoplectic if someone not associated with Broadway can turn out a really great musical....this might not be for you.
0060977493|5.0|I have to admit, I stopped after 60 pages, and started over, and I was extremely glad I did.  Something told me there was a gem here.  Yes, her writing style is very different, but easy and rewarding once you get in gear with her.  However, it wasn't just the different writing style that captured me, it was also the content, and the way that content was presented.  <br />Because of this book, I recently decided to read a bit more about India, in An Obedient Father, by Akhil Sharma.  Folks, there is a huge difference here, and one that matters.  Having read An Obedient Father created for me a serious contrast that I didn't previously appreciate.  Roy can creatively describe difficult circumstances without the gratuitous indecency of Sharma's writing, and still get the point across easily if not better.  Though Roy may be &quot;young&quot; as an author, her work is much more mature than Sharma's.  If you wish to read about India, this is a great one.

It also has footage of the WWF Hall Of Fame ceremony as well as pre-match and post-match comments from John Cena, Christian, RVD, Booker T., Molly and others.<br />Disc 3 is the one that makes this a keeper! WWE Films presents &quot;The Mania Of WrestleMania.&quot; It is a look back at WrestleMania 19 narrated by none other than Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura! This mini documentary will both amaze and entertain but some of the details (particularly behind the Rock/Austin match) will shock you! Also, &quot;The Ten Best WrestleMania Matches&quot; special is on here too. It was narrated by &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair! Also, WrestleMania trivia, photos and gallery are featured as well!<br />The card itself isn't that great but the extras mentioned, particularly on disc 3, MORE THAN MADE UP FOR IT! Get this set just for those specials alone!
B0000W5J0E|3.0|A woman in paramilitary garb stands over a kneeling male prisoner.  She's a soldier whose nation is threatened by the prisoner's allies.  He has information about an attack his people are planning against her more technologically and economically advanced society.  The soldier's commander needs her to &quot;soften up&quot; the prisoner so they can find out the details of the attack.<br />The prisoner knows he is going to die in this interrogation cell, but he doesn't mind, because his people's uprising will bring down the &quot;superpower&quot; of his supposedly more civilized captors.<br />The prisoner refuses to talk.  So this soldier, who has always thought of herself as the protector of her people, tortures him.  Without a moment's hesitation.  She repeatedly twists the prisoner's wounded shoulder until the pain makes him talk.<br />This isn't a digital movie from a prison in Iraq, it's the horror film Underworld.  The soldier is Selene, a vampiric &quot;death-dealer&quot; torturing a Lycan (werewolf) prisoner.  The vampires and Lycans have been fighting for centuries and now use guns that shoot deadly silver and ultraviolet light (sunlight) at each other.<br />Watching Underworld proves one thing - -  what's going on in the world at the time you see a movie determines what you see in it.<br />Underworld is more interesting than I thought it would be.  For one thing, the special effects and makeup are more believable than the cartoonish CGI in movies like The Hulk, Spider-Man, and Van Helsing.  (Speaking of Van Helsing, Kate Beckinsale should take a break from vampire movies.  She's a very good actor.  See Laurel Canyon and Cold Comfort Farm.)<br />After the vampires' equivalent of James Bond's Q designs the gun that shoots molten silver to use against the werewolves, Selene practices with it by shooting busts of William Shakespeare at the firing range.  As the liquid silver flows down Shakespeare's cheek, it looks like he's crying.<br />The film might be saying that this decadent vampire society, which sees itself as more intellectual, more cultured, more &quot;human&quot; than the sewer-dwelling Lycans, has rejected  everything that makes civilization (and therefore themselves) worth preserving.  Or the film might be saying &quot;Old Europe&quot; and its culture aren't relevant any more - - bring on the guns and Armageddon.  Or it might be that the screenwriter was forced to take a boring Shakespeare class in high school and this is his revenge.<br />It doesn't matter what the makers of Underworld and a lot of other movies in the last decade meant to say.  What they have said to a generation is that previously accepted rules of behavior are &quot;inoperative&quot; if they inconvenience us.  Individuals have always tortured and committed atrocities.  But if atrocity is condoned by our leaders, supposedly in a good cause, the world will turn (as Anthony Burgess warned us) quite horrorshow.saying that this decadent vampire society, which sees itself as more intellectual, more cultured, more &quot;human&quot; than the sewer-dwelling Lycans, has rejected  everything that makes civilization (and therefore themselves) worth preserving.

B0001XAOL6|5.0|When Ali was released in 2001 it received decidedly mixed reviews. While Will Smith was praised for his impressive physical transformation into legendary boxer Muhammed Ali, the film itself was criticized for revealing nothing new about the man. Herein lies the problem that Michael Mann and company faced: how do you shed new light on one of the most documented historical figures of the 20th Century? Like he did with The Last of the Mohicans, Mann has revisited Ali again on DVD with a new cut of the film. He's taken out approximately 20 minutes of footage and put 30 minutes of previously unseen footage back in. The effect? Hard to tell unless you've seen the film many times but Mann claims that the politics of the times are more the focus this time around.<br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Michael Mann. He does an excellent job of putting the film into its historical context. The director clearly did his homework and points out who everyone is and the significance of the events depicted in the movie which is a nice consideration for viewers not familiar with this particular period of time. This is an extremely informative track and Mann contributes many very thoughtful observations over the course of the movie.<br />\\"The Making of Ali\\" is a 29-minute featurette that originally aired on HBO. It is slightly better than your average electronic press kit and features some decent on the set footage and interview sound bites with Mann and various members of the cast.<br />Ali eschews the traditional docudrama for a more impressionistic take on the man and life. Mann's film may not say anything new about the famous boxer, but it does depict an exciting ten years of his life in a masterful and richly evocative fashion. This DVD features an excellent transfer of the movie with an aggressive 5.1 surround soundtrack and is definitely worth purchasing for Mann fans for his audio commentary alone.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Homer Wells has lived in St. Clouds orphanage/ abortion clinic/ hospital all his life.  An everlasting orphan with no family except Dr. Larch - who expects Homer to become a doctor just like him - he's never questioned the outside world.  Until Candy and Wolly come for an abortion, and end up taking him back to their town with them, changing his world forever.  <br />He comes across Mr. Rose and his daughter - Rose Rose and the rest of the apple picking crew.  Within time, Homer can see that the innocent world he thought exsisted is anything but, filled with insest, abortions, and love.  As Candy and Homer fall in love, Dr. Larch tries to reach Homer and make him come home, until he realizes that Homer has been &quot;lost to the world&quot;.<br />A beautiful movie, filled with lessons of what is right and wrong, love and hate, and an overall feeling of family at the end of the day.  Maguire is excellent as young Homer, and Micheal Caine gives one of his best performances.  Chalize Theron also shines as the insecure Candy, who must decide between Homer and Wolly.  Definetly worth seeing over and over again, a true American Classic.

6305127646|5.0|The folks who made this flick deserve credit. They cleverly decided to create a modern prequel to the classic character of The Saint. They didn't just ditch the character and steal the name. This isn't I SPY folks. This film IS The Saint. The modern prequel approach let them introduce a whole new audience to The Saint, but it also gave established Saint fans (like me) a rare glimpse at a part of Simon's life that I'd been wondering about for years: just how he got to be The Saint.<BR>This is a great film!
B0001VTPWM|3.0|When Robocop was release in Malaysia, it was a hit. I enjoyed the movie (and at that time, I don't even know who is Paul Verhoeven) a lot. Title maybe corny, but what makes a hit is the story involve and the violence.<br />Years later, two sequels came (Robocop 2 was a more action packed oriented without direction rather than the 1st movie while Robocop 3 was an excuse of making a sequel of the sequel) by and I have watched both with dissapointment. And I never thought the movie was written what used to be my favorite comic book writer Frank Miller. Dissapointment it is.<br />Well, comes the DVD Robocop Trilogy set. And yes, I bought it with curious reasons because its cheap. After viewing the classic, this is one edition that you have to get because you can't find a Director's Cut version of 2 scenes that was editted out because its VERY VIOLENT. Plus the 4 deleted scenes, 3 featurettes, storyboards & more is what gives the classic worth paying for, even though Robocop 2 & 3 suck.<br />But to buy all 3 together with the price that is given? I'll buy that for a dollar... well, if only it is for a dollar.<br />Only for the fun of enjoying the cult hit series.
6304711905|4.0|This is a fun movie.  Kurt Russell is dead-on as a wiley Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer steals every scene he appears in as Doc Holliday.  Bill Paxton is good as Wyatt's brother Morgan. Is there anyone that looks better under a cowboy hat than Sam Elliot?  He plays brother Virgil Earp.  Not so much a true narrative as a series of vignettes featuring the above characters (with the centerpiece Shootout at the OK Corral) the film is nonetheless a very entertaining look at these characters.  Powers Boothe is menacingly bad as Curly Bill, the leader of the outlaw Cowboys.<br />Kilmer's Doc Holliday, in particular, is a load of fun. &quot;I'm your Huckleberry&quot; he taunts Johnny Ringo, and although I have no idea where this saying originated, Kilmer repeats it in this film to entertaining effect.  Later on he is asked why he sticks his neck out for Sheriff Earp.  &quot;Wyatt Earp is my friend&quot;, he replies simply.  The other man scoffs &quot;I've got LOTS of friends&quot;.  &quot;I don't&quot; says Doc.<br />This is the kind of movie that perpetuates the &quot;Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, but it's also the kind of movie that grown men still quote liberally with big smiles on their faces more than a decade after it's initial release.

B00005ASGG|5.0|John Wayne was never more of a tough cowboy than in this John Ford Masterpiece, Pilgrim, and James Stewart was never more the aw-shucks embodiment of educated idealism.  Together they are rivals for Vera Miles, but they are also united against the outlaw who terrorizes the territory, Lee Marvin's Liberty Valance.  Marvin is almost over the top as the evil Valance, but that is sort of the point - that he is a man universally recognized as evil.  The question isn't &quot;is Liberty Valance bad?&quot; but rather which approach is more appropriate to combat him - fighting fire with fire (as exemplified by John Wayne's Tom Doniphon, the only man in the territory who is not intimidated by Liberty Valance) or whether &quot;law and order&quot; should prevail, as personified by Mr. Stewart's newly arrived Eastern Lawyer, Ransom Stoddard.  The first time I saw this film the way that this central conflict was resolved surprised me - one of the biggest &quot;twists&quot; in the Western genre.<br />In my humble opinion it wasn't until Clint Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven&quot; that another Western even approached the stature of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.
0743201140|4.0|The main theme of this book centers around the fact that we focus so much on our weaknesses that we sometimes don't realize what our strengths are.  Essentially, our strengths are usually neglected, while we work to correct our obvious weaknesses.  As the title states, this book will help you identify your strengths via a strengthfinder Profile that you take over the internet. (You will receive a identification number that allows you access to the Strengthfinder Profile) This Web-based interview analyzes your answers and then presents you with your five most powerful signature themes.  Once your themes have been identified, you can then utilize the book to show you how to most effectively work utilizing those identified strengths. Equally important, reading this book will help you gain an understanding of other people's strengths as well.  This alone could make you a more effective team member. The book's purpose is to help both your individual development and your managerial development if applicable.  This book shows how a total of 34 dominant &quot;themes&quot; can best be translated into personal and career success.  You will learn a lot about yourself by completing the Strengthfinder Profile.  That, alone, is well worth your time. Yet, the book is a tremendous compliment to the profile. Where else can you receive the opportunity to identify your strengths and then learn to use those strengths effectively?

B00006CXSS|5.0|I don't read non-fiction as a rule, but after seeing this mini series (really an eleven hour movie) I was truely compelled to read the work and learn more. What was truely suprising was that there wasn't really anything more in the book, they really managed to put it all on screen. You never really understand what war is like without living it, but when you see something like this you can at least grasp a bit more of it. Unlike Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, etc. This story is of the unit not a few people. There's no one person carring the narative, no BS story of the Bad Commander VS the Good Commander, no Private Gommer on the can eating a shotgun blast, no Tom Hanks dying ever-so-sadly to save a guy who doesn't want to be saved. This is just the truth, the reality is more drama than hollywood can dream up, it's more frightening than anything esle to.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a Buffy and Angel fan for years but was never able to watch Firefly because of the time and day it was on and VCR issues that have finally been resolved.  I bought the DVD set looking for something different and have watched every episode at least twice so far.  <P>My boyfriend can not stand Joss Whedon shows at all.  He hates both Buffy and Angel.  He gave them a chance but does not like them at all.  I tricked him into watching the pilot of Firefly by not telling him who made it.  Now he loves it.  He made me leave it at his house so he could finish watching it.  <P>Joss Whedon is a great story teller and Firefly was a wonderful outlet for his talent.  The greatest hope that I have is that they make a movie or two and then get it back on the air.
B00006CXXU|1.0|This album is really nothing special, but it's packaged to appear to be an epic album.  It's not a full-length listen, none of the songs are all that great, and the album is disjointed and lacks flow.  The best of the worst is &quot;Walk Away,&quot; but even that gets old after a while.  I suggest you skip over this album because it's overrated and pretty crappy overall.  People calling this a &quot;masterpiece&quot; are incredibly delusional!  Download &quot;Walk Away&quot; and be done with it.

B0000029AL|5.0|There may never be as fantastic a debut release by any musicians in the entrie history of music.  From beginning to end this CD is totally grade A.  Not a single weak track on it.  Aerosmith came of of the gate swinging and showed all of rock and roll how it is done right.  This CD is a requirement for anyone who wants the important works in the history or the genre'.  Bottom line is that it rocks.
0743454529|3.0|Jodi Picoult bravely writes a touching story about a very controversial subject matter with her new book \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". 13-year-old Anna comes to the realization that she was born with specific genetic characteristics, and has been used for them her whole life, for the sole purpose of saving her older sister's life. Now...she wants control of her own life. <br />I saw tremendous potential in this book, and even felt like it could have been a great story, but the problem I had was that it just never lived up to what I thought it could be. I really felt like the ending was a terrible cop-out so that the author would not have to make a decision that some of her readers wouldn't have liked. Show us the consequences of the girls having to live with their final decision! Also, did every single chapter have to end with an emotional one-liner? \\"Daddy can't go to hell, he'd put out all the fires there.\\" \\"I'm straightening my room now in case I don't come back from the hospital.\\" It would have been really effective if she had done it only 2 or 3 times over the course of the book. Anna is an amazing lead character, but is any 13 year old that smart and that deep as a person (quoting court cases to a lawyer to establish precedence, for example)? Further, I did not need the lawyer/child advocate love story either - rather than add depth to the story, it merely took away from the book's main theme. <br />I did, however, really enjoy the lawyer explaining his service dog (\\"Judge\\") in so many different ways every time he was asked about it. It provided nice and effective comic relief. <br />I wanted to like the novel more and really felt it could have been incredible. I was even pulling for the author to hit me with an amazing ending to put the icing on the cake. I would actually bump this book up to 3.5 stars if I could, but it just never quite made it to greatness level.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I know a lot of people who reviewed this album are saying, &quot;It's not vintage Pearl Jam,&quot; or, &quot;The songs suck because they're slow!!!&quot;  That's complete and utter BS.  Pearl Jam's talent really comes through in this album.  Mike McCready's beguiling guitar work will make you gasp in amazement because some of the guitar work is absolutely unbelievable.  Eddie Vedder also comes through strongly, offering a top-notch vocal performance.  Great all-around effort and it really paid off.  Congrats PJ, you've done it again!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is by far the best Slipknot Cd i have ever heard. And they didn't sell out Patrick, they just changed their style a bit. And they sound way better. You obviously arent a real fan of slipknot, or you wouldn't betray them after a slight change. Anyway, this album is perfect, there are no bad songs on it, and the best song is the blister exists! If you like slipknot, you will love this album so buy it and love it.
B00003CXDB|5.0|I found this movie to be fantastic. I loved every minute of it. Most of this movie seemed to tie in with politics. Being a conservative, I found this very interesting. The plot of millionare Gordon Gekko followed along the ways life should be lived. Greed, power, and self-confidence. <br />Revenge was another big part in this movie. I liked how Charlie <BR>Sheen played his role of Bud Fox. Towards the end the focus was to screw over Gekko and to have sweet revenge. <br />From this movie came my favourite quote of all:<BR>&quot;... greed, for the lack of a better word , is good. Greed is right, Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essense of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all its forms-greed for life, for money, knowledge has marked an upward surge of mankind...&quot;<br />I'm not sure that my way is the way that Oliver Stone intended his movie to be interpereted. Oh well, I don't necessarilly care. Greed is Good!
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This was one of my favorite films of 2003. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both deserved the Oscars they took home. My advice to anyone reading this review is save 10-15 dollars and buy the version with just the film on it. The Special Edition contains nothing more than some of the most boring interviews, which go on for over an hour or two, and a dull commentary track. No insight on the making of the film or the casting. The Soundtrack is decent but not worth the extra bucks. Please take my advice and buy the &quot;bare bones&quot; version of this outstanding film and nothing more.
B000024A70|1.0|I ordered this CD thinking it was remastered year 2004 as Amazon product detail says. What a fool Amazon made of me!<BR>What I got was 1994 version-10 year older version with higher price tag. Of course, I sent it back to be replaced with year 2004 version  only to see the same 10 year old CD from Amazon with no explanation or appology a month later.<BR>I, at least, do not have time and energy to fight with AMAZON about this anymore. DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!
B00006GEXQ|5.0|The fifth star of this movie is awarded to the DVD itself. It's really enjoyable not only the making off, but the cut scenes and the off-commentaries of the directors. It is interesting to see the real job of editing and making off this excellent film.<br />I like it very much the way Hugh Grant (Will) and the boy Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) tell the story as it goes for both of them. It seems that complicity of both characters is totally represented by both actors. I have seen Hugh Grant in a huge number of romantic comedies and I didn't expect much of him but THIS IS DIFFERENT. As he says in the extra material he represents 100% a British, rich, handsome, useless bachelor. He is even more irresistible for children than for women.<br />Some acting parts are beautifully absurd: when Will plays guitar helping Marcus to sing &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, when he goes to the SPAT to meet all divorced women into therapy, when Marcus tries to conquer the older girl by singing his brand-new rap CD...<br />And taking in mind the work of the directors, I think now I am even able to go and watch &quot;American Pie&quot;.
B00028HBKM|1.0|There was a lot of hype from people that thought this had perspectives that were prejudice against Jews. That's the first stupid thing. If a movie shows Denzel Washington getting shot, does anyone scream 'racist' because he's black? I didn't think so. It's seriously pathetic that so many people waste their time on religion.
0316666343|2.0|I bought this book after hearing about its rave reviews. Also, the plot and its premise seemed highly interesting. I found the first chapters to be very engaging, if disturbing. I'm not a parent, but I imagine the opening chapter would be nearly unbearable for a parent to read. This book gets off to a good start, but loses its momentum to dullness. The hubbub after Susie Salmon's murder soon fades as everyone else lives their everyday lives and grows up. Also, the author writes very long-winded scenes that make the book difficult to read and keep up with. I got some general plot basics from what skimming I did. The character of her mother seemed cold and unbelievable. Also, what would possess a family to name their little boy Buckley, especially with the goofy last name of Salmon? (Believable names make a novel much more readable.)<BR>Do you know many people who stayed with the boyfriend or girlfriend they've had since early adolescence? That's extremely rare and unlikely, yet it happens in this book. And, like many other reviewers, I was very bothered by the late scene in which Susie enters a young woman named Ruth's body, then, instead of telling important people who killed her, what happened and where her body is, as many of us would have done after helplessly watching our families struggle with these questions for many years, she has sex with the guy who had a crush on her in junior high. (If the last sex you had was getting brutally raped as a young girl, would you suddenly be filled with adult desire?) It was aggravating to read that part, for after the sex she leaves again, not answering those basic questions.<BR>Some other unbelievable events happened in the book, but putting them here would spoil some of the plot. <BR>This book was so painfully boring that I tried my hardest to read it but I ended up skimming over much of it. Now, a family member has started reading it, and she has the exact same complaints: it's very unreadable and monotonous. Susie goes on and on about her family's everyday activities as she watches from heaven, and the murder case proceeds slowly. This book lacks tension, and I actually felt bad for not liking it, but I'm realizing I'm not the only one.
0783229526|5.0|Fear and loathing may be the greatest movie i have ever seen, the first time i seen it i thought it was stupid as i did not understand it. Its the type of movie you must pay real good attention to if you wish to understand it. The 2nd time i watched it i was alone and paid attention to it and i absoulutly loved it. i have watched it 4 or 5 times since then. This movie is not for everyone though, its hard to understand, if you don't catch the beggining don't bother watching the rest cuz you won't get it at all, it will be a meaningless drug movie. The drugs are an integral part to this movie and it is part of the reason i love this movie so much so check it out.
6303407188|5.0|Ed Wood (1924-1978) is generally regarded as the single worst film maker to emerge from Hollywood.  This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse.  But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent.  Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego.<br /><br />The film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style.  Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level.  But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.<br /><br />As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece.  And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him.  Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular \\"psychic\\" and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's \\"Vampira;\\" and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller.  Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.<br /><br />In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art.  In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.<br /><br />If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged.  And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated.  But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film--and a film that desperately needs the DVD release that has been so repeatedly postponed.  Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable... and strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerccasional actress Dolores Fuller.

B0001GL3K4|4.0|This was a fun movie - flawed only by taking on the lives and loves of a few too many people. It's a romantic comedy in which there's a happy ending for about 12 of the 16 people involved as they careen into the stress and chaos of the Christmas holidays.<BR>Another stretch is accepting Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister; I'm sorry, but he just doesn't look the part, nor does his endearing, hesitant, bumbling persona lend itself well to the role of a world leader. HOWEVER, there's a scene in which he thinks he's alone and he's dancing all over #10 Downing to recorded music, and he's really laying on some hotshot moves - - - and suddenly there's a staff member-secretary-middle-aged-woman-person type standing in the doorway with a sheaf of papers. It's terrific. I replayed it 3 times and laughed just as hard the 3rd time as I had the 1st. <BR>Emma Thompson has a scene that's difficult to do justice to in words, and indeed, the scene is wordless. On Christmas morning, she realizes her husband (smarmy Alan Rickman) has a lover, and she leaves her family to go to her bedroom where she quietly, wordlessly, and eloquently regains control of her devastation. Masterful acting.<BR>Good movie. Some wonderful acting. But man, that's a lot of people to keep track of.

1582403589|5.0|i am a huge zombie fan and i love romeros work among others, and there was always the problem of not having the best actors possible and the budgets being next to nothing, but i had in my mind a epic zombie tale..this is it!<br />we have great writing that makes us grow to love the characters and feel for them, there are plenty of moments with just people being people, it's not all gore and zombies, that is why so many non horror fans love this.<br />but worry not horror/zombie fans, there is plenty of attacks, cities full of zombies living dead horror, no budget worries here, the artist can simply fill the page with as many as he wants, and the art is fantastic, very realistic with a ever so slight cartoony edge that never takes away from the impact of the story, and these are some of the best zombies i have ever seen.<br />it's all balanced out so well, it keeps you coming back for more, i hope they release more since the series is at issue 8 now and this collects the first 6.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|I don't have any words of wisdom as to why I didn't like this movie.  I just couldn't get &quot;into&quot; the characters, or the movie itself.  It was really slow moving.  Half way through it I turned it off. I was really disapointed because I had heard it was really good, but to me it was a waste of money.
0553573403|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to find this book (and series).  I've been a huge fan of fantasy such as Wheel of Time , but now that I've read the first 3 books of A Song of Ice and Fire, I can honestly say it puts WoT to shame.<br />The characters are dynamic in a way I've never read before.  The plot is intricate and complex without being obscure and indecipherable.  The story progresses rapidly enough to make it impossible to put the book down before you've turned the last page -- and even then difficult.<br />I must also add that if the Wheel of Time is 'rated G', this series is at least 'rated R', if not 'NC-17'.  George R R Martin pulls no punches and portrays this medival fantasy setting in a harsh and sometimes savage light.  I think this makes for a much more realistic and intriguing story, but I can imagine some may ... dislike some scenes.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana Krall ultimately made it. The setting with the jazz band rather than an orchestra brings an intimate feeling. Right tempo, great songbook and the voice create &quot;be here now&quot; atmosphere. The album sets the mood.<br />Listen to the record either loud or low, you will be amazed with its feeling of closeness to you that still allows space for aloofness.<br />Stop The World sets the spirit of the recording and promises a great adventure through the music journey with Diana Krall. And the rest of the album does not disappoint. Indeed. Temptation is, of course, the track that can be played again and again. You won't be able to resist listening to it one more time, every time. Abandoned Masquerade brings scenery of a late night cafe - dimmed lights, a few remaining guests, deep smoke from cigars in the air. The last track on the disc proves great thought put behind the record. Nowadays, there are not many records that end in a way they should be. The Girl In The Other Room with its Departure Boy is a rare exception. You wouldn't end the record in a better way. <br />Don't tempt yourself. You can't resist listening to Diana Krall this time. This record will definitely be the one for jazz record of the year.
B000002H3E|5.0|Why pass this up?  I enjoy this album for the cover alone, which features the gloriously teased-up hair and petulant faces of the one and only Dokken.  (That's Rockin' Dokken for those on the street.)  These guys were heavy metal fighters to the end, no different from Dio, Danger Danger, Duran Duran and Guns 'n' Roses.  <br />Musically, there's nothing better than \\"Under Lock + Key;\\" mid '80's music hit its peak on this treasured masterpiece.  George Lynch is a mastermind guitarist, but he never got along with Ronnie James Dio, and thus, Dokken as we knew them tragically ceased to exist by '87 - a sad day in metal lore.  Nonetheless, this headbanging piece of work is still with us, influencing the likes of today's bands, seminal rockers like Blink-182, Def Leppard, Velvet Revolver and the new Guns 'n' Roses.  <br />\\"Unchain the Night\\" and \\"Jaded Heart\\" are especially mind-bending tracks that will change you.  <br />I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000I8UE|2.0|This is not the best effort from Cassandra Wilson. Her earlier recordings were much better. Cassandra Wilson tried to travel miles, but she traveled to far and the miles look alike - boring scenery, same sand around, and the band seems to know only one tune. The American roots are heard here and there, but they do not fit to the cactuses of the spirit you want to get from Cassandra.<br />Try to travel in some other direction.
B000050XEI|4.0|The latest from Enya builds from all the basic themes of her almost 15 years of solo albums. (Hard to believe that long a time has passed!) And like all those albums before, or at least from &quot;Watermark&quot; on, the formula stays the same. Highly polished dreamscapes meant to evoke moods, mostly of the relaxed and contented variety. As &quot;Only Time&quot; proved in the aftermath of 9/11, music that aims to calm can still bring beauty to a tragic situation, and peace to troubled hearts.<br />The opening three songs of &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; could easily be the best ten minutes of music Enya has ever performed. And I, for one, will not moan over the disc's brevity. Better to have a half hour of near perfect artwork than to have it marred by extraneous filler. (Example, the wretched &quot;radio mix&quot; of &quot;Only Time&quot; that crowbarred a hip-hop rhythm track in a ploy to make it airwave friendly.) It takes Enya up to five years to craft her records, and almost to a T, they come out fully formed, seamless whole pieces. If I want more, I always have well worn copies of her other CD's to slip into the disc player.<br />&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; does contain one jarring surprise, the dark &quot;Tempus Vernum.&quot; It will surprise many who view Enya as little more than the empress of bland, as the breif latin chant breaks the surface calm of the album with something a little more stirring. It caught me off gaurd enough that it has become one of my favorite moments on the album, and one of the few times on an Enya album where she breaks the formula. It still makes me hungry for more albums, but I guess I still will have to wait another five years!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Eric Clapton tried to make his best blues recording. That should be appreciated. But... I do not believe these tunes. Yes, they sound like blues, but where is the soul? Most of the tracks sound artificial (\\"this should be done like this and that\\") rather than music coming from the very heart. There is variety of tempo's and styles, but all of them are too polished and not natural. This is synthetic music for the music itself. That is not the music for heart and brain.
B000069CWE|5.0|OK here goes.<br />I am a Linkin Park fan, most people either love or hate Linkin Park. I find that the people who hate them are generally more narrow minded because ther're usual reason is because,\\"they are a manufactored band so natrually they are crap\\", or,\\"tbey are new and different and so hence they are crap\\". Most of the haters will tell you to go out and listen to their favourite bands mainly grunge, classic metal bands ie Nirvana, Sex Pistols, Iron Maiden, AC/DC etc. and you should because those bands are real masters and I personally am a big fan of a lot of the the bands that these people tell you to listen to instead of Linkin Park but they are very different this is a new sort of stlyle, so they are not really comparable. <br />Right now I've got that out of the way. Hybrid Theory was the first albumn it was a triumph and was critically acclaimed. The style was very fresh and they did a hell of a good job. Then Reanimation came out and people said OH! It wasn't the expected completely new albumn but a one of those rubbish only for bargain bins remix/rehash albumns. Linkin Park are surrounded by preconceptions and this albumn was another preconception within itself, what chance did it have...None. It was generally overlooked by everyone to the point where people say Linkin Park have released rwo records Hybrid Theory and Meteora. This is a real shame because this albumn is amazing.<br />It is so unexpected that you have to listen to it many times before you begin to appreciate just how good it is. It is not the same style as the other two albumns, it is very mellow and there is a lot more rap, I am not a big fan of rap but this is just very different. The albumn is very hard to describe the reveiwer is just right when he says that that the songs are like musical landscapes sort of like space very large, forboding, barren. I advide listenening to the albumn from the beggining to the end because it is like a journey almost. This love of the Albumn could just be a personal thing but I think that you will be pleasantly surprised if you listen with an open mind and rid yourself of preconceptions. This, as the reveiwer said, really is an art peice.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|Master &amp; Commander - The Far Side Of The World is yet another triumphant film for Russell Crowe.  Mr. Crowe has the rare ability to mix action-adventure films with compelling character studies.  The special effects in the film are outstanding.  The battle sequences are intense, but the acting is superb.  Mr. Crowe is inspiring in his role a Capt. Lucky Jack Aubrey.  One scene in particular in which he brings a book to one of his young officers who lost an arm in battle is truly outstanding.  Trying to show strength and compassion as the boy's commander, he is moved by the boy's acceptance of his fate and is almost brought to tears.  Mr. Crowe may well be the best actor in movies today and Master &amp; Commander only adds to his growing list of impressive performance.
6300216039|5.0|There is nothing worse than bad Shakespeare but not to worry here-- Franco Zeffirelli and Shakespeare come together here in a lavish, opulent production of ROMEO AND JULIET, just when we thought there was nothing fresh to say about them. Zeffirelli has broken new ground  by casting Leonard Whiting, who is 17, and Olivia Hussey, who is all of 15 but looks even younger, in this timeless classic story about &quot;star-crossed&quot; lovers. With the possible exception of some parts of the musical score-- although much of it soars-- this film is as good today as it was when first released in 1968. (The musical theme was beautiful the first 50 times I heard it on the radio. Then it became trite.)<br />There are no bad actors here. In addition to the two lovers, Michael York as Tybalt and Pat Heywood as the nurse give outstanding performances, just to name two. My only negative comment about the acting is that Romeo always seems to run to and from an event or meeting; he never walks. Perhaps that is what a seventeen-year-old, testosterone-laden lad does, however. On the other hand, Romeo and Juliet's tragic story is completely believable and will put chills on your spine. Additionally, the dance scenes and duel scenes are quite wonderful. The wardrobe department got everything right as well.<br />A word about the language-- it goes without saying that Mr. Shakespeare is and ever shall be the greatest writer in English. Hearing his words again is a transcendent experience.
B000002H3E|5.0|This is my favorite Dokken album.  Every song is at least abouve average or better.  Unchain the night and the Hunter is one of the best one two punches that I have heard in a 'hair metal' album.  In my dreams is pretty good too.  The rest of the album isn't quite as good but is still worth a listen.  Slipping away and Lightning strikes again are two of my favorite lesser known Dokken gems.  What's up with the cover though?  That's a pretty lame cover.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I can't believe that some of the bad reviewers perfer there Self-Title and Iowa album. I hope they don't go off and make another album that sound like the last two they put out. I mean I wasn't impress with Iowa because it sound the same. Slipknot brought more to the table of the Nu Metal genre with Vol3(The Subliminal Verses). It sets them apart then any other nu metal band out there. It's a great cd by far their best work yet. I love the song &quot;Circle&quot;. Great vocals and it's end sounds like something Trent Reznor would do or has done with Nine Inch Nails.

Finally, I gave up waiting and bought it again.<br />I'm glad I did because this book is probably the most enjoyable read of my adult life.  I'm for once GLAD I'm a really slow reader because it's over 1100 pages and because the pleasure is just that much longer.

1594200106|5.0|This book was amazing. I read an article in which Stephen King recommended it, and he was so taken with this book and wrote such a beautiful review of it that I bought it right away.<br />Zafon manages to weave an incredible tale of love and loss, mystery and desire, knowledge and desperation, and he caps it off with that glorious Cemetary of Forgotten Books.<br />He wraps you up in his words, hooking you in from the first sentence and taking you on a mind-blowing journey. By the end of the book, you not only feel like you know  these characters, but that they must be real.<br />If you are reading one book this summer, make it The Shadow of the Wind.<br />Why this book has not received the same attention that such terrible books like The Rule of Four has is beyond me. This is one of the best books ever, and it is no surprise as to why it is an international phenomenon.

B0000AQVCL|2.0|I was really hoping to like this album after hearing how it was supposedly a break from the mainstream alternative rock sound.  And while I love the songs \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", \\"Cold Hard B****\\", and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\", the rest doesn't really appeal to me.  There's hardly anything original, if you ask me.  The slow songs are just too...dull.  The song \\"Lazy Gun\\" starts out great, but then turns into this slow dull song...much like the other slower tracks on this album.  While I appreciate Jet's effort to take us back to classic rock, I think I'll just go back to the 70's and listen to the original instead.
B000089RVX|4.0|When i first heard one of their songs, Going Under, i was blown away. It was very catchy, and Amy Lee has a fantastic voice. very unique. My Immortal is defintely one of my favorite songs ever. But Everybodys Fool OWNS THEM ALL! PUTS ALL SONGS TO SHAME IN EVER CD OF EVERY ARTIST! All the other songs...they were very good but Haunted and Whisper were creepy...didnt like them at all. Highly recomended.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|great job by avril,the more i listen to the more i like it.
0671027387|4.0|Although many aspects both political and scientific are a bit hard to swallow, this doesn't prevent the book from being an enjoyable fast paced read.  I'd certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of escape reading.  Who cares if parts of it aren't very realistic?  It's still fun!
B000005IS1|5.0|This is the greatest rock album, ever.<br />Wayne Kramer didn't use an SG, he used a Strat painted like the Stars and Stripes.  The only thing missing from this album is the intense ear-splitting volume.<br />Brothers and sisters, the MC5's music will drive you wild, into the streets, tearing down everything that would keep us from being free.  <br />Kick out the Jams and stay alive with the MC5.
0385335482|1.0|I found absolutely nothing humorous about this book.  I won't bother summarizing the plot, simply because there wasn't much of a plot.  When I read a book, I want a heroine that's likeable and at least somewhat intelligent.  Becky is neither of those things.  What she is, is self-centered, immature, and irresponsible.   I spent the entire book wanting to shake her sense into her.  At the *very end* she finally begin to grow a brain, but that's a long time for the reader to have to wait, and frankly by that time I hated her too much to care what happened to her.  I would have given the book zero stars if that had been an option.
0380778556|5.0|Oh my gosh!  My English teacher recommended this book to me, and when I first picked it up, I thought, no way am I reading this!  Well I did read the book, and although the book took a little while to really take off, it became quite intriging.  I love romance novels, but this one just blew them all away!  Rebecca is about a young mistress (her name was never given) who is married to a widower name Maxim.  Maxim's late wife, Rebecca, was loved and cherished by everyone~maids etc., and after her death a few things got a little cooky around the house.  Everyone tried to make the new mistress feel unwelcome and out of place.  I'm not going to give away the book, but Daphne Du Maurier definately through in a major suprise regarding Rebecca's death towards the end!  I loved this book, and I wouldn't be suprised if I picked it up and read it again!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|All i can say is GET URSELF a copy!!! A must have cd 4 2004!! Slipknot unlike u have never heard them before!! They have grown alot as a musician and artist, and they have put their music to a new depth. If u think they r getting softer y don't u try screaming for an hour or so.Corey is probably bored of screaming anyway! Y not let the man sing?? And if u judge good music wit alot of cursing words u got no taste in music at all and should get a life cause from what i see slipknot is not as depressed as they used to b, y should they?? they have nutting to b depress about!!! if they did, they would probably sound like some spoilt celebrities!! Anyway i like all the songs in this album except my least fav has to b Circle. i usually skip that song. Apart from that its all good!!
B000002IKR|5.0|I for one was blown right off of my seat when I heard this album for the first time two weeks ago.This is a relentless, ass-kicking debut by a band that doesn't get alot of credit in the metal world.It has a mix of their own style, a little Slayer influence definately, with a twist of old Metallica from Kill Em All. Let there be no mistake about it they are not a Metallica tribute band,they blend in their own style to a music that Metallica made known. Testament show that they too have something to offfer with songs like &quot;First strike is Deadly&quot; and <BR>&quot;C.O.T.L.O.D.&quot; The lead guitar work is incredible as well as the rhythm guitar as peterson chunks away as well as harmonizes right along With Scholnick. A classic piece of thrash metal get it now.
B000003TA4|3.0|hey,<br />stop generalizing and lumping nirvana in with the horrible bands of today<br />stop writing reviews just to list other bands you think are better than nirvana(they aren't anyways)<br />oh, in utero is better than nevermind anyway<br />aside from SLTS i dont listen to any of the songs on this CD(i prefer the unplugged version of come as you are)<br />smells like teen spirit is one of the greatest rocks songs ever written
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Well let me start by saying I am a huge Slipknot fan but this is just not right. Slipknot was what made me love metal. The first two CD's were great. Chances are if you like Stone Sour you will love this but do not buy it and expect the same Slipknot that used to kick ass. 2 stars because of a couple average songs and a really nice cover.
B000268QB2|4.0|These guys remind me of Travis more than anything else, how someone can compare them to Coldplay is odd to me.  Why, because they are British and play piano!?!?  So is Elton John, but he doesn't sound like Coldplay.  Regardless of trying to catagorize these guys, the fact remains that it is solid, smooth, and whistful music.  All of the tracks are nicely done and this would make a great addition to any collection that delves into alternative pop/adult.
B00006IU73|5.0|I discovered Porcupine Tree because I heard the end of a song named 'Blackest Eyes' on my satellite TV music station. I went out and bought In Absentia the next day. It has become my favourite album ever.<br />The album opens up with the song Blackest Eyes, a song that combines many of the elements of the Porcupine Tree sound into one song. It opens with a very metal riff (E down tuned to D and what not) and then the lyrics come in with fast paced drumming and guitar to back them up. It switches in between these two elements and then proceeds into a short ambient section. An amazing song.<br />The second song, Trains, is a very folk-esque song. It combines great folk guitar, and even banjo at one point, with amazing sound effects and Steven Wilson's lyrics about a Summer spent at his cousin's house. Another amazing song, also showcases how drastically Porcupine Tree can change their style within the course of two songs.<br />The third song, Lips of Ashes, further proves my point. It is a very spacey song, if you will. No drums here, just guitar and absolutely amazing vocal harmonies. Steven Wilson draws much of his inspiration for vocal harmonies from the genious Brian Wilson (of Beach Boys fame).<br />The fourth song is, need I say it, amazing as well. It's written in 7/4, and the lyrics express the shallowness of much of the pop music today, with lines such as, &quot;The music of the future, Will not entertain; It's only meant to repress and neutralise your brain&quot;.<br />Next is the fifth song, Gravity Eyelids. It begins as a very quiet song with amazing sound effects and a very cool drum machine effect. It then proceeds into a more metal sound, double bass provided by drummer Gavin Harrison included.<br />The sixth song, Wedding Nails, is a very eerie instrumental, and I had never heard anything like it prior to the album. It showcases all the band member's skills at their instruments.<br />The seventh song, Prodigal, is more morose. This, of course, does notdetract from how incredible it is. It has amazing vocal harmonies as well, in the chorus.<br />The eighth song, .3, always amazes me, it begins with a very deep bass line provided by Colin Edwin. Slowly, an entire stringed orchestra joins into the mix. One of the most beautiful songs on the album.<br />The ninth song, The Creator has a Mastertape, truely shows the madman that Gavin Harrison is on drums. This is a very dark and creepy song; I love it.<br />The tenth song, Heartattack in a Layby, has, by far, the greatest vocal harmonies of Steven Wilson so far. Multiple vocals overlapping make this an experience in itself.<br />The eleventh song is quite the opposite in mood from Heartattack in a Layby. A much darker song, same mood as The Creator Has a Mastertape. Some more, very metal sounding parts in this song as well.<br />The album ends with Collapse The Light Into Earth, a simplistic yet piano line begins the song and Steven's vocals join in as well. The same string orchestra you heard in .3 joins in in this song, and provides a powerful ending to an amazing album.<br />This album is by far the greatest album ever, in my opinion at least, and I hope to hear from Steven Wilson and Porcupine Tree for many years to come.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Wachowski brothers, how could you make such a piece of garbage? If you can't make something that at least compares to the original, why make it? Did they offer you enough for your collective souls? Or did you expend all your creative talent in the first movie? The second movie in the series was tolerable - tolerable only in the fact that maybe, just maybe, the third movie would redeem it somehow. Unfortunately, this is not true. <br />Originally, the Matrix was about Neo saving mankind. Instead, the movie turns into something completely different - the movie became Neo saving the Matrix from itself - the virus Agent Smith. There was no release of the humans from the machine, no real climatic moment where Neo finally does what he set out to do in the first movie. Why did they need to even have so much time dedicated to Zion? It wasn't ever about Zion. It was about getting the humans out of the Matrix and into Zion - not about saving a group of people that are, in a sense, already saved. <br />So, without ranting on for too long, do not buy this movie. Don't buy or watch either of the sequels if you were a fan of the first Matrix movie... and don't trust the advice of anyone who thought the sequels were good.
B000094DUP|5.0|Until recently I'd not really paid much attention to Delta Goodrem but we saw the CD and DVD set recently and bought it anyway and have been very very impressed.  Delta has *real* 100% genuine talent and an exceptionally beautiful voice.  This CD far exceeded my expectations and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who was interested in a quality, easy going performance my a modern musician.
0380002930|5.0|This book is definatly one of the best books I have ever read! Don't scoff at it just because it's about rabbits! When you're reading the book you get so absorbed into the story you forget that they're bunnies! I read this book because I had read the Redwall books and it was always being reffered to in the reviews on the inside covers of those books, and it got me curious. So one day I went down to Borders and picked it up. The rest is history! I read this book, 400+ pages and all, in two days! That's how absorbing it is! Read it and I promise you will have your eyes opened, you will never look at rabbits the same way again!
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The - OK, so it was cool for 1 song on their 1st album. But once I found out they'd done it on the whole album I figured these kids must be retarded. Then to find that they're applying the fuzzy mute effect to the vocals again on this release confirms my suspcion. <br />The - it's just too bad their 1st album was so overplayed and overhyped. I'm so nauseated by the very thought of the strokes that even though they're god's compared to most of the drivel that's put out these days, they've become just another played to death band that everyone once loved. Reminds me of the rise and fall of Hootie and the Blowfish. (not that Hootie was any good mind you - just a comparison of the god awful media hype machine that kills good and bad bands before they get a chance) <br />The - The End
B00006HBUB|2.0|First of all, my apologies, as this review is based entirely on my personal hopes of what this movie was going to deliver. Other viewers may have found lots of their expectations realised on the screen, but sadly, mine weren't.<br />The makers of the Scooby Doo movie didn't really have to get a lot of things right to make this film a real laugh, yet they managed to do everything wrong. I was really looking forward to seeing my favourite cartoon come to life, but they messed up on all the basic rules of this classic show. First off, the main characters all only have one set of clothes, but the costume designers for the film couldn't even stick to the simple designs of the cartoon, instead they went for hopeless approximations that just look ill-fitting and careless. Worst offender is Daphne, done up in all sorts of lurid fashions and hairdos, looking nothing like the animated original. Same goes for poor Velma with that odd long lanky brown wig and shapeless sweater. Even Fred had several changes of costume and the wrong hairdo. Only Shaggy came across as the real deal, which is probably more of a tribute to Matthew Lillard's dedication rather than the designers.<br />Next rule: There must always be a chase down a never-ending hallway with the same scenery going past over and over again. I think there were some chases in the movie, but nothing that brought this much loved (and much lampooned in the past) feature to the forefront where it should have been (Unless it was during a sequence when I dozed off).<br />Next rule: The monsters must be dumb and easily fooled. Most monsters in the cartoon just went &quot;Graaagghh!&quot; and swiped their arms in thin air as Scooby and co. slipped away from them just in time. The movie monsters are actually quite frightening demons that fly through the air, taking possession of innocent holidaymakers. Frightening is good, but it doesn't belong in this context.<br />Another thing that spoils the mood is surrounding the characters with hundreds of extras and other actors. It just shows up the implausibility of the whole gang ever passing for real people. This could have worked hilariously as a parody (a device that worked beautifully for the Brady Bunch Movie), but here it just makes the characters look thoroughly underdeveloped. They can't possibly interact with naturalistic &quot;real-life&quot; characters, only with similarly 2-dimensional ciphers like cackling crones, disgruntled sherrifs or sinister butlers.<br />Next up, the characterisation. Again, Matthew Lillard steals the show as Shaggy, and truly breathes life into the part. Fred and Velma are boring and under developed, but that kind of reflects the cartoon, so no big deal there, although Velma could have been given more to get her teeth into. Worst of all, again, is Daphne, demonstrated by the insertion of the blatantly inappropriate &quot;Daphne does martial arts&quot; sequence. If Sarah Michelle Gellar can't stay away from playing Buffy, she shouldn't be considered for other movies. She certainly shouldn't bring the character with her. A huge mistake. Finally, Scooby Doo himself. Considering the possible options for bringing a talking dog to life, the movie version is actually quite successful. I thought the interplay between Scooby and the human mambers of the gang worked pretty well, and his character really came through. Shame that the animators decided to give him those bizarre big, bright, human style eyes which the cartoon version never sported. Weird and a bit creepy.<br />As the the plot, its just far too busy. Anything and everything is thrown in making it clear that the makers could not decide what angle they were going for. They dabble in playing it true to the cartoon (very, very briefly), playing it for modern (Animal House-type) laughs, playing it as a parody, and playing it as a &quot;what if the characters went in this direction?&quot; kind of update. Too many styles, no substance and no chance for the audienceto engage with any one mood. A real mess.<br />As I said at the start, this is only my personal disappointment. I can't tell if other moviegoers had a similar experience, and lots of people seem to have found the film to be a riot. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a serious letdown and a huge wasted opportunity. I'm now waiting to see the second one to see if any of this gets put right...I really hope it does.gage with any one mood.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|I liked this movie when I saw it, but felt that some of the melodrama was a bit over the top.<BR>After being a gaijin in tokyo, so much of this movie became clear--especially the reason for so much melodrama. Spend at least a week in Tokyo by yourself with minimal japanese, and you will understand everything. You really feel the hollowness that was portrayed.<BR>My favorite scene has become Murray on the escalator at the JR station during rush hour...you're standing with a few thousand people and you're completely alone, in relative quiet (no one talks).   <BR>The desolate emptiness shown by the characters...it's real after a few days in Tokyo. I love Tokyo, but it can be very...strange.<BR>This movie does a great job of using the unsettling effect of Tokyo exposure  to intensify the characters' personal conflicts.<BR>The santori director is a reference to remarks made by an actor (Harrisson Ford?) on the only direction that George Lucas gives his actors.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Blowup is one of the greatest films ever made.  It will make you think long after the film is over and will leave you with images that you will never forget.  This DVD release is pretty good.  It has the OAR which is the main sticking point for me.  The audio is a little off on the low ends, but unless you have a huge system and look for that kind of thing then I don't think it would bother you.
B00013RC9I|4.0|The electronic French duo of Godin and Dunckel present a change of pace, a much slower, dreamy change of pace than their more experimental &quot;10,000 Hz Legend &quot; disc or for that matter the soundtrack for &quot;Virgin Suicides.&quot; Sometimes music takes me awhile to warm to and that was the case with this disc. When I first played the disc and heard &quot;Venus&quot; I thought ,oh no I bought a dud. The silly love puppy lyrics made me want to hurl, &quot;You  could be venus. I could be Mars. We could be together. Lovers forever .&quot; Maybe I'm too many lifetimes removed from such naive thoughts. Anyway it immediately got better and more on track to my likings. This is happy music, where everyone in the world walks around with unknowingly smiles, unwittingly pushing the next electronic connection to make a connection , be it real or unreal, where people have a dazed Orwellian look, waiting  at stop lights for the signal to advance them on their journey to nowhere, supersizing them along the path of life, eagerly anticpating a cocktail to relax and unwind before they vamp out into the night. Several songs are extremely catchy, as is most of the disc but the pure instrumental songs are like themes to a future where darkness is the norm and light is a valuable commodity. Check out &quot; Mike Mills&quot; where the music is like a futuristic carnival theme that streches out to the vastness beyond time and space. Other really cool songs are the  Pink Floydesque &quot;Another Day &quot; where the duo use simple lyrics, dreamy atmospheric music to create a certain  reactionary heavyness, like the weight in the morning mist that turns to dew feeding plants and trigerring a whole range of reactions. &quot;Alpha Beta Gaga&quot; is another instrumental song that entices with a build up in the beat amongst electronic tweeks  and a listen to the piper whistling throughout. &quot;Biological &quot; is another song that has that certain Pink Floyd ambience where the duo has that creepy hush, hush tone to their vocals that morphs into a  happy  laid back song. &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; has some Eastern influence to the mostly instrumental track that inches along in a quite meditative style for a nice ending to a very interesting disc. Overall this edition of Air is like a prozac  induced  euphoria where everyone is smiling and happy. A wonderful little disc to play for the lighter moments in life. Recommended laid back grooves for when the sun refuses to shine.as that creepy hush, hush tone to their vocals that morphs into a  happy  laid back song. &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; has some Eastern influence to the mostly instrumental track that inches along in a quite meditative style for a nice ending to a very interesting disc.

B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban has that sort of lovely heartfelt voice that it really becomes irrelevant what he's singing about as long as he continues singing. This CD mainly comprises of love song tracks which play up the full power of his voice. Its a good buy to listen to someone who can really sing in todays music world where I can safely say 80% of the folks out there who record CD's can't. But if you dislike listening to love songs and think its all wishy washy mush, leave the CD alone.
6305280762|1.0|Somebody once asked James Garner's character on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; TV show if there was nothing he wouldn't do for money.  He wouldn't kill for it and he wouldn't marry for it, he said, other than that he was pretty much open to suggestions.  Paul Newman and Steve McQueen must have been open to suggestions when they ok'd this turkey, and I wish they had said no.  The world's tallest skyscraper is burning due to shoddy construction work,  and architect Newman and fireman McQueen would like to put it out before the entire cast is incinerated.  On top of the building are a million gallons of water in reserve Newman forgot about in all the excitement.  Why this 2500 ton weight hasn't gone crashing into the basement we are not informed but the daring duo manage to blow up the tanks and there's your happy ending.  O J Simpson rescues a cat and Fred Astaire, after a lifetime of giving the American movies some of their greatest moments, was awarded an Oscar for enduring this production.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I cant get over how much I love Audioslave.  I am a huge Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden fan.  Combining the unique sound of Cornells voice with the distinct sound of Rage Against the Machine created an album that I had to have.  Lucky for me I was listening to the radio when they were being played, because I never listen to the radio.<br />I recommend this album to anyone who has a love for music, not just metal or rock and roll.
0385336810|5.0|I loved the Shopaholic series and had my doubts about this new book but I thought it was fantastic, even better than the Shopaholic books.  I couldn't put the book down once I started. I laughed, cried and cringed with Emma.  And the story between her and Jack kept me on the edge of my seat, willing them to get together.<br />Well done, Sophie!  Another great book!  Helen Fielding - watch out!!
0385508417|5.0|OK, first thing you need to understand is that this isn't typical John Grisham.  Those Grisham fans who read this book looking for courtroom drama or suspense simply because it's Grisham were probably thoroughly disappointed.  Nevertheless, this book is a riot.<br />This is one of those, 'If it can go wrong, it will' types of stories that had me rolling.  I don't think Grisham intended this book to be considered a work of literature with deeply developed storylines.  It's satire and a lot of fun.  I think that's what he intended.  None of the characters in the story are deep or believable, but that's not the point.  They're not portraits.  They're caracatures.  The entire plot is contrived for humor's sake.  And it works.  Nobody watches &quot;The In-Laws&quot; because we think that the relationship between Peter Falk and Alan Arkin will have some great impact on our view of family.  Don't read &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; hoping to find some deep meaning in the holiday.
B000002PH1|5.0|Wtf are you saying, Music Fan?  Kurt Cobain in a Belinda Carlisle review?  Wow thats kinda like writing about the Beatles in a Britney Spears review, considering how theyre on opposite sides of the spectrum.  And &quot;peddling faux angst&quot;?  You think the angst in Nirvana's music was false?  Maybe you should ask any random &quot;music fan&quot; about Kurt Cobain and the angst in his music before saying a statement like that.  And Nirvana wasnt quite punk, but hey, you're a &quot;music fan&quot; so I guess you know best.  You've lost all your credibility as a &quot;music fan&quot; saying that Nirvana's angst is false, because that statement completely wrong.  Maybe you need to go back to elementary school or something and learn how to write a review.  And next time avoid talking about random bands where it wouldnt make sense.
0792844882|2.0|It's an eye opener, reading the reviews, that the kitzhiness of a movie can also be good. A cheesy story, actors who cannot act - I have to admit that watching this movie I felt like I was transported to another planet. A fascinating experience in its own way. Some of the nude scenes are arousing. This movie plays best when you have the mute button on. I'd pick Basic Instinct over this one any day because there the story line is better even if chaotic.
B000002PH1|5.0|Nirvana?  Peddling faux angst?  Wtf are you talking about, music fan from CO?  Kurt Cobain and Belinda Carlisle are on opposite sides of the spectrum. Maybe you need to go back to elementary school and learn how to write a review.  I'm not here to say anything bad about Belinda Carlisle, she's awesome, but mentioning Kurt Cobain in the review is kinda like mentioning the Beatles in a Britney Spears review... they just have nothing to do with eachother.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I heard the first single, &quot;weak and powerless&quot; (I was not impressed).  I bought the cd (I was immediately impressed with &quot;the noose&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; but not much else).  I listened to it more and more (as i did i liked every song more and more)  <br />Then I saw them live at tower city ampitheater.  They opened with &quot;vanishing&quot;  This was one song that i thought was just a filler.  Now that i have seen it live, I understand.  &quot;vanishing&quot; and every other song that seems as if it is just a filler is so much more.  Every song on the CD is amazing if you give it time.  Please give it time.  You will realize how much there is in every song.  This is what makes great music (in my opinion).  It's what I like about other bands like Radiohead and the former At The Drive-in.<br />Also, realize that this is an album.  When you listen to it, listen to the entire album.  When i do, i enjoy it so much more.  The order/way in which it flows from song to song is what makes the (so called) fillers good, worthwhile songs.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Ever since their first album on Eyeball, MCR has been carving their own niche within the scene.  Many people have simply dismissed these guys as a another screamo act and moved on, and yet there's infinitely so much more to them than that.  Their new album showcases that fact and brings forth song after song of solid writing combined with a very original and innovative sound.  Simply said, if you liked the first album you're gonna either love or like this album just the same.  Or, you could just dismiss this as another simple screamo act and move on, but you'd be missing out on one of the probable best albums of '04.  Stand out tracks include: \\"Ghost of You\\", \\"To the End\\", and \\"Thank You for the Venom.\\"
B0000AI45P|5.0|After reading rave reviews for years, I finally got around to purchasing this classic CD several months ago and I can honestly say I didn't know music like this was possible.<br />Listening and performing music is a huge part of my life, and I have a very large CD collection, but Television has quickly become one of my favorite bands.  I simply can't quit listening to this disc and in the space of a few months I've bought four of their five releases, including a live one on Ebay that's out of print.  All of their CD's are great, but Marquee Moon is the best and qualifies as a must have for anyone who loves rock and roll.  I'd give it bonus stars if I could.<br />I'd also recommend &quot;The Blow-Up&quot; and/or &quot;Live At The Old Waldorf&quot; (great, but out of print) to hear how Television re-interpreted this material on the fly.  Simply incredible.
B00024BHTC|1.0|this album is so bad it makes me want to kick my mum in the face. i hate it. nightwish are the worst band ever.  i don't really understand what the other guy was thinking, this is bad plus eight.  all the members love gladiator and the lead singer's favourite actor is russel crowe.  every song is bad times eight.  i hate it.
078322611X|5.0|This movie goes the distance as perhaps the alltime best movie about baseball. I rank it up there with the Natural in its pure mythic and magical themes. Everything about this movie is magical and so well made that it stirs you inside. From Ray's relationship with his father to JD's ode to the american past time this movie moves you. It also has very humorous parts my favortie being the baseball game where Moonlight Grahm bats and the ensuing conversation with Shoeless Joe:  Joe-- He's thrown you two pitches high and inside where do you think the next will be?  Moonlight--- Either low or away or in my ear.  Joe---Look for low and away but be ready for in your ear.<br />This movie is a great tribute to dreams and the American past time.
B00005A46T|5.0|okay,this is slipknots best CD ever. Every song on this CD rocks.if i had to choose a favorite song i would have to say the whole CD.

B000002UAU|2.0|The Beatles were good, no doubt. This has some interesting things, but the best thing about it is the innovations and the way it pointed to the rest of psychedelia, concept albums, album art, and frankly the use of noise in mainstream rock music. All those things were done better, and I mean MUCH better, by the likes of the Velvet Underground, Mothers of Invention, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, The Godz, Hendrix, etc.. early Beatles, dated as they sound, are still a kick. Later stuff kept one foot in psychedlia, but backed the other one up into their rawer roots, and produced The White Album, with superior results. It's been hip to say Sgt. Pepper is the greatest album of all time for, uh, all time (it seems), and it was probably as influential as any album in rock History (with the noteable exceptions of &quot;Elvis Presley&quot; and &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot;). 2 stars, but I can't entirely say it's a waste. The title track is good hard rock, and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; while not the greatest song ever, has some really noisy moments. &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; recalls the teenage feel of the early Beatles, well, ALMOST. After that, it's a little dull, especially for the Beatles.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot is still rockin.they have changed bit on Vol.3 but they still have great music.the only difference on Vol.3 is that it doesnt have Parental Advisory sign on it,and they have two acoustic songs. Corey sings about a girl in some songs little bit more, he doesnt swear that much, and he sings a little bit more and screams just a little bit less.hes random if u know what i mean.this CD still does kick a** and so does Slipknot.they just changed a little bit.But they still rock.Buy this CD.SLIPKNOT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JS8|5.0|&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; has the rep, but if you like Rock-n-Roll, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; is the real payload. AC/DC is one of the greatest bands of all time, and this is probably their masterpiece. 10 songs, mostly they all sound the same, although &quot;Nightprowler&quot; is more subtle than the rest. Original line-up, Punk Attitude, Metal mood, pure rock style, crunchy electric guitars, screaming vocals, high energy, no commercial potential (nevermind that it was a big hit-it sounds like no other BIG HIT). Before Van Halen, before Led Zep, heavy metal was a toy for guys with lots of attitude, but low technichal skills (NOT to say they don't know how to play their instruments-there's a difference!). This is a throwback to that style, MC5 meets early Grand Funk even.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this cd is a kick a** cd. slipknot is a kick a** band too.this cd has sum reelly great songs on it. The best songs on this one would probably have to be, &quot;(sic)&quot;,&quot;Wait And Bleed&quot;,&quot;Eyeless&quot;, and &quot;Spit It Out&quot;. Those songs are teh standout songs.But the rest of the songs rock.If u want a good metal CD go out and buy this one.It rocks.Slipknot rocks!!!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|All the actors potrayed their characters well.  The script was true to the novel and the pacing of the story was really good.  The setting was intimate.  You felt as if you could be right there in the room conversing.  The focus was on character and mood rather than costume and furniture.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day was already my favorite band and this cd ranks right up there with all the rest of their cds and maybe even exceeds them.  It's different than their other cds, but you still get the same good vibe.  My favorite songs are Warning, Minority, Deadbeat Holiday, and Waiting.  I think more than half the songs on this cd should be on &quot;International Superhits.&quot; In closing, I recommend it to any fan of the band.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Pink Floyd isn't known as a &quot;Live Band&quot; they have reached flawlessness in the studio but aren't the same live.  You listen to the same songs, but they aren't the same.  The DVD is incredible.  The original concert is better than the director's cut in my opinion because it gives more of a chance to give a glimpse of the band live.  The Dvd captures the band in the end of their &quot;wandering&quot; phase and shows them recording two songs of Dark Side Of The Moon which is considered by some to be the height of their golden period, but i believe it to be just the beginning.  Animals was the height.  The DVD is great.
B00004W52U|4.0|This cd is a good buy for a punk fan of any kind.  It reminds me of Sum41 and Rancid.  The songs I like most are Soundsystem, Caution, Bad Town, Jaded, and Bombshell.  Operation Ivy has a cool sound that is different then some other punk bands.  Its sounds like a fusion of reggae, sca, and  old school punk.  One song I thought was over the top was Knowledge.  It was like throwing out the cool sca, reggaeish, punk sound and bringing in the hardcore death metal sound (I like Green Day's calmer version better).
B000002LQR|5.0|This is by far their best record, and the only one with no real &quot;fillings&quot; (and is a very long CD). After seeing them alive, Its very obvious that they put all the energy in the record departament, because they REALLY SUCKS ON STAGE! (if you havent seen them alive and you dont believe me, just see his latest DVD and youll see what Im talking about). Anyway, this is a classic.
B0000524CY|4.0|It is amazing that a movie from 1973 can still have the effect it has today. The horror in this film is not horrifying, not a lot of chopped off heads or limbs or frightening scenes. But the overall atmosphere is just freaking frightening, especially helped by the special effects they used on the young Linda Blair and her acting which makes this move as scary as Jaws for example. You don't see a lot but it scares the hell out of you. I would not be surprised if people really got nightmares from this movie, too close to real life it is. One of the best horrors ever made
B00005OWIU|5.0|This soundtrack by world-famous composer John Williams is so good, I can't express it in words. Hedwig's Theme, Harry's Wondrous World, The Quidditch Match . . . this, folks, is what TRUE magic is all about!!!
1594200106|5.0|When I first came across this book on Amazon, I was drawn by the title and also the subject matter. The glowing reviews only added to my desire to read this book, and I must say, of all the books that I've purchased through Amazon [and that's quite a few!], this was my best buy. The book reads like a dream,and reinforces to me the spellbinding nature of books. It is truly a beautiful work, and the language [wonderful translation by Lucia Graves] just makes me want to reread certain passages over and over again. The descriptions of Barcelona, the historical setting...the complex plot,Carlos Ruiz Zafon has indeed created a beguiling masterpiece. The platitudes can go on and on, but I leave it to future readers to judge for themselves. This book will be a tough act to follow, but I hope Zafon persists, and produces another enthralling work of ficton. Good luck!
B00008OLYN|5.0|Aside from being the best Opeth album to date (very close with &quot;My Arms...&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot; this album has more deep-seeded emotion and power in it than almost any album I've heard in a long while. It takes kind of a musically Pink Floyd and vocally Beatles feel at times (mainly with harmonies, echoes, and vocal lines) but remains completely true to the Opeth sound. The entire album is clean vocals with an electrical/unplugged feel to it. I saw this album performed live by them at the Berkelee P.A.C. and it was unlike anything I've ever lived. All I can say is get the album, read the lyrics and prepare to begin worship. Akerfeldt, Mendez, Lopez, and Lindergren are by far the most talented in today's metal and with songs and albums like we have seen since day one, they will remain that way for years to come. Rock on Opeth!!!!
B00000ICN5|5.0|It's very simple: SRV was the greatest electric blues guitarist ever, and one hell of a singer too. This was one of his masterpieces. Buy it, or I'll send Ted Nugent to hunt you down.
B0001CCXZW|4.0|I absolutely love this show and was excited when I saw the first season on DVD.  I had to give it 4 stars because of sound quality.  At times it sounded like the actors were in a box.  Other times the voices didn't exactly match up with the actors' mouths.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I got this cd the day it came out and am still listening to it and liking it more and more each time i listen to it.  It is a lot better than Iowa and a little better than their first.  Let me break the songs down<BR>1. Prelude 3.0 3/5-pretty good intro but more of a throwaway track<BR>2. Blister Exists 3.5/5-one of the more heavier tracks but gets tiring halfway through<BR>3. Three Nil 4/5-A pretty good song but not one a listen to regularly<BR>4. Duality 5/5-I love this song.  The chorus is amazing and it is just fun<BR>5. Opium of the People 4.5/5-this song is sweet and has a system of a down feel at the beginning<BR>6. Circle 4.5/5-This is a good acoustic song and surprisingly a little sappy.<BR>7. Welcome 4.5/5-This song has a sweet opening.  The drumming is crazy<BR>8. Vermilion 5/5-This is my favorite song on the cd.  It is just amazing and is freaking hard during the last minute<BR>9. Pulse of the Maggots 4.5/5-Another insanely good song.  The best really heavy one on the album<BR>10. Before i Forget 4.5/5-Oh wait, Before I Forget is insane too.  Perfect for moshing<BR>11. Vermilion Pt.2 4.5/5-This is such an awesome song.  it is all acoustic but is freaking awesome.<BR>12. Nameless 4.7/5-I love this song.  The transition into the first two choruses and then blasting into the third chorus is just crazy.<BR>13. Virus of Life 3.5/5-Song that is good to listen to if you are stoned or zoning out<BR>14. Danger- Keep Away 3.5/5-A pretty good song<br />Overall this cd is amazing.  The first few tracks are misleading. Listen to the whole thing a few times and you will love it.  It is still really heavy and melodic at the same time.  This band just gets better.

0060955775|2.0|I picked up this book thinking it would provide insight into suicide and asylums. I was disappointed. What I learned was that Coelho knows too little about women to write from the point of view of one. He also knows little about suicidals. Veronika shows little emotion and the scene with the orgasm is so obviously written by a man. There is little for the reader to identify with, because the main character has nothing to offer.<br />The ending had a twist, and twists can be quite clever but this one seemed to me as more of a cop out for the author. There is a moral to the story, but the presentation is unoriginal. I can think of a movie (&quot;My Life Without Me&quot;), an episode of tv show (&quot;The Simpsons&quot;), and a short story by Nancy Kincaid that carry the same moral with the very same worn out story, and I'm sure there are more that predate Coelho's work by decades. The only difference is that Veronika tried to take her own life and the characters of the former three examples were told that they were terminally ill. In the end it doesn't seem to matter that Veronika tried to commit suicide or not because the story becomes the same as all the rest.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|avril lavigne is a huge poser and should not be allowed to make any cds or anything. why does she say that she hates britney spears when she goes on trl just like britney!!!! if you want some real punk music, listen to rancid, offspring, and bad religion.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have been a fan of Avril Lavigne since I heard Complicated two years ago. I loved the last album too. This new album is really amazing its so good. BUY IT! All the songs are really good I can't even pick a favorite. Her voice has grown and her writing skills. This album is just hands down very good.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD was sooooooooo stupid!!!!! After listening to it my dog started attacking me!!!!!!!!!!! If you do buy this CD I am sorry but, what planet are you from???
1400034779|4.0|Highly recomand this book!I read this becouse it was today show pick and it was great.The characters are lovable and funny.A great start to a great series.At times it drags on but you have to get pass that and overall it's great.Now I have to read the other books.Highly recomand for a book club pick.Must read this novel.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Well, if I could give this zero stars I proboly would. There really is no good songs on this, except Duality. I used to be a big time hard rock Slipknot fan, but it just is too angry for me. Maybe its because I listen to punk rock now, but its a little too angry. I read the lyrics to songs and they're nothing impressive. The first album was good, the second was better but the third sucked. It just sucked, and thats a nice way of puting it. How can you listen to music and call it worth-while if you can't even listen to it. Its too hard, all that Corey does is scream. In punk bands it's cool, but Corey sucks at it. He should ditch Slipknot and go back to Stone Sour. He is much better in that. Maybe its because you can actually hear his voice. Anyway, the cd is not worth 10 bucks. I would not recomed buying it ever. It just is well.............HORRID!
B00009W0U4|5.0|In my opinion, this was the best film of 2003, although, admittedly, it's not for everyone.  Extremely brutal, the opening few minutes include one of the most violent attacks I've ever seen in a real movie... or at least, that's what I thought.  The rape scene that occurs later in the film is simply gut-wrenching, and not for a single moment does it seem like exploitation.  This is a movie that will take your breath away.  That is, if you can get through it.  When I saw it theatrically, about five people walked out.
0449227545|5.0|I liked the book and would recomend it to others.
0767853636|5.0|I have done reviews for the new &quot;special edition&quot; DVD of &quot;Annie&quot; and also the Disney remake from 1999.  Both of these were only worthy of 1 star but the actual film from 1982 really deserves 5 stars in my opinion.  &quot;Annie&quot; was my favorite movie when I was a kid.  It was always a special treat when my Dad would allow me to stay up late to watch it.  At one point I had actually memorized the entire film line for line.  For a little girl it's a fun movie with great songs.  Now that I am older I can watch the film with new appreciation and really wonder why it didn't get better reviews when it came out.  I may have figured out why that is though.  I believe it had to do with the comparison between the movie and stage musical.  The people who loved the live show seem to be partial to that where as most people who have only seen the movie, like me, think it's great.  I believe the movie stands on it's own when not being compared to anything and had that comparison not been an issue it probably would have received proper reviews.  I understand how people can be partial though.  I definitely am when it comes to this film because it's what I know.  Still, I can't see how certain aspects could go unnoticed.  As I was older I was really able to appreciate Carol Burnett's performance as Miss Hannigan.  I can't imagine anyone making this character come more alive.  She's detestable while being entertaining at the same time.  Disney really missed the mark on this character when they remade to movie.  Another element I can really appreciate as an adult is the relationship between Annie and Daddy Warbucks and how it developed naturally throughout the movie.  He starts out incredibly hard hearted, but through the charm of a dirty, almost homely, little orphan he sees there is more to life than just money and power.  She truly wins him over.  Because of all these things I still love watching this movie through the eyes of my inner child.  It can cause me to get a little misty eyed, but maybe it's because I am a sentimental sap.  There is just so much to enjoy from beginning to end.  I am especially glad I was able to get a copy of this DVD edition before it went out of print because believe me, widescreen is really necessary with this movie.  All my life I only saw it full screen and watching it on this DVD I was able to see all kind of little things I missed.  It's worth trading in the extras for.to get a little misty eyed, but maybe it's because I am a sentimental sap.  There is just so much to enjoy from beginning to end.

B000055ZB8|1.0|I suppose only those that like this movie will check the reviews. Mostly to read about how others like the movie as well as they do. But lord, what a boring movie this is. I don't care if it's a &quot;classic,&quot; I don't care how revered it is. Just because it's old and silent and the &quot;first&quot; movie about vampires/Dracula, does NOT mean that this is a good movie. I've seen plenty of silent movies, and it's true that most are boring, but some can be entertaining (I liked 1913's Cleopatra, for example). Nosferatu, on the other hand, is a bore. The mass of the story deals with people traveling, so you have tons of time wasted on someone walking, or riding a horse through vast landscapes, or having a ship drift through water. Walking and walking, riding, going places all the time - and never spending much time on the story when they actually GET THERE! It's such a terrible letdown. All this build up, and not much payoff. The director of this movie was obsessed with &quot;filler.&quot; Filling time, wasting time, &quot;just keep walking.&quot; Parts that were meant to be scary sometimes work. But barely. Count Orlock does look creepy (like a rat, or a bat creature, whatever...), and there are a few scenes of eerie looking shadows against walls. But that's about it. Sometimes Count Orlock looks silly, like when he's walking through town carrying a coffin as if it were light as cardboard (which it probably was). Worst of all, they took away the black and white of this movie by adding tints. So you get blues and greens and pinks. Horrible. Also, the music - well, enough people have complained about the music. It doesn't fit, especially near the beginning when it's just upbeat sounding and la-la-la happy silly and stupid. Grrr. I hated this movie. Glad I finally watched it, since it has such a reputation, but whew - what a pile. Don't buy into &quot;this is great because it's so old&quot; nonsense. This is boring, plain and simple. - Let the &quot;not helpful&quot; clicks begin!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Idina Menzel sounds phenomenal! I love this musical and anyone in NYC should see it! Defying Gravity is amazing, a really shopstopper, as well as No Good Deed. After hearing this CD I knew I had to see the play, it makes sure not to give anything away and the musical fills in the holes beautifully! I absolutely loved WickeD and will definetly see it again!
B000005YZM|5.0|when the music begins on track one, there is a temptation to write it off as zombies wearing blue stripes and carrying surf boards.<BR>yes, it does sound like mike love to the timbre and strains of god only knows ,etc... however, that would be totally unjust to a talented bunch as rod argent , colin blunstone &amp; co.<BR>granted the influence of the beach boys is there, but then again, it's easy to draw comparision to pink floyd, the beatles, dylan,  moody blues blah blah blah... that's besides the point.<BR>the dynamics of this album is commendable. if you are looking for homogeneity of so many crass pop albums today, ie: 1 hit and 10 cloned fillers;<BR>you are not going to find it here.<BR>instead you find imaginative harmonies, innovative interplay of musical instruments, some pop renditions, some rock, some classical. the lyricism of each tune is evident , and colin blunstone handles the role with a good ear... no off key neil young stuff here lol...<BR>and orchestration is tasty. if a comparision has to be made; i would rather draw the analogy  with something like the better albums of blood sweat and tears, todd rundgren,etc... ie: schizoid rock with more than the occasional classical tendencies. good arrangement, clean production, tight band with very little self-indulgence. the band plays like a good ensemble should, ie. this is a fine british band, mate!
B000001EGA|4.0|Elton has some masterful songs here.  &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; and &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; are two of the best on this CD.<br />The only reason this gets a four star rating is there are 3-4 poorly produced songs on this collection that could have been made a lot better.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|i loved this movie, i am 19 yrs old and i would say that it is my generations Wizard of Oz. i have seen this movie 3 times and it never gets old. i recommend watching this movie, but only if you have an imagination.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is a great classic CD. Every Elton fan should have this one!<BR>He is one of America's best ever pop stars. He is strongest when he teams with Bernie Taupin.  Some of his best songs of all time are on this record made 30-some years ago.
1400034205|5.0|In this brilliantly understated masterpiece W. Somerset Maugham slips the timeless theme of mysticism into the time-bound narrative of a novel. It is a class act with all the charm of a daguerrotype. The protagonist is a war hero who gradually withdraws from the world of ego and money inhabited by the social-climbing narrator, who is himself divided between high society and inner happiness. Of course, they are mirrors of each other: Boddhisatva. The excellent old movie based on the book catches the action but misses the nirvana behind the samsara that Maugham captures for us in his butterfly net of words. This has been a high-falutin' Zen review.
B00025ETIW|4.0|MCR's new album, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, is as good-if not better- than their first album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.This album, almost a year after the first has been expected to be as good as the first one, and it has exceeded. There are many good songs on this cd. If you liked their first album, or like sensis fail,hardcore etc., THEN THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!
B000001FKY|1.0|Def Leppard started out churning out pretty respectable metal that skirted the pop edge of the genre.  On Through The Night and High And Dry laid a solid foundation for the excellent Pyromania, and it's success on the pop charts apparently left a taste in the mouths of the Leps because that was obviously where they were headed with this lame followup.  This was hands down the most awaited album and the biggest disappointment of the 80's for me.  Pop metal I can stand, but if I want squealy girly metal, I'll listen to Poison or Vixen, maybe even Journey.  The only Journey path that the Leps didn't follow on this was a tour bus video.  Bad beyond belief.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my all time favorite books. It teaches everyone a great lesson about being prejudice to other people of a different race. It shows that even kids like Scout and Jem are aware of these issues and can be bigger people about the issue than some adults. They also face other hardships in their life other than prejudice. Scout is always being pressured into being lady like and not to play with the boys and what they do. That is not what Scout is like though, she likes she be with her brother and his friend and do what he wants do to. She doesn't like to be with other girls have tea parties. She is one very unique girl. I can relate to her in this way, because nobody wants to be girly all the time. Sometimes you have to be different from other people. Nobody wants to sit up straight all the time and be nice and pretty. Being different isn't bad all the time.   Both Jem and Scout have to deal with having no mother and living with only their father and their caretaker. They are very different characters but that is what makes them so interesting. This book has a clear lesson, that we should treat every person with the same amount of respect. We shouldn't treat people of a different race differently. They are the same on the inside as everybody else. I think if you're looking for a good book to read this would be the one to choose.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched this series several months ago and was entranced. Could not believe in these times of TV schlock what a quality production this was.<br />A few weeks ago I was listening to a local talk radio show. The guest that day was a local college professor who has written several books on World War II, lectured on the subject, has one of his works optioned for a movie, etc. People were calling in to ask questions about different WWII movies and what were his opinion on the movies mentioned. Some he liked, some he panned. I called in and asked what he thought about Band of Brothers. Basically he was full of praise for this miniseries. In fact, he said he had ordered it for his class as a teaching tool. At that point the host of the show said if this professor was using it in his classroom then it had to be special.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance have released one of 2004's best albums with \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.\\" I dare anyone to find an album that sounds quite like this, and that is perhaps, the reason why it is most enjoyable. \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" would simply be defined as a concept album with songs that vary from melodic rock, punk, and even a little metal. Gerard Way stretches his vocals from punk stylings, screams, and soaring melodies in the choruses of songs like \\"Helena\\" and \\"The Ghost Of You.\\" Think Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw/Head Automatica, only less spastic. The guitar work is equally varied ranging from fast punk riffage, guitar solos, and even some more metal influenced riffing found in songs like \\"Thank You For The Venom.\\" Highly recommended for fans of Thrice, Glassjaw, Thursday, and Coheed & Cambria. Highlight tracks include \\"Helena,\\" \\"Thank You For The Venom,\\" and my personal favorite, the haunting \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living.\\"

B0001KU8ZG|5.0|This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book &quot;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&quot; by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell,  at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however,  Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others.  It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .<br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes,  where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker,  a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a  bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.  Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.  Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.  The direction, however,  is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.  This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.  I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!ins, and a  bank robber.

1592400876|3.0|Eats, Shoots $ Leaves:  The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation. <br />Hmm...shouldn't there be a hyphen between &quot;Zero&quot; and &quot;Tolerance&quot; since &quot;Zero&quot; modifies &quot;Tolerance&quot; in the attributive position?
B000268QB2|3.0|Look, this is a solid pop album.  Reviews seem to fall into two categories: 1. Those that dig the percussion-piano driven catchy tunes anchored by Tom Chaplin's pretty voice.  2. The angry music nerds who can't write a review without putting the words &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;Radiohead&quot; into every damned review they write.<br />Get over it.  This is pop in all of its lite and airy glory, and it's pretty damned good.  Is this another label's answer to Coldplay?  Yeah, probably.  But it's a pretty good answer, particularly considering Chrissy Martin and the boys are a little big for their britches now and A Rush of Blood to the Head had fewer great songs than Parachutes.<br />So that's it.  This is a pretty, pretty pop album, nothing more.  And it doesn't need to be anything more to be great.
B00024I31C|4.0|Another superb batch of songs from JJCale. Highlights on this disc for me are My Gal, Stone River, Fancy Dancer and Blues for Mama although each cut in it's own right is worthy of many listens. My only minor gripe is \\"The Problem\\" is a stone knock of \\"I'll Kiss the World Goodbye\\" off of Really. <br />Well worth the wait and an excellent addition to your collection (you JJ Cale fans out there). It's a shame he doesn't get the credit he should in terms of his songwriting. Too bad most music fans don't know his work has been used by Clapton, Skynryd, Morrison, Widespread Panic etc. etc. etc.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|How nice it feels to be 100% satisfied with a MGM release! (Im still close to tears when I think of the horrible treatment they gave Garlands \\"I Could Go on Singing\\" recently!) This is certainly one of the best three strip Technicolor transfers available on DVD. The image quality is absolutely gorgeous from start to finish! I find it hard to believe that this haunting work of art looked any better when it was initially shown in first class cinemas way back in 1952. Ive seen Mr. Hustons film maybe 50 times over the years, but never in my wildest dreams could I ever imagine that it was possible to restore it into something as beautiful as this DVD. A loud BRAVO to MGM!

B0001AP12G|3.0|After earning a pretty strong following with his production work for such artists as Jay-Z, Scarface, and countless others, Kanye West is finally ready to drop a solo album as an artist. Much like 50 Cent did prior to him, Kanye has taken a tragic incident in his life (i.e. his nearly fatal car accident in 2003) and used it to positon himself on the pop charts. With the diary-like &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, Kanye created a successful street single that helped garner strong hype for his upcoming album. Having the already-hot Twista-guested &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; with ol' boy Jamie Foxx on the hook, Kanye already had two hot songs in heavy radio rotation before the album's street date. The big question, however, was did the rest of the album measure up to the expectations set by the first two songs that had dropped?<br />&quot;College Dropout&quot; is nothing to sleep on as far as production is concerned. Starting with &quot;We Don't Care&quot; which boats the all-too-familiar &quot;kids singing rap hooks&quot; chorus, Kanye attempts to flood his listeners with some laid-back music. His ode to the 9-to-5 crowd, &quot;Spaceship&quot; and the powerful religion-based &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; are both effective anthems in their own rights. &quot;Family Business&quot; is another personal record where West takes a trip down memory lane with a nice mixture of heartfelt lyrics and soulful production.<br />As good as some of the records on &quot;Dropout&quot; are, the LP drags in so many areas that it's almost a shame. Lyrically, Kanye is decent with his but after a few listens, a lot of his flows become less witty and start to just plain seem tired. His somewhat parody-like use of the popular St. Louis slang on &quot;All Falls Down&quot; just doesn't work. While &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; is solidly-produced, a frequently-recycled Jay-Z verse from &quot;Hovi Baby&quot;. Kanye's verse doesn't help matters as he spits a real poor verse that not only rhymes &quot;left eye&quot; with &quot;Left Eye&quot; but follows that up with a weak metaphor about Aaliyah and &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; that sounds like something from a bad backpack rapper. A comedic interlude called the &quot;Lil' Jimmy Skit&quot; is real funny but ends up getting beat to death as they try to stretch it out into three skits. Kanye's decision to include lyrical heavyweights like Talib Kweli and Mos Def is a good choice on his part though they do seem to outshine him on the songs they're featured on.<br />&quot;College Dropout&quot; starts off somewhat solidly but is far too incosistent to be a classic. There are a handful of amazing tracks and interludes that seem to compliment them well but there is so much filler on here that it almost leaves you shaking your head at what could have been. &quot;Through The Wire&quot; was such a monster first single that it makes the rest of the album seem average in comparison. Despite the occasional breaths of fresh air (&quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, &quot;Family Business&quot;), &quot;Dropout&quot; won't walk away on 2004's &quot;Honor Roll&quot; though it does deserve credit for its hard work and ability to keep up with the rest of the class.ot; with &quot;Left Eye&quot; but follows that up with a weak metaphor about Aaliyah and &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; that sounds like something from a bad backpack rapper.

B0001IN07Q|4.0|I bought Michael Buble's debut album a year ago after seeing him perform on Larry King Live.  I don't go a day it seems without listening to that album.  I'm 21 years old and I think that he's far more talented than many of the singers out there today.  I know most people my age don't listen to this music, but you can't deny talent, and that's what he has.  Yes, the songs are not originals, but just the fact that someone as young as him in this day in age can actually pull off these songs and appreciate this music is so great.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates music from the good old days! Very refreshing!
0385473788|1.0|I know that the holocoust was horrible and something that we do not want to repeat again but Anne Frank is just BORING. im not prejudice and i feel horrible about the holocaust but what i don't get is why is this girl complaining about her life? she had it way better off then some people. And why this diary is even famous. Anyone from the holocaust could have written a diary and be made famous. But a real good diary would explain the holocaust more then her own love life. Anne Frank is the most boring person i have ever seen in my life. When i was in grade 3 i didn't even want to pick up this book but since i was forced to read it for a grade 7 school project....i had no other choice. i admit, there were some holocaust parts but for every PARAGRAPH there was about the holocaust...there were 30 pages about her &quot;peeling potatoes&quot; &quot;feeling depressed&quot; &quot;studying&quot; and &quot;peter&quot;. There was no action whatsoever and people say that you could actually feel what she was going through...i mean get a life people. I know it's bad being cooped up and all..but....ughhhhhhhaoiwerualishfd bad book. And also...i can skip like 100 pages of the book and still know whats going on. I mean WHY AM I READING A BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT HER WANTING TO REACH PUBERTY. seriously. so if you want to read a book about food, and 5 other people, family trees, and useless things that will never come in handy in your life then i urge you to read this book. but serseiouly you will have wasted your time. read some REAL holocaust books
B00006LSM3|5.0|A real fine album I must say. It contains 12 fantastic songs.<BR>The album is touching, warm and a bit autobiographic as well.<BR>&quot;Stuck inside a cloud&quot; for example is about George suffering from cancer, and goes right trough the spine.<BR>Then again, songs like &quot;Brainwashed&quot; and &quot;P2 vatican blues&quot; proof that George has never lost his humor, nor his fabulous way of writing songs.<br />For a Harrison-fan, as well as a Beatle-fan, this is a must-have!
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Jack Nicholson and (especially) Diane Keaton are the two reasons to watch this pleasing, if unremarkable romantic comedy. Nicholson portrays a womanizing playboy in love with Keaton's daughter, Amanda Peet. Through ridiculous, sitcom-style machinations, we end up with Nicholson, injured laid up in Keaton's home, where they predictably fall in love. Add to this Keanu Reeves, as Nicholson's dashing doctor who also is smitten by Keaton.<BR>The film's plot is wafer-thin, and the supporting cast is a bit bland. Peet, while attractive, is not match for her older costars, and Francis McDormand as Keaton's feminist sister is completely wasted (though she looks fabulous). Keanu Reeves manages to be charming, though when in the presence of Keaton or Nicholson, he shrinks away in their shadows.<BR>While Nicholson, who is wonderful, looks pretty good for his age, it's Keaton who shocks audiences with her stunning figure. That she is sexy is not surprising. Diane Keaton has always cornered the market of \\"Intellectual, brainy babes.\\" But in this movie, we are finally allowed to see that, yes, Diane Keaton has (...) and legs -- stripped of her Annie Hall uniform of oversized jackets, vests, floppy ties and floor-lenght skirts, she looks stunning, making it very believable that a tenderoni like Reeves would fall in love.<BR>The movie was a welcome hit, and it garnered deserved kudos for its stars.
1559277254|1.0|I don't know who is writing these reviews, but you've got to be kidding me.  This was one of the most trite books I've ever read.  It was like every cop/action movie, but worse.  The humor is NOT funny (unless you find Full House hilarious, in which case, buy the entire Janet Evanovich series), and sex scenes are tossed about shamelessly in places where it is entirely inappropriate... for instance, after Stephanie is abducted, beaten, and almost killed.  she's gone for SEVERAL HOURS, and as soon as she gets back, she gets it on.  WHO DOES THAT???  \\"yeah honey, i was just diagnosed with cancer... whaddya say we head upstairs?\\" i recommend you stay far away from this book, unless you're okay with an obvious storyline, a plot lacks any sense of reality, and humor that yearns for comparison to Yakov Smirnoff.
B0001611DI|5.0|This is the new 2004 Dawn Of The Daed (1978) Divix Special Edition Theactical Version. This is a cleaned DVD, polished so you can see every blue zombie, and every gut splitting second. This DVD has many special &quot;SPECIAL&quot; features like hidden easter egg interviews of Chris Romero (wife) and Tom Sivina (FX). If you are a collector and dont have this virson, buy it! IT SHINNY! But if you never seen the original Dawn of the Dead...DONT! Do not buy this DVD unless you want to be left out, it may be cleaned, it may have extras, but its bad! Why?....because its cut! Cut?!?! what do you mean? On the back it says is longer, yah but not in the wat you think! This dvd does not feature the docking bay scene with Josef Pilato as the police officer and also cuts cool scenes that are funny and bloody. THIS IS A THEATER VERSION!!!!! meaning some guts are not included. They cut cool scene and extanded room scenes (a.k.a. &quot;PANIC&quot; scenes). These are the begining scenes in which every one panics! They extend the camera scenes and show more, like the computers and peoples reactions. Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger make this move great! But I still must say, only buy this if! IF your collecting this kind of stuff or this is your only chance to see it. But there are 2 main reasons I still must say do not buy, if you never saw this Dawn of the Dead...<br />1.) ITS EDITED!!!!(a.k.a. cut)<br />2.) There will be a special edition 3 disk DVD box set for Dawn of the Dead, featuring DAWN (78), DAWN (04), and zombi. And later on there will be a DEAD BOX SET, that will have Night(68),Night(98),Dawn(78),Dawn(04),Zombi,Zombi 2,Day(85),zombi3,zombi4,zombi5, and more!!!<br />NOW, its up to you to decide to buy it or not...or you could wait untill September/October.
B00025ETIW|5.0|For old and new MCR fans a like. Three Cheers is one of the best melodic hardcore cds I have bought this whole year! If you feel in love with I Gave You My Bullets then you will with Three Cheers. Songs like Give'Em Hell Kid, You Know What They Do To Guys Like Me In Prison, I'm Not Ok (I Promise)*which is probably their next single...,Thank You For The Venom, Hang'em High, and I Never Told You What I Did For A Living really bring out this album. Even though all the songs kick a$$! Do not be fooled by their major record lable move b/c they are still on Eyeball. This cd is a must buy...If you don't have it for the love of God buy it...NOW!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i heard duality and was floored...i bought this last friday and was amazed to hear ACTUAL SLOW SONGS on the cd...something slipknot is not known for but corey is.  they do well though and they pummel your face with brutality and make you think with poetic and somber songs.  definately pick this one up.<br />high points are duality, pulse of the maggots, three nil, welcome, vermillion(both parts), opium of the people<br />week points...prelud 3.0
044022425X|3.0|This book has its truly good parts, but quite a bit of it is boring. A big disappointment after the previous books. It's almost as if the two main characters are now together and settled, so the author does not know what to do with them. (Why fairy tales say simply `They lived happily ever after' - What's more boring than two beautiful people gleefully changing diapers?)
0736695982|5.0|I highly reccommend this unabridged reading of Pompeii, a Novel. The narrator, John Lee, is excellent, the story gripping, the detail delicious.  Take it with you on a long trip and it will transport you to an ancient Rome full of character and drama. You will learn interesting things along the way about engineering, fish, volcanoes. There is love, death, cruelty and a wonderful portrayal of Pliny, the scientist. This is too good a book to be abridged.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Of Rage's three original albums, this is by far the best.  Their self-titled debut album was great, but not quite as good as Battle of Los Angles.  This album itself is much more focused than their two previous albums.  Some of he songs themselves are more, while others are a bit convoluted with different messages.  For example, \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\" is an ode to Mumia Abu Jamal who is currently on death row for a crime he didn't committ and \\"War Within a Breath\\" is about the failed revolution of 1994 when peasants farmers tried to overthrow the corrupt Mexican government.  This album is full of memorable lines just like the debut album, but they are more specific.  Lines like \\"My panther, my brother, we are at war until you are free\\" (Voice of the Voiceless) and \\"Anything can happen on a New Year's day\\" (War Within a Breath).  Here's how I would rate the songs on a scale of 1 - 10.<br />Testify: 10/10 - Great instrumentals including an short Morello solo at the end of the song.  Great lyrics protesting the US' bombing of Iraq.  I'm not sure if it's about the Desert Storm or the brief bombings that took place during Clinton's presidency.  Either way, it's about Iraq.<br />Guerilla Radio: 9/9 - This song has an even better solo by Morello, but the lyrics are a bit over the place.  The song is aimed against censorship, but the lyrics are repeated such as the lines about Mumia Abu Jamal (considering there's already a song dedicated to him)<br />Calm like a Bomb: 9/10 - Very unique sound from Morello with good lyrics from de la Rocha.  This song's mainly about the impoverished masses of Mexico with some lines aimed against American capitalism.<br />Mic Check: 9/10 - Another song for Morello to show off his skills.  Lyrics range from attacks aimed the elites for the poverty of the lower class with some Mumia thrown in at the end.<br />Sleep Now in the Fire: 10/10 - A great song with yet another great Morello solo.  Short, but sweet.  Lyrics again aimed at politiciansand the elites.<br />Born of a Broken Man: 7/10 - Nothing really stands out here.  A good song but the lyrics could use some work.  I'm not quite sure what the song means.<br />Born as Ghosts: 8/10 - A nice slow song.  A change of pace where de la Rocha isn't rapping or screaming.  Good riffs again by Morello.  Is there anything this guy can't do?  Again, the lyrics aren't quite specific.  The plight of the impoverished masses of the 3rd world seem to be the message of the past two songs.<br />Maria: 10/10 - Some of the best Rage lyrics right here.  They are quite shocking once you really listen to them.  I love the slow sections of the song that contrast the message of the song.  It's about a Mexican immigrant who is sold as a (...) slave.  <br />Voice of the Voicless: 10/10 - An entire song dedicated to Mumia Abu Jamal.  The instrumentals aren't quite as strong here, but the lyrics (like Maria's) are a cut above the rest.  Again the song is slower paced giving the listner a change of pace to the aggessive songs earlier.<br />New Millenium Homes: 9/10 - Good instrumentals with a catchy chorus and some more odd sounds from Morello.  This song is again aimed against corporate America.<br />Ashes in the Fall: 9/10 - The intro reminds me of the Halloween theme.  Morello again gets some odd sounds from his guitar that are reminiscent of Space Rock like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  Good lyrics with some poetry thrown in.  The songs all over the place and is aimed against things like child labor, the penitentiary system, and pedophilic priests (ahead of it's time when you think about).<br />War Within a Breath: 10/10 - My favorite song on the album.  This song is the story of the failed revolution of Zapatistas, who tried to create a revolution on 1/1/94.
B0000025CP|5.0|For some, it's &quot;British Steel&quot;, for others, it's &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; or &quot;Painkiller&quot;.<BR>For me, it's obviously &quot;Stained Class&quot;. With such classics such as &quot;Exciter&quot;, &quot;Heroes End&quot; and &quot;Saints in Hell&quot;, this album is a masterpiece like &quot;Paranoid&quot; from Black Sabbath. With such energy and good riffing, &quot;Stained Class&quot; deserves 5 stars!
0440217563|4.0|I thought this book started slow, I would have preferred jumping right into the plot instead of so much backstory. There were quite a few things that were hard to suspend disbelief about. How many times can Jaime be injured? Does anyone realize how hard it was for a woman to get into medical school in the 1950's, especially since she has no formal education whatsoever? And what is with the homosexual hangup? It was OLD in the second book. Does the author think every gay man is out to get her husband? Lots of great action, though, still a very entertaining read.
B000089CJI|5.0|I first heard these guys from a west coast radio station.  I bought the CD, and it's awesome.  Too bad the east coast hasn't picked up on it yet.  Sad....
0385512104|4.0|This is a lovely book -- unlike any other I've read.  It is not really a mystery, so the fact that the murder of the dog is solved long before the end hardly makes the rest anticlimactic. (as some reviewers complained)  This isn't a book about the murder of a dog!  It's about Christopher, a teenager with Asperger Sydrome, a disorder related to autism.  Like most who have this disorder, Christopher has normal intelligence, and is in fact gifted in many areas.  His impairment is in communication, especially non-verbal communication. His inability to communicate on any but the most literal level makes every personal interaction and relationship difficult.  His brain works so differently form ours that this fictional peek inside is fascinating. Like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, there are many things the narrator (Christopher) describes that the reader understands long before Christopher himself does.  We are able to understand what other characters in the book are thinking and feeling, even though Christopher does not.  I highly recommend this book -- just don't go into it expecting a murder mystery!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The sound in this album is much heavier than in Let Go. The riffs are more catchy and more relevant and generally heavier, although there are some lighter acoustics such as 'how does it feel'. You can hear other musical influence a lot more on this album ie 'Together' has the slick feel of a Blink 182 track, but is more individual than any other Avril track I have heard so far. There are also no space fillers and the songs do not merge as much as in Let Go. <br />The lyrics have inevitably matured a lot since Let Go. All the songs are written by Avril herself and show various sides to her, from the lusting of Take Me Away and the anger of Forgotten to the care in Fall to Pieces and the remorse in Slipped Away. My personal favourite lyrics are 'Back under the stars/ back into your arms' from Fall to Pieces. <br /> I really like the moody rock feel to this album. The best songs were Slipped Away, Nobody's Home, Together and Fall to Pieces. If I lost it I would definitely buy it again. There isn't anything I hate about this album. It's well worth the money, and Avril has really come out top and thrown off her &quot;fake&quot; label (note my sarcasm when I say fake).
0380018179|5.0|I have read this at least a dozen times, and still love Meggie, Ralph, Fee, Paddy &amp; Frank. A classic, cannot recommend it highly enough.

B00003CX8U|5.0|This is vintage Bob Fosse at the height of his game.  Roy Scheider portrays Joe Gideon, a pill-popping, womanizing workaholic who is literally unable to stop his compulsive bad behavior and the manipulation of the people around him, even at the cost of his life.  The movie is reputedly semi-autobiographical, and its eye is not necessarily warm, but it is probing.  We see Joe Gideon's complicated relationships with his ex-wife, his daughter, his financial backers, and his colleagues, and it's not a pretty picture.  But we also see Joe Gideon's gift, his manic desire to drive his performers to truly achieve, and not settle for mediocrity.  And the devices through which the story is told, good old-fashioned singing and dancing production numbers, are just brilliant.  This film is getting on in years, it turns 25 in 2004, but the underlying story of razzle dazzle on Broadway, and the toll it exacts, remains as fresh and vibrant as ever.
0783117523|5.0|This movie is so strong,and as i watched i felt like I was there,like I knew the characters,and it will make you cry,such a sad story.I have seen the movie a few times and each time it breaks my heart.Angelina Jolie is an amazing actress.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|I cannot feel the quality of the film, although there are expensive cars. The story line is so so and the charactors didn't put much effor during filming. In The Fast and The Furious, I can feel the love, the friendship, the leadership and the emotion of Dominic's heart. In this movie, I felt that those racers are more like &quot;gangs&quot; rather than &quot;teams&quot;. The friendship between 2 main charactors is just too weak to hold the story up.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I expected this film to be: OK. <BR>Glad I was wrong. This film was so funny and the plot actually made sense. JAMIE as the daughter was hilarious even though I didn't believe her as much as I believed LINDSAY as the MOTHER&gt; Great acting all the way through. I would love to watch this film everyday.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Simply put.......this is as good as it gets! Idina Menzel is simply amazing! Hail Idina! Her Defying Gravity soars right off the cd!<br />All is Wicked in OZ!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril rocks my house everytime i play this cd. Songs are well written as Avril's matured vocals sing them with unbeleveable strength. I can listen to this cd over and over and never get tired of it. After Avril's image died down after her first album this is a truly amazing comeback that I would recommend to any person! Not just fans!!!!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|First of all if you've never heard My Chemical Romance before you have to get your hands on a couple tracks... I saw them on amazon.com about a year ago and downloaded some tracks off kazaa and i was amazed.  They have such talent, write such awesome songs, play such awesome music, and Gerards got the perfect voice for what the kind of sound they're going for.  Totally something new and fresh.  Anyways I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love was an awesome cd but this one has a more polished sound.  The writings just as good as is the music and it just sounds a lot better.  Gerards developed his voice more and sounds better than ever.  My only complaint is that there isnt enough screaming.  Just a little more would've been perfect.  Anyways it really is an awesome cd and surely fans of the first one and especially new commers will love this.  Pick it up ASAP.  Your local record store will probobly only have a few copies...
B000060K4O|5.0|&quot;We've been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay-Puft is o.k. He's a sailor. He's in New York. We get this guy layed we won't have any trouble.&quot; - Pimpin' ain't easy in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;<br />After 20 years since its 6/8/84 release, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; became the biggest surprise hit of the summer of '84 and has generated a hit sequel, a popular cartoon series, a #1 hit single, by Ray Parker Jr., thats an ode to parapsychology, the world over (I ain't 'fraid of no ghost!) and has mass produced legions of no ghost t-shirts. The film showcases the best talent from its principal cast and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is one of Ivan Reitman's best films to date.<br />After being kicked out of NYU, three Parapsychologists decide to go into business for themselves, becoming an elite team of paranormal investigators &amp; iliminators known, thru out the New York tri-state area, as the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. There first case is a big one, as an ancient evil, known as Gozer, the Gozarian, awakens and is hellbent on ruling Earth, starting with the great state of New York.<br />The cast is great, with Bill Murray giving one of his best performances to date. Writer, Dan Aykroyd wrote &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; with John Belushi, Eddie Murphy and John Candy in mind. But, with the tragic death of Belushi, the meteoric popularity of Murphy (and his salary), &amp; Candy not coming to grips with his character (he wanted Louis Tully to speak in a German accent with him owning, like, five Rottwielers for some unknown reason) Aykroyd retooled &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; with Murray, himself, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson as the team and Rick Moranis as the accountant geek who has a diehard crush on Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). The film is loaded with one-liners that would fit right at home emblazoned on a t-shirt. The effects hold up well over the twenty years and I only spotted two or three effects that actually look cheesy.<br />After the film became a success, in late summer'84 &amp; as a test, the producers decided to take the commercial the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; use in the film (Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?), taking the 555 number and exchanging it with an operating toll free 800 number. The results were 1,000 calls an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, over a six week test. The total of all calls is approx. 1,008,000 calls!!<br />The word Gozer comes from an actual haunting in New England, that, oddly enough, is also the film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; is loosely based on. Thru out the haunting the word Gozer would appear, mysteriously, on walls and belongings all thru the house with no essential meaning of the word.<br />The 1999, 15th anniversary DVD release of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is the best format to watch the film (rumor has it that Columbia/Sony may release a 20th anniversary edition in late '04 early '05). The DVD features deleted scenes, trailers, a great trivia track that runs at the bottom of the screen while the movie is being shown, and commentary by Harold Ramis (co-writer), Ivan Reitman (director), and Michael C. Gross (co-producer).<br />&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is still a great film that deserves shelf space in any great DVD collection.<br />After 20 years, they still are ready to believe you.s, in late summer'84 &amp; as a test, the producers decided to take the commercial the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; use in the film (Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?), taking the 555 number and exchanging it with an operating toll free 800 number.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie completely transcended what I expected of it.  I had put off watching it for a long time, and then one day my roommate and I popped it in.  I was blown away.  I've seen it a few more times since, and each time it gets better and better.  There is a lot that a first-time viewer wouldn't pick up on and it's great to go back and pick those things out.  The acting (Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter....and MEATLOAF) is fantastic, as is the direction and the effects.<br />The message of the movie has stayed with me ever since I first watched it - it is a fantastic commentary on our consumerism-driven culture as well as our lack of originality as a whole and our fear of deviating from the path of least resistance.  I may not be a guy, but sometimes I want to be Tyler Durden...I want to laugh at someone who deserves it, and question the status quo, and.....make soap.  <br />This is a movie that one cannot judge based on someone else's opinion (although I have tried my best to provide a very biased opinion!).  You have to watch it, with an open mind, and a sick sense of humour at your disposal (this movie is also funny as hell).  Watch it, live it, love it.....but whatever you do, don't talk about it.  That's the first rule.
B00000DR8R|5.0|I can't imagine my world without this album.  The song \\"Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken\\" first tickled my ear in a mixed tape a friend in middle school made for me.  The first time I heard it I felt a little older.  I guess it's hard to explain...it's just one of those songs that grabs you by the throat (and heartstrings).  It is still in the top ten of my favorite songs...EVER.<br />The rest of the album is totally stellar.   \\"Forest Fire\\" is another favorite of mine.  Lloyd Cole's voice is so sexy and desperate and fierce all at once.  I love the line \\"there's a forest fire every time we get together.\\"  It is an odd despriptive lyric of something so tangible.  And that's what so great about Cole's songwriting.  It seems like he has a cynical angle on love, but still admires the experience.  I think that's true for a lot of people, right?<br />\\"2CV\\" is great too.  He has such a tongue-in-cheek style of writing here, decribing the demise of another failed relationship.  My favorite line in \\"2CV\\" goes \\"we were never close, if the truth were told, all we ever shared was a taste in clothes.\\"  Sometimes his lyrics remind me of Morrisey's work in The Smiths, but a little more down to earth (and a little less dramatic).<br />The thing that is great about Rattlesnakes is that the sound is so timeless.  Considering that it was released in 1984, it coupld have easily sounded like mindless overproduced guitar pop.  But it steers way clear of the trappings of most music from that era.  It is so simple and modern and totally refreshing. <br />It makes absolutely no sense why Lloyd Cole isn't totally huge.  His subsequent albums with the Commotions were equally brilliant (especailly Mainstream), and he has been consistently recording amazing music for the past 15 years on his own.  The only explanation that I can conjure is that Cole's music is so hard to pigeonhole, people didn't know what label to put on it.  <br />Either way, you're a FOOL if you don't know who Lloyd Cole isand don't already own Rattlesnakes.  You can redeem yourself buy purchasing it now.  Enjoy the heatburn...
B00005JLO2|4.0|Let me start out with this: If you are looking for a movie with Victorian British action, a la Zulu, but with a more modern touch, this is your movie. However, this movie is not in the class of, say, Zulu, Gunga Din or The Man who Would be King. I suggest all three of those movies over this one. I have not seen the older version of the book, but I am told it was better as well. There are a couple reasons why this movie is outmatched. First of all, while it uses the basis of the book, it does not go to far in to it. The book is more a social piece than an action movie, and while I do recomend the book, it is not for you action fans. This movie has some incredible action scenes in it, most notably the square formation bit, which you can see heavily centered on in the trailer. It's not to great on the plot side. It simply doesn't take enough time to go through what's going on, and I have a feeling if you haven't read the book, you'll be slightly confused. Third or fourthly (I've lost count) this movie is not to spectacuarly acted. Wes Bently, Heath Ledger, and Kate Hudson all do their jobs adequatly, but the one to truly stand out is Djimon Hounsou, but his character, Abou Fatma, isn't even in the book, and this African Mistic bit that he has in The Four Feathers gets redundant. <BR>Once again: If you are looking for a movie with Victorian British action, a la Zulu, but with a more modern touch, this is your movie. However, this movie is not in the class of, say, Zulu, Gunga Din or The Man who Would be King. I suggest all three of those movies over this one.
B00003CXDD|1.0|I really wish Lucas had made a better movie than this. In fact he did, it was called Star Wars. Look at this movie and see the similarities to Star Wars. Willow is Luke Skywalker. Billy Barty is Obi Wan Kenobi. Val Kilmer is Han Solo. The two little faries are R2D2 and C3PO. And you can obviously see who the Darth Vader character is. <BR>I would have forgiven this if at least the story were watchable. Even when I saw this movie as a kid I found it hard care what happened it any of these characters. I really wanted to like this movie because I am a big fantasy fan. Unfortunately when Hollywood makes a fantasy movie 9 times out of 10 they make it silly beyond belief or so sappy that you wonder why they didn't just make a modern romance movie instead.<BR>If you want to see a real fantasy movie check out any of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Princess Bride, Excalibur or Conan the Barbarian (NOT the Destroyer.)
0790732254|5.0|I saw this movie with my parents and let me tell you...this movie really grabbed me into being part of the story, part of the movie! Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play exceptionally well! I couldn't help but drop my jaw on their powerful performances between eachother. They made me want to further<BR>become a great actor. This a great movie for anyone who wants to be a<BR>successful actor, director, or anything else that goes with movies. Teenagers (like myself) should see this kind of movie that really makes you think about life and just overall observe the movie and be touched. Nowadays, as other reviews here have said which I totally agree is that many people just watch non-thinkable trash movies. This is a masterpeice which everyone should love! When the movie will be over, it will literally take days to talk about the ending...because it is THAT good!!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Moulin Rouge! is a wonderfully inventive musical from director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann. It is the captivating tale of Christian, (Ewan McGregor) a British poet who takes up residence in turn-of-the-century Paris which is at the height of the Bohemian revolution. He falls in love with Satine, (Nicole Kidman) a courtesan with aspirations of becoming a famous actress. She falls in love with Christian but their happiness is not allowed to endure because of a jealous duke (Richard Roxburgh) who covets Satine.<BR>My first thought when watching the opening scenes of Moulin Rouge! was that this film was quite unusual. I gave it a chance because the story, aside from being a classic romance underneath all the glitter, was unique and the film was presented in such a manner that it was unlike anything I had seen before. The marvelous way in which this film is pieced together gives it a style and flare all its own. Although at times, Moulin Rouge! may seem over-the-top, its lavish set design, costuming, and even the acting is intoxicatingly rich. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman shine in their roles, creating such a strong sense of passion and devotion between the two leading characters. <BR>One thing that I find irritating in cinema is when a film designates the setting in a specific time period, yet it uses music or makes references to people or events that would not appear in society until sometime in the future; such is the case in Moulin Rouge! The musical takes place in Paris in the year 1900, except many of the musical numbers contain modern songs. Some may see using music from Madonna or Nirvana in a period film as innovative, but I feel it is out of place.<BR> It feels as if there is a ceaseless air of gloominess throughout Moulin Rouge! However, it enhances, not diminishes the overall quality and tone of the film. To outdo the uniqueness of Moulin Rouge! future filmmakers will surely have to step up to the plate.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Despite what some of the so called &quot;maggots&quot; might say i think this is an amazing album, so what they sound like stone sour it just proves cory taylor has an amazing voice and can scream and sing,i feel the same way about korn and metallica they didnt sell out they did what they thought was right so if thats selling out i guess everyones selling out.....
B000051Y0G|5.0|I owned this album back in the 80's. It was Cyndi vs. Madonna and Cyndi would be champ. Does anyone remember that silliness? Still, I was cheering for Cyndi. Well, we all know how it played out, but I still consider Cyndi a winner. Who wants to be as famous as Madonna, anyway - besides Madonna? The sheer torture of it all.<br />Cyndi was our champion. She encouraged us to walk in the sun, have fun, and play with ourselves. She was a little bit kooky, a little bit radical, and a whole lot of pop. A playful swirl of rainbow colors with an upbeat no-nonsense attitude and a generous spirit. Maybe it was the wrestling thing that was her downfall, I don't know.<br />Her singing voice could be surprisingly powerful, as well as a bit quirky, a bit confused, and a tad heartbroken at times. *She's So Unusual* succeeds at displaying her range of emotions and her invigorating energy.<br />If you need to lift your spirits, play &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;; in the mood for a bittersweet ballad then listen to &quot;Time After Time&quot;. &quot;Yeah Yeah&quot; and &quot;I'll Kiss You&quot; are crazy fun, &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; is her wonderful rendition of a Prince song, &quot;All Through the Night&quot; is soft and gentle, and &quot;She Bop&quot;, well, listen and decide for yourself.<br />Cyndi was one of the shining lights of the 80's. Even though she still burns brightly with unique talent, for a far too brief period in time she was not only the most unusual but simply The Most.
0743455967|5.0|im my opinion, this was a very well writtin book. though i had never read a memior prior to this, i still say that it was probable one of the best out there. the book itself was broken into two parts, one talking about himself, and the other talking about his thoughts on writing and what makes a good fictional story. reading about himself and how he grew up, like his childhood and everything suprised me a lot. he basically had a normal childhood like any other random kid. not expected when you're talking about Stephen King, right? but there was nothing really strange about any stories he told about him growing up. he got into trouble just like all of us, in school and out, and loved evry minute of it. then the part that really caught my attention and made me think twice about what and how i write is the section where he talks about writing. and he does i with a really good attitude, giving you detailed exapmles to follow by on what to do and what not to do when you write. now whenever i write, i will always refer to this book to generate ideas from and help me along the way. thanks Stephen King.
0393324818|5.0|I was skeptical about the book in the beginning, but as I started to read it I was completely hooked.  If you are a baseball fan this book is for you.  It takes you behind the scenes into the thoughts of the scouts, managers, and players.  I like how the book will dive into the story of how a player is picked/ranked among major league teams during the draft.  Then go into details of why the A's went against the grain and selected players that had amazing OBA but had some flaw in the eyes of other major league teams.  This flaw allowed the A's to pick up numerous players at below market value.  The Warren Buffet approach applied to baseball players.  After reading this book, it makes you wonder why are all the other teams not paying attention.  Just look at the draft on 6/7/04 and the A's seemed to have done it again.  I really enjoy the intellectual and statistical side the book presents.  Definitely a book to pick up and get immersed in.
B00020HEL6|5.0|There is this clear, almost magical quality to Renee Olstead's voice that is obvious the moment she sings her first note. You experience it, rather than merely hear it. She takes you on a small journey with each song, to a much better place from where you started. But sadly, as uplifting as the music is, going back to ordinary reality afterward is a letdown. At the conclusion of &quot;Someone to watch over me&quot; you ache for more of that willowy voice, and you wish you could replay the piercingly beautiful climax of &quot;Summertime&quot; (where she belts the phrase &quot;your DADDY'S rich...&quot;) constantly. The only problem with the album is it doesn't go on forever.
0064430227|5.0|This classic little book is a lovely reflection on childhood imagination and the joys of creativity.<br />Tiny wide-eyed Harold, in his one piece jammies and purple crayon in hand, wanders through the night using the dark canvas of sky to draw whatever fanciful dreamscapes his curious young mind can conjure.<br />No dummy is our Harold. He is an inventive little fellow who devises his own path, invents his own moon to light his way, makes a boat when he finds himself enveloped in a purple sea, creates pies when he is hungry, and so on until he is tired. Thanks to cleverly leaving behind special images as pointers to guide his way, he makes it back home in one piece and with lots of exciting stories to tell.<br />This is such a delightful book for children and one of the reasons is that it can be used interactively. Read the story with your kids then give them some crayons and a huge sheet of paper and let them loose to design and explore their own magical worlds.

0743457900|5.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a novel about the &quot;Circus,&quot; an invented nickname for MI6, in the 70s.  A mole has dug his way into the Circus over forty years, blowing agents, destroying spy networks, and generally making a mess of things for Control and his 2nd in command George Smiley.  Just when Control was getting close to discovering the traitor, a disastrous operation in Czechoslovakia causes a changing of the guard - Control soon dies, and Smiley is fired.  Now, the new leadership, an inner circle of four men, seems to be putting the Circus back in business (and keeping themselves on top).  But one of them is still the mole, and is as yet unidentified.  Smiley must come out of retirement and begin a long quest through the past to uncover the mole - and his nemesis Karla's calculated operation, that has perhaps damaged the Circus irreperably.<br />George Smiley is a recurring character in John LeCarre's works, beginning with LeCarre's first novel Call for the Dead, through his brilliant first big success The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, to Tinker, Tailor... and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  He has been called the greatest protagonist in spy fiction, sometimes even one of the best characters in contemporary literature.  He is the anti-Bond, an aging, plump little man who probably never won a fight in his life and doesn't wear hats for fear that they make him look even more ridiculous.  LeCarre casts him as a failed husband and cuckold to further emphasize his ridiculousness on the surface, but this is only seen as a weakness or something laughable by those who don't know him.  In reality, Smiley tries hard not to let anything get to him.  Indeed it is this calm and rationality, and his ability to meticulously analyze those things that would cause pain or panic in other men, that make him good at his work.<br />But one person can penetrate this defensive barrier of cold logic: his devious nemesis, Karla.  This conflict is the one area of Smiley's life that cannot remain purely business, that has to be personal.  At times, particularly in the sweltering heat of their first meeting in India, Smiley's emotion gets the better of him, so much so that the rivalry seems more human and personal even than Smiley's marriage; this idea is symbolized in the novel by Smiley's lighter, a gift from his wife that Smiley allows Karla to take.<br />But how can this very human conflict truly be expressed when Smiley and Karla have never even spoken?  Throughout the interview the Russian does not say a word.  Just like the Cold War, their conflict is never &quot;spoken&quot; or overt, only indirect and implied, yet each knows the other's character intimately.  This makes their conflict more than pure business, and more than merely one of ideology.  That seems one of LeCarre's major points in this work (and in Smiley's People) - that while one can explain away the Cold War by framing it as an ideological conflict, it was not fought by two populations with set ideologies - it was fought by individuals, people with failing marriages, people with sick daughters, people who are all ultimately human.<br />LeCarre is undoubtedly the master of the genre, and this, as well as the other two of the trilogy (Honourable Schoolboy, Smiley's People) are his finest.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is such a excellent series and I am amazed that they canned it after so few episodes. The character are great and the story lines are captivating leaving you wanting more. Let us hope that, like the animated cartoon series Family Guy, the DVD sales generate enough interest that they will resurrect the series.
0316666343|5.0|I finished this book today and I was sorry to finish it. I wanted to continue being part of the Salmon family. This book is a keeper and I have called everyone I know to recommend it. I cried many times. The story taps into a fear that is buried deep in the heart of every parent. This book, although heartbreaking at times, is inspirational and provides some comforting thoughts about life and death and heaven. I can honestly say it is one of the best books I have ever read.
B0000025ZF|5.0|This album will never leave my collection as long as I live.  <br />I have owned The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking for 10 years now, and consider it the best album to come from the brilliant mind of Roger Waters--surpassing even The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon.  The imagery of the lyrics transports you directly into the head of a man dreaming of love, loss, family, sex, and horror.  The dream logic which melds one song into the next is smooth and flawless.  If you are evaluating this album on a song-by-song basis, you have missed the point.  To appreciate the whole picture you have to make time to sit down and listen to it beginning to end--as is the case with most of Waters' works. The lyrics are jarring, haunting, Blakean.<br />The music is similarly inspired.  Even if you don't normally go for Eric Clapton's music, this album features him doing what he does best: slowhand improvisation.  This album would be nothing, musically, without him.  His guitar work complements and interweaves with the lyrics in the kind of musical partnership that you just don't hear much coming out of a recording studio.  The man can speak through a guitar like no one else I know of.  He is melodic yet unrestrained, prominent yet subdued.  Listening to this album, you find yourself thinking, \\"wow, this is a great song,\\" and only later, \\"wow, there's almost nothing happening but the guitar.\\"<br />I heartily recommend this album to anyone who reveres Roger Waters and anyone who lives for a well-formed concept album from someone who actually has a concept.  This CD has a plot and characters you feel you know.<br />This is an excellent CD for long car trips at night, nights spent sitting on the couch listening to the stereo and sipping scotch, or nights spent tangled in carnal bliss atop sweaty sheets.<br />Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking is a true masterpiece.
B00008S2VG|5.0|madonna has never really been a typical commercial pop artist. most of the songs she has sang no other artist could pull off. in my opinion she has blossomed into this very mature singer/songwriter. i can really appriciate that. most of the reviews here cant. they expect her to sing pointless dance songs forever and i dont understand that. they talk about the album being boring, to me sounding the same album after album is boring and that is the reason i have been a life long madoona fan. she has always given you something to look forward to, u knew the album wouldnt sound like the last effort. AL is a very touching and personal effort. Her voice has really matured over the last few years, i think, and so has her songwriting. i mean LOVE PROFUSION, INTERVENTION, X-STATIC PROCESS are great examples of that.she really shows off her love of words in those songs. while most artist after falling off the charts wouldve stopped releasing singles but she kept on showing how much she stood behind the project and her love for it. i love this album and for once i cant see how she is going to top this. love this cd to death.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off, lemme say that I think this is a really impressive album.  Every group member's ability is shown off at at least one point during the record.  This album has a way different sound than their others.  Overall, it's slower, and softer... but that's not necessarily a bad thing (when talking about Slipknot).  This band is maturing, and it's something that is rarely said when talking about these hardcore bands... Slipknot is a cut above the rest.  <br />The guitarwork and drumming is far more advanced in this album than in their previous ones.  Some pretty spiffy soloing in some songs even.  While there is no song as monstrous as Wait &amp; Bleed, the average track on this CD is really really impressive and merits multiple listenings.  This is my favorite of the Slipknot CD's and I hope they continue in this vein as they continue to mature.  They will be around for a long long long time at this rate.<br />Definitely check out this CD!!!
B0000046JP|5.0|I bought this CD by reading review in this area and I'm glad I did to say the least!.<BR>This is the 3rd version of Concerto de Aranjuez that I have - the other two are by John William and David Russel respectively.  The J.W. is a bit better D.R. - but this version by Paco de Lucia is the best in my opinion.  The rythm of his guitar blends in very well with the orchestra - the sound of his guitar is so gentle/smooth and yet it doesnt hide some subtle notes.  My musical vocabulary is very hopeless so i cannot describe what i felt in musical terms - it doesn't really does the CD any justice sorry :)...if you're fan of Aranjuez - Grab this CD now!.
B00016POFE|5.0|The other reviewers are correct in that this DTS release of In Absentia truly blows away the CD version.  There's nothing wrong with the orignal...it is one of the great albums to come out in recent years.  It's just that DVD-A format and remastering truly enhances the sound to epic proportions.  It really surrounds you and takes you on an hour long trip.  Besides you get 3 great addition tracks and other DVD goodies.<br />If you are a long time PT fan, then you probably own this already (good for you!).  But if you are new to the group, and have a 5.1 surround sound system that can truly take advantage of this albums dynamic audiio, then grab it now!<br />If you only have a TV set hooked up to a DVD player, then stick to the regular CD, the video extras are not THAT great and the original release is top-notch.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd has it all... only true maggots will appreciate it simply because the other people who have reviewed this say \\"Oh, this isn't heavy, blah blah blah\\" that is bullsh*t. This CD has more emotional power and more real and honest music, it is damn good if you are into Stone Sour and I am not even a big fan of them but this CD is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased... I love almost every song.<br />1.) Prelude 3.0 - 3/5 - For an intro this is a bit different from the usual Slipknot but this is still a pretty good song. It's slow but has some pretty cool sound effects.<br />2.) The Blister Exists - 5/5 - This is a fast ass song with alot of hardcore rifts and fast paced vocal screams. This CD also features a simple but incredible war drum like drum solo, very nice.<br />3.) Three Nil - 3/5 - This song is pretty good but I have mixed feelings about it, most of the stuff on here is great but this is one of the 2 songs on the album I am not the biggest fan of.<br />4.) Duality - 5/5 - This is one of the best songs on the CD it's got a bit different vocals and a great chorus. Great Song<br />5.) Opium of the People - 4/5 - Great guitar work and fast pace vocals and pretty good lyrics make this a solid insane Slipknot song.<br />6.) Circle - 5/5 - This song is on the softer side but is a great song with melodic lyrics and a fantastic chorus, this is also one of my favorite songs on the CD, very emotionally charged and almost poetic, very nice.<br />7.) Welcome - 5/5 - This is a heavier song, one of the heaviest on the CD, really fast drums, fast vocals, this is a helluva song.<br />8.) Vermilion - 4/5 - This is a pretty cool song reminds me of Purity and Prosthetics but I think Vermilion Pt. 2 is alot better, yes these are soft but they are very well written and masterpieces.<br />9.) Pulse of the Maggots - 5/5 - Hell f*ckin' yea... this is what it's all about, fast, fast, heavy (...)... this song is pretty (...)sweet.<br />10.) Before I Forget - 5/5 - Great song,I love the chorus and the whole song is pretty great, the chorus is repetitive but still pretty good.<br />11.) Vermilion Pt. 2 - 6/5 - This is my favorite song on the CD because it is really emotionally charged but it is without a doubt one of my favorite songs of all time, very emotional, very good.<br />12.) Virus of Life - 2/5 - This is a wierd song... not saying it creeped me out or nothing but it just doesn't belong if you ask me.<br />13.) Danger - Keep Away - 4/5 - This is a pretty good song, semi-emotional, but it has some great effects, pretty good, not the best but pretty good.<br />Overall this is one of my favorite songs ever, I was shocked at how much I like it, at first I was a bit iffy but then I really sat down and listened to it... then listened to it again, and before ya know it... I was f*ckin' hooked! <br />I really think if you give it a chance you will realize that this CD is a major accomplishment for Slipknot... very good, Congrats Slipknot on an excellent CD!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|First off, I never ever EVER want to hear ANY avril song referred to as punk. This girl is as poppy and fake as all the people she critisizes. If you do think this is punk then you plain and simple have never heard punk. Avrils songwriting hasn't &quot;grown&quot; or &quot;matured.&quot; The few songs she actually writes are still the same old stuff from the last cd. Its rediculous that this girl sells any records period. It proves single-handedly that all record companies do these days is snatch up someone with a little talent, give them a whole new band, and throw 14 songs their way. Then they leave it to MTV to shove it down peoples throats and they start buying the cds. Music is sad these days and people like avril lavigne are the reason why.
0446608955|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  It warns you that first you'll smile, then you'll cry, and it was completely true.  The love between Jamie and Landon was so pure, so innocent.  Everything about Jamie was pure - she was an angel.  While it sounds completely sappy (and let's face it, it was), you still can't help but get engrossed in this book.  I wonder how the movie version turned out...

B00006879E|5.0|I saw Maroon 5 in concert this past fall, and it's an experience I'll never forget.  Not only are they terrific musicians, they are incredible performers and really feel what they're singing.  Now about the album, it's genius.  Very similar to OutKast's &quot;The Love Below,&quot; &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is a well-sequenced ALBUM, not collection of songs.  The tracks flow from one to another, telling the listener a complete story.  Not to say that other &quot;collection of songs&quot; albums are not intelligent, but Maroon 5 has done something few performers have done...create a musical masterpiece.  If you are a fan of R&amp;B, rock, and funk, this is for you.  If you are like some of the reviewers on here that do not like those genres, it may not be for you.  However, don't log on and give it a 1-star rating just because it's not your style.  If you really look at what these guys have put into this album, you'll appreciate whether you like music or not.  A true masterpiece!
B00018D44U|1.0|I saw Norah live last year and was not impressed at all. I bought &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Now I could certainly deduce that her debut album &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, although it was no masterpiece, was a fluke, a one time only. <br />If this is how it Feels Like Home, I'd rather be homeless.
B000000OSE|4.0|After 1987's Appetite for Destruction, Axl started to get really ambitious. What was raw in 1987 shifted and his ideas became more grandiose and also proving difficult for everyone else. They had recorded so much stuff they ended up releasing everything on 2 albums(not a double album, they were sold separately), and both came out unfortunately a week before Nirvana's Nevermind hit. So pretty soon, GNR's hard rocking metal and killing musicianship skills took a backseat in the music industry to a incoherent songwriter with subpar guitar skills. But despite that, Part I ends up being better than it's twin.<br />Right Next Door to Hell: It starts off great and energetic but then it's rather meh. Great guitar interplay and a nice scream by Axl but otherwise it's ok. 7/10<br />Dust N Bones: Ah here we go. Sung mainly by Izzy and his one of the best contributions on the twins. I love the chorus to it, and the entire song has a metallic bluesy vibe to it. A definate highlight. 9/10<br />Live and Let Die: Wings cover written by Paul and late Linda McCartney and it's actually quite good. The reggae-esque section I could maybe do without but it's still listenable. 8/10<br />Don't Cry: The original version(one with different lyrics is on II), musically it's great with a killer solo and a moving final chorus. Lyrically, I like the 2nd one better, this one's a bit sappy touchy-feely.<br />Perfect Crime: High speed rocker that's actually quite good albeit short and shows Axl's diversity with his higher voice. 7.5/10<br />You Ain't the First: An Izzy addition and god does it suck. It's like a group of players drunk singing and playing, a low point on here. 6/10<br />Bad Obsession: One of the best intros on here with first a harmonica, then Izzy, then Slash with a great riff using a slide, the song seems to be about drug use and it's pretty good although not a favorite.<br />Back Off B****: Count em 22 b**** and one f*** sang. I actually found it funny listening to this, I don't like it much but just the lyrics and everything puts a smile on my face for some reason. 7.5/10<br />Double Talkin Jive: Energetic intro before Izzy sings for his 3rd song and it's quite good, halfway through Izzy takes over for an electric solo(it's Izzy, check the liner notes, Slash is only credited for acoustic solo and acoustic rhythm and Izzy is Lead and Rhythm guitars). 9/10<br />November Rain: Who hasn't heard this song or seen the video? 2nd longest song with not 1 but 3 solos by Slash. Some say it's long, sappy, overwrought, pretentious, I say it's GNR's Stairway.<BR>10/10<br />The Garden: appearance by Alice Cooper about a song that sounds like it's about a strip bar. I like the guitar riff during the verses but it's rather meh. 7/10<br />The Garden of Eden: Energetic rocker with fast singing by Axl. It's not bad. By the way, if you ever see the video check out Dizzy by the drums. He's funny to watch. 7/10<br />Don't Damn Me: Awesome guitar intro. Song's about Axl going on about critics and naysayers going after him for his lyrics like One in a Million, Used to Love Her or It's So Easy. 8/10<br />Bad Apples: Not that great, and it takes its title from a Osmond hit which is double not great. The chorus is quite long too. 7/10<br />Dead Horse: That's Axl on acoustic in the beginning to this quite good song. Has an oddly catchy solo by Slash. 8/10<br />Coma: The longest song, the one with the most changes, the one with a whole bunch of **** going on and has awesome lyrics by Axl. How could you not like this song? 9/10<br />Like a lot of people have said, you could cut the best of I, best of II and make a record that could easily surpass Nevermind but guess they couldn't just let go of the songs.
B00004W4UB|2.0|This movie should have been a LOT better than it turned out to be!  One can imagine the meeting at the producer's office at which it was pitched: \\"OK!  We're going to retell the story of <BR>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde... only from the point of view of Dr. Jeckyll's maid, Mary Reilly!  Let's get Julia Roberts in the title role and John Malkovich to play Jekyll and Hyde!\\"  Sounds like a winner, no?<br />No!<br />One is never quite sure who is to blame for all the missed opportunities here; whether the studio wanted to make one film and the director another, or whether director Stephen Frears just made bad choices, but this movie never quite jells.  Indecision seems to plague it at almost every turn.  When it should be scarey, it settles for being merely creepy.  When it should be creepy, it is merely weird.  When it should be suspenseful, it goes conventional.<BR>Julia Roberts seems more constrained in this picture than Winnona Rider and Sadie Frost do in their corsets in \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\"  She stays in her \\"wounded bird\\" persona throughout the entire film.  The trouble is we are given no preamble to explain why should be that way, and no development to explain why she should stay that way.<BR>John Malkovich, ever the unconventional actor, makes an astounding choice with his character, choosing to play Dr. Jekyll<BR>not as the obsessed mad scientist we're so familiar with, but as a doomed Byronic romantic.  His Mr. Hyde is just the flip side of that doomed romanticism, blatently sexual, full of spontaneous, unrestrained libido.  It's a brilliant choice.  If <BR>Frears had picked up this cue and run with it, we would have had an interesting film about the \\"fallen angel syndrome\\" which has been the bane of the dating scene for the last 50 years.  Some of the single women in the audience might have actually stopped asking: \\"Where are all the good men?\\" long enough to ask themselves: \\"Why am I always so attracted to bad boys?\\"  Alas!<br />Hollywood today is either incapable or unwilling to make a movie that asks its audience to think!<BR>So, instead we get a film which can never make up its mind whether it wants to be a horror movie, a \\"doomed love\\" story or a \\"Julia Roberts vehicle.\\"  By trying to be all three at once, it fails to be any of the above.<BR>How disappointing!
B000000OSG|4.0|This is the record that's hard to review because on one hand it's got its share of instant classics, other cases it has almost hits: songs that could've been awesome if it only for one part.  This could be described as the more epic half of the Illusion set has only 4 of the songs go above 6 minutes. While this isn't a bad record, it could've been changed a bit.<br />Civil War: after an intro from the movie Cool Hand Luke, in comes in a great acoustic guitar with a song that rants about meaningless war. Features plenty of great Slash solos and a great opener. 1 of 4 to go over 6 minutes. 9/10<br />14 Years: an Izzy song and not a favorite. It's not bad but again, it could've used some work. 7/10<br />Yesterdays: A single that pretty much flopped although that's a shame cause it's quite good. Nice guitar intro but Axl's voice is the higher voice which I think should've had his lower one. 8/10<br />Knockin on Heaven's Door: Very good cover and infinitely better than Avril Lavigne's. I like the use of the choir as it gives it a nice epic feel although that telephone part is completely unneccessary. 9/10<br />Get in the Ring: Personally...I think this song's funny. Axl rants against his critics and even calls them out by name. It's a good rocker and has quite a good crowd singalong at the end. But again some hate it, some love it but I like it. 8/10<br />Shotgun Blues: Axl's on rhythm guitar and it's...ok. A rocker that doesn't seem to catch hold. Nothing else to say, really. 7/10<br />Breakdown: Here's is where I have an issue. The verses on this completely work but the chorus flat out sucks. Bit too long. 2nd to go over 6 minutes. 7/10<br />Pretty Tied Up: Probably the best intro of the twins. A sitar opens then a very frenetic riff comes in. The rest of the song? It's not bad although the chorus doesn't really work for me. 8/10.<br />Locomotive(Complicity): The 3rd to go over 6 minutes and it really overstays it's welcome. While I like the verses, the chorus has to go. This could've been cut in half easily. 7/10<br />Estranged: NOW we're getting somewhere. 9 minutes of genius as far as I'm concerned. Modest as he is, Slash does deserve credit for the guitar in this. 2 great solos, a great piano section, volume swells, everything. My favorite part is the riff Slash plays after Axl goes &quot;1, 2!&quot;. Best song on here. 10/10<br />So Fine: You know that Duff has a solo career? You know why you never heard of it before? Cause he can't sing. He's good with background vocals but not lead. Nice guitar intro and good Axl singing but it's meh. 7/10<br />You Could Be Mine: One of the big singles that was also in Terminator 2. It's quite good although I don't get why it sold so big. 8/10<br />Don't Cry(alt. lyrics): Same thing musically but words are different and I prefer this version. Lyrics seem less sappy although it may come off as unneccessary to have 2 of the same song but you can like one or the other or both. 9/10<br />My World: Well now this is uuh..interesting. It's pretty much Axl on everything in a really strange minute and something long piece. First listen is interesting but then you'll probably skip it entirely later. 6/10<br />This is the weaker half but still holds some classic stuff. Could've used some work, or simply, gather the best songs from here and 1 and make a killer follow-up to Appetite but oh well.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I can appreciate the fact the Sarah Mclachlan wanted to take some personal time off. Six whole years of it. And in that time she had many ups and downs. When I heard she was finally releasing a new studio album (not another re-hash) I was overjoyed. Being Canadian, I always cheer more loudly for Canadian made content. I was a little disappointed with the length of the CD. Now quality is better than quantity, but just a little more bone would have made this CD really shine. It's frustrating hearing interviews with Sarah Mclachlan and how she seemly doesn't care about her music or her talent. She is so gifted it hurts. I hope someone can talk some sense into her.
B00000DCHD|5.0|this is a very good album. Roselinda and stiletto are AWESOME!<BR>there are other Awesome songs too! Heck, I love the whole album!
B0001ENYKS|2.0|Heh, this album just screams broadway shows, high heels, red leather dress, and bad wigs. It's been sometime since I've seen this flamboyant of a record. I'll admit, there are one or two songs here that will get stuck in your head. Now whether that's out of sheer enjoyment, or simple annoyance, you'll have to decide. I agree with the others that Franz is a take on some of the other bands out there, like The Stroke, The Vines, and all the other recent \\"The\\" bands. But they aren't the ones you'll be listening to on your way to the gay clubs. Get ready kids, this CD is a wild and wacky ride into sometimes scary territory.
0385335482|5.0|the best book I have read in ages. I fell in love with Becky Bloomwoods hilarious romps in the shops and all her witty commentary.  Becky's horrible spending addiction has me turning pages over and over again. All her well thought out, but disastrous plans to make money all make you relate even more to the character. A colorful cast of characters with their own funny adventures, surround her own unique story. She lies, spends, and it utterly embarrassed, but her character is so kind at heart and loavable how can we not love her and sensible Suze? A quite unexpected ending only  adds to the wonderfulness of it all. An excellant book.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I know what you all are thinking going into this... MCR is selling out & their album on the major is going to be horrible... Have an open mind... If you've never heard MCR before there's lots to love... Lyrically they're dark & cryptic in a way comparable to AFI to go along with that they have truck-loads of hooks to go along with it... MCR have a pop sensibility that is undeniable... You'll be humming these for days, and when you start singing the words to go along people will walk on the other side of the street... Have an open mind & don't discount this record just because of the label it's released on... It's just as brilliant as \\"I brought you...\\" was.<br />Jim
B00005JLEU|5.0|I pay compliments when they are due, so when I do it means that it soars far past excellence. Spirited Away is the most unique, beautiful, toching, creative, and plot-ladden, movie that has been created in ages. It 'spirited&quot; me away on an adventure that will never be forgottan. More original then any movie I have ever seen, and put together beautifully. Great for kids and adults.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Attention!  BLS has not been ruined.  They are not done with heavy metal.  Zakk explains perfectly what this CD is with the album name: Hangover Music.  Zakk said after a long night of metal and Alcohol Fueled Brewtality, you need something different the next morning to listen to.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was surprised, to say the least, to find that this album wasn't all the dance songs they blast everywhere (dirrty, fighter), and that the rest of the content was soulful tunes with good melodys and beats. You rarely will hear her ballods &quot;cruz&quot; and &quot;the voice within&quot;, on MTV, right? Their beautiful meaningful songs., but that doesn't mean that she doesn't have some fun. On tunes like &quot;Infauation&quot; and &quot;make over&quot;, you can definatly get your groove on. However, if your ready to dance, don't turn on track 19 &quot;I'm Ok&quot; the sad song about Aguilaras pained childhood. The album was mostly focused on leaving bad relationships and having a postive outlook. Aguilara fans won't be dissapointed, and non-aguilara fans, might want to try the album out, because you can't tell a book by it's cover. The songs truly show off her strong voice and embedd meaning that you never knew was there.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While Firefly was on tv, I never really thought to watch it.  When it came out on DVD I purchased it for a friend who asked for it for christmas, who flipped out about how great it was.  He'd been trying to convince me to come over and watch it with him and didn't get around to it.  I eventually got a gift certificate and was deciding how to use it and began reading the reviews posted here.  If a few of my friends liked it and a million people posting reviews liked it, I decided to give it a shot.  <br />Let me first say I'm not the type of person to post things online<BR>but this show is worth the effort and then some! Especially if it means more people getting into it that will go see the movie Serenity coming out April 22, that will in turn (hopefully) relaunch Firefly or at least create more films.<br />This show has everything, great characters with development, humor, action and suprisingly good effects.  This is what good television should be.  Take the time to check it out if any of what you've been reading peeks your curiousity.  You won't be disappointed.
0385336810|4.0|Sophie Kinsella strikes again! This time, with a book that is in the same league as her hilarious shopaholic books. It was a wonderful read, and reminded me of delicious chocolate. You try to savor it , but end up gobbling it right up. I read it quickly and laughed out loud many times, as I was transported into the world of emma corrigan.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|This soundtrack is right next to the first. For the person below, the track playing when Elle Driver drives to Budd's trailer is &quot;The Chase.&quot; It's kind of short.<br />Some of my favorites include:<br />-Goodnight Moon<br />-Summertime Killer<br />-A Silhoutte of Doom<br />-About Her<br />-Malaguena Salersoa<br />The one I love the most that I keep listening to is &quot;L Arean.&quot; It's incredibly smooth and great to listen to. Keeps me whistling in the shower. The two speech parts &quot;The Legend of Pai Mei&quot; and &quot;Truly and Utterly Bill&quot; are actually really cool to listen to. I didn't like the two mixes by Whenever You See Fit though.<br />Nevertheless this soundtrack rocks. Buy Kill Bill Vol 1 and Vol 2 soundtracks and play them in one sitting. It's awesome.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Never has a movie shown both the tremendous action with the portrayal of human suffering before Band of Brothers. The action and special effects in Band of Brothers is the most tremendous showing of the emotion behind the battles. While watching some of the more emothional scenes I find myself taken aback at the amazing courage and firendship between the soldiers. When a member of the unit dies, you see the entire untis reaction and sadness. Incredibally none of the emotion takes away from the incredible action scenes. If you though Saving Porivate Ryan was a good WWII movie than Band of Brothers will blow you away. There is no way to explain how good this movie is. If you have any intrest in war, drama, or action, you will absolutly love Band of Brothers.
B000002P2W|5.0|I never understood why this album never got a fair shake.  What always made the Who special to me was not just the aggressive, bombastic musical approach that was so influencial, but Pete Townshend's allowing his deep emotions to shine through in his songwriting.  This album continues the soul searching that was so powerful on Quadrophenia.  Here, if Pete had an issue, he wrote a song about it.  His drinking was a problem: witness the harrowing \\"However Much I Booze\\"; despite (or maybe because of) his Rock star status, Pete never felt truly connected with women: \\"The Are All In Love\\", \\"Dreaming From The Waist\\", \\"In Hand Or Face\\".  He never felt like he had TRUE friends: \\"How Many Friends\\" (\\"..he's really just after my ass)+ (\\"we talk SO much (...)behind each other's backs\\"), his life was falling out from under him in the extremely powerful \\"Slip Kid\\".  Entwistle's \\"Success Story\\" adds a little comic relief and sarcasm to the mix, unfortunately, the label also wanted a hit single, so \\"Squeeze Box\\" is thrown into the mix (a quality song, don't get me wrong, but) which doesn't even come close to fitting the mood of the rest of the collection, it just affects the flow of self depricating midlife crisis songs that give the album it's theme.  Easily up there with other \\" hold on for dear life\\" albums such as: Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\", Harry Nilsson's \\"Pussycats\\", Big Star's \\"Thirds/Sister Lovers\\", Roger Water's \\"the Final Cut\\", etc..  So, don't pass this one up due to the mindlessness of critics: unless you have never had moments of sincere doubt in your life, never questioned yourself, or what IT ALL means,  this album will pull on your emotions and  remind you that \\"I hope I die before I get old\\" wasn't just a line to create a cultural anthem, Pete feels a lot of pain in his heart and brings us all along for the ride.
B000268QB2|4.0|I'm a bit at a loss, Rolling Stone mentions Coldplay and Radiohead in their review and everyone gets uptight. This disc is simply pop music, it's different because the entire disc has no guitars, it's similar to some of Coldplay's songs because it's piano driven. I don't think Keane set out to reinvent the wheel, they simply made a pop record without guitars. If you want to unwind and listen to some hook-filled music, indulge, if not, don't buy it. As far as it being rubbish, you can find that on your radio, where you won't find Keane.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|finally we get to see the full length version as it should be....my only disapointment being the sound after watching the superbit version (maybe not a fair comparision)no special features to speak of...although this version is a complete story and like the extended versions of LOTRS i prefer the totally unabridged editions... this is still by far the best WW2 movie along with Saving Private Ryan and Band Of brothers so go get it.......
B00005QXXO|5.0|There are valid criticisms of this album: the abbreviated length, the fact that anyone with a high-speed internet connection can make up their own collection of live tunes.  But the availability of complete live shows doesn't negate what this is: a superb little record that chooses quality over quantity, resulting in flawless music all the way through.  That's the rarest of all accomplishments, for a live or studio album.<br />Radiohead open up on stage in ways they never do in the studio.  They manage to convey a range of sound comparable to their albums' production effects, but without the calculated distance.  The result is that each of the songs here seems a truer version of itself: noisier, more powerful and more genuine.  Like Spinning Plates and Everything in Its Right Place, in particular, crackle with new emotion.  And all the songs benefit from what's best about live work: they're energized by the fact that they balance constantly on edge of possible failure (though of course these were selected because they succeed).<br />Anyone who has only listened to Radiohead's albums will benefit from hearing how they flourish on stage; and anyone who already knows live Radiohead should cherish these outstanding mixes.  In the company of only their fans, Radiohead finally aren't afraid to be a great band.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The sheer Pantheon of reviews that have been written for this DVD should be evidence enough; this film has stirred the laughing apparatuses of many, many reviewers.<BR>  <BR>  Some think there is a brilliant and subtle Desert Storm analogy to the film . . .<br />  Some think there is a brilliant Jesus parody in the film<br />  Some think it is a heap of postmodern crap<br />  I, for one, love every corner of this film.  <br /> <BR>  --------------&gt;   The Big Lebowski is so incredible that my fundamentalist christian parents can see its brilliance even though there are snippets of porn themes in the film, and the F bomb is dropped more than one-hundred times.<br />  <BR>  Unpious, Unpretentious, sheer brilliance.  It's the funniest documentary ever made.
0790732203|5.0|Joel Goodson (Tom Cruise) is a high school senior who is already half-way to an ulcer from anxiety about future success.  He stresses about his SAT scores, his performance as a Future Enterpriser, and getting into a good college.  His friends urge him to lighten up; he tries to do so while his parents are away on a trip, and the result is a life-changing experience for him.<br />This is not only a very funny film, but it is also very insightful and subversive about the get-ahead-quick, materialistic mentality that lies behind the kind of uber-businessmen that began coming up in the 80s and have enriched all of our lives so much with shenanigans such as the Enron debacle.  Cruise's character goes from an innocent kid who believes that the key to success is hard work and preparation to one who realizes that a clever opportunist with a smooth line of BS is the one who will really come out at the head of the pack.<br />Excellent work from the supporting cast as well as writer/director Paul Brickman.
6304696566|5.0|This is the best Western ever made. There's simply too much to say about it here to do it justice. The imagery, John Wayne's character's growth, the comraderie between the &quot;searchers&quot;, the supporting cast and the theme will make seeing this film worth the while of even those who &quot;hate&quot; Westerns. It's a classic, and purchasing it will be money well spent.<br />Enjoy.
B00005JMUA|5.0|3. The Bride (played by Uma Thurman) is the strongest fictional female character I've ever met, whether on-screen or in a book. She is utterly awe inspiring. <br />2. The music, especially the song 'Malaguena Salerosa' by Chingon, is awesome.<br />1. The story is incredible. If Vol. 1 could be considered 5/8ths action and 3/8ths story, Vol. 2 is the other way around.<br />(...)
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There's a 'rule' in movies that I've always believed in: if most of the people either love or hate the movie (i.e. barely no three-star reviews) then it tends to be worth seeing. &quot;Big Fish&quot; was not the exception to this 'rule'.<br />Tim Burton has grown with time to become one of the directors I respect the most, and with &quot;Big Fish&quot; he combined the talents of a host of great performers to deliver a movie that moved me like few flics have. Maybe it was the fact that I am now in a point of my life, with my father over 75 years old and my son who is not even one, but I could identify with the main character and his struggle to dig the truth buried inside his father's extraordinary stories he grew up listening to over and over. I felt compelled to follow the story through the world of fantasy that Burton assembled for us, to a point where everything started making perfect sense. He has done it before and he did it again, and for that I thank him.<br />Should you watch this movie? Absolutely. Don't let other people's negative opinions about it push you away from it: you may find, like I did, that behind Burton's fantasy lies a world of truth and hope to be found.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I dont have much to say because pretty much everyone has said everything I've wanted to say. The first track explains everything this band wants to achieve with the music on this cd. It covers spacey timeless music with hints to their metal roots. Unholy Confessions is a good song but after a few million listens it does sadly get old. Needless to say thats when you skip to the next track and chapter four couldnt be any better than it is. The fastest drumline on this whole cd next to the little teaser drum break The Reverend gives us all on Remenissions, which is my personal favorite track on this whole album. The accoustic guitar style shocked the hell out of me because it had a spanish guitar style to it, which is just pure genius! You keep head banging through most of the tracks following Remenissions, until you get to I wont see you tonight part 1. This song is tragic, and if theres one song that wants you to slice your wrist it would be this. I'm kidding. The piano is again another great move the band took, and it shows off their musical inclinations. or something along those lines. but anyways, these are my favorite tracks:<br />1.Remenissions <BR>2.I wont see you tonight pt.1 and 2<BR>3.Eternal Rest<BR>4.And all things will End (if there's a band that has a better closer for a cd please tell me)<BR>5.Desecrate Through Reverence<br />Awesome cd, the best metal has to offer in this new millenium.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I've been quite critical of Marillion's work since their concept album 'Brave' back in the early 90s. Though 'Anoraknophobia' improved things, it still wasn't at the same level of creativity as they accomplished with that classic album that was meant to be played &quot;loud and with the lights off.&quot;<br />Finally, in 2004 Marillion takes back on their &quot;brave&quot; sound and brings it to the next level, with their 'Marbles' album. This is a production where there are some extraordinary songs that have a 100% Marillion sound, with accents reminding of Pink Floyd and Genesis carefully sprinkled all through most of the longer tracks, which makes it is extremely difficult to pick favorite tracks. Perhaps the promotional &quot;You're Gone&quot; I could live without, but even that one is far from bad.<br />All in all, my favorite tracks are:<br />-The Invisible Man: strong &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; influences to be felt in the beginning, due to its obscure nature, for the most part.<br />-Angelina: a more contemporary sound to it, but also bringing to mind works such as &quot;Wish you were here&quot;.<br />-Neverland: Strong, up front Marillion, starting with H and a piano and bringing band members in as it grows, displaying some of the craftiest production details in the album.<br />-The four &quot;Marbles&quot;: much more like the Marillion we learned to love in 'Brave'.<br />The album comes not just as a great musical production, but also an attempt to break traditional music marketing and distribution schemes, something that they attempted their previous album, but didn't quite succeed at due to the shortcomings of their distribution deal. What you will listen to in 'Marbles' is an album whose production AND distribution was taken off the gound by thousands of fans that pre-ordered it even before it was recorded (something I was proud to be a part of).<br />Once you listen to it, in spite of the album's cost, I think you will agree that breaking the ties from a recording contract can yield things that are extremely worth paying a little more for. And if you feel you can't get enough Marillion with this CD, there's more for you to dig into: go to Marillion.com and get the double CD, which includes much more, but in particular one of the best Marillion songs I've ever heard, called &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot;. They definitely delivered on their promise to save some great stuff for the double-album edition that they made available, but they were also able to bring together some great material for this version of 'Marbles'.s from a recording contract can yield things that are extremely worth paying a little more for.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Best Lp CD ever, very hard and to the point. Exactly what I like. Very worth buying.
B0001XWV0S|4.0|Well you won't confuse it with it's big brother Road Trip nor the recent classic Old School which took hilarious to epic levels, but Eurotrip has some funny moments which makes it a stand alone type of movie.  I loved the inital scene when Scotty gets dumped by his girlfriend cuz she can't stop cheating on him, only to attend the after graduation party where the band leader is actually singing about how he porked his ex-girlfriend without him knowing on stage in front on him, in front of everybody.  It gets no more humiliating than that.  And of course Cooper (Jacob Pitts) convincing his boss at a law firm that he's actually at work when they are enroute to Europe was hilarious.  And how can I forget my man Vinnie Jones (From Snatch Fame) playing the leader of soccer hooligans.  I love the way those Londoners talk, just hilarious.  Like I said before it's not nearly as over the top as Old School, Road Trip, the first two American Pies, How High, or even Paper Soldiers, but Eurotrip holds it own.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|First off to give credit where credit is due. Sarah has a wonderful voice and her Cd's are always well produced. The problem here is that the songs don't really stay with you and after repeated listens to this CD I am left remembering very little of it's content. I have very high standards for Sarah as I fell in love with many of her releases to date. My suggestion would be to buy: Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, B-sides &amp; Rarities and Surfacing before venturing into this unremarkable CD. Frankly, there is no afterglow happening here.
B000084T18|1.0|I'm sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great bands like Killswitch Engage, In flames, As I Lay Dying, Lamb of god, Ect. Now thats real music. Not this crap. The only reason this guys even popular is because he got shot nine times. In a few years rap will die just like disco. Then metal will rule the world once again.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido gets major points for consistency, not the greatest vocalist, fair writing skills and yet she understands her skills well enough to maximize her abilities. The music here is very solid and consistent with her last outing. The writing again is fair enough to give some good stories for the music to support. Dido is great background fare and I do means this as a compliment. Sometimes, you need music and vocalists who work well behind the scenes of everyday life not as the focus, ladies and gentlemen I give you Dido.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|As though I were Thomas, the protagonist of the piece, only fragments and minute visual clues capered through my subconscious for 38 years.  I saw BLOW UP its U.S. release in 1966.  I was 15 years old then and I'd not since BLOW UP since.  Not until acquiring this DVD, which is an outstanding presentation with superb video and audio specs.  I've only heard 15 minutes of the commentary track thus far, but it promises to be a worthy analysis of this intricate cipher of a film.    I won't offer my analysis here as it's a film that demands its own unique relationship with the viewer.  Suffice it to say that both the teenager and the middle-aged man in me still find this masterwork utterly fascinating.  I vividly recall patrons walking out of the theater in 1966 chuckling over the film's enigmas: \\"What the hell was that?\\" was the common utterance.     In the case of BLOW UP it is the questions asked and not a futile fumble for logic that holds me today and well as it did 38 years ago.  See this one.  If you \\"don't get it\\" then just give it a decade or two...      Added note:  9.12.08 - Since posting this review a few years back, it has been brought to my attention that this American release was \\"virtually censored\\" by cropping parts if the frames and digital smearing to minimize frontal nudity.  Sad note on our cultural priorites.
6301976258|4.0|Don't judge this movie by millennium standards; this was a simple movie from a simpler time.  Sgt York was a hero.  The film is missing some spots.  I remember a particular scene during training when York's backpack was filled with bricks, while the other men had loaded theirs up with straw (don't laugh I've known Marines who actually load their rucks up with heavy gear).  But overall, it's a good representation of early genre.  Please note that a War Movie used to also include the home coming, the fianc&eacute;e or wife or mom back home pining away with worry and doubt.  It's all here, too.  Great entertainment?  Not really, it's more in line with a historical review of early cinema.
B000002AE3|5.0|This has got to be my favourite TOTO-album of all time. I still remember october 1995 when I bought Tambu on the relase date. I had great expectations, but I also wondered how this album would be after the heavy-rocking Kingdom of desire and a 3 year long break. I had already heard I will remember several times on the radio, and loved it from the very first listen. Luke´s voice, the piano, the strings, the lyrics. Very melancholic and beautiful. <BR>Tambu is filled with honest and meaningful songs (except Dave´s gone skiing which is just a fun instrumental tune) and the sound is as brilliant as never before in Toto´s career. Mellow, but still raw and fresh, with a lot of acoustic feel. I wish they would do much more like this. Also Lukathers´s voice fits perfectly to the songs, except in Drag him to the roof where the power fails him a bit. <br />Favourites:<br />1) Gift of faith (This mid/uptempo song holds a great guitar-riff throughout the song, along with some acoustic guitar, great shuffling from Simon Phillips and furthermore good lyrics)<br />2) I will remember (One of my favourite ballads ever. Read the abovementioned)<br />3) Slipped away (Love the way the piano and guitar works together. The melody has some great odd parts and the lyrics are deep).<br />4) If you belong to me (A simple popballad about love gone wrong. A lot of great acoustic guitar, piano and organ on this one)<br />5) Baby he´s your man (Note: This isn´t really one of my favourites on the album, but I have to mention it because I find it great that Toto wasn´t afraid of making a song that actually has some hip-hop feel to it. Lukather and Jenny Douglas-Mcrae sings great together and the bluesy B.B.King-like guitar-solo in the middle is just tasteful)!<br />7) The turning point (So funky, rocking and great. The deep lyrics, the guitars, the organ, the piano, the vocals by Jenny and Luke. Everything fits perfectly in this song. Somehow I find that it has the same elements that made &quot;I shot the sheriff&quot; such a funky great hit in Eric Claptons version.)<br />9) Drag him to the roof ( A cool riff which is probably a rip-off of &quot;Carmen&quot; from the Isolation-album, but who cares. The song in itself is a bit strange but the groove is great and Simon does a tremendous job on his drums. The vocals, which are sung by Dave and Luke + Jenny and John are unfortunately a bit weak)!<br />10) Just can´t get to you (This song is simply a smooth, very acoustic ballad with beautiful harmonies and a nice Rhodes-solo from Dave. After 3 uptempo songs in a row, it makes you relax for 5 minutes.)<br />11) Dave´s gone skiing (I know no drummer who can play this, so Simon, I tip my hat for you. You are fantastic! This is just a funky, jazzy experimental track in the vein of Jake to the bone. Don´t try dancing to it ;-)<br />12) The road goes on (The perfect ending of a perfect album. Lot´s of acoustic guitars, piano, strings, and even a mandolin. Furthermore, Luke plays a wonderful solo in the middle. The lyrics are beautiful and carries a lot of hope. What a ballad!)<br />P.S.: If you have the idea that Toto is always &quot;80es-sounding&quot; you should definetely listen to this album and get your mind changed!
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|\\"Mystic River\\" puts you right in the middle of 3 children's urban Boston life long ago. One of the kids (Tim Robbins as Davey) is abducted by 2 men in a car who look like detectives. Davey is returned to the streets after 3 long days of torture and most likely sexual abuse. Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) are grateful Davey's back... but Davey's forever different. Years later, the children are now adults, and are for the most part living their separate lives. Jimmy is a corner grocery store owner with a strong love for his family. He's very rough around the edges... with his talk, his tattoos and his smoking and drinking. Sean is a detective for the state of Massachusetts and his lonely life is falling apart (no kids, wife has left him). Davey wanders from job to job and his wife (played by Marcia Gay Harden) supports him, tho often points the finger at him. Present day in \\"Mystic River\\" finds Jimmy's 19 year old daughter murdered... and this dark story tries to uncover what happened and more importanly who did it. Suspicion begins to rip all of them apart. Several Oscar nominations and 2 big Oscer winners for Penn & Robbins - all were well-deserved. Clint Eastwood did a great job directing (Oscar nominated). The city streets of Boston never looked better. Sean Penn turns in a great performance (perhaps of a lifetime)... especially the scene when he discovers his daughter's murder and he has to be restrained by what seemed like the entire Boston police force. Tim Robbins is wonderful as the moody, mysterious, and borderline-mad Davey. Does this movie deserve to be in the top class of movies  from 2003; including \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", \\"Last Samauri\\", \\"Seabiscuit\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"Master & Commandor\\", \\"Cold Mountain\\"? Yes it does. Two reasons why this DVD gets four stars... 1st being the actors attempts at authentic Boston accents (Laura Linney - ugh!); 2nd is due to NO worthwhile extra features on this DVD. For the commentaries, featurettes, interviews, etc - you have to buy the triple disc deluxe DVD set at 2x the price... I hate when they do that.- you have to buy the triple disc deluxe DVD set at 2x the price... I hate when they do that.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|i was really excited to open this cd.  but it wasn't what i expected.  alot of slow songs and simple guitar work.  didn't sound like a crushing locomotive like self titled release was.  maybe too much stone sour influence.  i guess after watching disaster pieces i was expecting something similar.
B00005A0N5|5.0|What can I say, the more I listen the more I like, what a breath of fresh air, the lead singer is amazing, the highs and the lows, &amp; the high quality musicianship!!!<br />This music is not for everyone but I love it. Hey, I am 41 years old! I listen to all kinds of music, this music is not boring!!! It soars! way above some people's heads. If you don't have any imagination this is not for you!<br />This is a classic, by the sounds of the talk Wishmaster is next on my shopping list.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I hardly know where to begin, this film being so terribly awful. The fountains and geysers of blood were so over the top as to be laughable. The several hundred &quot;Kato&quot; characters running around left one begging for a cartoon Green Hornet to enter the scene.... it couldn't possibly have been worse than what we got. Uma's in a coma for 4 years, yet in a few hours she's up walking and fighting again. She flies commercially while nonchalantly carrying a Samurai sword. The language would make a sailor blush and run away. A young non-Japanese woman running a Tokyo crime syndicate could happen, right? Has anyone ever heard of a gun??? Uma's character would have been dead many times over (except for the &quot;expert assassin&quot; in the beginning of the movie who shoots at Uma and misses): OOPS! I forgot! At the start, Uma gets shot in the head at close range, yet comes back unscathed. etc. etc. etc. I'd need 10,000 words to list all the garbage that reeks in this film.<br />I thought maybe Tarantino was going for camp, but no..... there's nothing but a few very lame attempts at humor. This idiotic film actually takes itself seriously. It's weak attempts to pay homage to another time and to other films falls flat.<br />Folks.... If you believe Uma Thurman makes a good Samurai, then I've got some property in Florida you might be interested in..... natural irrigation, wildlife.... it's beautiful!!<br />Tarantino is Sam Peckinpah times 10, without his grit or meaning.<br />Look.... The acting's bad, the plot is thin and predictable (did anyone not know after 15 minutes that the baby was alive?), the language and lines are eye-rollingly horrendous, and the blood so deep as to not even be gross. Don't just leave this movie on the shelf, hack it apart with a Samurai sword.... It's the only satisfaction possible out of this gelatinous chunk of dooty.<br />&quot;Run away..... Run away!!!!!!!!&quot;
B0000AVF29|5.0|Excellent re-release of Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals' first album together, Winds of Change. It's a very interesting and good album, superbly remastered by Repertoire. Throughout strong songs. San Fransiscan Nights, their biggest hit ever, can be found here along with such gems as Hotel Hell, Good Times and Paint it Black. It also contains some extra tracks.<BR>If you're fond of psychedelic music, or like Eric Burdon, buy this album.
B000268QB2|2.0|There is plenty of pleasant solid pop music to go around without this rubbish.<br />Take The Psychedelic Furs, The Church and even New Order. For the record I did like the first Coldplay cd, and I have nothing against dry british music w/ a piano. For cripes sake.. this is just not very good. All three of the bands I just mentioned are British and use plenty of piano/keyboards but there just isn't anything distinct about Keane. Maybe it has somthing to do with the punk influnces in the afromentioned bands. Maybe it has to do w/ keane's primary influence, Coldplay (there is NO denying this). Coldplay is NOT very high up on the totem pole to to be counted as an influence. You need to aim for greatness, or else you just get.. well, this. Maybe when Coldplay dies, Keane can set their eyes on greener pastures.<br />P.S. I care little if music is derivative. Either it's good or it's not, either it's better then what came before or it's not. If most music was not derivative, we could hardly have any music at all.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Back in the old days, Madonna had some pretty good pop tunes, if not overly &quot;deep,&quot; but on American Life, she's starting to run out of ideas- making it seem very stale and lifeless. Madonna's problem is that she's trying way too hard to fit it with the current pop trends...it doesn't work. It makes her look desperate. The one thing that will keep Madonna from being able to achieve true respect and longevity, past the 20 yr. mark, is that unfortunately she is not blessed with a true singer's voice. She's so limited in her ability to 'measure up' with the true vocalists, it will only hurt her in the long run. Also, her bag of tricks have run dangerously low, and the public is quickly losing interest, and moving on to fresher acts. There's really nothing left after that.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is THE SINGLE most amazing greatest hits album I have ever owned.  How anyone could rate this disc lower than five stars is beyond my comprehension.  Remastered sounding better than ever and some of the greatest songs ever to reach my ears, Guns N' Roses is my favorite bands coming from the 80s era along with Bon Jovi.  The song selection is great and the cover and inside cover art is awesome.  I would recommend this CD in a heartbeat.  No doubt, the most amazing greatest hits album out there, that I've come across.
B00008WG3U|4.0|This album encompasses the many stages the band has gone through in its evolvement. Hardcore, punk, and a return to ska. Don't complain about the price, you can buy it at [...] for $10, if the amazon price is too high.
B0000D96NW|3.0|A masterpiece for the producer, not the band.  This band is strange in that although they can't really make up new riffs or new music in general, but they still pass on this feeling of intensity or power that sets them appart.  I remember a few years ago I really wanted a heavy band with emotion and I got machine head, but now all I hear are the lyrics and think &quot;oh god that's terrible.&quot;  Robb cannot still be feeling all this pain after so long and so much success.  Oh he's &quot;so alone.&quot;  get over it goddamnit and write something that you care about that is happening right now, not at &quot;the age of five years old.&quot;  I mean jesus, I go to poetry web sites to make fun of lyrcis like this.  Anyway, I appriciate the feeling that I get from this music even though i've heard it all on their first albums over and over.  It's that epic sound that the kids eat up.
B00008K7AM|5.0|The movie &quot;THe hot chick&quot;is the funniest movie I'v ever seen!!!<BR>The subject of the movie is amusing and interesting, I have never seen a movie with such a unique idea. The movie began as a legend of a pair of earrings who swich bodies. The movie itself is at the year 2002, it is about a young girl named Jessica how has a perfect life: the perfect look, the perfect boyfriend, the perfect friends... .<BR>Jessica saw in an antiquity shop this earrings, but jessica didnt know what this earrings can do. The owner of the shop told here that the earrings are not for sale but Jessica wanted them for the home-comming prom so she stole them.<BR>As Jessica and her friends were on their way home Jessica lost one of the earrings and a 30 year old man who stole from a gase stashion found the earring. Here the story gets complicated, Jessica gets the body of a man, no-one belives here and she is miserable. At last she convinsed her best friend April that she is Jessica. April fals in love with the &quot;boy&quot; jessica. This is a excellent act of Rob Schneider. I personally think that Rob Schneider is one of the gratest acters today.<BR>And back to our story jessica look's for a way to get back to her-self. Mean-while jessica missed her boyfriend .She tried talling him the truth but he didnt believe jessica that she is a boy.<BR>At the end jessica found out that the earrings were the cause of all that happened. She went to conflict wuth the man that has her body.<BR>All the story is in a defined time , because she needed to get the earrings back together befor the full moon stricks or else she would stay in that boby forever.<BR>The story is lened with funny scenes.
B00005Y7GQ|2.0|Dare no one criticize the \\"king of comedy\\" stephen Chow or, OK, most of you westerners may have a different taste.<BR>From the point of view of a Hong Kong born native speaker of cantonese, I have no choice but to say that Shaolin Soccer was overrated. SC's hilarious jokes went stale and he was too obssesed with the use of special effect too. This movie makes me miss his past works like \\"from beijin with love\\", etc so much.<BR>another point is that, SC are now more concern of the market of the rest of Asia and even Western, he eliminates all jokes which only locals find funny. So to me, as a Hong Kong people, I am disappointed.
B0000024K1|1.0|Why have I been wasting my time listening to Charlie Parker and Claude Debussy all these years? What ever made me think that Aretha Franklin and Gundula Janowitz could actually sing? I must have been high. THIS is the great work of true musical genius that all mankind has been waiting for. It marks the culmination and final, greatest achievement of the human race. What have we left to live for? It's all downhill from here, folks, so let's end it now, on a high note, and go out in a blaze of glory.
B00005KARK|5.0|Made in the 40s and still appreciated by yours truly now. My favorite scene is when Dumbo and the mouse fall into the well and his wine in it. they get so drunk and they ended up hallucinating for like a 10 minute long substance abuse horror scene for children. honestly, unless you are taking shots of cheap vodka or smoking out of your buddies pipe whose name is an inside joke, do not let your kid see this part. (OR ANYOTHER SCENE because I remember crying when I was a little kid when Dumbo goes in a different cage than his mom on the circuis train and they get separated). <BR>Anyways, about that scene. why does it last so long? was it like an inside joke to all the older viewers? i think this movie was the origin of the timeless hallucination of pink elephants. it is so trippy like when the elephants combine and they shoot into the sky or something like that and everything turns into fire works. <BR>the next morning dumbo and his mouse friend end up in a tree and they're like man what happened.
B000066NW0|1.0|The reviewer below needs to calm down a bit. It is NOT true that Avril Lavigne is God and knows all the answers to the riddles of the universe. Difficult as it is to fathom, Avril is still just a mortal human being, like you or me. It IS true, however, that Avril combines the musical abilities of Mozart and Duke Ellington all rolled up in the hottest little package ever known to mankind. That much I WILL grant you.<br />In terms of her singing voice, if Renee Fleming and Aretha Franklin had a lovechild (now THERE'S a thought!), and if that child had been given the finest musical training from the age of 2 to, say, late middle age, acquiring the emotional maturity of the seasoned artist while still maintaining the freshness of a young ingenue...then we might have something approaching the spectacular abilities of the awesome AVRIL. <br />In terms of her lyric-writing ability, if you were to take Shakespeare, Pushkin, and Noel Coward, and mix 'em all up and give them astounding insight into the minds of all the 12-year-old middle-class white girls in North America, encompassing all their joys and sorrows and profound musings on life, love, and the unified field theory, then you might get some inkling of what AVRIL is capable of, with her Zen-like haikus and infinitely subtle prosody and wordplay illuminating the human condition to its very core.<br />So, while I am not quite ready to make a graven image of her and offer up my firstborn, I am willing to concede that we are very lucky indeed to be living at this hour, when Avril walks among us. Cherish this moment in history. We shall not look upon her like again.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This is definately one of my favorite albums.<br />A 180 in a style change from Beck's norm, and I loved it.  Every song envokes so much emotion, it's almost overwhelming.  There really isn't much I can say.  Favorite track on the album is &quot;Paper Tiger&quot;.  Check it out, really, you should.
B000084T18|1.0|This would win the Gold. I cannot understand for the life of me how this cd made so many &quot;best of&quot; lists last year.  This dude's flow makes him sound mildly retarded this is worse than Chingy.  I've been a fan of Hip Hop for going on 2 decades now and I realize that everybody complains about the sorry state the music is in, I don't think that's true.  Mainstream Rap music might be at an all time low as far as creativity and talent, but the underground is flourishing.  Avoid garbage like 50 Cent at all costs, check out artists with something to say like Blackalicious, Jurassic 5, Madlib, El-P, hell even Outkast.  This is exploitative trash and 50 Cent must have gotten some serious brain damage on one of those occasions when he was shot.  If you really like your rappers with plenty of bullet scars go buy an ODB cd.
B000096IBI|5.0|Modern times was a smart comedy in the previous years to WW2.<br />Charlot made raptures images in several sequences.<br />Our unlucky or disadapted little man , definitively wasn{t made for working with the industrial process. This kinetic introduction in the middle of the complex mecahnism of machine systems is a issue to develop unforgettable laughable situations. The sense of alienation in front the no ending belt , causes in him an insane loss of the reality. And the machine who feeds you without waste of time for your employers is a classic.<br />Obviously Charlot inspired himself in Metropolis, the bitter nightmare of Fritz Lang from 1927. (Watch for instance for the employer who works around the machine control) .<br />So our beloved anti hero goes out from this the factory to the hospital and over and over he tries to get a job but he fails , by one reason or another.<br />In the middle of the film will appear a deep inspiration. The eternally beauty Paulette Godard represents exactly that weird mix teenager-woman who will work out as link for him later.<br />He is a guy with good feelings. He acts always as humanity benefactor but the long arm of the fate runs behind him and the results are not succesful.<br />The sequences in the dinner hall with the chicken that never comes to the impatient client is a masterpiece. Literally it's a funny coreography dance in the purest sense of the word.<br />Smile ; no matter what's wrong with you. We'll keep ahead , overcoming all the possible obstacles.<br />A remarkable film and one of the landmark pictures of this timeless genius.<br />Haven't you seen it? Make yourself a favour and buy it as a gift for you or your wife or fiancee or kids. This film will never dissapoint you , at least in the next three hundred years.
0446677450|5.0|A life changing read. Reminds me of &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; by Matt Pasquinilli. Both books are new directions in thinking - they both are the beginning of a movement. As a parent, I wanted financial security and freedom for my family. This book changed my thinking and changed my habits. I am now financially secure and able to buy/invest in all the things my family deserves. Get this book and buy &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; to change the way you parent and to give you more freedom to parent.
B000063DHK|5.0|I can review this quite simply by saying that a friend of mine who is a muscian and into all sorts of music has said &quot;This recording ruined a lot of concerts/live recordings for me&quot;.  He would go to shows or buy live recordings and be let down by the lack of energy, or the band sounding totally different live.  I feel this is the standard for live recordings for metal bands, thought not perfect it is an excellent addition into any Maiden fans collection.  It's hard to believe how big Iron Maiden was back then without any radio air play in the US, and yet they sold out show after show in the largest arenas.  I feel LAD captures everything that propelled Maiden to the top.
B00005JMKI|5.0|Let me start off by warning people that this movie not for everyone.  Due to the length of the film and its nature - its filmed on a sound studio with the set outlined as though with chalk and many of the props are mimed - many viewers will feel alienated.  That said, this alienation is what makes this film so fascinating and original.<br /> The film is firmly in the tradition of the influential playwright and theorist Brecht.  Simply listening to the song Pirate Jenny  from Threepenny Opera which has been recorded by countless major musicians will give you incite into Nicole Kidman's character in the film.  While you watch the movie you are constantly reminded that it is a film because of the set, the scenes being divided into chapters where you are told what will take place in each segment, and the actors characterizations which are broad and somewhat grotesque.  Much has been made out of the films alleged anti-american sentiment but i disagree.  I think it's somewhat incidental that the film is set in America.  It seems more of a parable about human cruelty and greed as opposed to a statement about american nature.  <br />The alienation we experience allowed me to feel like it was a piece more about questions than answers.  Whenever I felt like I was too emotionally immersed in the piece, the constant reminders that it was a film distanced me from these emotions and caused me to step back and analyze the situation.   While the film certainly took me on an emotional ride it reinforced that it was an artistic work reminding me to step back and take a more  \\"scientific\\" look at it. <br />Additionally, the performances in this film are not to be missed and the plot contains surprising elements.  Kidman is fantastic; emotionally deep and fully immersed in what she's doing and the rest of the cast is filled with A-list actors of the highest quality.
B00005JMEW|1.0|What a waste of time, money, air, breath, fake blood, stunt men, wirework, etc, etc, ad nauseam (and there was a lot of that). This is just crap. It doesn't even get any better on double speed when they all sound like Chip and Dale. <br />Tarantino is the nerdy kid that got picked on at school all grown up and now he's laughing as he takes his vengeance out on you the viewer. <br />Watch anything else, for your own sake, please. I mean that, anything. Well, maybe not 'Battlefield Earth' but even then it's a toss up.

1587990717|1.0|(...)  There's nothing here which would surprise anyone even remotely acquainted with the market; it's just a shallow and poorly-structured rehash of well-known ideas, mixed in with a few ill-timed rants and some copious name-dropping by the author.  If you're interested in behavioural economics (which I heartily recommend), then try Belsky &amp; Gilovich's popular book or some of the excellent online articles; if you want market war stories, then &quot;Liar's Poker&quot;, &quot;When Genius Failed&quot;, and &quot;Inventing Money&quot; are all far better bets.<br />The one thing I can say in Taleb's praise is that he raises some nice ironies in a self-reflexive sort of way.  One of his &quot;big ideas&quot; is survivorship bias, to which the publication of this book provides a counter-example.
0061015725|2.0|I'm going to keep this review short.  Just wanted to give a rating so that system is fair, meaning the ratings are not filled with all 5 star people telling you to buy it.<br />The book was ok.  Read other peoples' poor ratings.
0393324818|3.0|I saw Michael Lewis interviewed on Television prior to purchasing which prompted my purchase.  Further, I am a long time Michael Lewis fan ... apart of the wonderful cult that has read and re-read liars poker.  <br />I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with this book.  While I like baseball, and it told a decent story -- I just couldn't see the purpose of the story.  It lacked a lot of the zest portrayed by the characters within Liar's Poker (the Michael Lewis standard) <br />Sure, I love the concept of thinking outside the box, and enjoy the quips encrusted within the wisdom, but it was very difficult for me to envision the bigger message I think Lewis was trying to convey.  It just seemed like a story of someone using the Internet and statitistics in a neat and innovative way -- in a very traditional almost elitist industry.  Makes 300 pages too long.<br />A fair book, but I would wait until it was on paperback or pick it up in the library.<br />Hope this helps!
B00005Y7KX|4.0|the costumes and narration of this classic book made into an epic drama are fantastic, however there are some times that the play drags, making you wonder when the next BANG is going to come.  The characters are fantastic, and the idea that Esmerelda is hung for a crime she did not commit is Tragic, as the book was meant to be.  <br />This play was true to the book, unlike the disney fairytake, and Garou did a fabulous job really playing the belle ringer of notre dame as a fearful creature with a tender heart.  The genius way the light of a rose window is reflected on stage made the whole place come alive.  I would definately love to own this movie.
B0001XWV12|5.0|really good movie!!!!<BR>question though? did any one see both this and the unrated version? was there any diffrence in the special features or the movie itself? Was it worth buying that kind instead of the R rated one?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The first time I saw this film I was BLOWN AWAY by the songs, the visuals, and the performances.  Even the people who hate this movie have to love the sequence where &quot;Roxanne&quot; is turned into an erotic Tango!<br />This is the film that brought the musical back to the modern screen, filling a definite void that can not quite be captured by animated Disney movies with songs.  While the story is nothing original (and, actually, neither are most of the songs as they are new arrangements of existing songs), what Baz Luhrmann has does is infuse the excitement of bohemian Paris into the minds and hearts (and tapping feet) of a modern audience.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor turn out incredible performances, but the one who steals the show for me is Jim Broadbent--watch this film and relish in his performance as Harold Ziegler, and then flip to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; and enjoy his performance as Bridget's dad.  <br />Who should watch this?  Hopeless romantics, music lovers, film students, theatre majors, and everyone in between.
0345446798|5.0|I LOVED This book. I've read many books on dog training &amp; this one is truly wonderful.  It provides tons of great information on dog behavior &amp; on dog-human interactions.  Very easy to read &amp; understand.  McConnell is also a very witty, entertaining author.  This is truly one of the best dog behavior books I have ever read!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I own this.  I love this.  My favorite thing about the movie was the new arrangements of these great songs, and to have them all on one CD is heaven for long car trips.  I'd like to meet the person who can listen to the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; without smiling.  <br />The one issue I have with this CD, however, is that Jim Broadbent's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was not included and relegated to the vol. 2 of the soundtrack.  But McGregor and Kidman sound great in their respective songs, and the voices of all the characters blend nicely in the large ensemble pieces.
B00004U3UG|5.0|I've seen the U.S. theatrical cut of this film a number of times, so I bought the Director's cut (ASIN B00005QW4K) when it first came out.  I finally got around to watching it recently, and I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed with this particular edition.  If you want to see the director's cut, I'd recommend you go with the &quot;Boomstick Edition&quot;, which also includes the U.S. theatrical release.<br />There were a number of flaws in this particular DVD.  The first thing I noticed was really bad pixellation in many scenes.  They did a great job in many cases of cleaning up any scratches or flaws in the source film, but then they did a really bad job of DVD compression.  I'm sure the other editions aren't any worse on that score, and hope that they're better.<br />Also, this cut is actually missing some of my favorite scened and lines.  The worst offense is that the line &quot;Good, bad - I'm the guy with the gun&quot; (which for me has always epitomized Ash) was replaced by &quot;I'm not that good&quot;.  In the commentary, Campbell and Raimi actually note that they prefer the &quot;Good, bad&quot; line...  So why not include it in the &quot;director's cut&quot;?<br />They also deleted an early fight scene, just after Campbell's arrival, and went back to what was apparently the original ending.  I really liked the ending in S-Mart, though.  I also found the editing on the windmill scene in this edition less cohesive than the theatrical release.<br />The commentary by Campbell and Raimi was very good, since those two have a long history together, and really seem to have loved making this movie.  Still, though, it was clear that they could see some of the same issues I mentioned above, leaving me baffled as to why they didn't work together to make this edition a true reflection of what they think the &quot;best&quot; version of &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; would be.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This movie had the potential to turn totally cheesy--a stranger from another place moves into town, opens a chocolate shop, people think she's crazy and bad, and then they all realize she's good and everyone gets happy.<br />What saves this from happening, however, are the performances turned in by Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina, and Johnny Depp.  You feel Binoche's restless spirit being pulled by the desire to provide a stable existence for her daughter.  You feel Molina's pain with a wife that has left him, but still trying to keep it together with a tough exterior that turns the town against him.  And who better than to epitomize the river gypsy than Johnny Depp?  <br />This movie is like making chocolate: it takes some work in the beginning to get it going, but once it gets in the oven (stove?  wherever you make chocolate) and the smells start to waft over you, it is delightful and pleasant right up through swallowing the last bit.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|When I first played this CD I didn't like it. I just put in my home system and played it sort like background music. I filed it away and about month later on a whim took it along to play on the way to work. I didn't realize how good it was till I cranked it up. I stuff is best played LOUD. Crank it up to 11 and you'll love it
B000060OFT|2.0|Maybe my viewing experience of this film was tainted when, while seeing it in the theatre, one of the 13 year old girls sitting in the row in front of me turned to the other and said, \\"is Leo going to talk link this THE WHOLE TIME?\\".  <br />For a Shakespeare purist (as I am myself), the problem is not the modernization of the setting and the use of the language in that setting (I personally love it), but it's the absolutle murder of the language by the majority of the cast that makes my skin crawl.  This movie, in terms of the execution of the script, does a disservice in getting kids hooked on the poetry of Shakespeare's writing.  <br />However, I will admit that visually it's great.  The setting is apt.  Mercutio is amazing.  But, teachers, I would think twice about showing this version to your class.
B000092Q4U|4.0|When I first saw the 11th Hour video, I loved it and decided to get this cd. I must say that even though Ilistened to this for quite a while, I eventually did get tired of it but now I enjoy listening to it every now and then. As others have said it does get repetitive but its not so bad that it deserves a really low rating. I skip a few songs no matter what, but most are just good head banging metal. I am looking foward though to seeing them live this summer with some other great bands. Anyway pick it up for some good times but don't expect anything incredibly original or groundbreaking.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I would caveat my review with the fact that I am not a church-goer, nor have I ever taken the time to read the bible (as yet).  I am however, a believer of Christ.<br />I had heard about the film at the same time I also heard about the anti-semetic tags that were being pronouned on its director and determined to judge for myself, I went to see it.   The cinema was full and I sat down a mix of nervous anticipation and the feeling what I can only describe as \\"voyeristic guilt\\" swept over me..<br />(I won't waste your time by detailing elements of the film - there are enough synopsis-laden reviews present..)<br />The film to be frank, is unrelenting and contains some of the most brutal violence likely to be ever shown on screen.  However, it is entirely because of this that \\"The Passion\\" is so totally compelling..  Mel Gibson's direction at times has been to throw the camera right in the midst of the torture; basically where you would least prefer to look if you were given a choice.  In doing this, you are conciously reminded that the beatings, the flagilation and ultimately the cruxifiction are not areas to be shyed away - there is no luxery of choice in watching this film.. <br />Despite the unrelenting bloodiness, \\"The Passion\\" also captures a quiet tenderness within the flashback sequences..  The flashbacks between a young Jesus and his mother Mary are only for a few minutes, but they provide a massive understanding towards Mary's struggle to find and comfort her dying son.  <br />In its finality people can mock the film, asking \\"where's the laughs\\"... or people can question the religous continuity within the Bible.  I am not here to do that.  I am thankful that such a masterpiece has been made that has given me the understanding of Jesus and how he died without forcing its own opinion down my throat.
B0000666DW|5.0|I had heard some people say some good things about this group, so since I couldn't think of any other cds that I currently wanted at the time, I went and got it. Boy am I glad that I did cause this cd is wonderful. The whole thing is great from start to finish which isn't too common in today's music. Some songs start out brutal and keep it like that all the way through, while others have beautifuly done slow melodic parts and then go into the heavy stuff which is a great change for metal bands. Also the drumming is fantastic on here. Anyway be sure to grab this now cause they are definitely worthy of your listening pleasure and money.
B00005N5S2|4.0|This was a good movie, it could have been a great movie but it fell short in a couple places.  The performance by Gregory Peck was great (almost in George C. Scott league but not quite).  The performance by the supporting actors was not bad, especially the guys that played Truman and Roosevelt.<br />I think where the movie fell short was that it seemed too jumpy.  The scenes of his battles (both military and political) seemed short.  There didn't seem to be closure on the battles other than jumping to the next battle to be fought.  I've never seen the uncut version, so  I don't know if that's addressed there.  It seems like this movie would have been better served with another hour at least.<br />I would have to say my favorite aspect of the movie was his warning as he was fired.  Namely that you should never tell the military to fight a war of half measures.  Also, that Congress shouldn't shirk its responsibility by not declaring war.
0156027321|5.0|Good storytelling in this age is quite rare.  Rarer still is an engaging story with a sustaining set of characters to draw you in and teach you about what it means to be a human being.  There is plenty of plot summary elsewhere to give you a sense of what the book is about.  What you won't know until you read it is how deceptively simplistic those synopses are.  Long ago, I actually decided not to read the book after reading such a summary.  What a mistake!<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is without a doubt the best work of contemporary fiction I've read since &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay&quot;.  The story's elements are simple and straightforward, but the author's voice is charming, intelligent and insightful.  What I found so remarkable about a book advertised for it's &quot;inventiveness&quot; is the degree of realism.  In many ways, Martel's style reminds me of the great &quot;magical realists&quot; like Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Pi's fascination with religions and his attention to the detailed inner workings of zoo management are illuminating.  Never before has such an eloquent case been made for the civility of a zoo (I suppose it would take a zoo run by a vegetarian family to make such a place civil).<br />Naturally, the story really finds its legs once Pi is stranded at sea with wounded animals.  It is a testament to the author's abilities that 227 days on the ocean can be filled with such immediacy and interest.  Pi's journey is a story of resilience and determination...a desire to go on living when there is seemingly no point in doing so.  Throughout it all, Pi suffers with dignity and pride, engaging his plight head-on, digging in his heels and sticking it out until the end.  What's staggering is how lively and redemptive such an experience can be.  This book is funny, informative and surprisingly fast-paced given the fact that the narrator is adrift at sea.
0385335482|5.0|After reading this book, the first of her trilogy on character Becky Bloomwood I was instantly hooked.  I don't even know why I picked it up at Barnes &amp; Noble, but I did and I'm sure glad I did.<br />I never considered myself a shopaholic and after reading this, I know that I definitely am not a shopaholic.  When you're done with this one, pick up Shopaholic takes Manhattan.  The wit and antics are great and it gets even better in her second book.  The surprises are awesome!  In the third book, the antics become a little less petty, but the shopping doesn't stop!  Shopaholic ties the knot, which i'm almost done with, is another great one.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird was an amazing book, and I loved it! It displayed the many hardships of growing up, as portrayed through the eyes of young Jem and Jean Louise, &quot;Scout&quot;, Finch. From the beginning of the book we realizes that the Finches are among the intelligent and &quot;well-brought-up-folk&quot; in society, and with their name comes certain expectations. &quot;Scout&quot; is expected to act more like a lady and less like a tomboy. Jem is expected to act like a gentleman, and Atticus Finch, a lawyer and there father is expected to raise his children up to act like the lady and the gentlemen that they are. I could relate to many of these expectations, but the trails don't cease here in fact the above don't even scratch the surface, but you'll have to read to find out more. However, the main conflicts in this novel come about when Atticus begins representing a young black man Tom Robinson in court, and society turns against him in his pursuits due to Tom's race. In conclusion not only was I able to relate to this book; I also learned the lesson, which everyone should gather in a book filled with them: Prejudice and hatred toward people of a different race leads only to destruction, and the wound from such destruction is not easily mended. It leaves a scar that will last for lifetime, teaching the generations to come the importance of equality. So, if you're looking for an insightful novel packed with many side plots and interest I would definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions is a GREAT movie. It is sexy, witty, and thrilling. It is highly reccommended, and so is this Special Edition DVD (it has very good special feautires). If you liked this movie I would recommend \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\", which was made in 1988 and won 5 Academy Awards. Cruel Intentions is based on that movie, but they were all originally based on \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" which is a very popular classic book!

Her voice left a lasting impression on me...I never get tired of this album. Buy it!...it is a keeper!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It was wonderful.  It came to me at a time of uncertainty in my own life, and it made me feel human again.  The imagery and humor made the film come to life, and the performances by Johansson and Murray were perfect.  It reminded me that sometimes the best thing in your life, or for your life, is not necessarily in front of your face.  <BR>Everyone seems to have a mixed view of this film.  Watch it and decide for yourself what it means to you.

B00008G9JO|5.0|If you own one or two Tull CD's, most likely they are &quot;Aqualung&quot; or &quot;Crest of Knave&quot;, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is an overlooked Tull masterpiece that deserves to be in your collection as well! All of the songs are classic Tull numbers that show why this band has been able to maintain such a strong following for four decades. &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; features what I think is the most beautiful &quot;rock&quot; song ever recorded in &quot;Moths&quot;. &quot;Moths&quot; never fails to give me goosebumps when I hear it. The way this little acoustic number builds on itself, adding instruments as it progresses is something everyone should hear. As a lifetime Jethro Tull fan, &quot;Moths&quot; is my favorite Tull tune period. Besides &quot;Moths&quot;, &quot;Horses&quot; also features other great songs by a band in their prime. &quot;Weathercock&quot;, &quot;Wild Acres&quot; and the title track are simply great songs, Rock, Folk or whatever label you want to throw on them. I just have to mention &quot;No Lullaby&quot; as well as I have seen several reviewers say they just didn't care for it. If you listen to Barriemore Barlow's drum work on &quot;Lullaby&quot; you will be hooked. His drum work is amazing on this song, and the whole disk. If you have even a passing interest in Tull you should buy this disk.

0684803356|5.0|FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS takes place in the space of three days, and Hemingway narrates nearly every moment in 471 pages. When reading large sections in one sitting, I really felt the weight of the experience settle on me. The novel also begins to feel increasingly existentialist as the absurdity of the structures of war and death play out for the characters involved. During &quot;marathon&quot; reading sessions on three different days, I came to see this as a literary, &quot;real time&quot; adventure, as Hemingway details almost every moment in the characters' lives.<br /><br />The novel starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a &quot;code hero,&quot; a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now &quot;gone bad.&quot; He cares primarily for his horses. His &quot;woman&quot; Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the &quot;love interest.&quot;<br /><br />I love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is explosed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.<br /><br />The story becomes existential, very Kafkaesque, as well, when one character's interactions with command are relayed by Hemingway. I laughed allowed at the absudities, but was struck by the dire consequences of these ridiculous desicions and actions. These situations show the war machine's indifference to individual human life and the ridiculous scenarios that arise from various leaders' individual conceits and worries.<br /><br />I think that the book's time frame of only three days makes a strong point about war and the people one serves with. For the reader, the band in the mountains are basically the only people Robert Jordan knows (though there are brief flashbacks). One can see how those who fight together can bond so deeply in a short period of time, as practically every moment is laden with portent and their fate as a group turns on such small things as an evening snowfall.<br /><br />I unequivocally recommend this book.ves with them in the mountains.

B0001WTUH6|5.0|UNDERWORLD, watch this interesting battle between (not humans as one would think) but Vampires versus Lycans (werewolves)<br /> Selene (Kate Beckinsale of Pearl Harbor fame) is a Beautiful Vampire Soldier (Death Dealer) whose purpose is to hunt down and kill any Werewolves she comes across, until one day (or night it is always dark it seems) she comes across a human Micheal who the Lycans are trying to capture. Well of course she falls for this guy and the plot gets more intense as it moves along between betrayal, power struggles and internal conflict which brings the film to an interesting (and bloody of course) end. (No doubt there will be a sequel) <br />The setting is very dark and &quot;gothic&quot;. It seems like it is always raining and cold looking (which adds to the feeling of this film). Costumes are also the type seen in the usual Gothic Vamp circles. Action scenes are pretty good as well (enter the Matrix).<br /> It was a sleeper hit last October and it continues to draw crowds of viewers.  I saw the normal DVD (rented) and liked it so much I picked up the Extended version (2 DVD set unrated) it adds about 20 min more to the film and comes with some interesting extras.  I particularly liked the documentary called Fangs or Fiction which touches on the history of Vampire, Werewolf Myths and Legends and even has an interview with a &quot;real&quot; Werewolf as well as two &quot;real&quot; Vampires. <br /> If you like Vampire movies (or Vampire stuff in general)or are into the Goth scene, this film will satisfy both (or are both the same? hmm...)<br /> I give it 5 stars, and look for a sequel or even a prequel in the next year or so.

1563892278|5.0|... at least not if you're only getting started in comics. I say this because the Sandman series is among the finest comics you will ever find.<br />In fact, &quot;comic&quot; is too small a word. So is &quot;graphic novel,&quot; which is most often used by adults who are trying not to feel silly about reading comics. Sandman is one of those rare comics that transcend the medium. This is no mere comic book.<br />This is fiction, with artwork. This is visual storytelling, a modern descendent of humanity's earliest art forms. Don't let the &quot;comic book&quot; label fool you. This is a full-fledged book.<br />The entire 10 volume Sandman series centers around Morpheus, the Dream King. One of The Endless, he is one of seven eternal beings who are the embodiments of abstracts. Dream's older sister Death makes an appearance in the final chapter in this volume.<br />Other reviewers have criticized this volume for not being very representative of the series on the whole, and that is true. But this volume is a supremely important one becuase it lays the groundwork for everything that follows.<br />Not only that, it's very entertaining in it's own right. Chapters like A Hope In Hell, The Sound of Her Wings, or 24 Hours are extraordinary examples of comics at their best. Any one of those stories makes this volume worth owning, but you get all three of them, plus five more chapters as well.<br />If you already read comics, then by all means buy this book (and the other nine volumes, too). But if you're just getting started in comics, you should seriously think about starting somewhere else.<br />Because once you've read Sandman, you're going to be spending a lot of time in a mostly fruitless search for more books that are as good as this series.<br />Seriously.  It's that good.  10 out of 10
0316168815|5.0|Loved it.  Unpredictable and honest.  The reactions of the characters to Susie's death were real.  Susie herself was a realistic and honest narrator.  The author captures human emotion and makes these characters and the chaos surrounding them so believeable that you'll find yourself thinking about the novel's events as non-fiction.  I cried more than I'd like to admit and plan on re-reading it soon.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album is very interesting.  If you've heard it before, then you know what I mean.  The songs are pretty long but that really shouldn't be a factor in anything, because the songs are classics.<br />1.Mysterons-There is this one part in the song (I think it's after the chorus) and it's just this really cool instrumental.  Onto the song, I think they were smart to have this song as the opener.<br />2. Sour Times- &quot;Nobody loves meeeeeee, it's true.&quot; wails Beth.  This song is a very good song, and, with msot of their songs, there are some creepy instrumentals. <br />3. Strangers-  Not a personal favorite of mine, but I think that this song is an excellent song in terms of jsut vocals. <br />4. It Could Be Sweet- A rather unforgettable song, with the singer going &quot;I don't wanna loooose what we had....&quot; <br />5.Wandering Star- This is a very good song, one of my favorites.  I don't know exactly why, but it's just a good song. <br />6.It's A Fire-  Not as good as the upcoming song, but it's still a pretty good song... <br />7. Numb- Probably my favorite song. There is just something eerie about how she goes &quot;Still feeling lonely, feeling so unholy&quot; <br />8.Roads- This song is a little slower (well none of the songs are exactly fast paced, but this is almsot like a &quot;ballad&quot;, if there is such a thing in Portishead Trip Hop. <br />9.Pedestal- I can't seem to make it through this song, it just seems a little too boring.  <br />10. Biscuit-Good, but you can tell that this album is almsot over. <br />11. Glory Box- I like it, but it doesn't seem to be an appropriate closing song, but maybe it's just me.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This album is written well for the first album sung in English by Shakira. All the English songs are good except for Ready for the good times and the English version of Ojos Asi(Eyes Like Yours).In Spanish Ojos Asi has more of a fast beat, it is much better. Que Me Quedes Tu, Te Dejo Madrid, and the Spanish versions of Whenever Wherever, and Objection Tango are better in Spanish. Overall it's a good CD and I would recommend you buy this Cd before you buy an all Spanish Cd because you can learn some of the songs on this Cd en espanol.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ill tell you one thing: when i first heard of slipknot making a new album, i thought it will be the heavier thing i ever heard, but when the album came out, after reading the reviews, i was a little scared, because they said it was like stone sour, and i didnt like stone sour, but after hearing prelude 3.0, my mind simply blow away, i was listening to the best slipknot cd, i havent heard any better cd since marilyn mansons antichrist superstar, or nine inch nailss downward spiral, it is truly dark and beautiful, i completely recomend this cd, ACCEPT THE CHANGE MAGGOTS
B00005JMEW|5.0|Although at times it can be a little far-fetched, this movie is pretty good. I think Quentin made Uma a little too good at times though, because it can be a little boring when she has no competition. What I mean? The action is great but it is a little one-sided most of the time as Uma decimates anyone in the area without sweating.<br />The film is interesting though. The start is pretty interesting, as well as the bleeps. The black and white and anime scene are clever. Also, the movie doesn't go in order exactly which is interesting. All these different things make the movie a different experience, which is a good thing.<br />5 stars!!!!!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|In today's cinematic world, silent movies are often a difficult category to approach.  Silent movies are usually referred to almost like a separate genre, as if black and white movies were a single genre.  Even silent flick enthusiasts sometimes don't have the right attitude, because the modern appreciation of pre-talkie movies is sometims nothing more shallow than appreciation of a movie because it is a silent movie.  This attitude streams from the modern audience that views the silent era as embryonic of the talkies, as technologically handicapped, when in fact, the contemporary audiences of the 20's did not view their motion pictures the same way.<br />Metropolis is a great move that overcomes most of the barriers between moderns audiences and silent movies.  The genre is unmistakably sci-fi--the forerunner to nearly all modern sci-fi movies.  It was a fantastic movie that just happens to be a silent movie, and anybody who sees it will understand that silence is not a handicap.<br />The biggest barrier for silent movies is that there are usually variant DVD editions in circulation, and unlike pictures made in the last few decades, it really does matter which edition you see.  Kino's restored edition is (and shall be for a while if not forever) the definitive edition of Metropolis.  I had been viewing an incomplete, incoherent version of the film for years before i treated myself to Kino's delightfully exhaustive work, and it was then that i realized what i had been missing.  Watching this version was like watching a different movie.  In fact, the restoration is so immaculate, it was like watching a movie that was just filmed yesterday, or rather, like i was watching it in 1926.<br />Kino should be praised for the edition (which they have been), that vindicates fans of Metropolis, sci-fi, and silent movies.  Even the flaws are reasonable: some scenes are missing, but they are filled in with explanations and still photos, when available; there could have been enough extras to fill 2 more discs, although the extras included are sufficient and repeatable, as compared to the loads of extras fans normally demand but rarely ever watch.<br />All in all, this is an excellent restoration of an epic movie that deserves this treatment and attention.  Include the Kino version in your collection over all of the inferior versions circulating.
0446677450|5.0|Robert elegantly and simply explains the pitfalls of what the majority of people are doing with their finances.  He educated me on how valuable investing in real estate is, and caused me to realize that no job (employer), no matter how good it is will use its profits to make me rich.<br />I have read almost all the books in this series and HIGHLY recommend them to my friends.  Especially the my friends I know are struggling financially.<br />The concept of living on 70% of what you make, and saving 10%, investing 10%, and giving charitably 10%, when used, transforms how you look at money.  It made me realize the abundance I have in finances, and how bless God has made me.<br />I hope those who will benefit from this knowledge will find the time to read this valuable book.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This cast recording is simply amazing! I'm in love with the music and I haven't even seen the show. Both leading ladies have terrific voices and kudos to Menzel, who just won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Elphaba, the &quot;wicked&quot; witch.
B000268QB2|5.0|Half the reviews you will see on this page are written by people who play guitar and are sick of bands like Coldplay and Keane who are making it big without emphasis on the guitar.  Keane is an innovative band who has been able to create rock music without guitars (except the occaisional bass guitar).<br />I for one am sick of guitar!!  Don't get me wrong, guitar has its place in rock music but it is overused and it has contributed to the degradation of the quality of music in America for the last 10 years or so.  It needs to be on an equal footing with all other instruments.  Many artists have restricted themselves to using just guitar and it shows.  Why limit your artistic output to just one instrument?<br />Keane themselves do not oppose guitar.  Their guitarist left them  early on and ever since they have been at their present 3 members.  Tom Chaplin is an amazing vocalist somewhere in between Thom Yorke of Radiohead and Morten Harket of a-ha.  Keane has a sound that would appeal to more people than even a band like Coldplay and it is for this reason that I call Keane such a revolution.<br />They may not end up being popular here in the US (although in England their album has hit #1) but I would say almost anyone would like Keane (even those who don't like Radiohead or Coldplay).  I also don't see how anyone could compare this band to Coldplay.  A more accurate description would be that they sound like the old Radiohead, but Keane is a sound of their own.    I have a lot of experience in writing and listening to music and I know I probably sound very biased but Keane is a very talented band and their album is a monumental effort, especially considering this is their debut.  Don't listen to those people who ridicule Keane because they got rid of the guitar.  They're not an anti-guitar band; they just don't use one.  Is this a crime?  I say no as long as the music doesn't suffer and judging from this album, it definately doesn't.<br />LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.<br />If you get the album take note of Bend and Break, This is the Last Time, and Bedshaped.  Everybody's Changing is also popular with people and Somewhere Only We Know is Keane's breakout single that hit #3 on the UK charts.<br />By the way, I am American (not British like Keane) and I'm not some fanboy just writing a review to my favorite band.  This one's really worth a look.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I'M SO GLAD IT'S DURING MY LIFETIME! Josh Groban's voice is similar to the addiction of chocolate.  While reading the other reviews, people complained that he was &quot;opera&quot; and very bad at it, or too depressing.  Well, okay, sorry but have you listened to the CD?  Did you even pay attention to the lyrics of &quot;Never Let Go&quot;?  Lyrics that say: <BR>&quot;You don't have to close your eyes<BR>There is room for love again<BR>Ease the pain to realize<BR>All that love can be<BR>Forced apart by time and sand<br />Take a step and take my hand<BR>And don't let it go<BR>Never let go&quot;<br />Yep, that's depressing.  Sure, some of the songs are depressing but if you knew anything about the artist you would know that depressing songs are the song he loves to sing the most.  So why wouldn't he sing them?  He said himself that he doesn't feel comfortable singing happy songs.  <br />As for the &quot;opera&quot; title Josh himself said that he wouldn't be touching any of that material for many, many years.  He said his voice hasn't developed yet.<br />And, now, on to my review of &quot;Closer.&quot;  This is the first CD that I have actually counted down the days to its release.  Josh's voice is perfect, in my opinion.  And, although I am not a trained singer or fluent in Italian, Spanish, or French, when I listen to Josh sing, it doesn't matter if he doesn't pronounce the words right (although that I highly doubt that he sings any of it wrong.).  It's Josh's voice that keeps me mesmorized, not the nit-picky things.  If you love good music, an amazing voice, and swoon-worthy lyrics, &quot;Closer&quot; is perfect for you!  Although it is impossible for me to pick a single song that is my favorite, I will try:  &quot;Oceano&quot; is an amazing Italian song, a great way to start the CD.  &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; is all Josh.  He wrote it, he sings it, he plays the piano.  I guess I love it so much because I feel as if it's one step closer to who Josh is a person and what's going on in his mind and a look into his soul.  &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; is Josh.
B000062TU1|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan. i absolutely love Harry Potter and I think it's one of the best series for all ages. However, some things in this movie just don't work. Emma Watson's acting, for one. I know she was like, 10, when she made this movie, but it's some of the worst acting I'd ever seen. The special effects weren't great, but Chris Columbus followed the books perfectly, and overall, it wasnt so bad. Especially since it was the first movie and all.
6305508550|5.0|Anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment, an environment necessitating the need for cubicles, needs to go out right away and pick up a copy of \\"Office Space.\\" Created, written, and directed by Mike Judge-the same guy responsible for \\"Beavis and Butthead\\"-this 1999 movie perfectly captures the innumerable torments of the modern white-collar worker. The film did poor box office during its theatrical run, but has since become a massive cult classic on video and DVD. It's no wonder. The movie is funny, cynical, and is the only film in my opinion to adequately use rap music to great effect. To give you an idea of how popular this movie has become-my own mother has heard about the movie and made me rent it so she could watch it. Yep, when your own aging mom knows about a movie, you just know it has jumped the boundaries of a narrow audience and become a pop culture phenomenon. For those poor souls who waste the days of their lives imprisoned in a small box in some generic looking office building out in the suburbs, \\"Office Space\\" is the best way to channel your rage. It sure beats going postal, at least.<br />Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is the moral and physical center of \\"Office Space.\\" This young guy works at Initech, one of those late '90's computer tech firms that sprang up across the country like weeds. Peter hates his job, hates his bosses, and hates sitting in his cubicle listening to annoying co-workers. He especially despises Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), a vice-president of the company who takes great pleasure in asking Gibbons to work on the weekends even as he hassles him endlessly about those \\"TPS\\" reports. The problems don't stop there, though. Peter's girlfriend is a controlling personality with a decidedly loose sexual reputation. Gibbons trudges through his days, finding solace only in two sympathetic co-workers named Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). His neighbor in the apartment next to his, a construction worker named Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), provides an occasional breath of fresh air as well. Peter Gibbons's life is a complete disappointment, an endless march of days doing nothing more than updating computer programs for Y2K and sitting around in his generic apartment watching Kung Fu. Something has to change before Peter goes off his rocker, and after he visits an occupational hypnotist, it does.<br />After Dr. Swanson (Mike McShane) dies suddenly in the midst of hypnotizing Peter, Gibbons is a changed man. He saunters into work whenever he feels like it, wearing casual clothes and ignoring his bosses. He finally asks out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a cute waitress working at a restaurant called Chotchkie's, after months of indecision. After a midday fishing trip, Peter guts his catch on a huge stack of TPS reports. Something is definitely wrong with this guy. His friends worry about his reckless behavior, especially with a couple of consultants-the two Bobs-hired by Lumbergh to pare down the company lurking in the background, and try to shake him out of his malaise. Peter is undeterred and, when he learns his antics have actually garnered him a promotion while the consultants consign his two pals to the unemployment line, hatches a plot to bilk Initech out of a boatload of money. Predictably, the plans go horribly long, leaving Peter, Samir, and Michael in a desperate situation. Will the three survive to work another day? Will Peter find the fulfillment he's been seeking for so long? Will Bill Lumbergh ever quit saying \\"mmkay\\"? These questions, and many others, will find resolution at the conclusion of \\"Office Space.\\"<br />I'm not even going to waste time describing in detail the huge number of characters, all of them brilliant, who populate the universe of \\"Office Space.\\" Obviously, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) deserves special mention since he constitutes an entire subplot of the movie. Based on a series of short cartoons Judge made for \\"Saturday Night Live\\"in the early 1990s, Milton is quite a character. You'll either love him or hate him; I liked some of his shtick (the stapler, the cake), but thought he detracted somewhat from the main plot involving Peter Gibbons. What really stands out in the movie is the immensely quotable dialogue, some of it arguably the best lines in motion picture history (paraphrasing here):<br />\\"Somebody has a case of the Mondays!\\"<br />\\"He [Lumbergh] represents everything that is soulless and wrong.\\"<br />\\"Ha Ha-he's not related to Bill, is he?\\"<br />I could go on and on. For instance, the sound Peter makes when he learns from Joanna that she did indeed have a relationship with Lumbergh is priceless: it's the sound a person makes when the very essence of their being is wounded. The fantastic dialogue and horrifically true aphorisms virtually demand repeated viewings of this movie. Everyone who works should own a copy of \\"Office Space.\\"<br />I've never met anybody who doesn't like this movie. Even my mom got a chuckle out of it. I drop anything I'm doing to watch it whenever it shows up on cable television. It's quite sad the film did poorly at the box office since a sequel, while it probably wouldn't have been as good as the original, could still have been great fun. Unfortunately, the DVD version of the movie is poor, with almost no extras worth mentioning. I'm praying the studio will release a special edition DVD at some point in the future with commentary tracks by Judge, Livingstone, Cole, Herman, Root, and other critical cast members. No other film in recent history deserves such a release more than \\"Office Space.\\" Yes, it's that good.in the early 1990s, Milton is quite a character.

B000089RVX|4.0|Rating the CD, I'd give them 4 stars. However, rating how they perform live, I'd have to give them one star just to be nice. The CD is amazing, and it's one of the best I've heard in the past year, but the live performance isnt great. Amy Lee has an amazing voice in the studio, but she can't pull it off singing live.
1592400876|4.0|I confess to walking into the Levi's Strauss store on union square (here in SF) and railing on the &quot;greeter&quot; about the sign that said &quot;All tee's on sale&quot;  And this was produced by an advertising agency!!  Of course, the teenage greeter looked perplexed and called me &quot;ma'am&quot; so I knew nothing would come of it.  But it did make me feel better.  Pick up this book, it is great.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold mountain really woke me up. Sure, we've all heard about wars. We've studied them, read about them, heard about them on the news but have u watched cold mountain? Of course i can't say a hollywood dramatization does war justice, but it got my attention. The story is about a man in the civil war who gets a letter from his lonely and poor girlfriend to come home. He braves all sorts of peril to return to her. It's sad, dramatic, romanic, funny, and ironic, but so, so, so good. I loved it. A word to the wise: don't take the kids to this one, and if you're a kid: don't watch it with your parents.
B0000CABBW|5.0|There isn't much I'll be able to add to this movie's reviews besides validation: Castle-Hughes has the performance of her life, the story is touching, you're likely to spend some time sniffling, etc.  This film delivers on the hype - a great selection for your next family movie night.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I was just looking at some of the recent negative reviews for this CD which I guess is backlash from all the awards it has recieved.  Though this is not a truly great CD it is still good and an  excellent debut for a  young major artist.  She reminds me of IndiaArie and I believe she has the chops to really put out that great album soon if she is not to affected by all the hype.  Come away w/ me is a beautiful soft song and yes the lyrics do stay w/me throughout the day.

I loved the role he played in Secret Window but you would have probably never expected him to act that way in secret Window after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean!<br />Although there was a couple scary parts in the movie and a couple gory scenes I loved it and I could have went to see it 3 more times in theaters!!<br />I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and I probably always will be!

B000002LHT|4.0|Ramones have already positioned themselves as rock legends with their unique brand of hard, fast-paced, but yet catchy songs.  On their way to the 90s, they released &quot;Brain Drain&quot; which sounds like an 80s album, but the Ramones signature sound is definatly there.  Album highlights include &quot;I Believe In Miracles, Punishment Fits The Crime, Pet Semetary and Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight).  The album is mature indeed and all the Ramones are in fine tune.  This album also sees the exit of Dee Dee Ramone on bass guitar.<br />First-time listeners will wonder what all the hype was about the hard rockin' Ramones band, so I recommend you go with their self-titled LP or Rocket To Russia first before exploring the rest of the Ramones fine records.  But this album is definatly a worthy addition to the long-time Ramones fan or general rock collection, which any die-hard ramones fan will definatly agree with.
B00018D44U|3.0|I was a huge fan of &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; and to those of you who aren't a fan of her music, well that's like your opinion.  I feel sorry for you if all your music has to grab you by the balls and not let go.  Now, while that can music can also be good, so to can the subtle understated jazz sounds that come from Norah Jones.  Don't listen expecting the greatest album of all time; listen expecting to find what you don't know is there.

0446677450|1.0|I am sorry, but I don't believe anyone could honestly write a positive review about this \\"book\\". There is simply nothing in it! This book is nothing but a collection of useless stories and junk advice. I was looking for some concrete suggestions and ideas on how to improve my finances. What I got instead were some stories my 3 year old would not believe. This was not worth the $3 I spent to buy it at the used book store. Kyosaki must be a marketing genius, because that is what it would take to get so many people to buy this book. What a con!
B000002MP2|5.0|In my honest opinion, I believe this to be the best album Green Day has produced. &quot;Dookie&quot; was the album that finally got them recognition as a serious band and bought them an entire legion of fans. It also helped set the stage for a new generation of musicians and was one of the most influential albums of the '90s. A common complaint is that their sound was simple and sophomoric with &quot;Dookie&quot;, but I do not believe that to be the case. Sure, their later albums exhibit a different style in some aspects, but your liking of this album just depends on which type of music you're looking for. Another complaint I have heard is that &quot;Dookie&quot; lacks depth, and I believe that to be false because songs like &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, &quot;She&quot;, and &quot;F.O.D&quot; provide meaningful lyrics intertwined with catchy melody.<BR>       When &quot;Dookie&quot; is compared to later albums, the difference is noticeable, but Green Day can still retain their trademark sound and mature at the same time. Other bands have failed in doing that (i.e. blink-182). When I heard blink-182's self-titled album, I was throughly disappointed because while taking creative license, they totally screwed up their sound and the old blink is dilluted in a haze of special effects. I know I'm a little off-topic, but the point I am tyring to make is that Green Day got their start with the sound on Dookie and were able to build on it later in their career. But these loud, catchy, and sometimes profound tunes stay stuck in your head for days and allow you to see everything that is going on around you in a more comical way. There is not a bad song on the CD and I suggest in wholeheartedly.
B00005YUNY|4.0|This is Yes' best videotaped concert.  The band, in its many iterations, has come back from &quot;delirium&quot; many times in its 35 year history.  This DVD concert shows how they were, in 2002, able to combine their wisdom in sticking with their older, longer format songs with the subtle use of a small orchestra to &quot;fill in the gaps.&quot;  These guys are clearly older and a bit slower than they used to be, but, since they're such great musicians (unquestionably the most talented lineup of all rock bands), the quality of their performance is still outstanding.  As mentioned in other reviews, &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; is probably the best of the selected set list since it incorporates the orchestra the most effectively.  Yes pretty much sticks to pre-1975 releases with the exception of &quot;OOALH&quot; and three selections from &quot;Magnification,&quot; their fairly recent CD on which orchestral arrangements are overdubbed.  All in all, this is definitely a worthwhile and entertaining investment.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Any film that can assemble the breadth of talent that graces this offering AND permit each major actor just enough room to make his or her mark obviously has a lot going for it.  The roster reads like a who's who of British film, and the performances are highly polished. In short, this is a great product. Eight different love stories interweave (with Heathrow Airport acting as an anchor-point) and the film makes easy use of the kind of time-compression frequently seen in Shakespeare's plays (e.g. the action takes place over a few weeks but people accomplish tasks that would in reality take months). London itself also makes its presence felt - a glittery, clean London quite unfamiliar to those of us who've spent time there in real life. Many different kinds of love are in evidence: the love of a recently bereaved step-father for his step-son; the unexpected asexual love of an old reprobate rock star for his life's companion (his overweight male manager); the love of a man for his best friend's wife; the love of man for woman, of wife for straying husband.... and yet none of these summaries is really accurate, for each story, though sketched quickly, carries undertones. Although it would be easy to dismiss this film as lightweight, there are enough moments of pathos, of thoughtfulness, and of sheer charm to disarm all but the most curmudgeonly.  Seven of the eight love stories work their magic, so it would be churlish to complain that the eighth fails completely (for those of you wondering, it's the segment where a young Englishman heads to the USA and - quite unconvincingly - finds four beautiful young women who ravish him. This segment led me to suspect the writer had never actually been to the USA, where such behavior is about as likely as Neil Armstrong finding a McDonalds on the moon...).If you want an amusing, heartwarming product that is wonderfully devoid of violence and cynicism - basically the antithesis of vile concoctions like Kill Bill - then this is the movie for you.movie for you.

Ugly Kid Joe weren't named after a police man.<br />18. Fred Durst thinks he's a gangsta.<br />17. Pretty Boy Floyd weren't very pretty, and Ugly Kid Joe weren't very ugly.<br />16. Ugly Kid Joe were not even very good at being one hit wonders. They ended up with two.<br />15. One of the hits, \\"Cat's In The Cradle\\" is often thought to be a Cat Stevens song. It's not. Harry Chapin wrote it.<br />14. The other hit, \\"Everything About You\\" could never be confused with a Cat Stevens song, of which Mr Stevens is probably eternally grateful.<br />13. Cat Stevens is not called Cat Stevens any more. He converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam.<br />12. Harry Chapin was a proper one hit wonder. He wrote nothing else of note besides `Cat's In The Cradle'.<br />11. Pretty Boy Floyd weren't even one hit wonders. No one actually remembers anything about Pretty Boy Floyd except Ugly Kid Joe were named after them.<br />10. Well, Ugly Kid Joe's mascot and Fred Durst both wear red caps, so there's a bit of an influence.<br />9. `America's Least Wanted' has a cartoon of the Statue Of Liberty on it. Sacred Reich's `The American Way' and the Acid Drinkers' `Strip Tease' also had cartoons of the Statue Of Liberty on the cover.<br />8. `The American Way' and `Strip Tease' weren't very good.<br />7. The Statue Of Liberty came to life in Ghostbusters II. It wasn't very good either.<br />6. Outside the twohit songs, the rest of this album is filler.<br />5. Ugly Kid Joe singer Whitfield Crane ended up singing for the band Life Of Agony. It was about this time the rest of Life Of Agony discovered he was a crap singer. Millions of Americans already knew this, hence the fact they didn't want `America's Least Wanted'.<br />4. Life Of Agony weren't named after a gangster.<br />3. A lot of people would be very happy if Fred Durst gave up his music career for the Islamic religion. Except for the Muslims.<br />2. A lot of people wouldn't notice if Whitfield Crane gave up his music career for the Islamic religion.<br />And the number one, most important reason not to get `America's Least Wanted' is...<br />It's not very good.
1592400876|5.0|I decided not to use the Oxford comma in my title. This small little book by Lynn Truss is delightful, informative and oh-so-very-funny. Her snarky impatience and (duly admitted) neurotic round-up of punctuation rules, regulations and crimes is worth reading more than once and would make a great gift. Thank you, Lynn!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen Firefly in its initial, flawed, and out-of-order run on Fox, and in a way, I'm glad. I might have not fully understood how amazing this show is if I had seen it out of order. Recently, after reading nothing but the praise on this show heaped upon it by friends and colleagues, I broke down and purchased the DVD set, and boy am I glad I did. This has to be one of the most amazing pieces of televised storytelling I've ever seen. The characters are deep and fleshed-out. The writing is amazing, and the mixture of action and humor has never been more pleasing. The top-notch cast really got into their characters, and you can tell they they're having a ball. Overall, if you caught an episode on Fox and didn't &quot;get it&quot;, or if the successful mixture of Sci-fi and Western genre's appeals to you, do yourself an immense favor and pick up this DVD set. It will enrich and enlighten you in surprising ways. Enjoy!
B000002B7O|5.0|I have a collection of over 1000 CDS and this is the first the collection and NO other CD in the passed 7 years of collecting has bettered it. I don't care what the critics say, this record is flawless! It may be full of ballads...well...GOOD! Ballads are the main attractors, especially when they're as good as these. My favourite songs have to be You Can't Kill Rock n' Roll, and of course Flying High Again! Let it bring you as much pleasure as it has always brought me!
0792164903|4.0|Washington Irving laid the foundation for this story. Burton built on that - a wonderful structure, but not what Irving had in mind. Fine.<br />Depp, of course, is wonderful as an overly straight-laced Crane. He's a hard-core realist, in a truly unreal situation. Ricci does an outstanding job, too. The real star, though is Tim Burton's visual sense. Just about every scene is at least tinged with his macabre sensibility, most especially the &quot;fifth victim.&quot; Burton truly outdid himself with the bizarre array of instruments given to Crane for his scientific investigations.<br />I know this is just entertainment, but at least one anachronism stood out. Window glass at the end of the 18th century was still a hand-made product, with ripples and pontil marks. Here, though, just about every window was glazed with flat &quot;float glass.&quot; I can't get too worked up over that, though.<br />The story is well paced, with a web of interlocking tensions between the main characters. The visuals create a rich, spooky ambience. This movie is easy to enjoy and well worth the time spent.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Over the past few years we've been inundated with garbage pseudo-punk and rap-rock. Jet is back to good old fashioned Rock &amp; Roll. Just guitar driven rock. Many younger listeners may not like it because they're used to the crap that's been produced for most of the 90's and today. Jet definitely brings back the sounds of AC/DC and old Aerosmith (not the ballads). <br />With bands like Jet and Velvet Revolver, Rock and Roll is back after a way too long hiatus.
B00025ETIW|5.0|yea so i guess i was one of only a few who went searching cd stores june 8th to get this cd but when you hear it, its worth it. After signing to a big record deal my chemical romance didnt sell out but instead suited up to outdue their last album without selling out. (well except for \\"i'm not okay\\" which was still an alright song since its something they would scream about anyway). I knew this cd would be big after i heard whatever songs i could from the internet a month before from the cd. They brought the same energy but this time with some insane solos and catchy hooks. This cd definetly shouldnt make them lose any fans, and if it does then they are stupid. My favoite tracks are numbers 3,4,and 6. Give these boys another album and they'll be taking over the scene.
B00006LIRI|4.0|Its very hard for me to be critical of anything U2 does because they are just an amazing band! I've been totally into them for over 20 years and my collection is humungus. Having read some of the reviews posted here, I can however understand where they are coming from. I have always believed that 'greatest hits' and 'bests of's' are always aimed at a mass audience and not entirely focused on dedicated fans - fans should already have all the tracks anyway!    This compliation, for U2 hardcore fans, is a little dissapointing. I thought the first best of was ok but lacked an obvious structure. Would it not have been better to start from the very beginning and include all the rare original tracks - Boy/Girl, Another Day and Celebration (I cant believe this was not included - also, I wish they had taken that awful Xylophone (spell?) out of I Will Follow). Maybe all this will come together in the future when a Beatles-like Anthology comes out.  It is just obviously aimed at the mass audience who wont buy U2 albums but like the odd song.    The Best of 1990-2000 has a little something extra that the first didnt. The remixes of the songs was a bonus for all U2 fans - if you prefer the originals then simply play the album versions. What happened on Mysterious Ways though? There is a slight change in lyrics from the original single, yet there is no mention on the sleeve.    I am trying to be as objective as I can here which is not easy. Everything they do is superb and cant be knocked.  I will only try to comment on things I find a little negative (not easy for me to do).    I was never a big fan of Even Better Than The Real thing and only gave that song its due respect when I heard it live.     Electrical Storm is a must because its not on an album - the other mix on the flip side is better.  It does seem to follow the usual U2 template that they seem to be sticking to more than ever though (Edge could have really gone to town on a lead at the end but seemed to hold back).Gone -  the album version is better and yes I will only play the album version. This version seems an after thought from developing it live but its far better live.    The Hands That Built America - This could have been done better and lacks what it promises in the beginning.    Staring At The Sun - I would have prefered this song if it hadn't been done by U2!!! It so un-U2. What are those lyrics??? Still, it has a feeling and the feeling is good. Its a cracker live.    Numb - This is one of the few U2 songs I dont like at all. Why is it here?    I would like to have heard a remix of The Fly. Granted, the original is murky. If they could have redone it as they did on the Boston concert DVD I would have been happy - now if I want The Fly, I play Boston!    Thats the negative comments out of the way.    My advice, like most of the other reviewers is - if you are into U2 buy the albums. If you are just passing by, buy the compilations.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I am a fan of Avril, and I loved her first CD. Her voice is supurb and she is really hot. In this CD the guitar riffs are good and really rock. There is a but to this album. She doesn't rely on meaning and words a lot. I love voice inductions as much as anyone but she could have thought of something to convey her thoughts. Music is an expression of feelings and ideas. The band did a good job conveying feelings but the lyrics lack the idea. Over all I would suggest buying this album, it is fun. The songs grow on ya. Love ya Avril look forward to your next one.
0812550706|1.0|I had to read this book for class. I was very disappointed in the quality of this literature. It was so melodramatic! And they made Ender appear to be a semi-God. To keep it short, it was terribly boring. TERRIBLY. My suggestion to you is, RUN, RUN, Run away from Ender's Game, before you get boredom cancer like me!<br />Kit-Kat, Tank, Manny, Nyk
B0000CDL93|5.0|First of all, most people know that this is one, if not the most controversial films ever made and it's brilliantly, photographed and re-enacted, and I would like to add..a beuatiful, haunting musical score by John Williams that I don't beleve is on CD, but defnitely should.Rather than give my opinion of the film, I'll mention a few important things the reader may not know  The reporters who were in Dallas that day completely blew it: Dan Rather(CBS News) who being the only journalist to see the film in 1963..misstated the contents by saying&quot; Kennedy's head went forward when he was shot&quot; Obviously, the film shows the exact opposite-Bob Schieffer(CBS News) Tom Wicker(NY Times) Hugh Sidey(Time) &amp; Hugh Aynesworth(Newsweek-Wash. Times) All these gentlemen that were there that are so confident either Oswald acted alone, or was the only shooter  in a small amorphous conspiracy, did they ever talk to Jean Hill one of the closest eyewitesses who heard 4-6 shots that day &amp; at least one shot from the Knoll and signed an affadavit to that effect 11-22-63, how about Bill Newman and his wife the closest witnesses on the sidewalk? He thought all the shots came over his head from the knoll, and he had been in the military, how about officer James Chaney closest motorcycle patrolmen to Kennedy's motorcade- he told a reporter in the hall 11-22-63 that  &quot; he was shot in the face&quot;, yet was never interviewed by anyone else? How about patrolmen Jackson, who corroborated Chaney, by saying in an FBI interview&quot; the President was shot between the ear and temple&quot; which, is exactly what Marilyn Stzman said, who was on the pedestal with Abe Zapruder to take the famous home movie. Groundskeeper Hudson &amp; Zapruder said vaguely in their initial interviews about the direction of shots as&quot; behind them..behind them is the Railroad Yards behind the Grassy Knoll, to their left some 250 ft. is the Schoolbook Depository. No reporters ever interviewed these people! How about Texas Patrolman Hurschel Jacks who at Parkland Hospital saw the President before the Secret Service put a coat over him as they were removing him from the car, he signed an affadavit that day&quot; their  appeared to have been an entrance wound in the right temple&quot; he was only a few feet away. Both Charles Brehm &amp; reporter Altgens 2 of the other closest witnesses, both initially thought a shot, or shots came from the knoll, and this is documented, though later they said the shots came from the rear. Did these Reporters  ever talk to the Dallas Doctors who were unanimous in their belief the throat wound was on of entrance? No! no record of it, also, their descriptions of the head wound are  incompatible wth a shot from the rear.unless Oswald was firing a Bazooka, since there was a large hole extending into the back of the head, showing the effects that suggest an explosive bullet, not a Full Metal Jacketed one. Here's a few bombshells by The Records Review Board in resonse to this film- 1. X-Ray Tech Custer says Kennedy shot from front in head, and describes a back wound at t-3/4..to low for single bullet theory.2. Autopsy Assistant Jenkins- describes a headshot from the front &amp; single bullet theory not true 3.Both FBI agents at Autopsy- do not believe Single Bullet Theory, &amp; question&quot; doctoring&quot; of autopsy photos,4. Captain Lipsey&quot;told by his superior officer Gen Wehle&quot; to keep your eyes at all times on the body&quot; says&quot; there were 3 shots that struck the President, not two as in officialdom 5. Dr. Grossman who now says&quot; Oswald acted alone&quot; told the Review Board&quot; that's completely wrong&quot; in regard to being shown the back of the head autopsy pictures showing an intact &quot;back of the head&quot; These are just a few of many more bombshells in the medical and ballistic evidence, so remember this when someone prominent in the media tells you this is a simple case.
B00005JKCH|5.0|i've never seen a better superhero movie like this one for a long time. he goes to the museum with his classmates, he gets bitten by a spider that excaped from it's container, and bites him on the hand. later on he goes home and faints. then he wakes up the next morning and he is way stronger than he was and that he didn't need to wear his glasses. then he meets his best friend's dad who turns out to be the evil nemesis, the green goblin. i just love the story line. i don't know why some people hate this movie. what is there to hate? the only thing to hate is some of the actors they put in. like that guy who does the newspaper pics. they could've gotten somebody better.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Gibson should do a sequel to this, a documentary about all the concrete thinking, intolerant and hate-filled Christians in America that have latched onto this film to perpetuate this arcane philosophy. What the Romans did to Jesus was barbaric and the Christian community has been doing the same to the rest of the world since then. A great way to express one's faith. Gibson should call this documentary \\"The Sorrow\\".
B00028HBKM|2.0|This gory bloodfest is nothing more than a money-making scheme by Mel Gibson. It has no plot, no character development, and no theology other than \\"God hates us\\". Mel's legions of worshipers like to use words like \\"brilliant\\", but the only brilliant thing about it was the marketing. He personally talked to every group of fundies in America to ensure the Christian right that he is every bit as hateful and racist as they hoped, and then he got to just sit back and let the Church take over the marketing. They plugged this flick in nearly every sermon for 3 or 4 months (Was there even ONE church marquee that didn't mention this trash?) and bought out theaters to guarantee its success.<br />Mel engaged in race-baiting (complaining about Jewish criticism BEFORE it even existed), and many Passion-supporters helped out by sending racist letters to Jewish groups (\\"Didn't the Holocaust teach you people anything?\\" one asked.) According to a poll from the Pew research group, the percentage of young people who now blame Jews for deicide has increased to 30%. Perhaps more importantly, though, countless children have been exposed to this gruesome work of brutal piety. It's sadistic. It's pornographic. And it's endorsed by the same people who usually condemn movie violence. What hypocrisy.<br />I don't know which is my favorite Passion-related story. Is it that several people--including Caviezel-- were struck by lightning during filming? Or is it that Mel and Caviezel blamed the lightning on Satan, when historically it's associated with God? Or maybe that a couple got in trouble with the law after stabbing each other with scissors after seeing The Passion? Or perhaps that a churh marquee had this Passion-related pearl of wisdom: \\"The Jews killed Our Savior. 'Nuff said.\\"<br />Nuff said, indeed.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This is a very New York record. You might have to live in New York to get the singing,the simple kind of loud guitars, and the drum beat. The band is clearly influenced by the New York club scene, and they sound much like earlier bands from CBGB's and other NY bands, like Television and the Ramones. Overall this is a solid album. Normally I restrict myself to classic rock, mainly the grateful dead and Led Zep, but since they are only so many dead concerts out there, and you can only listen to Led Zep so many times, I was looking for a new median of music. The strokes are good, and much better than the majority of bands comming out now. I only give it 4 because 5 is reserved for masterpieces. Overall it is a solid rock album, and hopefully they will only improve with their sound and creativity.
B00000DLUV|4.0|All I can say is that this album is excellent. Casual fans may be tempted to get their 2-disc &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which is also amazing, but this 24 track live disc is just as great. Song after song is just classic, and newcomers will probably be suprised by how many hits these guys had. Included is &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Tragedy&quot;, and even &quot;Grease&quot;. Plus &quot;Islands In The Stream&quot;, and my favorite &quot;(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away&quot;. This is a perfect example of quality and quantity together in one collection, and it's all live in Las Vegas too. It's a must for any level of fan.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album was soo awesome. I liked the self title album. I hated Iowa. I like how they are going after larger audiances. My freind hated slipknot until he heard duality. Don't get me wrong I am also into crazy songs like Eyeless. You have to buy this album.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I can't believe there are negative reviews regarding this album.<BR>If you are any sort of SERIOUS music fan, you must have this in your collection.  &quot;O&quot; isn't for people looking for some catchy little songs, it is for people who want something completely original and beautiful.  Yes, it can be very dark, but it is best listened to as a whole.  If you aren't moved by songs like &quot;The Blowers Daughter&quot;, &quot;Cannonball&quot;, or especially &quot;Cold Water&quot; I think you should just put on Maroon 5 and give it up.<BR>Be sure to listen for the two hidden songs at the end.  Lisa Hannigan's version of &quot;Silent Night&quot; is simply haunting.  If you do like the album, see him live as it is even better.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Joel and Ethan Coen seem incapable of making a film that isn't at least interesting, and often their movies are absolutely delightful.  I think everyone has their favorites (mine are &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;), but this film touched a few cultural nerves that are infrequently accessed.<br />For one thing, the soundtrack features a brilliant collection of grass-roots and Americana music - acoustic blues and jazz and bluegrass.  Alison Krauss, already a novelty around Nashville as a platinum-selling bluegrass artist, received a thunderbolt of a boost to her career by supplying several tunes and vocal parts to the soundtrack (for example singing the Heavenly &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; during the baptism scene and the seductive voice of one of the sirens later on).  Dan Tyminski, one of the musicians from Alison's band, Union Station, supplies the singing voice of George Clooney and Dan Tyminski's &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; became even MORE of a novelty around Nashville as it won one Country Music Award after another without the benefit of any significant radio play.<br />The script is VERY loosely based on Homer's Odyssey and knowing that allows the moderately educated a few hearty chuckles recognizing, for example, that John Goodman's Eye-Patched Bible Salesman represents the Cyclops.<br />George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson deliver the Coen's rib-tickling dialogue with gusto.  I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch characters who are clueless, or at least more clueless than they think they are, but to see three bravura performances as chain-gang refugee dunces is a treat here.<br />In a typical early sequence our trio has just made their break from the chain-gang and Clooney's Everett begins taking charge.  Turturro's Pete questions him:<br />&quot;Wait a minute.  Who elected you leader of this outfit?&quot;<br />Everette responds &quot;Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought.  But if that ain't the consensus, then hell, let's put it to a vote.&quot;<br />&quot;Suits me&quot;, says Pete. &quot;I'm voting for yours truly.&quot;<br />&quot;Well, I'm voting for yours truly too&quot; replies Everett, not backing down.<br />Pete and Everett turn to their slightly denser partner Delmar to break the deadlocked vote.<br />He ponders it thoughtfully.&quot;Okay.... I'm with you fellers&quot;.<br />Classic Coen Brothers.<br />----------------------------<br />One tidbit provided on the &quot;Alison Krauss and Union Station LIVE DVD&quot;: Dan Tyminski, upon learning that he was going to be providing the singing voice for George Clooney, called his wife to give her the exciting news.<br />&quot;Honey! They're making a movie and I'm doing a voiceover for George Clooney!&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, that's good, Dan.  What's a voiceover?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, when people go to see the movie and look up on the screen, they'll see George Clooney, but when he sings it'll be my voice coming out of his mouth!&quot;<br />&quot;Oh Dan&quot;, Mrs. Tyminski replied. &quot;That's my fantasy!&quot;bstract thought.  But if that ain't the consensus, then hell, let's put it to a vote.&quot;<br />&quot;Suits me&quot;, says Pete. &quot;I'm voting for yours truly.&quot;<br />&quot;Well, I'm voting for yours truly too&quot; replies Everett, not backing down.<br />Pete and Everett turn to their slightly denser partner Delmar to break the deadlocked vote.<br />He ponders it thoughtfully.&quot;Okay....

630522577X|5.0|The music from \\"My Fair Lady\\" makes it easily one of my favorite musicals with \\"I could have danced all night\\", \\"Wouldn't it be Loverly?\\", \\"The Street Where you Live\\", and Stanley Holloway's rousing showstoppers \\"With a Little Bit of Bloomin' Luck\\" and \\"Get me to the Church on Time\\".<br />It's well chronicled how much gnashing of teeth surrounded the Hollywood decision to leave out the then-unknown Julie Andrews, who was the new toast of the stage as Eliza Doolittle, and instead cast the more bankable Audrey Hepburn.  Hollywood rewarded Ms. Andrews with \\"Mary Poppins\\" and an Oscar, and although I'd love to have seen Julie Andrews in this role, 4 decades later I can't complain about Audrey Hepburn.<br />Rex Harrison's reprises Henry Higgins from the stage, and I frankly can't think of another actor who would bring the same English Arrogance and tongue-in-cheekiness to the role.  The interactions between Harrison, Hepburn and Wilfred Hyde-White as Colonel Pickering, especially in the early part of the film, are witty, entertaining, and move the narrative right along without pausing for exposition.  The Higgins character is a cad, very full of himself, and he makes the mistake of treating those he feels are socially inferior poorly.  The Colonel Pickering character acts as a surrogate for the audience, observing the educated but pompous Professor Higgins and allowing us to feel not TOO badly that poor Eliza has come under the influences of Higgins.<br />Stanley Holloway recreates Alfred P. Doolittle, Eliza's father, from the stage, and although his character has as many moral deficiencies as Professor Higgins (at one point he shows up at Higgins doorstep hoping to extort money from Professor Higgins for \\"shacking up\\" with Eliza) and is much less educated and with a much lower social standing, he is nonetheless a \\"good ol' bloke\\" and his moments in the film are among the most memorable, especially the previously mentioned show-stopping musical numbers.<br />The final act feels a little soap-opera-ish between Jeremy Brett as Freddy fawning over Eliza and Professor Higgins beginning to appreciate her fine qualities at the same time.  This portion produces two of the finer musical moments as Freddy sings \\"On The Street Where You Live\\" and Higgins croons \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\\".<br />Since George Bernard Shaw died in 1950 it's purely speculative to wonder what he'd have thought about the production of his Pygmalion story.  I'm guessing he'd have liked it.  If you like musicals, I'm guessing you will too.

B00007ELEL|4.0|This movie begins with a meandering voiceover by Sam Elliot that wanders around in several different directions before he pauses to admit that he has lost his place and forgot what the hell he was talking about...<br /><br />The script wanders about too, but it's a good trip.  The script is a Coen Brother's specialty, with characters who are not very smart, or at least not nearly as smart as they think they are.  Jeff Bridges plays \\"The Dude\\", a likeable loser of a Californian who unfortunately shares the same last name as \\"The Big Lebowski\\", a wealthy older man with a trophy ex-porn star wife who owes bad characters money.  The Dude's chief social activity consists of drinking White Russians, being stoned, and hanging out with his bowling team.  The Dude's team includes John Goodman as a Vietnam Vet who doesn't think twice about trying to double-cross criminals to make off with a million bucks of ransom money, or pulling a gun on a rival bowler who makes a minor infraction, stepping across the line during league play.  Steve Buscemi is on the team as well.  It has been noted that another Coen trademark is bizarre manners of death for Buscemi characters.<br /><br />To try to describe the plot would meander worse than Sam Elliot's opening narration, but by the end Sam shows up in person (looking great as usual beneath a cowboy hat) to tell the Dude that he likes his style.<br /><br />The Dude abides, and I like the Coen's style. A lot.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I haven't listened to Devil's Night, but this is pretty good!<br />Stop hating! so what if they're worse now! forget about the better times before and concentrate on the cd now!<br />I haven't heard the whole cd, so you can rate the rest yourself.<BR>Here is a review of the tracks in the cd:<br />1.Git Up - a fast and long verse by Em at the beginning and everyone else jumps in. Weird intro for the cd, but solid enough. 4/5<br />2.Loyalty - Long but okay. Too much verses 3/5<br />3.Just like u - Bizarre is in the whole song, repetitive and strong words. The chorus is not so good, but I still like the song. 3.5/5<br />4.I'll be Damned - Too much hating. I don't know what to rate this song. /5<br />5.Dude (Skit)- Interlude to My Band.<br />6.My Band -Luv it! 100% catchy! (who would skip this?)I like it better than I did a month ago but STILL not my favorite. Not even on this album. 5/5<br />7.U R The One - so not like d12, but still a great song! 4/5<br />8.6 in the morning - a lot of Em in the beginning. I don't know why but THIS song is the best one in the album! Notice I said THIS ALBUM. 5/5<br />9.How Come - good chorus- wait. Who am I kidding? GREAT chorus and GREAT verses. 4.5/5<br />10.Leave Dat Boy Alone - According to the other reviews, I leave this song alone. Rate it urself./5<br />11.Get My Gun - Hadn't listened to this either.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Man.....I think yeah sounds a little like Stone Sour but I really don't care for that CD..But this is great 5 stars. They have evolved in their music talent. I can't belive that people are mad because they changed their sound. Hell they did that on there 2 cd..so I guess you could really say they sold out then..If you want the same group sound over and over again I suggest any punk group or someone stupid like cradle of filth. It has all the same drum kick sounds but not on every song something different for the Maggots instead of just one song after another and another and another and... anot....an....ano.. a<br />good songs...<BR>1. ALL OF THEM
B000001E7T|4.0|I can't really say that I am still the big PJ Harvey fan that I once was a few years ago. Obviously my musical tastes changed in the past five years. Still if anyone can sing the blues in modern rock, it is PJ Harvey. PJ definitely does a much better job at it than say the White Stripes. PJ's music is more primitive and raw, &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; definitely establishes that the woman can sing the blues. I must say that my favorite PJ Harvey cd still is &quot;Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea&quot; but &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; is still a solid blues-rock album from PJ Harvey. Although her music isn't necessarily autobiographical, PJ certainly sings with the utmost conviction. You can hear her angst and rage through &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; and the title track. I first heard PJ Harvey when &quot;Down By the Water&quot; became a moderate hit for PJ back in 1995 when I was in college. It wasn't anything that I heard of back then. It was indeed a nice change from the sea of garbage that flooded the airwaves at the time. The first time I listened to &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, I wasn't exactly thrilled with what I heard, especially the first couple of songs. I had to listen to the cd a few times for the music to sink into my head. Listening to it again makes me wish that alternative rock today was what it was back in the '90s like PJ Harvey, and not this horrid garbage like New Found Glory.
0385336810|4.0|This was a funny book.  I love Kinsella's humor and the way she has her characters (Becky from Shopaholic, Emma from this one) look at things.  I love that I can identify with them; their flaws and shortcomings, and the funny things that happen to them.  <BR>In this book, I particularly enjoyed the relationship changes that took place with Emma's parents and cousin as the book progressed. Great secondary characters as well: Emma's marriage-hungry roommate was hysterical, and her best friend loyal and helpful.   <BR>From a romantic-comedy angle this book was excellent.  Though problems are constant with two men involved, Emma perseveres and works it out best for her in a way that keeps the reader laughing. <BR>The concept of secrets was a fun idea.  We know right from the start Emma's secrets but have to wait to find out those of the man she adores. <BR>I recommend this book!  It is funny, sweet, and happy!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril says her music is &quot;deep&quot;. <br />Deep?<br />As her debut album says, Avril should &quot;Let Go&quot; of her mock seriousness. She has put forth way too much effort trying to be someone other than who is truly inside of her, a Britney Spears model. She has assumed that with this day and age, accessories from Hot Topic and an extremely moody attitude make her some type of an advanced artist.<br />It's a shame that this type of music must hit #1 on the charts, pushing true &quot;deep&quot; albums like Alanis Morissette's &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; down to #10.
B000059T00|4.0|Well Blind Faith is one of those side-project bands that stands the test of time. The band does nothing truly experimental or anything really extrodinary instead they just play standard, good, and solid rock music. Now this may not seem to be any great feat but in fact looking through the annals of history we see that few bands were able to conjure up an album that plays so well the whole way through. All of the songs are at the very least tolerable. Of course the album features the classic Bellbottom Blues, which I grant is a horrible title but it is such a great song. Furthermore the album is great for any occasion whether you want to play it as background music for a party or whether you want to space out to some good music this album is good for every single occasion. <BR>Highly Recommended yet not essential.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|To state the truth, I used to hate Slipknot. You know, 9 people, where's the talent? But since I've listened to this album, I immediately noticed the differences between this and older albums. 'Circle' and 'Duality' are both amazing songs. I'm glad to see that they have taken their musical talent to a higher level, and now they have one more fan. GREAT JOB SLIPKNOT!
B00006JJ51|5.0|If you want Gangsta rap look no further than this masterpiece. The songs are violent, hateful, masogonistic, entrenching stereotypes,a nd every other thing that could be potentially viewed as a negative charecteristic. Everything that is bad is featured on this album, however for some reason this album does not either offend or disgust me the least bit. On this album are the obvious clasics: F*ck the Police, Gangsta Gangsta, Straight outta Compton, and a few others. These songs alone are the reason why this album is worth the few bucks that you shall pay for it. Furthermore the new version has a few extra tracks including the ultra masogonistic a B*tch is a B*tch, which however is a classic song and is also a display of some twisted truth. <BR>Furthermore everything on this album is presented honestly and openly. Though it is obvious that Ice Cube doesn't kill Cops for no reason daily, the song does display honesty in the sense that it shows the problems of frusturations faced by people everyday.<BR>High Recommened; Buy It
B0000A02TZ|2.0|Kevin Bacon's first on-screen credited appearance is in this movie. This is where the legacy of the worst actor in the world started. I heard somewhere that Belushi chugged a bottle of Jack Daniels in this movie, that it really was Jack Daniels, and didn't die. A lot of people would at least have their stomach pumped. Well, I bet this review wasn't terribly helpful.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This exquisitely laid out 2 DVD issue of Meet Me in Saint Louis is an absolute must have for any Garland fan, Vincent Minnelli fan as well as fans of the major American musicals of all time. The movie itself is introduced with a short talk by Liza Minnelli to whet the viewer's appetite for the film; then the film is beautifully reproduced on the DVD for the viewer. One small disappointment: the film is shown in full screen; there is no letterbox version of the film on this 2 DVD set. The set is chock full of great extras which offer the viewer a rather comprehensive introduction (or review for seasoned fans) of Judy's work in such shorts as Bubbles as well as trailers for both Judy's films and Vincent Minnelli's films. The sound quality is excellent and the video quality is equally superlative.<br />The movie itself is the story of the life of an American family in 1903 in Saint Louis and their ups and downs throughout one year's time. Does the father take that new job and move the family from Saint Louis to New York? Do Esther (played by Judy) and Rose find the loves of their lives? Watch and find out! A special treat is the strikingly convincing acting of Margaret O'Brien as the youngest sibling in this large family from the last turn of the century. Margaret won an award at the Oscars and she very much deserved it-she acts her little heart out!<br />In short, this movie is a BUY! Go get it! Order it here, or shop for it anywhere-but just get it and enjoy a great American musical and the numerous bonus extras that are very hard to find elsewhere!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i bought this CD at Target w/ my gift card and i was like, hey! it's the new CD, maybe I'll get it! i'm actually listening to the full tracks on her site and i love them. only listened to Don't Tell me and take me away. i have a friend who's obsessed major w/ Avril and she's mad at me because i won't make her a copy of the cd. well, buy this cd because it's the best since Evanescence.
0920668372|5.0|A lot of people say that this book is creepy because of the ending but I think it is wonderful and I think that it really conveys a parent's love for their child!! My mother read it to me as a child and I'll never forget her saying, \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\" It might seem weird for some adults but it's a great way for a child to visualize that their parents will always love them no matter what!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|a awesome follow up to their great debut. MCR is definately one of the best emo-core bands out there today. So if you enjoy bands like Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, From Autumn To Ashes, you will love this album.
0060254920|5.0|I took a children's literature class a few years ago in college and I am now expecting my first child and I remembered this book and have recently purchased it. It's absolutely wonderful!!
B00024BHTC|5.0|Id give the album 5 stars, meaning this deserves 5 stars for being the worst album ever. Nightwish couldnt even pop a boner if they wanted to, im gonna tell everyone how bad this album is even if it means i have to pork as many babes as there is tea in china. Nightwish used to be workers for the Make a Wish FOundation, until they turned tubular. You think nightwish are sweet, where are your manners, young man? theyre as cool as a fool in a swimming pool.
0790749815|1.0|The plot has more loopholes than a fishnet. A good thriller should have a logical and coherent plot, this one is all dramatic and no logic. Sadly because its famous the film isn't reviewed based on its merits but its reputation.
078681859X|4.0|This book was excelent. Its intricate plot weaves the characters in and around modern London, where danger for Bartimaeus, the djinni, and Nathaniel, the 12 year old boy who summoned him, lurks around the corner. From corrupt magicians to an important, and very powerful, amulet stolen, which leaves a man dead, this book captivates your mind.
B000059Z8M|5.0|It's different from your average animated film. So was Toy Story part 1 but this one is better. The movie plotting is a lot better in this part. I give it five stars(I'd give it six if it was in my hands!)
0316666343|4.0|Kind of a disturbing book. Still I liked it. Reminded me of that book My Fractured Life sometimes. Not sure I liked the end though.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|THIS ALBUM ROCKS! ITS MORE DEEP THAN LET GO. AVRIL ROCKS!(...)
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|I'm sooo glad somebody finally commented on that stupid vocal affect these guys use. What the heck is with that? <br />Anyways,<br />I'm just a bored rich kid that wants to be a rock star, can I come play with you guys? We don't have to get real jobs cause our trust fund will pay for everything. We can buy quality equipment without a thought, pay for a studio and not have to worry about time. Record contract? No problem! PR and Marketing? Don't worry about it! Enough air play? Payola doesn't affect rich people! Golly gee gosh fellas, we've got it made.<br />Daddy's taking care of everything.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Great Movie! I saw it at the theatre same day as the Academy Awards, and stayed for the credits at the end. Glad I did as the song \\"My Ain' True Love\\" (played by Alison Krauss, written by Sting) was worth the price of the movie itself. Was disappointed it didn't get best song at the awards that night.<BR>Great acting, great story, great job of production and direction. Scenery is splendid. Learned a lot about the home front here in North Carolina during that war. An eye-opening experience. A+, number 1, what else can I say?
B0000DYKET|5.0|I bought a pair and have not taken them off since. Easy to slip on and off these are the perfect pair for someone on the go. The unique toe guard protects your feet like no other sandal of this type. They also dry very quickly so if you spend a lot of time around water these could be the sandals for you. (Although the Newport H2's dry faster) To top it all off they feel great on my feet. Do yourself a favor and try these out you will not regret it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|You have to see this movie. The whole time I was watching it<BR>I was speelbound. It has one of the greatest openings. It is<BR>so cool the way the 10 strangers all end up at this motel<BR>on a dark, story night. Ray Liotta and John Cuscack are excellent. A different role for John Cuscack but he is great.<BR>I can't give the plot away---it is full of suprises. The ending<BR>will really get you. After you watch the movie you will think<BR>about it and understand yhe way all the pieces fit. This movie<BR>is scary--but with it taking place at night and it raining<BR>the whole time only adds to the suspense. This is a creepy and<BR>scary movie. Buy it you will like it.
B000002MTU|5.0|Although Clapton's singing here isn't as original or as strong as the blues greats that he is covering, his guitar work makes up for it.  All the songs don't run for too long and there is no self indulgence of guitar soloing.  Which is a good thing here because Clapton's guitar solos are white hot, intense, and explosive.  This album isn't live, but is &quot;live&quot;.  As in, there are no overdubs or edits done on the songs except for two of them.  This album is definately one of the strong points in Clapton's career.
B000002IST|5.0|This is, unfortunately, the last one with Collins, too bad he decided to leave the band. No Son Of Mine is a great tune, full of emotion and power! Jesus He Knows Me is another great tune. Driving The Last Spike makes the band returns once more to their days like a progressive band, and really worth the whole cd! I Can't Dance is a great pop tune, Never A Time is a nice song, Dreaming While You Sleep is between the best gems of the album, great song, as like Tell Me Why and Living Forever, both excellent tunes. Hold On My Heart is a slow beat song, very passionate, a great pop tune. Way Of The World is easily between one of the best pop tunes Genesis ever made. Since I Lost You remembers the prog Genesis, as like the long, Fading Lights, one of the best tunes of the album! I strongly recommend this album as a last registry with Phil on the band.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|THE FOG OF WAR is former Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara's belated effort at a public explanation for his, President Kennedy's and (especially) President Johnson's actions in embroiling America in the Vietnam War.<br />Secretary Bob does a nice job establishing credibility and a milieu for mea culpas as he describes his role as an Army Air Force officer helping to plan the firebombing of Japanese cities at the end of WWII. Basically, he says that the air campaign ultimately saved a lot of GI lives even though, had the U.S. not been victorious, America could have been charged with war crimes for its killing of untold thousands of civilians. But, hey, the winner always writes the history of the conflict. Then, after digressing for a few minutes about his time as the top executive at Ford Motor Company, he explains how he reluctantly became Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, first advising during the Cuban Missile Crisis, then during the fateful seduction by South Vietnam. MacNamara subsequently stayed on as SecDef during Johnson's administration. Now, he places the Vietnam debacle pretty much at LBJ's feet - Jack of Camelot would never have let our military involvement escalate to the degree it did.<br />THE FOG OF WAR, sprinkled with a lot of period war footage, especially of falling bombs, is a smartly done and insightful documentary on how our government waged a couple of its twentieth century conflicts. MacNamara gives it an almost folksy touch - only the pipe, tweed smoking jacket, and cheerily crackling fireplace are missing - as he shares with the audience the eleven lessons he learned beginning with WWII, the last being that &quot;human nature will never change&quot;. Honesty has its limits, however. At the end, Bob refuses to take any personal responsibility for the Vietnam entanglement, and declines to say why he didn't speak out against the war after resigning from Johnson's cabinet when he felt the President was going too far in deepening the grave being dug. As MacNamara says, &quot;It was complicated.&quot;<br />For me, the most striking aspect of THE FOG OF WAR was the evidence that the former Secretary, even in his mid-80s, still has his wits about him. Why, he could take over for Rumsfeld tomorrow.dug.

B000066NW0|1.0|She can't even spell.  Say it with me, &quot;B-O-Y.&quot;  Plus, she's shallow, since she only wants him once he's famous, and she dumb--dumb--dumb--dumb.  Vocal chord removal is the only option.  Also, someone ought to steal all her pencils so that she can't write all that dumb stuff.  Then, last of all, fill her ears with cheeseballs and her nostrils with sorbet.  Tie her up and beat her up and throw her out of Babylon.  And she has a funny nose.  Worse than Michelle Kwan's.  And weird eyes.  She looks like a demon.  Is she into Satanic worship?  I met her at the mall once and she was wearing a pentagram necklace and black lipstick and she was singing, &quot;Oops, I did it again&quot; by Britney Spears.  So she's really just a little teenie-bopper.  Get a life.  Get two of them.  Get a whole barrel of lives.  Go off to Zanzibar with your Skater Boi and if you ever come back, we'll kill ya!
0446310786|2.0|This book &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; has two parts to it. The first part is about these kids wanting some guy named Boo Radley to come outside. The second part is about a case that Atticuss is doing. He's deffending a black a man.<br />    I think this book wasn't good because it was boring. This book needed something more because after a while you will stop reading and not pick the book back up. This book needs action and mystery to it. It could be in the end of part one and two. The only people who would like this book is the people who like books with no action and mystery.
B000002IST|1.0|This album is very disappointing. In fact, I'd prefer that they never made it. It sounds half hearted. <br />&quot;Jesus he loves me&quot;, and &quot;Driving the Last spike&quot; are OK. But after the song &quot;we can't dance&quot; it goes down hill really badly. There seem to be a lack of ideas, some half baked noodles, a few solos that meander into  sounding like 2nd Home by the sea demos. Phil sounds bored singing. It's a mess, and not even an interesting one. My attention was really lagging with each track.<br />With previous albums like Duke, Abacab, Genesis and Invisible Touch they seemed to embrace change and write with vigour. Invisible Touch really is one of their best albums, you can feel the enthusiasm. We Can't Dance does not sound like a band enjoying themselves. It's worse than &quot;And then there were 3&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First let me say this album is ALOT lighter than their previous work. I didnt like this cd the frst time I listened to it. I hate people that say Slipknot is just a bunch of mask wearing suicidal maniacs. I happen to be a fan of metal. My favorite album of all time is At The Gates-Slaughter of the Soul and Slayer-R.I.B.There is alot of talent maybe not as much with the DJs but the drummer is one of the best I've heard in about 5 years. They should drop about 3 members because 3 percutionists is not needed with a drummer as good as Jordison I am not some 13 year old that says IOWA is the best album ever and old stuff like Led Zepplin and Slayer suck. IOWA was a good cd that many people did not like. There self titled cd is also a extremly good cd one of my personal favorites but I am musicly open(some of my favoite bands are The Haunted,At The Gates,Death,Children of Bodom,Slayer)Some of the songs are awesome on this cd such as pulse of the maggots which, in my opinion is the best song on the cd.Vermilion I hated at first but its a good song after you listen to the album enough.Same with the intro.The only songs I dont really like ar circle(alot of people like it)and the nameless but the latter is a decent song.I am a maggot and a metal head a breed that hardly exists anymore(most Slipknot fans are under 16 to this day)I am a fun of some Nu-Metal such as System of a Down and surprisngly Linkin Park. Older music though such as Inflames,Cradle of Filth and Shadows Fall are other examples of Metal. People bad mouith this band saying that fans claim this is heavier and classic rock sucks.I hate  these kind of people that say anything other than Nu_metal sucks. I used to be a Korn fan but there music isnt as good once you listen to it 5 years later(their last 2 cds suck)I also hate bands like AFI,Thrice,Story of the Year,Simple Plan... People say Slipknot is musically rearted but love this crap called Emo music. Slipknot in the end gets Sterotyped for being sucidal, screaming 99.99% of their music and being quote from an online message board\\"slipnot isa buncha clown-fag sucidal retads tht juss screm\\"Not only is this untrue, its plain ignorant.Slipknot just gets confused with the nu-metal metalheads hate so much. If you wanna get into metal listen to this then move on to bands such as Inflames,At the Gates,Shadows Fall, Slayer, Cradle of Filth,Lamb of God,Death,Children of Bodom...Anyway actaully listen to music before you review it other than just stating opinions based on appearances and listening to 2 seconds of it and saying its garbage.
B00005OC0G|1.0|I am shocked that something as sublime and classical as Beethoven's violin concerto can be played in such an affected and self conscious a manner. Similar maanerisms can be found in her recordings of Kreutzer and Spring but to a lesser degree. Clearly, Mutter does not appear to understand what it means to observe fidelity to a score and to the spirit in which a work is written.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|It's no doubt there was a big expectation for Lavigne's follow up.  Gladly she worked with new and fresh producers and with amazing writer Chantal K. who helped her with a few lyrics.  Overall don't expect to have the most introspective album deliver to us by this canadian brat.  After all is her second album.  The songs are simply delightful POP-ROCK tunes that aboards every theme from LOVE, SOLITUDE AND FORGIVENESS.  This is a great album from the begginning to the end.  Maybe the best coming out this year.  Of course is unfair to compare ALANIS and AVRIL since their albums came by the same time, it's just not right because the both of them are talented and most of all different. Back 2 Avril's album, the best tracks are the history telling &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; were you can tell the desperation of the caracter, well sung by Lavigne, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; the leading single a in your face love song, about, yes! she's not an easy girl, how ironic, but then it's lovely to see somebody like Avril demanding respect. Love the momentuos of the last chorus, a great song.  &quot;Who Knows&quot; this track sounds so anthemic and easy to sing along with, and a great track. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; supposed to be the second cut to be release to radio waves, although is catchy and not bad at all, it's not one of my top tracks, but it's ok.  &quot;He Wasn't&quot; souns a lil-ske8r boi alike, this is fast, and funny to hear that the man she expected him to be is not, &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is a slow track of put yourself in my feet, this is a more mature Lavigne, &quot;Forgotten&quot; it's a total rocker song, another mature one, but it doesn't mean it's the best one.  &quot;Freak Out&quot; sounds funny and anoying, &quot;Slipped Away&quot; dedicated to her grampa, it's sad and slow, a great closure. &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Together&quot; both sounds a like, and &quot;Falls To Pieces&quot; is forgettable.  At the end this is a great comeback sophomore album that hopefully won't get stucked in bad promotion or radio overlooked tracks, just like many albums that came this year. This is a well invested money record.
B000056NX5|3.0|That's all. Disappointing from the beggining. New arrangements, ciber-punk fashioned people, and a cast that really works... until Jesus starts to act. My god! I've never seen such a bad performance. He's cold and over-acts. When he tries to inspire pity or fear all he can get from you is a laugh. Getsemani becomes tasteless in the mouth of Carter. Judas and Mary Magdalene are two of the few caracters that are convincent in this new DVD. I've played drums in an amateur representation of J.C. Superstar and our christ was better than Carter.<BR>If youve never seen the play in a theatre, this is not the best way to do it. If you're a fan as devoted as I am buy it. You dont have to see Carter's scenes if you don't want to
0553260111|4.0|A surprise at every turn, Mr Ludlum makes me want to keep reading from page to page, chapter to chapter, and on into the next 2 books in this trilogy.<br />This was my first Robert Ludlum book, and in a round-about way, I picked it up because of the movie.  This is to say that I picked it up because I liked the movie, and told a friend about the movie, who replied to me \\"Don't want to see it....it can't be as good as the book!\\"  So I took a friend's advice, bought the book, started to read it and was side-tracked for a while.  But I picked it back up about a week ago, when I heard about the 2nd movie coming out, and re-read the entire book, including the unfinished part, in about 8 days.<br />Mr Ludlum sure does keep the thrills and surprises coming.  I am not sure what my problem was with not finishing it the first time, I am not a fast reader and I had a little trouble biting off 530 pages, but it was well worth it.  And I look VERY forward to the next installment, The Bourne Supremacy.<br />I could have done without the swearing, but other than that, the story line was quite unique and was not at all guessable.  I was surprised with the outcome of the main characters, but not the main villian, since there are sequals.  But I am happy with the result.<br />If you like espionage and suprise twists and turns, read this book.  It is a good story.
B00006GFAB|4.0|&quot;Very best&quot; does a good job for the most part of covering the Kiss story up until 1978 then it really goes haywire.<BR>First,i believe that the selections from the first 7 albums are good but i can't believe that they would forget about &quot;Black Diamond&quot; or &quot;100,000 years&quot;, or &quot;Shock Me&quot; or the ULTIMATE KISS BALLAD &quot;Sure know something&quot;.<BR>They could have dropped &quot;Lick it up&quot; and &quot;I Love it loud&quot; and all of the post Ace hits to include these absolute essentials.<BR>Also,what the heck is &quot;New york groove&quot; doing here when it wasn't even a Kiss collaboration???<BR>I think that due to the time limits of a cd they should have concentrated on the years of 1974-1980 with more careful consideration to the song selections then later release a second cd to cover the years from 1980 to 1998.<BR>I mean they tried to cover the post make up years which spanned about 12 years in 3 songs.<BR>That's just not good enough even though Kiss had produced only one truly great album in &quot;Revenge&quot; but they still had many great songs from the second rate albums like &quot;Asylum&quot;.<BR>You got to have such classics as &quot;Tears are falling&quot; and &quot;Heaven's on fire&quot; which was one of their biggest and best hits!<BR>Anyway, this collection still rocks with plenty of great moments from their classic years and covering some of their best rockers(&quot;I want You&quot;,&quot;Strutter&quot;, &quot;Deuce&quot;) and best ballads<BR>(&quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot;).<BR>The best thing to do is to get this collection then purchase the millennium vol. 2 collection then buy &quot;Revenge&quot;.<BR>The millennium vol.2 collection does a good job of covering their post make up 80's work and is the first Kiss collection to concentrate on that decade's hits even though it's a little skimpy. <BR>Anyway,pick up these 2 collections and &quot;Revenge&quot; and you'll be set unless you get struck by the Kiss spell.<BR>Then you can get the ultimate classic Kiss &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Rock n&quot; roll over&quot; and &quot;Love Gun&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Happy rockin' my fellow Kiss Army !<br />O.F.
6304077955|5.0|This film possesses a hypnotic pull that I am unable to resist. It demonstrates a clear argument against most human interaction. Johnny is on the run from doing something he probably shouldn't have.  He leaves Manchester and heads for London, where his ex-girlfriend Louise works and lives.  Their initial reunion is filled with tense silences and overt hostility. Johnny is antagonstic towards everyone and everything he sees. Yet, he does see, which is more than can be said for the rest of the characters in the film.<br />Clearly, Johnny is a stranger wherever he goes.  He's an outsider who loathes the hypocricy he associates with the inside.  It isn't that he is hopeless. Nor does he lack desire.  He desires that which exists beyond the palty grasp of human desire. He has heretofore avoided being nailed to the floor with compensations for thwarted, vulgar human desire.  There is no pleasure in consuming for Johnny. There is no pleasure in most things that he, or any other human, might covet.<br />Johnny believes in an angry, vengeful Judaic god that hates mankind. He seems to believe that humanity is a scourge on the planet. He obsesses over eschatological xtianity. He seems rather unimpressed with the basic living apparatus most civilized humans take for granted.  He certainly finds it most economical to degrade women as he sees fit.  Johnny is rare.  His truths are scalding to those careful, complacent types who make up the world of false ideals and false hopes. He will forever be alien in their world.  He will forever spit on their world.  But he is human.  He longs for attention, if not affection.  He is capable of feeling something other than the pure balm of hate.<br />The performances are all stunning in this film.  I particularly enjoy the late Katrin Cartlidge's turn as \\"wicky-wacky\\" Sophie. She's so wonderfully disturbed.  Her bouts of hysterical gibbering, her pathetic desperation to be cared for by anyone at all--are prize winning entertainment.  Cartlidge makes Sophie completely reprehensible in the end.  That is quality work.  Claire Skinner as Sandra is possessed with some festering inability to complete any of her sentences.  She's so perturbed yet so efficient in administering medical aid. She is also excruciatingly appealing--her 5 seconds soaking in the bath are tantalizing and simply evil in their allure.  As Jeremy, Greg Cruttwell creates an elitist who specializes in psychological torture. He's quite nasty and possesses no redeemable qualities.  He is quite like Johnny, except he is apparantly loaded. He really likes violent sexual encounters--consensual or not. He's cool, confident, and destined to remain an enigma.  It is the rare film that allows such a consummate bastard to walk away.  His deeds go unpunished and poor little Sophie whines and sniffles her way to absolutely nowhere.<br />Then, of course, there is David Thewlis as Johnny.  Quite a lot of praise has been bestowed upon his performance.  He's so rabid and manic.  He must speak.  His mind is racing and he'll tell anyone who is listening what is in his head.  Except, unlike a person who is undergoing a manic crisis, his thoughts are lucid.  Nevertheless, there is nobody listening.  It is sad, brutal, ugly and very much true-to-life for many individuals. Johnny represents what happens with good minds that cannot be yoked to systematic measures of untrammeled \\"truth\\".  If he possessed more will he would certainly make Jeremy look like a slap-happy schoolboy with his first fisting mag..  Cartlidge makes Sophie completely reprehensible in the end.

6305603847|5.0|Despite what I've been reading from other reviews there is a story in this movie. You may have to watch it a few times to understand it because the movie jumps around in time a lot, but it's there.<br />This is the story of a boy, Pink Floyd, growing up in England after the war. His father was killed in the war so he is starved for male attention. At one point in the movie he tries to attach himself to some other kid's dad but is rejected. His mother is very over-protective. His schoolmaster at school is abusive and too strict. He grows up to become a rock star and eventually his wife leaves him for another guy because he's always too stoned to even acknowlege her. They are all bricks in his wall. Finally he just loses his mind and nearly kills himself and some groupie that came to his room. When he wakes up from this stupor he imagines himself a cold-hearted nazi leader reborn from a rotting corpse. Finally at the end of the movie he is sentensed in a \\"trial\\" to be exposed and his wall is destroyed so that he no longer has any place to hide. Thus his nervous breakdown is complete leaving him to pick up the pieces.<br />All of us have walls that we build up around ourselves. Some more than others depending on how open a person you are. We only let people see what we want them to see. That's what this movie is about. Imagine if all your deepest fears and secrets were completely exposed. You'd probably have a nervous breakdown too.<br />This movie doesn't follow a traditional chronological order so it's hard to follow and fit the pieces together. If you think of the beginning of the movie as the end and the rest of the movie as flashbacks you'll understand it better.<br />This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it every once in a while and am always amazed. It has possibly one of the best musical scores in history. The animated sequences are amazing with a lot of symbolism and pop art. Give it a try, especially if you like Pink Floyd's music.
B00005KKC8|5.0|It's said this album was something of a departure for the group. That this was not the ABBA people had come to know and love. No \\"Waterloo\\". Not a trace of a \\"Dancing Queen\\". It should be pointed out however that this album is not exactly \\"ABBA does Death Metal\\".<br /><br />The opener and title track is perhaps the closest they came to emulating the New Wave/Synth Pop explosion of the time. Parts of it are reminiscent of \\"Summer Night City\\" (minus the disco) and \\"Eagle\\" (without the majesty) while managing to create an interesting and unsettling sonic landscape all of its own which suggests an encounter of the third kind may very well be waiting behind the locked door, and they must surely score points for creating a pop song about Russian dissidents.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Head Over Heals\\" which treats us to its fairground synths, jaunty chorus and tale of 'girl-about-town gets herself in trouble'. This one is a bit like Agnetha's very own \\"Money Money Money\\" and lyric-wise it's tempting to imagine Bj&ouml;rn, a la Fleetwood Mac, cheekily having his ex sing a song about herself that isn't altogether flattering. Or not.<br /><br />\\"When All is Said and Done\\" is a standout in the style of \\"The Winner Takes it All\\", although it is surprisingly upbeat for a break-up song (and sort of Christmassy) with a positively defiant lead vocal from Frida. A song of shaking hands and walking away, head held high. Bittersweet rather than just plain bitter. It would have made a good, upbeat album closer, and had serendipity played its part properly, the perfect send off for the group: \\"Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun ...\\"<br /><br />\\"Soldiers\\" is perhaps the forgotten gem on this album. Starting sparsely with a vaguely military drum and some admirably restrained guitar, it then segues effortlessly from a moody, understated first verse and Agnetha's plaintive lead vocal into the most sublime, unashamedly anthemic chorus, where Frida and Bj&ouml;rn join her in some quite beautiful harmonies. As for the enigmatic lyrics: \\"Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing, the songs that you and I don't sing ...\\" What's that all about then? The need to have the courage of your convictions be it in love or war? To judge not lest you too be judged? Answers on a postcard please.<br /><br />Frida takes centre-stage once more for \\"I Let the Music Speak\\" aka \\"The One that Sounds like it Belongs on the Soundtrack of Les Miserables\\" (around the point where some peasant woman stands up in her rags and sings heartrendingly about not having enough parsnips to make soup for her son who's just returned from the war). The lyrics though tell a different story. One of nighttime hauntings and astral projection (ABBA staples then). Dark, fanciful and slightly macabre on the verses, the choruses return us to more familiar ABBA territory with Frida displaying her quite formidable vocal prowess throughout.<br /><br />After that we get \\"One of Us\\" and what can I say? It's just gorgeous. Greek tragedy laced with Swedish cool. A happy little drumbeat bouncing playfully along behind Agnetha's wrist-slashing and soaring vocals. A kitchen sink tearjerker in the great tradition of \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" (a-ha!) and \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" and quite rightly an all-time classic.<br /><br />With \\"Two For the Price of One\\" the question is always going to be Is it as bad as everyone says? The short answer is yes. The long answer, however, is also yes. By and large it bears the rare distinction of being an unintentionally funny intentionally funny song. Wait until you hear the \\"quite exciting\\" husky voice that answers the mock-telephone (unless there's another layer to this fable which I'm completely missing). The one semi-redeeming feature is the chorus, where everyone joins in with some low-key harmonies and thankfully you can no longer tell what they're singing about, but just when all the verses are out of the way and you're sure it's safe to tap your foot till the finish, in blunders the Salvation Army and marches the song off to a merciful end.<br /><br />Luckily, Agnetha is on hand to lead us back to sanity and wave her first born off to school in the shape of \\"Slipping Through my Fingers\\". Saved from mawkishness and total schmaltz by one of those sublime, harmony-heavy choruses and Agnetha's crystal clear voice and heartfelt delivery.<br /><br />\\"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\\" closes the album proper. It has to be said that, on this album at least, most of the vocal kudos must go to Frida, and she plays a blinder in this last one. Stripped as it is of all sonic clutter as well as harmonies, when the song begins you'll think - quite astonishingly - that she's singing from the corner of your room. A clock ticks away on the mantelpiece. A music box plays quietly in the background and Frida sings of lying down one last time and welcoming the Angel of Death. Amen.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks (all top-notch, especially Under Attack which features a good old-fashioned harmonic tussle between A & F in the chorus) The Day Before You Came is the standout - swirling, rain-drenched synths, a sense of impending doom while tantalisingly we never find out who or what 'you' is. It could be love. It could be Nuclear annihilation. Could be the gas bill. Pop Noir par excellence.<br /><br />All of the trademarks which made the group so popular are still in place throughout - strong vocals, clever song-structures, barmy lyrics and a healthy smattering of Scandinavian navel-gazing and marital strife. All of it delivered with an icily immaculate production sheen - elements of which dovetail neatly with the current synth revival, while the rest, due to the solid songwriting, sounds simply timeless. In short, anyone with even the most limited musical palate will find something to enjoy in this album.till the finish, in blunders the Salvation Army and marches the song off to a merciful end.<br /><br />Luckily, Agnetha is on hand to lead us back to sanity and wave her first born off to school in the shape of \\"Slipping Through my Fingers\\".

B0001BKAEY|4.0|I thought The Matrix was one of the best films I'd ever seen and was extremely disappointed with the second film; I came to this last instalment with low expectations but a desire for closure, and was pleasantly surprised.<br />The film is not as talky as the second nor as deep as the first, but it does have some exquisite graphics. However, the action scenes often go on way too long, the Anderson-Smith fight is nothing new, and ultimately I learned nothing new about the philosophy of the Matrix in either of the second two movies.<br />I was very disappointed that all the talk-talk-talk with the Frenchman and the Architect came to nothing in this film, and especially that we NEVER visit or even see the Matrix again. I expected we would see, or even hear about, all the people being freed from their artificial pods, but instead we spend all of our time in Zion or the machine city.  Also, there are some fine moments and good acting, though we don't see Neo and Trinity enough.<br />Managing to walk that fine line between exciting and downright unilluminating, the Brothers Wachowski's final instalment doesn't suck energy out of the universe, but doesn't add any either.
0345423496|1.0|First of all, there is hardly any plot.  This would be fine with my if the philosophically aspects were intriguing... but they're not.  The plot is basically that they find Frank Poole in space and revive him, and then more than the first half of the book is just introducing him to all of the new technologies and societal developments.  I don't find future predictions all that interesting as a whole, but I find it even more disconcerning that his future seems to be mostly a world where everyone has progressed along the same lines that Clarke himself would have, which is quite narcissistic, even if not intentional.  His view of religion is fairly typical of an atheist, and in many places he doesn't seem to act like he cares about empathy, or recognize Christians that are pacifistic, compassionate, and intelligent, such as his colleague Lewis (such as basically maintaining that all religious people are insane and in self-denial).  Uninformed, at best.  I'm sure Clarke would be shocked to hear that I would consider him a religious fanatic himself - just that his religion is atheism.  His character development is weak, if even that.  All of the characters are extremely bland, and there are hardly any differences between them.  I would guess that they are all people of a like mind to Clarke.  They are all incredibly bland scientist types, and Clarke would have you believe the whole human society has basically the same ideas.  The ending is somewhat compelling, but no where near the same level as 2001.  The whole novel simply seems inconsequential.  I really find it hard to believe that this same man wrote 2001 and Childhood's End.  Back to Philip K. Dick and Asimov for me!
B00006399Z|3.0|I used to have a copy of this on 8-track back in the day ... and I listened to it so much that the cartridge eventually fell apart.  <br />&quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; is a document of a place and time, and the last gasp of the original version of Traffic before it jumped off the jazz/rock deep end.  Dave Mason joined up with the expanded core group for just a handful of dates, and he delivers two songs that later showed up on his early solo efforts.<br />The recording is rather poor, particularly on the acoustic-based &quot;40,000 Headmen;&quot; unfortunately, the CD remastering helps only a little.  The package is also a bit skimpy, clocking in around 39 minutes ... a bonus track, available on other Traffic remasters, would have helped (maybe they just weren't available).<br />In all, this is Traffic's best live album.  The fiery playing and excellent vocals by Winwood, Mason and Capaldi more than make up for the primitive recording.  After all these years, this album is still a personal favorite.
0345423496|1.0|It's hard to believe this is the same author that wrote those two masterpieces!  In 3001, there is hardly any plot.  Basically, they find Frank Poole in space and revive him - leading to the first half of the book (if not more) as an introduction to Clarke's predictions of new technologies and the progress of society.  His view of religion is fairly typical of an atheist in some places, greatly misinformed in others, and extremely offensive at the worst.  He basically calls any religious person insane (most atheists tend to think of the religious more as ignorant - the reverse of which is probably true as well - but instead Clarke goes one offensive step further).  I'm sure he would be shocked to hear that I would consider him one of those religious fanatics he blames everything on, just that his religion is atheism!  Clarke really doesn't make any strong cases for his thoughts on religion, the criminal justice system, or any other flaws he sees in the 20th century.  His argues are weak and pseudo-philosophical, sometimes being little more than saying &quot;Religion is dumb - what were they thinking?&quot;  His character development is weak, if it exists at all.  All of the characters are extremely bland, and there are hardly any differences between them.  Instead of an eclectic society, everyone has basically the same ideas about life - which are probably the same as Clarke's.  Most of the book is a superficial look at what might be the future - which is what I find to be the worst kind of science fiction.  It's not until the end that any kind of plot development seems to occur, and here it is much weaker than in any of the previous three.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I have grown up with the Disney version of Peter pan all my life, and I was always dissatisfied with it (even when I didn't fully realize it).  I may still dislike Tinkerbell but in this film version of the story, I began to understand why she is important and, in the end, she is a genuinely a likable character.  <BR>Before I watched this movie, I never felt the urge to read the classic children's book, afraid I may be disappointed by the similiarity it might have to the Disney version.  But now this terrific film has made me change my mind.  Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Sumpter, and Rachel Hurd-Wood are all excellent at portraying the various dimensions of their characters, allowing the audience to truly understand their state of minds and why they are the way they are.  <BR>Overall, it is truly enjoyable and I can't wait to one day share this film with my children.
B0001L3LUE|2.0|From the trailer, The Fog of War comes across as a mea culpa of sorts by Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense to Kennedy and Johnson, to admit and accept responsibility for the disaster that was Vietnam. However, the film amounts to nothing more than McNamara outright refusing to discuss responsibility for Vietnam and instead shifting blame to Lyndon Johnson. While the film is a brilliant piece of cinematography, coupled with the phenomenal music by Phillip Glass, Errol Morris tries very hard to be a serious, historical film maker but comes across contrived and overly dramatic. <br />The lessons from the life of Robert McNamara in \\"The Fog of War\\" can be summed up, as one reviewer put it, in one short phrase: War is hell. However, the primary focus that the film seems to hedge around forever is the Vietnam war. The conclusions by McNamara that the United States failed to see Vietnam not, as the last stand against communism, but as a civil war are correct. Unfortunately, this is not the mea culpa one might expect. At the end I was left with just as many questions as I was before, namely how involved was McNamara, and how far did he go to push Kennedy and Johnson. Inevitably the blame for Vietnam rests solely at the feet of Robert McNamara; the same as some might say Donald Rumsfeld pushed and thus is responsible for the war in Iraq. <br />If you're looking for an interesting view on war, game theory, foreign policy, and waging war then this is it. A serious work of historical facts? No. Errol Morris does an excellent job of combining images, sound, and music to push across the thought that in an instant the world can be destroyed. If you are looking for an explanation of Vietnam, or someone to take blame, or even someone to admit responsibility, then this is not it. McNamara avoids the topic of responsibility completely and refuses to discuss it like the stubborn old man that he is. Furthermore, the lessons we've learned from the life of Robert S. McNamara is that war does happen, and the blame for its failure cannot be erased with time, nor can the success of it be easily forgotten. I was left with many questions than answers.
B000000H66|5.0|5 Stars is not enough to give to this album. Death starting the death metal genre and doing it perhaps beter than all their followers. Lead vocals by the now dead Chuck are beyond descriptin and the lyrics to all of Death's songs especially those on this cd are never anything les than genius. If you have any ear for good music this is for you.
B00009Z574|4.0|Tormato(1978). Yes's ninth studio album.<br />Throughout the 70s, Yes has had an amazingly everchanging career. They first came up with their own sound on The Yes Album(1971), followed by much success with Fragile(1972) and Close To The Edge(1973). By then, the band became truly progressive and released the overindulged Tales From Topographic Oceans(1974). Rick Wakeman left for a short time because he wasn't happy with where Yes was going, but thankfully they managed to churn out their last &quot;long epic album&quot; masterpiece Relayer(1974). Three years later, Rick Wakeman returned to the band and they released the excellent Going For The One(1977), which saw the band refining their song structures to shorter pieces. Still, even with the shorter songs, this album was a major success for them.<br />So the next year, vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and guitarist Steve Howe joined up again to record the next album, Tormato. The recording process ended up not being quite as inspired as the previous albums because several of the bandmembers were exhausted from the constant touring. The band even admits upon entering the studio that they &quot;weren't sure of ourselves&quot;. Throughout the recording process, the band came up with numerous experimental ideas, most of which appear within all the songs, but at the same time, you could tell that there was a tension created by differen opinions within the band. Therefore, many of the pieces would've been masterpieces with more work and a more unified focus in the band. For instance, many of the songs gradually build up to what would be a dramatic and fantastic conclusion, but end up falling short. The general consensus among fans is that this is a terrible and unfocused album. While I agree that it isn't one of their best albums, to me the music still sounds very interesting and has a lot of variety to it, and you can hear lots of cool unique musical ideas. Also noted is that Rick Wakeman dominated the songwriting process due to the presence of his 70s casio-like keyboards all over the songs. True, sometimes they appear as cheesy, but on other songs it adds to the appeal. One instrumentation factor that I do like is that Chris Squire's bass tones are HUGE. They add alot to the music here. Now let's talk about the tracks...<br />Starting off is the unorthodox train-engine drum beat opener 'Future Times'. Very different, but a great song once you get used to it. 'Don't Kill The Whale' is one of Yes's more straight-forward songs, but I like it. 'Madrigal' is a calm number, but it lacks the edge that other lighter Yes tracks like 'Turn Of The Century' and 'Soon' have. 'Release Release' is one of Yes's heavier rockers, hinting at what is to come on the next album. Very dynamic and I like the drum bit in the middle of the song. 'Arriving UFO' sports some weird sound effects and it's probably the most experimental track on the album (probably inspired by the movie Close Encounters Of The Third Kind). 'Circus Of Heaven' has a very uplifting innocent, vibe to it (Jon Anderson's son even has a small vocal part towards the end). Silly but well written. Then there's the melodically orchestral track 'Onward'. This is a very good ballad-type song with none of Rick Wakeman's casios anywhere in sight. Of course, the album's best track is none other than 'On The Silent Wings Of Freedom'. It's one of their faster-paced romps, but it's melodic, exciting, and overall enjoyable all the way through. I'd even say that it's one of my 10 all-time favorite Yes songs.<br />Unlike what some reviewers said, I thought that Rhino Records did an outstanding job with the remastering and packaging. There are very detailed liner notes and photos of the band during the era, plus there are counting 10 tracks (one hidden at the end), which doubles the album's normal length. If you're a huge Yes fan, then these bonuses are a real treat. They're not all that great,but some stand out more than others. 'Money' is sort of a &quot;boogie&quot; rock 'n roll song done in the style of Yes's first two albums. 'Picasso' is supposed to be a sequel to the last album's 'Turn Of The Century' but it fails to capture and build up the emotion that that song had. For some reason, I really enjoy the melodically uplifting 'Some Are Born'. 'Everybody's Song' is an early version of 'Does It Really Happen', a song on the next album, but with Jon Anderson's vocals. Overall, the extras on here are very good and worth hearing at least once.<br />Although Tormato isn't one of Yes's very best albums, it's still a great listen. 4 stars for the album, and 4.5 for the remastering. Most Yes fans will lead you to think that this is a terrible album, but I've noticed that a lot of Yes fans (and progressive rock fans in general) aren't very open when it comes to their favorite band's albums. The problem is that a lot of fans take the album too seriously instead of just liking Tormato for what it is. You can wait around forever for a sequel to Fragile or Close To The Edge if you'd like, but in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy one of Yes's more fun, energetic, and experimental outings.<br />Other similar albums:<BR>-'Going For The One' by Yes<BR>-'Drama' by Yes<BR>-'Hemispheres' by Rush<BR>-'Permanent Waves' by Rush

B00009Z576|5.0|Drama(1980). Yes's tenth studio album.<br />Prior to 1980, Yes saw times of great success in the 70s, their main key points being the early 70s with Fragile(1972) and Close To The Edge(1973), and the late 70s with Going For The One(1977). Afterwards, the band recorded Tormato(1978) which although an interesting album, wasn't nearly as inspired and didn't fare quite as well as previous outings. The recording process created such high tension among the band that when they went back into the studio in 1979, the band was separated into two opposing sides: The Squire/White/Howe side, and the Anderson/Wakeman side. This caused Anderson and Wakeman to both leave the band, leaving the others to look for replacements. It wasn't as big of a deal losing Wakeman because he had jumped the ship at an earlier point in the band. The real problem was replacing Jon Anderon, THE VOICE of Yes and one of the two most Yes-like bandmembers.<br />Enter vocalist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes, two goofy looking guys that formed the Buggles, a new wave band that previously created the smash hit 'Video Killed The Radio Star'. All five formed the lineup for 1980's Drama album. The main consensus I've gathered from the fans was that this album was bad because of the lack of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman, so I avoided getting the album for a while. I was worried that Drama would never be as great as other Yes albums. While it's no Relayer(1974) or Close To The Edge in terms of progressiveness, at the same time it's actually quite good on it's own terms. No, make that INCREDIBLY GOOD! While Horne and Downes aren't exactly the best bandmembers to circulate in and out of Yes, they offered a much needed outside contribution that was absent on Tormato. In fact, Downes' keyboards are much better than Rick Wakeman's cheezy casio sounds that were all over the last album. The synths here are much more full in sound, often depicting deep atmospheric textures to the music. And as for Trevor Horne... he actually sounds a lot like Jon Anderson (I know, I just committed blasphemy among Yes elitists, but it's true. He does!). So I don't see the problem with him. He was only on this album anyway. Thankfully, the songwriting here is more focused than on Tormato and as a result the music sounds cohesive and brilliant. With the exception of 'Into The Lens', I could call this one Yes's second best &quot;short song&quot; album (Going For The One is the best).<br />Here's an analysis of the tracks. Starting off is the GIANT soaring 10-minute opener 'Machine Messiah'. This song is one of my favorites and concludes that Yes is still in fact Yes. If anything is to be noted it's that this is definitely one of Yes's heavier albums they've made. 'White Car' is simply a short melodic intro which leads into 'Does It Really Happen?', an energetic rocker that showcases a lot of great guitar playing. Then there's 'Into The Lens', the only real dud on the album. If anything, this Yes song is really a Buggles song in disguise. It certainly has some of the STUPIDEST lyrics ever penned to a song, &quot;I am a camera, camera&quot;. It's the only song here I don't like. Thankfully, things pick up with the melodic, yet heavy 'Run Through The Light'. This track is a foretelling of the style that Yes would employ on their 80s reunion album 90125(1983). The final album track is the fast-paced 'Tempus Fugit', considered by many to be classic Yes's swan song. It's no end to the band, but it makes for an outstanding closing track.<br />Like the other new Yes remasters, Rhino Records does a stellar job packaging and including extras. The liner notes detail this era of the band and feature many photos (Trevor Horne has to have some of the nerdiest looking glasses I've ever seen). Of course, Rhino Records doesn't skimp out on the bonus tracks either, counting a total of 10 bonus tracks, almost tripling the size of the album. These include single versions of 'Into The Lens' and 'Run Through TheLight', the demo versions of 'Tempus Fugit' and 'White Car', and the Squire/Howe/White instrumentals 'Have We Really Got To Go Through This' and 'Satellite'. The real bonuses here though are the four final tracks taken from the '79 Paris sessions when Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman were still in the band! 'Dance Through The Light' is a vocal-less early version of 'Run Through The Light'. Then there's the uplifting rocker 'Golden Age', and the brief moody 'In The Tower'. It's too bad these last two tracks never saw the light of day, as they would've fit great on Drama. 'Friend Of A Friend' is pure pop rock, but still decent.<br />If you ever had any doubts whether this album would measure up to earlier Yes, then put your worries to rest because Drama showcases very inspired songwriting. It's a very underrated album in the context of Yes's work and is much better than most fans will lead you to think. 5 stars for both the album and the remastering. There is one bad song, but the other 5 more than make up for it. Of course, with Trevor and Geoff, the band just wasn't the same, so after the tour, Yes was put on indefinite hold. It's too bad the band themselves don't like this album because there's many great songs to be heard. If you're open minded and can take Yes without Anderson or Wakeman, then you'll definitely enjoy Drama. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other similar albums:<BR>-'90125' by Yes<BR>-'Going For The One' by Yes<BR>-'Signals' by Rush<BR>-'Asia' by Asia
B00004Z459|5.0|The only album which can challenge Hybrid Theory for overall greatness is Meteora, another Linkin Park album. This band is simply what we all needed. Limp Bizkit was getting old... all their songs overplayed, and not very good in the first place. We all need a good rap/rock band, and here's the top of the line! No where else will you find a more hardworking, honest and open, and heart-ripping band and music. With Chester yelling &quot;I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter&quot;, it doesn't get any better. People can really relate to most of these songs.<br />Key tracks- In the End, Pushing Me Away, Crawling
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  If you like bands like The Used you should like this.  My favourite track as of right is &quot;Do You Know They Do To Guys Like Us in Prison?&quot;, which is featuring the lead sing Bert McKracken from The Used.  The use of distortion on this CD is very nicely done at parts and the vocals have an original feel to them...which is rare in this day and age.  Buy this CD, honestly!  It's not Emo...it punk-rock with emotion!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I enjoyed her first CD, and her second is even better. I was actually surprised just how good it was. It took me a while to get a feel for it too, but after the third time through I was very confident of my feelings - this is an awesome CD. She sounds to me a little more like Alanis Morissette this time around. I've been playing it over and over since a got it around a week ago and have yet to get sick of it. <br />I enjoy every song, and they're each unique. You don't find yourself feeling like you've heard it before on a previous track. There's a nice variety of good sounds to be heard. It's definitely worth giving a try, and if for some reason you don't like it you can always send it back,^_^.
B00004W510|5.0|While this was one of the great albums of the greatest era, it was also an album that was so off from what was going on at the time. In an interview, Robbie Robertson once said that they didn't care about the hippie movement and what was going on around them. This was a very good thing as it led to completely original creativity through music and voice. There is no other album that could be compared to &quot;The Band&quot;. I'd also like to point out that everyone in the band was Canadian except for Levon Helm. I pointed this out because in another review, someone said that they were genuine American. Sorry, but they are 'completely' Canadian.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Please don't listen to the haters that are reviewing this album. I'm 100% sure that they haven't even heard the album!<br />Anyway...I'll make this quick. This album is the BEST of all Britney's albums. There are NO fillers on this one. The best moments on the album for me are Breathe On Me, Toxic, Outrageous, Touch Of My Hand, Shadow and Everytime. This album only has one track, that is similar to her earlier stuff, it's called Brave New Girl, but still it's a great track! So what are you waiting for? Like I said, don't read the reviews, that are written from haters, who haven't even heard the album. They don't even know what good music is.<br />Buy it!
B000002UAU|5.0|Until the sixties, singles were the main way in which people bought music. Albums had been around since the forties in one form or another and had become increasingly common, but they were still regarded as secondary to singles. They were steadily gaining in popularity but even this album sold far fewer copies at the time of its release than the singles released by the Beatles at around this time. Nevertheless, the quality of the album ensured that, within a few years, albums became the standard means by which people bought music. Singles eventually became what they are today - just marketing devices to promote albums.<br />So why did this album have such an impact? Because it's brilliant, of course, and it is different from anything that had gone before. None of the songs here were released as singles. Legend has it that Strawberry fields forever was originally intended for inclusion, but was withdrawn when it was coupled with Penny Lane for single release. Some of the songs have since become hits for others, most notably With a little help from my friends (a UK number one hit for Joe Cocker) and Lucy in the sky with diamonds (a UK top ten hit in 1974 for Elton John). Of the other songs, my favorites are A day in the life, When I'm sixty four, She's leaving home and the title track.<br />Musically, the album was very different from what went before, with all kinds of studio trickery being used for the first time. Some of the effects add to the quality of the music while some don't - they occasionally did things for the sake of it rather than because it enhanced the music - but the overall effect is of an album that was unique at the time. Some say the Beatles picked ideas from Pet sounds (the Beach Boys album) but that was in turn partly inspired by Rubber soul, an earlier Beatles album, so what goes around comes back around. Other critics claim that other have used the studio trickery to better effect, but this album came first.<br />While this is not my favorite album (that accolade belongs to Magical mystery tour), it was revolutionary in its time and contains a lot of wonderful music. If you are interested in sixties music even a little, you must hear this album.album (that accolade belongs to Magical mystery tour), it was revolutionary in its time and contains a lot of wonderful music.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Yes, that's right, put it right back down on the shelf, do not click \\"add to shopping cart\\", do not pre-order. Do not encourage George Lucas to continue reshaping & remaking this successful trilogy well into the future until it becomes distorted beyond repair. It is unfortunate that many fans are willing to accept this new trilogy anyway, & are desperate to have anything out on dvd, even if it no longer resembles the original films, despite all kinds of questionnable changes & edits to the films. Hayden Christiansen's performance in Attack of the Clones was one of the worst things about that film, & now they want to have 'continuity' between the 2 trilogies by using him in Return of the Jedi? Leave the badness of the recent trilogy out of the goodness of the first one.<br />Judging by the updates of the past few months we keep getting from the Lucas camp concerning these dvds, they refuse to even acknowledge the original versions, citing that these new ones are the 'definitive' versions. That's fine, & they can believe that if they want to, but can they at least include the original theatrical versions in the set so we can keep those & use the 'definitive' versions as coasters?<br />To be honest, Lucas & his people have been downright arrogant when asked about including the original versions.What original versions? You had your last chance to get them when they came out in 93 on laserdisc/vhs, they say. Why this attitude? All that many fans are asking is if they could have the original versions, let's say- as a 'bonus feature'-included in the upcoming dvd set. Put them in & call them 'the incomplete/working versions', if that's what he wants. But Lucas won't even budge on that. Is it really so difficult to grant this wish to the many who grew up with & loved the original versions? <br />Unless they do a swift turnaround at the last minute & decide to release the original versions with the dvd set, I'm not going anywhere near this box set. They've shown nothing but contempt for the fans up until now. It even seems that many dvd websites have adopted a spirit of appeasement towards Lucas & the upcoming dvds, afraid to upset him lest he really decides not release the original versions at any time. I know everyone is hoping for that, but I refuse to get down on my knees & play nice.<br />Say No to Lucas, don't buy these dvds, & get the original versions off of ebay. Yes, they will be transfers to dvd from the '93 laserdiscs. Yes, they will be inferior in image quality to those of the upcoming dvds. But they will be forever more real than the tripe Lucas will be releasing in a few months.<BR>What a disappointment, to have this trilogy finally released, but in such a questionnable/controversial way.........
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I just have to say, that i absolutely loved the movie underworld.  I loved it so much that as soon as it came out on dvd, i purchased it the very same day.  What I didn't like was the fact that now in May, 4 months after the dvd release, the release an extended version.  I think it's unfair. because had i known i would have bought the extended version, but i bought the normal version.  I think it's unfair to all the loyal fans who went out on the same release day to purchase the film, to know have a better film and an almost equal price.  I want to buy the extended version, but i also dobn't want to get stuck with 2 dvd's of the same movie.  IT SUCKS, and is UNFAIR!!
038073186X|3.0|Having read everything Lehane has produced,I was eager to start SHUTTER ISLAND.  I 'got' the shock ending. (read Margaret Millar for the queen of endings) I understand that Lehane wanted to do an old fashioned gothic thriller. I also understand he wants to branch off into different styles.  But this book is not the effort I expect from such a great writer.  The book is not terrible, it is simply not worthy of Lehane.  The depth of his other books reveal the shallowness of this work.  The dialog is wooden and the plot is a bit simple.  It is worth the time only don't expect Lehane's best.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|A good way to describe at the drive-in is that they have that special something. Music sounds better coming from them. Everytime I listen to this album I get blown away by how good they are. I'm always hearing something new in the songs, like &quot;wow, was that riff always there?&quot; You don't get that with alot of bands. My favourite songs on this album are 'Cosmonaut', one of the albums darker moments, and 'Invalid litter dept.' just for being what it is. In my musical tastes, this song has everything I look out for in other songs. So to rap things up. Buy this album, and learn how to love music.

B00005RYKV|5.0|I am fed up with people talking about how kill bill is such a good film. I watched this film about a week after I saw Kill Bill and I honestly think this is the better film. I watched it 3 times. The way Beat' integrates american and japanese culture makes this film standout. The scene where his luitenent plays basketball with one of his brothers friends stands out. Another scene is when they go to attack the mafia, all you see is flashes of gunfire while this young boy is dead in the car. This is a moving film, asides the infruequent gore, You feel a great sympathy for the characters.<BR>Kill bill has no technique at all especially when she is fighting the crazy 88 or whatever. I have seen more technique in Iron Monkey (an old skool martial arts film)The awkward ending leaves you distraught with no hope, but that is the point of the film and 'Beat' portays it that way.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album has a great concoction of hip-hop, jazz, rock and everything in between; it really reflects the diversity of the group. Each song presents a different mood, all of them great.<BR>Watch out for the really nice hidden track after &quot;where is the love&quot;, it's awesome.
B000021XR5|3.0|Sorry,<br />I did not think this album is up to par with any of the previous efforts. I personally think STP peaked with &quot;Tiny Music&quot; Maybe I am too hardcore. It seems most of the songs are a continuation of &quot;Barbarella&quot; Scott's solo CD. Barbarella with the exception of &quot;Your roof&quot; sucked. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan and collect everything they put out. This album did not cut it for me. To musically frayed and incohesive. Will I continue to buy STP? Hell yes, because they are prolific and write artistically masterful music. This CD however, is not of that example.
B000000Y59|5.0|Portrait in Jazz was the first of only four (official) albums made by what Evans fans know as &quot;the first trio&quot; - the one with Scott La Faro and Paul Motian - which introduced a new approach to the music of a jazz piano trio. Whereas the conventional trio tended to feature the pianist as a 'star soloist' with bass and percussion essentially as 'accompanists' with a fixed and limited role, Evans, La Faro and drummer Paul Motian aimed to develop more of a sense of equal and spontaneous interplay. Scott La Faro was the right man in the right place: his virtuoso technique and strong musical personality enabled him to play the more active, assertive (but compatible) role Evans wanted for the group. By the time this trio played its famous sessions at The Village Vanguard (Live at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby) this 'collective improvisation' was well developed. Portrait in Jazz being the first album by the trio, the roles within the group are sometimes still fairly conventional, with bass and drums functioning as a `rhythm section' with the pianist spotlighted as `leader'. However, there's a strong sense of discovery and enthusiasm which, I think, gives the music a greater freshness and vitality than the subsequent albums by this trio and it's those qualities, along with the sensitive, alert musicianship of the trio which makes this one of the most absorbing and enjoyable of Evans's many albums. <br />Part of its appeal is also the excellent choice of material, but much of the interest lies in what Evans in particular does with it. Often this is mainly a matter of the unusual chord voicings and adjustments of rhythm and phrasing he gives to a familiar tune, which open up wider harmonic and rhythmic perspectives for improvising. You hear this from the opening bars of the first number, &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; and it's evident also in the slower ballads, a haunting version of &quot;Spring is Here&quot; and a probing reading of &quot;When I fall in Love&quot;. Notice for example how, on the latter very familiar tune, Evans's slightly 'off-centre' harmonies create a different kind of emotional tone from the suave, sentimental one which singers usually give it. Among the other high spots are the famous up-tempo version of &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, with its infectious swing and lively interplay between piano and bass, similarly propulsive readings of &quot;What is this Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; and a marvellous &quot;Blue in Green&quot; on which the rapport between Evans and his partners is especially close. <br />This is a classic piano jazz album, and one that never seems to lose its freshness. Highly recommended.
B00004TLN3|2.0|This novel is my least favorite of Austen's work.  However, I did expect to pleased when I sat to watch this video. I was thoroughly disappointed.  This film was just plain silly.
B000000XH4|5.0|It would be crazy to withhold a 5-star rating from this music, but I don't really recommend the CD. The music is wonderful - ten tracks from a famous live date by one of the best-ever small groups in jazz, the Bill Evans `first trio' at the Village Vanguard in 1961. But who would want a selection which omits three particularly good tracks: the ballads \\"Detour Ahead\\" and \\"Some Other Time\\" and the gently swinging waltz, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"?<BR> <BR>Probably the best alternative is to buy the two separate Village Vanguard albums: `Waltz for Debby' and `Sunday at the Village Vanguard'. Opinions may differ about which is the best of the two; but I think that `Waltz for Debby' is the one to go for first if you aren't ready to buy both. That entirely subjective recommendation is because I think that Evans was playing particularly well at slow and slowish tempos on this occasion and there are more examples of this on `Waltz for Debby' than on `Sunday at the Village Vanguard', notably the sublimely lyrical \\"My Foolish Heart\\" and the moving \\"I Loves You Porgy\\" (but you also need to hear \\"My Man's Gone Now\\", the one piece at slow ballad tempo on `Sunday at the Village Vanguard'). To save later regrets, buy the versions that contain alternate takes of some of the tracks, unless, as some listeners do, you think an original album is spoilt by the inclusion of material which the artist `rejected'. Even if these takes are not essential they at least make the CDs better value.<br />Another alternative, for `completists' who don't mind the expense, is to buy the 3-CD `Complete Village Vanguard' set on the Japanese label, JVC Victor (VICJ-60951), which has all the available tracks from the sessions including alternate takes. I think it is only available as a pricey import. An even pricier alternative is to buy the complete Riverside recordings box set, which includes this `complete Village Vanguard' material. Isn't it amazing that more than 40 years after the event there is still not an official, well remastered, sensibly-priced `Complete Village Vanguard' set which doesn't need to be expensively imported, and which would surely fit onto two CDs?<br />However, if a one-disc selection is what you want, you could consider another alternative, which is to track down, if you can, the selection available on the Italian `Giants of Jazz' label in its `Immortal Concerts' series, under the title `Waltz for Debby/Village Vanguard' (53207). It includes \\"Detour Ahead\\", \\"Some Other Time\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" which this Fantasy version omits, and it omits \\"Solar\\" and \\"Jade Visions\\" which the Fantasy includes. It is better value, with 11 tracks in good (if not the best possible) sound on a label which usually retails at budget price. However, at the moment it is difficult to get hold of. <br />But my recommendation is to avoid selections. This is music to live with and to come back to again and again, so you might as well go all the way and buy either the `Complete Village Vanguard' edition or the two separate constituent albums. <br />I also recommend that anyone interested in this music should look up Adam Gopnik's New Yorker article, \\"That Sunday\\", which marked the 40th anniversary of the Village Vanguard date in 2001. It can be found on the Bill Evans Web Pages site.

0804106304|4.0|Each of the four Chinese ladies at the Mahjong table has a story to tell. The Joy Luck Club tells the story in detail. Each arrived in America through different circumstances. Many faced poverty, arranged marriages and loss of children, family and possessions. They lived through hardships that they cannot forget. When they arrived in America, they learned to speak English and adapt to American ways although Chinese culture still dominated their lives. The Joy Luck Club is also about their daughters. The daughters are American-born Chinese and are totally different. They cannot understand their mothers and become frustrated easily by their ways.<br />The story is rich with detail and engages the reader in small captivating chapters. It is easy to cry as you imagine some of the pain that the mothers experienced in China. One can tell the huge generation gap among immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters more clearly after reading this book.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|First off, for those reviewers who are wasting their time trying to persuade people that have come to read reviews on an AVRIL LAVIGNE CD not to buy the CD, you're absolutely crazy. You're wasting your time and being rude. You are entitled not to enjoy the artist, but bashing others for enjoying it is stupid.<br />That being said, I am one of the people that enjoy Avril and her music. I am speaking purely of the music, not counting things the media try to cram down my throat or other's opinions that I don't want half of the time. Her music is a strange mixtues, often compared to Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch, and it is definetely different than her previous album.<br />Firstly, this music can be called more &quot;gothic&quot; by some, but it's not gothic, it's darker, the two are not the same. Her lyrics are written mainly by her this time, rather than others before, and she has co-written with a new friend, Chantal Kreviazuk.<br />If you enjoy rock-ish music, darker lyrics, more matured vocals and what sound, in my opinion, to be heart-felt lyrics, I recommend this CD. My personal favorite being &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, written in memory of Lavigne's late grandfather.<br />Buy the CD because of the music, not the media hype.

Specifically because people referred to it as a complex story filled with political intrigue and convoluted plotting. I bought the Advanced Reading Copy with Tom Doherty's (President of TOR books, which is releasing Gardens of the Moon and the other books in Malazan in the US) letter in the front also comparing it it Martin's work. After starting with much anticipation, I found myself slogging through this poorly written book. All I have to say after finishing it is that Mr. Erickson is no George R.R. Martin. My main gripes are: 1- The characters are half-assedly hashed out. It was hard to get a good picture in my head of what was going on, what people/places were like. Relationships were skimmed over. It was obvious that Mr. Erickson had a dictionary on hand, which is good. I like expanding vocabulary. But the sloppiness that he used to cobble this book together just made it annoying. 2-The dialogue seems so unnatural at times. Continually I would find myself wondering at the words coming out of character's mouths. &quot;Why would a god say THAT?&quot; It just sounds stupid!&quot; There was an inherent wrongness to much of the dialogue. 3- Logic breakdown. There were several times in the book I would find myself going &quot;Huh? That makes no sense.&quot; I didn't keep a log book of every time this happened (it would have been long), but one example that comes to mind is when Crokus and company are attacked by Adjunct Lorn near the Gadrobi hills by the barrow of the Jaghut Tyrant. She and Crokus came face to face, and she could have easily killed him then. The author is always going on about Lorn's &quot;special sense&quot; in regards to things arcane (Crokus is chosen of the twin gods Oponn, and bears their mystically imbued coin), and almost immediately after she lets Crokus and friends go back to Darujishtan, she makes a direct beeline to assassinate him in Darujhistan using her said &quot;arcane spidey senses&quot; that apparently failed to detect and recognize him just outside the city. There was no explanation as to why. Obviously the book is fantasy, of which I am a huge fan. I understand that a fantasy book is not going to mirror reality, that's the whole point. But if it's not INTERNALLY CONSISTENT and the people inside of it don't act like people would, it's going to drive me nuts. Gardens drove me nuts. The whole books is just chock full of weak premises and weak logic.<br />Many of the ideas in this book are interesting. Perhaps if Mr. Erickson had taken more time with this book and had better editors it may have been worth the read. However, I think there's a reason it has taken so long to be released in the US. And it has nothing to do with the alleged fact that it's &quot;Too complex for Americans&quot;. Rather I think that up til now they've called a spade a spade, and let the Brits keep Gardens of the Moon, in all it's sloppy glory, to themselves.ect beeline to assassinate him in Darujhistan using her said &quot;arcane spidey senses&quot; that apparently failed to detect and recognize him just outside the city.

Read the end flaps of this book and quickly put it back on the shelf.  Not only is the book not funny... it's not even entertaining.  Everything in the book was covered in 7th and 8th grade English classes!<br />Save your money.  Go to your local bookstore, read the end flaps, have a chuckle or two and put it back on the shelf.  Buy a softcover version of a classic you've always meant to read.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|First let me say this album is ALOT lighter than their previous work. I didnt like this cd the frst time I listened to it. I hate people that say Slipknot is just a bunch of mask wearing suicidal maniacs. I happen to be a fan of metal. My favorite album of all time is At The Gates-Slaughter of the Soul and Slayer-R.I.B.There is alot of talent maybe not as much with the DJs but the drummer is one of the best I've heard in about 5 years. They should drop about 3 members because 3 percutionists is not needed with a drummer as good as Jordison I am not some 13 year old that says IOWA is the best album ever and old stuff like Led Zepplin and Slayer suck. IOWA was a good cd that many people did not like. There self titled cd is also a extremly good cd one of my personal favorites but I am musicly open(some of my favoite bands are The Haunted,At The Gates,Death,Children of Bodom,Slayer)Some of the songs are awesome on this cd such as pulse of the maggots which, in my opinion is the best song on the cd.Vermilion I hated at first but its a good song after you listen to the album enough.Same with the intro.The only songs I dont really like ar circle(alot of people like it)and the nameless but the latter is a decent song.I am a maggot and a metal head a breed that hardly exists anymore(most Slipknot fans are under 16 to this day)I am a fun of some Nu-Metal such as System of a Down and surprisngly Linkin Park. Older music though such as Inflames,Cradle of Filth and Shadows Fall are other examples of Metal. People bad mouith this band saying that fans claim this is heavier and classic rock sucks.I hate  these kind of people that say anything other than Nu_metal sucks. I used to be a Korn fan but there music isnt as good once you listen to it 5 years later(their last 2 cds suck)I also hate bands like AFI,Thrice,Story of the Year,Simple Plan... People say Slipknot is musically rearted but love this crap called Emo music. Slipknot in the end gets Sterotyped for being sucidal, screaming 99.99% of their music and being quote from an online message board\\"slipnot isa buncha clown-fag sucidal retads tht juss screm\\"Not only is this untrue, its plain ignorant.Slipknot just gets confused with the nu-metal metalheads hate so much. If you wanna get into metal listen to this then move on to bands such as Inflames,At the Gates,Shadows Fall, Slayer, Cradle of Filth,Lamb of God,Death,Children of Bodom...Anyway actaully listen to music before you review it other than just stating opinions based on appearances and listening to 2 seconds of it and saying its garbage.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|a lot of people think this cd is very creative, artistic, and shows great musicianship. Heavymetal music however is primarily easy music. it is made this way so non-musicians can enjoy music w/o becoming overwelmed with sophisticated musical ideas. as far as heavy metal goes, it's not bad. But true music, at its best, is not found here.
0060005688|5.0|Schwartz takes an interesting perspective on the decision sciences, exploring not how we could make decisions better, but instead how we can feel better about the decisions we do make.  <br />He explains that we live in a world with overwhelming choice, where every activity from buying a box of cereal to choosing our ideal job offers us an almost unlimited set of options.  But although these increased choices often make us better off objectively, they don't necessarily make us feel any better.  Instead, we get anxious while making the decision and then feel regret once it's made, wondering if we made the &quot;right&quot; choice.  Schwartz helps us understand the psychological underpinnings of our anxieties regarding choice, and then offers some simple but useful suggestions on how we can feel better in the world we live in.<br />I really enjoyed this book...and as a &quot;maximizer&quot; I found it very helpful.  It's a quick read, so if you're at all intrigued by the title then I'd definitely buy it.
B00005J6T0|5.0|After 2 mega-selling albums with 1983's self-titled album and 1984's sometimes imfamous &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, Madonna avoids the third album jinx by releasing her greatest selling album to date at this point in her career &quot;True Blue&quot;.<br /> Released in August of 1986, this CD outsold it's two predecessors and it deserved all of the success that it got. Although it's certainly cheesy in some ways, &quot;True Blue&quot; is to me Madonna's album where a much greater maturity took the podium and her voice sounds so much better than it did previously.<br /> While most of these songs like &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot; border on the edge of 1980s bubble-gum pop music this CD is one of my favorites for two really excellent and thought-provoking classic hits which are &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot;. The former while certainly straight-out pop in nature has a very dramatic and pleading sense of urgency and a great orchestral sound to back it up. &quot;Live To Tell&quot; is in my opinion Madonna's greatest ballad and having a really dark yet bright sound with a really dramatic undertone about someone surviving a horrific crime or accident (whatever you call it) and living to tell about it. I really love the haunting keyboard effects and the echoing beat.<br /> &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; is a long-lasting classic with those memorable tinkling keyboard effects but it is really starting to show it's age with those tingling keyboard effects but it's still great to listen to.<br /> I strongly recommend this for Madonna fans because it is just plain fun and people from anywhere on the intelligence scale can really enjoy this album because it's just plain fun and is a great time capsule for a great year in music (In my opinion). The remastered edition has really improved sound quality and included are two extra remixes of &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;La Ista Bonita&quot; both of which are good.<br />In a way it makes me sad to think that Madonna has lost her way in making such great music like this with her latest atrocity that is &quot;American Life&quot; which sounds far more dated than &quot;True Blue&quot; does.makes me sad to think that Madonna has lost her way in making such great music like this with her latest atrocity that is &quot;American Life&quot; which sounds far more dated than &quot;True Blue&quot; does.
6305622914|5.0|This is an exemplarary example of the kind of wry, sociologically observant humor that the English do so well (and that we do so poorly, if ever). A brilliant and touching portrait of Sheffield, out-of-work steelworkers, the English working class, gender relations, and much more. I've seen it perhaps a dozen times, and each time I not only have laughed at the same jokes, but have also noticed some nuance that I overlooked before.

B00005B4GU|3.0|Amnesiac plays as sort of a continuation of the sound and ideas found on Kid A. Similar sounds pervade it, and similar themes link it. However, despite what Radiohead and others have tried to claim to the contrary, Amnesiac doesn't really work as an album by itself, but rather as a companion to the preceding album.<br />Amnesiac is a much more conventional sounding album than Kid A, more immediately likeable and easier to get into and understand. This in and of itself should endear itself to many listeners more than the intensely cerebral and experimental Kid A. And indeed, if not for some problems, I think I would like Amnesiac better than Kid A myself.<br />The big problem is the very lopsided track listing and track selection. For every moment of brilliance on the album (the Bends-era guitar song &quot;Knives Out,&quot; the brilliant &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; and the paranoid &quot;I Might Be Wrong,&quot; as examples), there is at least one other track that is either unnecessary, a failed experiment, or both (the annoying shifting beats of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,&quot; the pointless guitar noodling of &quot;Hunting Bears,&quot; and a completely unnecessary re-interpretation of Kid A's &quot;Morning Bell&quot;).<br />If anything, the spotty tracklisting and weaker songs seem to point to the argument that Amnesiac is, at best, a collection of songs too conventional to make it on Kid A. While I resist the notion that Kid A is little more than Kid B, I can certainly say that I enjoy Amnesiac far less than its predecessor (and is perhaps my least favorite Radiohead album, not counting the abysmal Pablo Honey).<br />Overall, fans of Kid A's sound will find much to enjoy here, but probably won't find it to be as spectacular a package as Kid A.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a fresh new musical and the soundtrack allows listeners unable to see the Broadway show to hear the wonderful voices of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. The two leading ladies have amazing vocal skills and the harmonies the two create during the CD are wonderful. Kristin Chenoweth's belting soprano voice is showcased in the cute song Popular that is also humorous and catchy. Idina Menzel deeper voice performs a show stopper in Defying Gravity. After listening to the great songs on the CD, you will be singing their praises along with vocalizing them for the next week. The musical is fresh and new, and filled with catchy songs that appeal to everyone. The soundtrack is a great buy if you are partial to muscials and love Broadway
B000002N2N|5.0|This IS the Ramones.  To fully appreciate the &quot;Bruddas&quot;, you have to experience them live and this is the closest you're going to get to the Ramones at their peak!  Here, you have the band while they still cared 100%.  You have Joey before he decided to mumble through lyrics.  You have Johnny before he tried to play every song faster than the speed of light.  You have Dee Dee, period!  You have them when they still all, more or less, liked each other.  Unlike later live albums like Loco Live, this one leaves you feeling as if you were there, without feeling like you've been rushed out the damn door.  This is the same set as the recently released Live NYC disk.  The only difference being Joey's in-between song banter (what there is of it).  Instead of Joey telling the crowd &quot;After eating that chicken Vindaloo, I wanna be well!&quot;, he says &quot;After eating that dressing room food..&quot;  The sound on It's Alive is far superior however, so if you're buying one or the other, make it It's Alive.  All the early day hits are here- Cretin Hop, Rockaway Beach, Sheena is a Punk Rocker, Teenage Labotomy....and so on.  Make your day and pick this mutha' from tha' Bruddas up!
B000002UR7|1.0|...they sounded like every other guitar rock band on the planet, and if there's anything Radiohead usually aren't, it's generic.<br />Alas, Radiohead's debut has not aged well at all in any way. Momentary flashes of the group's later brilliance pop up occasionally (most notably in the horrendously-overplayed (yet still high quality) &quot;Creep&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;), but for the most part, it's a group trying to find its voice and failing miserably, as most of this album will be forgotten as soon as you're done listening to it.<br />Some would say that this album was ahead of its time when it came out. No it wasn't. Radiohead sounded like every other post-grunge outfit on the radio at that time. It can't really be &quot;ahead of its time&quot; if its sound can be classified by the time period it was released in.<br />Some would also say that you shouldn't come down so harshly on this album for being such an early release by the band, and this may be true. However, just going by the differences between Pablo Honey and The Bends (their second album), the jump in quality between the two is staggering. Even the difference in quality between Pablo Honey and the My Iron Lung EP (released the year after Pablo Honey) is pretty noticeable.<br />Overall, what we're left with are the very sketchy beginnings of one of the greatest bands in rock and roll. Some of you Radiohead fans might be tempted to buy it just to make your collection complete. Don't. You'll probably only listen to this album once and put it away on a shelf somewhere. Your money would be much better spent elsewhere. Also, those of you thinking about buying Pablo Honey as an intro to the group should think again. The Bends makes a much better introduction to the group's sound.
B000148KK2|1.0|I own three of Diana's previous albums, &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Look of Love&quot; and &quot;Love Scenes&quot; and think they are marvelous... however, this new album, which is her FIRST POP ALBUM, is economical, uninspired, &quot;formula&quot; and pedestrian.<br />The ONLY thing that is truly &quot;fresh and original&quot; on this CD are the compositions by Elvis Costello and Diana... however, they are weak and immature. The lyrics themselves do not often even fit the melody, but rather ramble on without purpose or point. Something I found consistantly irritating to hear. The tempos are equally repetitive and unimaginative. Diana's voice, distant and brooding. I am told she is &quot;expressing herself&quot;..... I bought this album thinking, as a fan, Diana would sing something I COULD RELATE TO... not so, this is HER album for her own gratification with Elvis. Call it &quot;original&quot; if you must, Diana.<br />I read other reviewers refer to this as a jazz album... as if to say that pop albums are a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with a jazz musician doing pop. Ella Fitzgerald, Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Tony Bennett, and many other &quot;jazz&quot; singers have made successful pop hits.... but the songs on this CD don't come close to what those jazz artists accomplished in the pop world... they made pop albums wth originality and those recordings remain timeless... and what is worse, Diana Krall is one of the few jazz singers today who COULD make a magnificent pop album... unfortunately, this is not it. <br />Diana has taken her husbands advice and emulated a very unoriginal style that curiously resembles Norah Jones, Joni Mitchell and Bonnie Raitt. A style that is currently VERY popular. Even singing a few non-Costello songs from some of these very artists. So far from being &quot;original&quot;, this album was obviously made to appeal to the larger (more profitable) audience who is currently buying that style of pop singing... and it is succeeding. Case in point: I visited Ms. Kralls official website and it brags that this is the BEST selling (and most profitable) album she has made. Not surprisingly, they fail to mention that this album is also the weakest of any of her previous albums according to the overall reviews. <br />That's okay Diana, forget about making any more jazz albums with big orchestras and fancy arrangers ... they are too expensive and pop albums like this one are far cheaper, are more fun to make and you get to keep most of the profits yourself. Smart girl.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead are nothing if not courageous. Hot on the heels of their masterpiece OK Computer, they decided to release the highly experimental and electronic Kid A, an album that's nearly the polar opposite of its predecessor. Instead of the amazing walls of sound and lush guitar work of OK Computer, we're left with sparse, minimalist, and highly electronic soundscapes that are simultaneously disorienting and fascinating.<br />I can admit that, at first, I hated Kid A. I couldn't understand how the band that made OK Computer could release something as bizarre as this and get away with it. Subsequent listens, however, have started to reveal the album's strengths to me.<br />The band make their new sound known immediately on the odd &quot;Everything in Its Right Place,&quot; with Thom Yorke singing over a sparse keyboard line and his own chopped-up-beyond-recognition vocals. The song itself serves as a shock to the senses and gives early indication that the album is not going to be anything like OK Computer in the slightest.<br />Sound experiments litter the album. &quot;Kid A&quot; comes across as otherworldly, its robotic, vocoded vocals and electronic beats further driving home the album's strangeness, and &quot;The National Anthem&quot; (by far the album's most brilliant track) marries a menacing bass line with a marching band that sounds like it's being led into a meat grinder.<br />The best thing about the album is that every song on the album works toward the whole. Even the much-lambasted ambient piece &quot;Treefingers,&quot; in my opinion, serves as a perfect bridge between the quietly beautiful &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and the more uptempo &quot;Optimistic.&quot;<br />Overall, this album definitely isn't for everybody. However, if you keep an open mind and given the album a few listens for it to set in, this is perhaps Radiohead's most brilliant release next to OK Computer.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is the best film that I have seen on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  I have a video titled \\"How Christ Died - The Final 18 Hours\\", of which I previously viewed as the best representation of what Christ suffered.  Gibson's film not only accurately portrays what Christ suffered but it brings out the emotions of what the people closest to him must have felt.  I believe that it is very important for people to understand what Christ did for us.  We hear many stories of his teaching but we don't see or hear much about how much he suffered for his greatest creation...mankind.

B00005JMCT|2.0|This movie just tries to squeeze out a few more million out of our pockets by reusing all the jokes from the previous two movies. What you saw in the previews was about the extent of the jokes -- and those weren't funny at that.<br />The only worthwhile part of the movie -- if a part can be called worthwhile; nothing could have saved this disaster -- would be the acting of Seann William Scott. His ability to critique each moment with one of his memorable quips was somewhat interesting. Even with him, I still give the movie only 2 stars.<br />If you must see the movie in order to finish out the series, get it from the rental store or a friend, but do not buy it. You will regret it.

I bought it in 1986 in high school and listened to it bookend-ed between shriekback's \\"oil and gold\\" and the butthole surfers \\"psychic powerless and another man's sac\\" for about a year until the cassette (unwittingly, yet ceremoniously) self-destructed in my datsun's tape player.<br />that seems like extraneous information wrt to husker du, but it isn't. this record made me want to see where this band came from, so i did. and discovered their discography backwards from candy apple grey.<br />i still listen to husker du in 2004 as much as i did when i first learned about them. i think the trio of wig, new day rising, and zen arcade is unmatched in sheer sonic accolade-worthy diy rock. but i still think candy apple grey is a terrific record.<br />candy apple grey shows the artistic expression of the band as it was beginning to blow itself apart. songs like dead set on destruction and eiffel tower high back-to-back show how the band was simultaneously moving forward while the dynamic tension of hart and mould conditioned the peak musical experience with frenetic but controlled energy on the verge of total obliteration.<br />in my mind candy apple grey is a seminal and pivotal record for rock and roll. and while the band was on a bigger label, they were playing for the same reason: emotional aural experience. and the band never compensated for that with their sound or their enthusiasm.<br />candy apple grey is a five star record in a universe of music where 3 stars is really good, 4 stars is essential, and 5 stars is classic, 18 years later.

Even if i don't care for the style I've gotta say that this band is the real deal and for a band to actually scare me says something....They had all the markings for a true black metal band and I'm gonna say Kudos to this band for being real. By the CD if you're into Slayer or Venom cause I'm sure that these guys are gonna shock you.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Ok, I'll start by saying I'm disappointed. Here's a band that in the past has proven that they have the potential to create great things... and yet sadly, they haven't done so with Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses.<br />Anyone who wants to bitch about the \\"nu metal\\" crap or whatever it's called, well good luck to you. There is no line that was ever drawn that divides old from \\"nu\\", it's all one gradual and natural musical evolution. So here we have Slipknot, a band which takes a MAJOR influence from death metal (any REAL metalhead would agree with me there) trying to pull moves with the big boys of death metal and falling flat on their faces.<br />Guitarists Mick and James have the talent to be BRILLIANT guitarists but their little dabbles in traditional style metal lead soloing is woeful... vocalist Corey forgot he was singing for SLIPKNOT and thought he was making anothing STONE SOUR record... really, the only individual that truly shines is drummer Joey (who happens to outshine the rest of the band on ALL their albums)...<br />Simply put, Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses is little more than an experiment gone wrong. Slipknot's lost their sight, their vision and their minds. I always had faith that when the time came for Slipknot to show their REAL death metal roots, they would blow EVERYONE away... I guess I had too much faith. They failed to impress.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When I went to see this movie in the theaters I didn't really know what to expect. Then I was swept away by this wonderful film, which has got to be one of the best movies of all time, not to mention the best adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic yet. I remember when I came out of the theater feeling as if I had just come from Neverland itself. It is far deeper and has much more substance to it than the entire host of versions of Peter Pan put together (Hook especially! Seriously, do NOT watch that movie). I love the scene when Peter and Wendy are dancing in the moonlight. It is so beautiful. I can never for the life of me figure out why it did not do well at the box office, and it wasn't even present at the Academy Awards (it should have gotten \\"Best Original Score\\" at least). In the first place, they finally have the sense to get A BOY to play Peter. Jeremy Sumpter was perfectly cast, and so was Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy--and to think--this is her first movie! Jason Isaacs as Hook and as Mr. Darling was amazing. Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell were great as John and Michael, and so were all the Lost Boys, especially Theodore Chester as Slightly. And don't forget Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell. She was also perfect--funny, wild, and beautiful. The special effects are amazing, and the music is so beautiful it's breathtaking. Perfect casting, wonderful script, great special effects, and beautiful music--what more could you want from a movie?

B000002H2H|5.0|Released in 1984, Ride the Lightning is Metallica's Second Album.<br />Although Kill 'Em All was arguably the album that revolutionized Underground Heavy Metal, Ride the Lightning assuredly expanded the Underground scene to new heights. Only one year after the release of Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning comes off as a fully realized and ambitious Thrash album that showed Metallica WERE the Kings of Metal, and they never lost their throne until releasing St. Anger. Each track tries something new and it explores the limits of Metallica's creativity, not just in lyrics but in complex song structures that show a maturity most musicians can't capture until VERY far in their career, except like Led Zeppelin, Metallica pulls it off very early on with their sophomore album Ride The Lightning. Although not commercially popular, after the release of the Black Album, many people began to peruse Metallica's early records, and since then, EVERY SINGLE METALLICA ALBUM HAS BEEN CERTIFIED PLATINUM, signifying these albums staying power and popularity. Although none of the songs on Ride The Lightning charted, you still hear such fan-favorites as &quot;Fade To Black&quot; and &quot;For Whom The Bells Toll&quot; on a regular basis(At least on my radio stations!). Although not as grandiose as Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All(Their Best!), Ride The Lightning stands as one of the best moments in Metallica's career, and it shouldn't be missed by anybody. Below you'll see song by song reviews to see just why this record is so great!<br />Track Reviews:<br />Fight Fire With Fire-10/10: Don't be fooled by the classical guitar at the beginning, you're not in for a night at the opera!Burton's bass and Ulrich's drumming immediately pick the pace up to a frenzy, and Hetfield's vocals echo bloody murder behind the instruments! Crazy solo by Hammett, and it shows why he's the best guitarist ever!<br />Ride The Lightning-9/10: Hammett's deathly riff starts us off, and Hetfield's rather high-pitched vocals scream out lyrics about being killed in the Electric Chair. Great chorus, but Hetfield's vocals are a little iffy on this song, thus one point degraded. Really long interlude where Hammett and Lars thrash it out for 2 minutes straight!<br />For Whom The Bells Toll-10/10: Echoing eerily of AC/DC's Hells Bells, church bells resound behind Hammett's doomy riff. Thrash is it's supposed to sound, we get 5 minutes of total bliss that revolve around Hammett's mastery of the guitar and his exuberant playing. Hetfield's vocals AND lyrics are great, and I would have to say this beats out all the other competition on this CD!<br />Fade To Black-10/10: Really overrated, but a great song nonetheless. A far cry from &quot;One&quot;'s mastery, Fade To Black is a sermon about the effects of suicide through Hetfield's eyes. Hammett's soulful acoustic guitar playing and Hetfield's heartbroken vocals truly show Metallica were geniuses. Really thrashy as it goes along, and Hammett's solo is incredible!<br />Trapped Under Ice-10/10: If you call this or &quot;Escape&quot; filler, you are a MORON! One of the hardest songs here, we are thrusted headfirst to Hammett's heavenly solo at the beginning of the song! Soon after Hetfield takes over, singing the (rather cheesy) lyrics superbly.<br />Escape-10/10: Hammett's addictive guitar riff starts the song off and stays the entire time, and Hetfield's vocals truly echo the mind of someone trapped and unable to escape, very haunting!Rather creepy solo from Hammett, and it perfectly matches the song's tone! The police siren only gives added effect to this song!<br />Creeping Death-10/10:A song about the 10th plague sent down by God in Egypt to combat the pharoah is a non-stop thrashfest, and clocking in at 6:36 it's a fully realized one too. Hetfield's vocals are exceptional here, his voice infused with a sarcastic tone about death. Great solo from Hammett and a killer bass line from Burton!<br />The Call of the Ktulu-10/10: Although not as magnificent as the S&amp;M version, Ride the Lightning's version is nothing short of excellent. You get 8 minutes of some of the best instrumentalists pushing all their instruments to the creative brink. Truly a masterpiece, and my favorite instrumental by Metallica.<br />Overall, this is a flawless album that won't fail to disappoint Metallica diehards and metalheads alike. Ride The Lightning is a glorius step up from Kill Em All, but it really only hints at the greatness to come. Don't worry about the album only being 8 songs, it still manages to be almost 50 MINUTES LONG, which is a lot more than you can say for most albums today! A casual warning to buyers, Hetfield's vocals on Ride the Lightning sound much lighter and different that his later material, so don't come in expecting that!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! FANS OF METALLICA, METAL, AND MOST ROCK WOULD HIGHLY ENJOY THIS ALBUM! METALLICA AVOIDS THE SOPHOMORE SLUMP IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE! ALSO GET: MASTER OF PUPPETS,...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, AND THE BLACK ALBUM!Thanks for reading!Although not as magnificent as the S&amp;M version, Ride the Lightning's version is nothing short of excellent.

B000002UJQ|5.0|It's the artifact that best chronicles the sentiment of that decade. Pop perfection.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|but since Creed has broken up, and the music world in now a brighter place, I guess that makes these guys the number one most over rated band, or possibly the Vines(who think they copy Nirvana), its a toss up. <br />I seriously loved this album when I first got it, last year, not just this week like everyone else that loves whatever their radio tells them to love. I listened to it a whole lot for about a month. Then since they have gotten more popular I have begun to hate &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; its just everywhere. The more I think about every song on here the more I realize that I only loved them because they sound exactly like other songs I love. For instance, my favorite song on here was &quot;Look What You've Done&quot;, but I have come to the conclusion that I only loved it so much because it sounds exactly like my favorite Beatles song, &quot;Hey Jude.&quot;  So if I want to here an amazing song I will listen to the original, and the comparison of the 2 songs is like comparing a Big 'n Tasty with a filet mignon. <br />As for the rest of the disc, every song either sounds exactly like another Beatles, Stones, or AC/DC song. Cold Hard B!tch starts exactly the same way as AC/DC's Shoot to Thrill. <br />Just pass this disc by, you've heard it all before and if you haven't then go buy any album by the 3 bands mentioned above and hear the original versions of these songs. If you are looking for modern rock bands with classic rock sounds that do not copy their music, immediately buy anything by the White Stripes, Secret Machines, Supagroup, or Silvertide.
B00005JLK1|2.0|I'll give ya the good and the bad as quickly as I can.  <br />The good; Acting.  Everyone was pretty on their game in this film.  The visuals were pretty good too, they kept the movie creepy in a classic way.  <br />The bad; the plot.  Maybe I've seen too many ghost stories but how many times can we learn the lesson, gold leads to dead cursed stuff.  The movie was well written for what it was but it wasn't much.  Cheap scares all done before with little variation.  Personally it's a film I'm not likely to remember in 6 months unless I see the cover again.
006054094X|1.0|With the (stupid or, worse, deliberately nasty) untrue comments about Europe in he 1400's. Why did this Menzies guy wrongly try to make Europe out to be so primitive in comparison to China? Why? He's wrong no matter what his reason.
0425098478|5.0|This should be in the library of all managers and those aspiring to be leaders.  It keeps accountability straight; and promotes initiative and quality in all involved.  I find that this method gives each person in my command a sense of worth and it is very respectful of that person's ideas and performance.  Better than any other style of management.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is so good. I just loved the action in it. The blood is somethings too much but other than that you could ask for a better movie. The historical aspect of the movie was very good. Execpt the Marcus Aurelius, the Emperor at the beging of the movie, never wanted to restore the Republic no on else wanted to do this as well. The thumbs up and down were not correct if you had lived in anctient Rome. Thumbs up was death and down was life becuase death was the enterainment to the Romans. However the fight at the beging of te movie distplayed very actruate military moves. There actually was a German tribe that envaded the Empire in 167 B.C. during the rule of Marcus Aurelius. The formations of the centurian was accurate but Marcus Aurelius died of cancer and not of his son as in the movie. The Gladiator fights themselves were very well done. The Romans actually did fights in which one group was a particular army and the other was the good people. Such as the fight in which Maximus' gladiators were Hannibal's men and the others were Scipio Africanus' men. The two armies dipictied were actullay real people that were alive during the Punic Wars in which Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal's men a the battle of Zama in 202 B.C. The section in which Maximus was trying to get his army back becuase his army thought he was dead. Was very well done becuase due to the fact that Rome became a professional army due to Marius and their loyalty rested with thier Generals not Rome. So this is why Maximus could have marched on Rome with his army if they had gotten reunited. This is one of my favorite movies I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did and still am.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The words STAR WARS used to mean something, but now they are soulless and empty. Thanks to the mind of George Lucas, we will never see the beloved originals again. I am not only sad, but greatly disappointed. This release is nothing more than cowardly.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Lucas does not believe in the brilliance of his original creation, the ones that fans have devoted a lifetime to. Why? I can't even come up with one logical reason. So what if the originals were old and archaic? That's why we liked them.<br />(...).<br />This pathetic showing is absolutely devastating. There's no excuse for George Lucas not to release what the fans really want.
1582432678|5.0|I loved this book. The character of the mother was revealed so well in the form of letters to her husband. The evolution of the criminal son in the letters along with the loss of the marriage and ultimately everything was just so inevitable. I kept wanting to shake Eve and tell her to run, run. But she didn't and that was the thing that caused the most afterthought. I wanted to know what happened over the years she visited her son, if a relationship ever formed. For all the darkness, it seemed to me there was a tiny ray of hope at the end. But this book will stay with me for a long time.
B00004TL21|2.0|This CD is really nothing special. The songs aren't really that interesting, and the lyrics are almost meaningless. However compared to some other bands this is acceptable. If you like other Deftones CDs you might like this. The music on this CD is so bland you cant really come up with anything substantial to critisize.
B00001QEE8|5.0|I'm a little kid, don't remember exactly how old, elementary school age. My teenage cousin promises to take me to see *The Jungle Book*. She falls asleep. Minutes are ticking down to show time. I poke at her but she snoozes on. Elders tell me to leave her alone. I stand over her and glare, using my powers of mind control to will her awake. It works!<br />I was just desperate to see this movie. I loved all the Disney animals stories and *The Jungle Book* turned out to be my favorite. The lively songs, lush animation, compelling characters, and strong storyline left quite an impression on me. Can never forget the loving and gentle Bagheera, that kooky monkey, and Baloo, Baloo the lovable bear. Ooh, and that sinister Shere Khan striking fear in the hearts of all and the slithering sneaky snake always up to no good. The voices used are wonderful and fit the characters to perfection. I was in heaven, and it has stood the test of time by remaining one of my favorite animated films.<br />I just wanted so badly, just longed to be a girl version of Mowgli. Raised by wolves, living wild and free in the jungle, playing with the bears and apes. Climbing trees and swinging from vines. Yep, that was the life for me. I sobbed at the end, crying: No, Mowgli, don't leave your animal friends behind and live with people. You are making a big mistake!  Would he return to his original home? I wondered, why of course he would!<br />As an adult, I understand Mowgli's decision to join the village and live with his own kind. The girl in me, though, still doesn't get it and yearns to run free.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I got the CD a few weeks ago, and i listen to it almost everyday. This new albunm is different in some ways from the last. In my opinion, the first cd features more piano leads, however, many of the songs on this album have the piano in the background and focus more on her lyrics and voice. I have to admit that i thought she would flop, like the rest, but she has proven that she is a \\"real\\" artist with talent and doesnt plan to leave any time soon. I would love to give her 5 stars, but some stuff i did not like. Here are my ratings for each song..<br />1.Intro- nice tune, gets you excited about the cd. 10/10<br />2-Karma- kinda serious song, great to listen to if you have problems with your boyfriend or somthin : ) 9/10<br />3-Heartburn- Really dont like this song, but the opening beat is so catchy that i end up listening to it anyway. 7/10<br />4-If i was your woman- Hot mess!! but you can listen to it if you dont feel like skipping to the next song! Its so bad that i listen to it and laugh. 6/10<br />5-U dont know my name- radio song, nuff said. 9/10<br />6- If I aint got you- Tired of hearing it, but hte piano is so pretty that i listen anyway. 9/10<br />7-Diary- One of my favorites, it made me buy the cd. it has a slow kind of sensual feel to it. 9.5/10<br />8-Dragon Days- before i heard the song, i was like \\"what?\\", but its another of my favorites, has a kind of upbeat tempo. 9/10<br />9- Wake Up- Ok song, not one of my favorites. 7/10<br />10-So Simple- my favorite song on the album, its unlike anything she has done before and the beat is catchy. shows that she can do a variety of song styles. 10/10<br />11-When you really love someone- ok song, i like the lyrics better than the actual music, but i still like it. 8/10<br />12-Feeling u, Feeling me- nice interlude, very slow and sexy. 9/10<br />13-Slow Down- My second favorite song on the album, i really like the music on this song. 10/10<br />14- Samsonite man- not a favorite but its better when you actually listen to the lyrics. the melody reminds me of Erykah Badu's \\"watcha gonna do when they come 4 u\\" 8/10<br />15-Nobody not really- never listened to the whole song. maybee next time. <br />I connect with a song if the lyrics apply to my life in some kind of way. Of course these are just my opinions and you may like the opposite of what i liked. Nevertheless, I strongly recomend that you get it, it has a few suckie songs, but the good songs make up for it. you rarely get an album that you like from beggining to end anyway. this is as good as it gets for right now.(...)
1582432678|5.0|The author is brilliant. This book is dark, honest, beautifully written and leaves one with more questions, ambivalence about the mother, shock, sadness and lingering desire to know more than any book I have read in years. I wanted it to continue, I wanted to know what happened in her quest to finally, too late, have a relationship with this terrible child. I see why it is regarded as a secret feminist novel. After all the child did destroy the marriage, the husband, the sibling and the mother along with her career, financial well being and her very soul. Isn't that what some feminists think about children? But somehow I don't think the author intended that view. This book has an honest and penetrating depicting of characters that I would expect from a much older author. I will look for this author, she is really good. And I still want to know what happened after the end of this book. It is so very dark but some teeny ray of hope was there at the end, almost unbelievably so. I won't forget this book for a very long time if ever.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This DVD is simply the best, WHY?<br />1/ Besides Dark Side and Wish You Were Here, I always thought that the Floyd flew a little too close to Spinal Tap territory but this DVD whilst nostalgically confirming that in parts they WERE Spinal Tap, it just doesn't matter, the rest is simply perfect.<br />2/ Corny visuals (revolving planets etc) and corny songs (Set the controls for the heart of the sun, purleez - Lotuses lean on each other in yearning, Under the eaves the swallow is resting??)<BR>don't matter here, the overall effect is startling.<br />3/ Couple of genuinly beautiful and moving sequences (lump in the throat stuff) as follows:<BR>(i)  opening Echoes part one intercut with the two lads in their Paris studio fluffing the lyrics is really effective<BR>(ii) laying the piano into Us and Them<BR>(iii)Gilmour putting guitar solos into Brain Damage, fantastic<BR>(iv) when the keyboards kick in on Saucerful of secrets, magic<BR>(v) final Echoes P2 with corny visuals really work nicely at the end.<br />4/ Interviews are funny and seriously nostalgic, look at Waters and Gilmour as they were back then or the drummer bloke who IS the guitarist in Spinal Tap, a classic English foppish twit complete with THAT moustache!<br />5/ How brilliant was the timing, concert coincided with their recording of material for one of the greatest albums ever - The Dark Side of the Moon.
B000096FUD|4.0|A very low-key, undecidedly entertaining, documentary about a film Terry Gilliam never got quite off the ground called THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIOXTE. The result is the documentary, titled LOST IN LA MANCHA, salvaged from videotaped pre-production, taping during production, and hours worth of filming with only a few minutes worth of actual screen footage.  It is an interesting if not a sad account of how a film (dogged with post-production, financing, casting, and stated in the documentary &quot;acts of God&quot; problems) failed without being actually released or finished for that matter. The most heartbreaking pitfall and probably the main cause of the shut down of the film, is the failed health of the lead, French actor Jean Rochefort. Included are some pre-production and completed footage with Johnny Depp as Quioxte's sidekick.  The film had the proverbial &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; syndrome hanging over it from the get go.  One funny sequence caught on tape during the first few days of production in the deserts of Spain is where a Spanish airforce fighter is doing maneuvers overhead. The production crew have to stop filming and wait for them to stop. In some of the pre-production footage, it shows Gilliam drawing some of the storyboards himself and playing with miniature recreations of the set designs.  The documentary is narrated by Jeff Bridges. Overall, a unique &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; documentary about the behind the scenes look of film pre-production and its problems. Also, its a chance to see (director, performer, screenwriter and Monty Python member) Terry Gilliam up-close and personal in some very human moments from frustrating to humorous.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I bought this cd the first day it come out expecting it to be wonderful like the rest of her music.  I had heard &quot;Fallen&quot; on the radio several times and loved it.  So I get it home and listen to the cd from start to finish and found it to be...well...pretty boring.  After listening to the whole thing, the only song that stuck out to me was &quot;Fallen&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, the rest of the songs were okay.  But that was the problem, they were all just &quot;okay&quot;.  Nothing special about any of the rest of them.  After &quot;Fallen&quot; it felt like one continuous song up until the end.  The only reason I gave the cd 3 stars was because I love her voice.  Her voice is as beautiful as ever, it's just that the songs didn't have the same feeling to me that her previous albums have.  The cd did have one good use to me though.  It will put you to sleep pretty quickly and peacefully.  In comparison with her other albums, &quot;Afterglow&quot; just falls below par.  If you want a true, meaningful ablum from Sarah McLachlan, buy &quot;Surfacing&quot;.  That cd is great from start to finish, and every song will stay with you, even the instrumental song at the end of the cd.
B000002MUW|4.0|Bedtime Stories is another amazing album by Madonna! With a more r&b feel to it, each song has a cool style, both sexy,and upbeat. <br />Survival - nice song, not most popular, but fun to listen to.4/5<BR>Secret - most popular from this cd. Real R&B, guitars and  everything! 5/5<BR>I'd rather be your lover - ok song, better after listening to it overtime. Good bass 5/5<BR>Inside of me - sexy song, good bass again 5/5<br />Don't stop - repetitive, but pretty good song 3/5<BR>Human Nature - well- known song, brings out a lot of r&b 4/5<BR>Forbidden love - really a beautiful song, slower than others 4/5<BR>Love tried to welcome me - slow, but nice. A pretty song. Have to listen to it and give it a chance 4/5<BR>Sanctuary - slow, butvery sexy song, different from other songs 5/5<BR>Bedtime Stories - great song! fabulous video! Bjork wrote it I believe, if u can imagine what the style of the song is 5/5<BR>Take a bow - slow but really pretty song - Baby face sings in it too 4/5
B0000CABBW|5.0|Keisha Castle-Hughes is one of the cutest little actresses I've ever seen on film!<BR>I nearly cried at so many points in this film, I wondered how it would end happy. But it does. And it's a great film, no matter what your age.<BR>Poor little Pai, the unfortunate female twin who survived their birth, is practically abandoned by her dad and nearly disowned by her proud, heritage-obsessed Koro, until he gives her a chance. Despite the closeness they accomplish, her granddad will never allow her to fully experience her tradition, simply because she is a girl. He denies her the chance to become the leader of her people, as she thinks she might be, and instead looks to the other boys in their community for their new leader.<BR>The girl power is not over-emphasized, and we get a rich, emotionally complex story about a girl's realisation that she has the power to communicate with their ancestors and become a much needed leader for their people.<BR>The story is endearing and sweet. A must see for everyone!!
B00004X01U|4.0|Music is a great album. Not the usual 80's or 90's Madonna stuff! It's today, and u can tell when u listen to it. <br />Music - Awesome dance song!!! One of her bests, love it! 10/10<BR>Impressive Instant - my second favorite song off this album. It's different but also danceable, and really cool! 10/10<BR>runaway Lover - a fast pace song, really cool. 10/10<BR>I deserve it - a slow song, but pretty. U hear the acoustic guitar shine in this one - 9/10<BR>Amazing - another fast pace song. Kinda reminds me of &quot;beautiful Stranger&quot;  9/10<BR>Nobody's perfect - slow, not bad. Lot's of voice overs here. 8/10<BR>Don't tell me - western music never sounded this good. Her voice is really nice in this song, u'll be tapping ur feet 8'10<BR>what it feels like for a girl - a meaningful, nice song, can get a bit tiring 8/10<BR>Paradise not for me - a nice song. It's slow but tons of stuff goin on in the background. Love the sounds. 8/10<BR>Gone - slow, but her voice is really nice here, and once again the guitar is the star - 8/10
B000002GYR|4.0|Before Tom Waits became so uniquely original he was simply a balladeer.  Back in 1973 Tom Waits wasn't singing about those topics that only he could think of like the `Big Black Maria' (Rain Dogs) or cookin up a `Filipino Box Spring Hog' (Mule Variations).  No, back then he sang about love.  <br />Below is my take on each song on the album.  It is not a perfect album.  There are some weak tracks.  But it is an album that every self respecting music fan should own.<br />Ol' 55 - Arguably the best song he has ever written and that is saying quite a bit for such a legendary musician.  <br />I Hope That I Don't... - From a great song to this you may think he's not as good as you thought.  Be patient, it gets better.  This song is reminiscent of the Bob Dylan song `Eternal Circle' (See the `Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3').  It is told in that conversational style that Dylan used.  In my opinion, one of the weaker tracks, but still not so bad you would want to skip it.<br />Virginia Avenue - A jazzy song that is a little glimpse of what is to come from Tom Waits.<br />Old Shoes - This is what country music should sound like.  A great song with an inviting groove.  <br />Midnight Lullaby - Sounds best after two or three Jack and Coke's.  Another great one.<br />Martha - Beautiful.  If I weren't a grown man it would make me cry.  If you've ever tried to reconnect with a lover you wish you never lost, this song will take you back to how you felt.  <br />Rosie - A `come back lover' song that actually sounds cool.<br />Lonely - Here's where the album takes a down turn.  This is very much a skip-able track.  A good reason why sometimes you shouldn't write music on the piano.  Sometimes it just doesn't work to be signing the same notes you're playing.  <br />Ice Cream Man - Waits comes out swinging with a rock-a-billy \\"I don't want to hang up my Rock 'n Roll shoes\\" type song (If you don't know what I'm talking about go buy The Band's `Rock of Ages' Album).  Not bad, but it sounds likea stretch for him at the time.<br />Little Trip... - By this point in the album I'm a little tired of the ballads and this doesn't help.  In contrast to the love songs that were done well this one is lacking lyrically and musically.<br />Grapefruit Moon - Not bad, but by this time it is clear that his best material has been used up.<br />Closing Time - Instrumental.  A nice way to close out the album.  <br />So to sum up.  If you don't own it, buy it.
B000002N3J|4.0|An amazing album by Madonna, filled with a collection of slower tunes/ballads by her. Also included are some new tracks never heard, or remixed, which truy make this album special.<br />Some standouts include: <BR>&quot;I want you&quot;, a remixed song of Marvin Gaye, done with Massive Attack, who made this track absolutely awesome!!!! 10/10<br />&quot;I'll remember&quot;, the theme from the movie &quot;With Honors&quot;. Really nice song 9/10<br />&quot;You'll see&quot;, a great slow song, kinda similar feel to it as &quot;take a Bow&quot; 8/10 (Also check out the fast version which is great)<br />&quot;This Used to be my playground&quot;, theme from &quot;A League of their own&quot;, slow, sad song, but nice. 8/10<br />&quot;Love don't live here anymore&quot; - a remake of the song she did in the 80's, however this version is a remix, and if u take the time to listen u'll hear the different beats from the original, and will really like it 8/10<br />Forbidden love - pretty song 9/10<br />Oh Father - check out &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; album for reviews 9/10
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I am stunned to see such a high average review rating for this latest effort by one of my favorite artists. I have all of her albums (except for the b-sides compilation) and Afterglow gets the lowest marks of all. In my opinion, if you want to hear Sarah at her creative best, my advice is to buy Fumbling Towards Ecstasy which is just about as flawless an album as I've ever bought. Surfacing was also a far better CD than Afterglow. What has always endeared me to Sarah Mclachlan, aside from her chillingly emotive and passionate voice, is her brilliantly written lyrics and the overall construction and exquisite grandeur of her songs, which were intuitively infused with a sense of deep personal experience and; therefore, paradoxically, universal experience.  In Afterglow, aside from her beautiful voice, the rest of the aforementioned recipe is missing. In my opinion, Afterglow cannot even stand in the shadows of Fumbling or Surfacing. Except for the song Fallen this cd is banal and very uninteresting and to be honest I'm extremely disappointed because there is so much mediocre music spewing over the airwaves these days that I look to the likes of Sarah Mclachlan, Tori Amos, Sinead O'connor, Peter Gabriel, etc to keep on producing the great music I've grown accustomed to expecting from them. I will forgive this very mediocre effort in the hopes that her next CD marks a return to what made her exquisitely fabulous!
B00005KA9G|5.0|The Full Monty is hard to categorize.  It is very funny, yet it is heart-wrenching in places, with great performances by all the actors.  So let's not worry about what it is, because it will leave you laughing and smiling for days.  Seeing this movie will also boost your optimism and make you charge ahead on those dreams you have had on the back burner.  The funny scenes are absolutely hilarious.  You will want to watch them over and over.<br />A motley group of unemployed British steel workers hatches a plan to be male strippers.  Gaz, the main character, saw a group of Chippendales dancers pass through town on a one-time show with great success.  Although his group lacks the looks and the moves, Gaz is not deterred.  His primary motivation for this enterprise is to come up with child support money so he can spend time with his son.<br />The human interest story is what makes you root for these characters.  There is strong language, a scene of attempted suicide, impotence, strong male sexuality, and a homosexual scene.  The working-class accents are unbearably hard to decipher for the first fifteen minutes, but you get used to it.<br />The music is fantastic.  This movie is so unique that I wish everyone would see it.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is brilliant film, and a stark contrast to Lost in Translation, which lost me. Sure the Japan stereotypes are there but unlike falling flat and reflective of a &quot;bad trip&quot; to Japan by an immature director, QT buzzes with creativity, humor and dazzling cinematography. For comparision, check out the streaming glimpes of neon Tokyo in Kill Bill Volume I with those in &quot;Lost.&quot; The action in this movie is surreal; QT's incorporation of animated film reflects Japanese technology at its best and the QT inimitable touch. I've lived in Tokyo 20 years and loved Kill Bill; I only wish the release of both volumes would have been simultaneous or presented as one film; gladly would I have paid the extra bucks to see the film in its entirety.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I will NEVER pay money for the Star Wars trilogy on DVD, as long as the words Special Edition are included.  George Lucas, god bless him, turned what were once phenomonal films into bantha fodder when he reworked these icons of Americana.  And the first two are VERY tolerable, but the way that Return of the Jedi was turned into a cartoon essentially, causes me to VOW NEVER to give money for something that is completely unnecessary and unwanted.  Boycott the Special Edition DVD's!  Soon enough Lucasfilm will see that it's entire audience isn't 4 years old and make amends for their travesty.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Just imagine this..<br />If the lead singer were to kill himself he'd be held up on high as the second (third, fourth, fifth?)coming of God, just like Kurdt Cobain was. Kurdt brought Punk back??? Yeah sure... The Strokes brought RNR back??? Yeah sure...<br />Just give then time and they will be forgotten, that is if there's no suicide...
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is definitely an album worth buying.  This CD is so original compared with all the current albums out there now.  Their songs have good lyrics, their music has beats that really work well with their music and vocals.  5 Stars for a deserving album.
B00022M518|5.0|A terrific record - definitely groundbreaking, probably influential (it sure influenced me), and extremely funny both lyrically and musically (check the spot-on Bryan Ferry impersonation in &quot;Dead Finks Don't Talk,&quot; the lyrics of &quot;Paw-Paw Negro Blowtorch,&quot; or the sound of robot chipmunks in heat during the instrumental break of same).<br />The new remaster marginally improves the sound of the original CD release (to my ears, anyway), though the tinny, early-70's studio sound is still very much in evidence.  For some reason the LP cover was butchered on the original CD (bad cropping job) but for the remaster Virgin has restored the original sleeve illustration to its full, weird glory.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Good album but its not as good (...)!<br />1. Git Up: Em rips it but it gets kinda boring after that. 3/5<br />2. Loyalty: Obie Trice is in this one and he pulls it out of the gutter. this song is too loooong. 2/5<br />3. Just Like U: This is on of my favorite songs. Bizzie by himself in this one it's better than \\"Girls\\", Em's single on Devils Night. I Wonder whos next to do a solo? 4/5<br />4. I'll Be Damned: This song is upbeat but it isn't that great, but Kon Artist throws it down and i cant ingnore that. 2.5/5<br />5. Dude (skit): This is pretty funny. Leads up to \\"My Band\\". The security guard guy forgets Kuniva's name and thats pretty funny.<BR>\\"Hey wassup Swifty McVeigh. Hey nigga, I'm not Swift nigga I'm Kuniva.\\" 3/5<br />6. My Band: The first single off the album. The video is funnier than hell and so is the song but it gets annoying because the radios played it too damn much. But overall a good song. 4/5<br />7.  U R The One: This is a pretty good song I love Kuniva's verse in this. Bizarre's is pretty hot too. 3.5/5<br />8. 6 In the Morning: This is a good too song. But it gets boring too. The chorus rocks. 3/5<br />9. How Come: This song rocks! This is one of my favorite songs on the album and it is actually pretty serious for Em. Kon Artist is good in this too. 4/5<br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone: This song is fun but gets annoying fast. Em should never try to have a southern accent. 2.5/5<br />11. Get My Gun: This song is awesome one of my favorites. Fast paced and the chorus just plain rocks. 4/5<br />12. Bizarre (skit): This is not that good. not even near as good as Bizarre's skit on Devils Night. His rap isn't even that great.<BR>2/5<br />13. Bitch: My Favorite song on the album Em is great on it. \\"You just mad me mess up Bitch.\\" Bizzare is awesome. \\"Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberries and grapes damn that sounds great hold on wait.\\" i love when kuniva and kon artist go back and forth. Oops, somebodys jackin' off tonight!\\" Proof is hot too. \\"Swallowand breath, swallow and breath.\\" 5/5<br />14. Steve's Coffee House (skit): Pointless but funny. The dude does a horrible reenactment of \\"Purple Pills\\". 2.5/5<br />15. D12 World: Not that good. Bad for a title song. 2/5<br />16. 40 Oz: This song is awesome, really hardcore. The whole thing is good but Bizarre trying to act tough makes me laugh. hahaha. 4/5<br />17. Commercial Break (skit): This is like Obie's skit on the last album but with Young Zee, oh yeah, and its better. 3.5/5<br />18. American Psycho 2: This song would be crazy IF i hadnt already heard part one. but you have to hand it to them for tryin' but noone will ever be able to match part one. this features B-Real from Cyprus Hill. 3.5/5<br />19. Bugz 97: Bugz was pretty good. It's too bad. It's just too bad. 4/5<br />20. Good Die Young: This song brings a tear to my eye, no not because it sucks, it doesnt, but because it so sad. gotta feel sorry for all of them. Em doesnt rap on this track. But thats good this isnt Em's kind of vibe. My 2nd favorite song on the album. 5/5<br />21. Keep Talkin: This song was released a long time ago but its still awesome. Its a Ja Rule diss and Ja will never be able to strike back near as good as that. Bizzare's verse is sick but its funnier than hell 4.5/5<br />This is a good album. But it dissapoints everyone who has the other album. As you can see it gets better as it goes along.<br />top five songs:<BR>5: 40 Oz<BR>4: Keep Talkin<BR>3: Just Like U<BR>2: Good Die Young<BR>1: Bitch
1559408855|4.0|Salo is an interesting movie if you watch it for what it is. If you're into disturbing movies you'll find that this isn't incredible disturbing, if not then be prepared to see things not generally shown in theaters. <br />Here is a quick summary if you're too lazy to read all the other comments (mind you it's been a bit since I've seen it). Four aristocrats decide to take in some men and women play with them, torture them, and kill them. Suppossed this is based on de Sade's 120 days of sodom. <br />HOW TO BUY RARE (SALO) DVD CHEAP<BR>Don't pay a ridiculus amount of money for this movie. The first version of this movie I found on tape for $5 on ebay. I recently found a $5-10 dollar DVD version on ebay. From my understanding it's legal to sell this movie since it's unavailable here. As an added note if you're into rare movies I suggest finding a good import site say diabolik or xploited cinema (There's plenty others) or again try ebay. <br />Hope this helps.
0618526412|5.0|It's a stunning book that I really thank Oprah for reminding us to revisit. Such books only come along every once in a great while. Carson McCullers captures a beauty in sadness that leaches your soul and won't let go, but at the same time injects in you a spiritual growth. Few authors can capture that. \\"East of Eden\\" was a similar book now considered a classic. But what of today's authors? \\"Middlesex\\"? \\"Lovely Bones?\\" Both good but not quite on that same level. \\"My Fractured Life\\" is probably the closest argument, and even that you have to question because it is so contemporary. Truly \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a book to be read - definitely for first timers and equally recommended for those revisiting. I don't deter you from reading today's authors. \\"My Fractured Life\\", \\"Secret Life of Bees\\", \\"Father Joe\\", \\"Middlesex\\"...there are so many wonderful writers today. BUT I think you will appreciate them even more if you academically injest a classic like \\"Lonely Hunter\\".
B00005JKCH|5.0|I saw this in the theater and it was an awesome adaptation. While I am old school and grew up with Spider-Man having web-shooters, I like having him with his own web power! It makes sense because why have the powers of a spider but can't shoot a web!?<br />Anyway, this film by Sam Rani is genius but does borrow a lot from the original James Cameron script, particularly the organic web shooters. Still he makes it his own with the way he takes the classic origin story and updates it! From the spider-bite to the tragic death of his Uncle Ben.<br />The only real knock I have on this film is that I would've rathered have waited to use The Green Goblin. He was a very major villian (arguably the greatest Spidey foe) and could've been just hinted at in this film and used in Spider-Man 2 rather than Doc Ock (though I know I will enjoy that film anyway).<br />The extras also make this one a keeper! Get it in its old form as I have on good authority that the re-release is actually a step down from its original release as far as extras.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Having been a fan of both Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton, I was impatient to unwrap the album and listen to it. What a disappointment... Compared to his other exclusively blues album, \\"From The Cradle\\", this is a frustratingly mediocre interpretation of great songs... I think the sound is way too refined for Robert Johnson songs, whose wailing voice and slide guitar were \\"deeply soulful\\", quoting Clapton himself.    I cannot pinpoint the exact reason for my dislike, but I believe the mojo is just not there. Maybe it's the crisp and flawless rhythm of Steve Gadd, maybe it's the studio-perfect bass sound of Nathan East, maybe it's Billy Preston's leaking organ, or it's just the too-clean, squeaking, perfectly reproduced Blackie replica sound that Clapton loves so much...    It might be a good album for some people who like to listen to music in the background, but for hardcore blues fans, I don't think it'll do. It would have been much better if Clapton had just taken his acoustic into the studio and had Jerry Portnoy or Chris Stainton with him on a few tracks... Well, the producer obviously had other things in mind...
B0001XALT6|5.0|Cop Land is a homage to police corruption films like Sidney Lumet's Serpico and Prince of the City. In many respects, Cop Land is also a modern western, complete with a High Noon-style showdown. Miramax previously released this film on a movie-only DVD. This new version is a huge improvement but is it worth the upgrade?<br />Definitely.<br />\\"Cop Land: The Making of an Urban Western\\" is an excellent retrospective featurette. Stallone to be interested in the role but the actor wanted to something different, to go back to his starving actor roots. After him, came De Niro and then everyone else followed.<br />Next, there is a \\"Storyboard Comparison\\" that allows one to watch part of the film's climatic shoot-out simultaneously with the storyboards for it.<br />There are two deleted scenes with optional commentary.<br />Rounding out the extras is a solid audio commentary with director James Mangold, producer Cathy Konrad and actors Sylvester Stallone and Robert Patrick. Not surprisingly, Mangold and Stallone dominate this track. Stallone comes across as a very humble and gracious guy. Mangold keeps everyone talking, acting as an informal moderator and asking everyone questions. This is a really good track and definitely worth a listen if you're a fan of this movie.<br />Cop Land features a killer cast and allows them to flex their acting chops with a top-notch screenplay. This DVD is a definite improvement over the previous bare bones edition and is worth the upgrade. Miramax has finally done this film justice with an excellent special edition.
B000003N7G|2.0|Okay already, I'm convinced you have chops!  You don't have to keep trying to impress me...or each other...or yourselves...<br />This album encapsulates the fatal flaw of jazz music, the element that is relegating it to the dustbin of history: form over substance.  Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years (not many do now except those who confuse self-obsession with depth).  There are moments, especially the middle section, where Coltrane and co. hint at some melodic structure, some level of aesthetic appeal, but inevitably a stylized flourish ruins everything.  I suppose it's good that someone pushed the 'repetitive droning and squawking' envelope, but do you really want to listen to him do it?<br />Art reaches out, speaks to the universal, appeals to the heart.  Jazz excludes, speaks in code, demands analysis.  I prefer art.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Well I start out by saying... It's Nightwish, who would expect a bad release from them? This is far from bad, it's extraordinary. Each time they change their style a bit, and they have yet to fail pulling it off. I will rate song by song.<br />1. Dark Chest of Wonders - 5/5 - Nightwish is known for heavy starts, and I feel this one beats them all.<br />2. I Wish I Had An Angel - 4/5 - Similar to the \\"Century Child\\" song \\"End of All Hope.\\" But still great nonetheless.<br />3. Nemo - 5/5 - Ah yes, the first single from the album. It's soft, it's heavy, it's Nightwish, enough said.<br />4. Planet Hell - 5/5 - This is where I noticed a change. Very interesting opening and the song gets better from there.<br />5. Creek Mary's Blood - 5/5 - Celtic-sounding, soothing, enchanting. I believe it's a short story about the 'Trail of Tears' ... Indian language spoken at the end of the song.<br />6. The Siren - 5/5 - Heavy and catchy... Even though Tarja just harmonizes, I still feel myself humming.<br />7. Dead Gardens - 4/5 - Heavy and interesting. It grows on you, I didn't like it much at first but now I like it more. I love the reference to 'Elvenpath'.<br />8. Romanticide - 4/5 - More harmonizing from Tarja. I can't really get into the song or chorus much, but still great.<br />9. Ghost Love Score - 6/5 - Yes, it gets a 6. And I know that it's 10 minutes long, but I stay attached the whole time. My favorite track on the CD.<br />10. Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan - 5/5 - A slow song for every CD. This is it. Finnish is a very posessing language I have learned from this song. Way to go Tarja.<br />11. Higher Than Hope - 4/5 - Not really a good way to end a Nightwish CD, however, \\"Ghost Love Score\\" makes up for what it lacks. I just don't like the chorus much, it doesn't seem to match the verses.<br />Well that about covers it, and if it doesn't, you can always ask questions. -_- This CD is a definite buy, and if you are a Nightwish fan you MUST add this to your collection!
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is brilliant. Everything about dis album is top notch. Every song is 5 out of 5. You just can't say one particular song is better than the other because they are all true classics.      Get this!!! along with 'Doggystyle' and 'The Chronic' if you want to hear how rap is spsosd 2 b!
B0001VTPWM|4.0|What I find disturbing on Amazon.com and most other DVD sites is the lack of information about a release's format. All three ROBOCOP films are finally in Anamorphic Widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is the first time Robo 2 and 3 get anamorphic releases, so for me, this alone was worth the cost, since I already owned the definitive Criterion Robocop. This is a slightly better release, however, in that it has some featurettes and trailers. It's great to finally watch Robo 2 (and the slightly sillier Robo 3) in Anamorphic Widescreen on my 65&quot; HDTV, and in DD 5.1! While Robo 1 is still the best of the three, by far, don't discount Robo 2 and 3 for they have their moments too.
B000002VSN|5.0|Mutli platinum selling artist Whintey Houston puts her best foot forward on &quot;The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack.&quot;  Houston grew up singing in the church, and this album truly shows that she learned a lot.  Her gospel roots are clearly displayed on this album.<br />The overall tracklisting is an impressive one.  The album contains gospel songs previously released by other artists including a different rendition of &quot;Somebody Bigger Than You and I&quot; and &quot;I Love the Lord&quot;.  &quot;Somebody Bigger Than You and I&quot; features Houston's husband, Bobby, New Edition members Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill and Monica.  The album also includes the Babyface produced &quot;You Were Loved&quot; and &quot;My Heart is Calling&quot;.  This album can be played from beginning to end without any wanting to skip a track.<br />Top 3 Songs<br />You Were Loved<br />My Heart is Calling<br />Step By Step
B000060MMI|5.0|This is an over-all enjoyable album. There aren't that many different styles on here, unless you call &quot;ballads&quot; a style (&quot;Sun Never Shines&quot;), but it's still good. Maybe you shouldn't listen to me, because I'm more of a punk fan, but either way you won't regret buying this, even though the tracks are fairly similar, and there isn't a great amount of emotional depth.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I was at first against this movie, but after seeing it i really enjoyed this flick, i love werewolves and this had great transformations and gore effects, and am amazing plot twist!! a must see!
B000003TA4|1.0|Someone said this is one of the best albums of 90's.-YUCK<BR>Only the first song is good( I have to admit it,it is really good).All the others are dumb .Nirvana might have influenced culture in U.S.A but one Rock album that has really influenced Rock music is Korn's self titled album.I RECOMMEND THIS.<BR>For those who really want grunge go for GODsmack.<br />Forget Nirvana.Kurt suicided b cos he is a loser.
B00008US8R|1.0|This music sucks, when i hear the singers voice I want to strangle her to make it stop.  The vocals sounds like a girl driving in a car trying to sing a song on the radio.  What a useless band.
0805062971|5.0|If you think this book isn't about business or can't inform just about any business in America, then you're sorely mistaken. <br />This book has everything to do with business that Sun Tzu's The Art of War does.  While there are many instruction manuals in the world that teach the strong how to be strong and the great minds to compete in the business world, this is the only book that delves into the minds of the 21st century male. <br />We are a nation of men who have been told violence is never okay. That it is never permissible to hit another person. That the only permissible course of action in any conflict is to call for authority and await the outcome. <br />Fight Club teaches us how the male has been emasculated and all about the simmering violence that lies just beneath that can be exploited or-worse-ignored at great peril. <br />The book speaks loudly about marketing and merchandise but really the book is about conflict and how competition has really become a bad word in modern day America. <br />Think this isn't true? Look at how businesses compete today? Most operations would rather coexist peacefully with their competitors. Most managers would rather play it safe. Most executives foster images of humility. <br />Fight Club teaches us about the absolute necessity of competition in order to channel the violence and aggression into constructive and important aims. Left to fester, violence boils like an infection just beneath the skin and will, ultimately, find release in some fashion. The Greeks knew this; they called it Katharsis. <br />This book will teach you why you have to fight. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I love this movie, it effectively uses all the elements to make a perfect love story. I cried and not many movies do that to me.
B000001GQ1|5.0|This CD deserves five stars for the Moonlight and Waldstein sonatas. These are the only two on the CD I listen to. I will agree that the Appassionata is not necessarily robust enough, and, having learned the Pathetique, it is not to my liking either.<br />But, before  listening to Kempff's Moonlight recording, I had not especially liked the piece, especially the second and third movements. As I have heard all of the Beethoven sonatas, and most numerous times, this Moonlight recording brought to my attention the previously hidden beauty and &quot;coolness&quot; (in the second and third movements). It vaulted the piece up to about #6 on my list of Beethoven sonatas. <br />The Waldstein Sonata's first and third movements immediately caught my attention. Although I play the first movement faster than Kempff, it is nevertheless exceptional in my ears. The second movement is wonderful in its own right, but I am not particularly fond of it as a work, not at all Kempff's fault. As for the third movement. I am at a loss for words. Beethoven certainly helped out any pianist who plays this by making it one of this three or four best. This piece is absolutely delicious and Kempff makes it even moreso. The detached triplets at the 7:57 mark make me literally jump in the air and pump my fists.      <br />These are, quite simply, the best Beethoven recordings I own, easily topping Van Cliburn's and Arrau's were a very close second. I have yet to obtain a Schnabel recording of these pieces.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|As great as this movie is, the only difference between the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; and the &quot;Special Edition&quot; is the packaging and $10, so you may as well go the cheaper route.<br />What I don't understand, are people who don't find Monty Python funny. There has to be something wrong with you if watching this movie doesn't make you want to watch it again and again...and love every minute of it.
B00001MXXH|5.0|I find this film completely entertaining.  Yes, it's a teen movie and I haven't been a teen in awhile, but it's still great film.  It's low budget and cheesy at times, however, it's humor and willingness to commit to it's cheesiness show heart.  Also, the scene at the parade is classic film influence and seduction, it dares you not to join in on the celebration of the song &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by the Beattles.  John Hughes hit all the right buttons on this one.  Just awesome. I also love seeing Charlie Sheen at the end, it was a deadpan surprise.  I only wish that the DVD had more stuff on it because this film was such a part of the overall culture of the time, maybe not as quintessential as &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; but just as entertaining and has perhaps the best comedic performance of Matthew Broderick's career.
B000007T1M|5.0|I'm a SOAD fan,i have to say,each of their albums i have are great.Its hard to find bands that are bold enough to be different in the music world.I'm not that type of person who can accept any type of music easily,i'm the type that expects the music to capture,not only my ears but also my heart.I believe that the heart brings out many feelings.When i first listened to this album,it did not capture my attention that much,but soon, as i slowly listened to each and every of their songs,something grew in me,it was a mix of craziness,anger,creepiness and i don't know what else.i don't mean to exaggerate but these miscellaneous feelings exploded till it popped out of my mind,&quot;GENIUS!&quot;.From SUITE PEE to PLUCK,each and every song was different and beautiful,the lyrics in some songs may sometimes be repetitive,but who cares,just enjoy the freakin music!Songs regarding issues on religion,war,drugs,politics and other issues that i believe are important for us to listen and understand.The lyrics in most of the songs makes you think.Usually, most of the time, when i listen to bands like KoRn,Mudvayne,Deftones,Slipknot or any other metal or hard rock bands,their music makes me 'feel' than think,what do i mean by 'feel',i'm trying to say that their music brings out a lot of feelings out of me.But when i listen to SOAD,its a different story,their music makes me feel and at the same time think.<BR>FAV songs:all except for cubert(this song is just okay to me.)<BR>WARNING! SYSTEM OF A DOWN MAY BE ADDICTIVE!
0780622553|5.0|The DVD contains both formats of the movie with two commentaries: one by the filmakers and one by Roger Ebert.  It's very interesting to listen to. The other features are somewhat scimpy.  I really don't get the game about shell beach and I've never been able to get that going. Whatever, the film features a terrific supporting performance by William Hurt as the detective and a creepy Kiefer Sutherland performance to good effect.  Rufus Sewell does a good job in the lead, but his character is more or less an effect of the environment rather than an individual character for most of the film.  William Hurt's character has more individuality throughout even though he doesn't have the special power.  At any rate, it's a classic of escapist sci-fi and truly creates a world where the individual can make it anything he wants and isn't that the message that we're always trying to convince ourselves of? That we can change the world to fit our own desires, which are to the benefit of the entire world would be a goal that anybody would have.

(8/10)<BR>The Gloaming.                    (9/10)<BR>There there.                     (10/10)<BR>I will.                          (8/10)<BR>A Punchup at a Wedding.          (7/10)<BR>Myxomatosis.                     (8/10)<BR>Scatterbrain.                    (7/10)<BR>A Wolf at the Door.              (7/10)<br />If i had to pick the best song off the album it would have to be 2 + 2 = 5. I would buy the cd for that song alone. <br />         My only complaint is how it all sounds crappy after you rip it on to your computer.
B00004W52U|5.0|this album has some of the best lyrics in the history of punk. this is one of those records that comes along once a decade.  this was the record for the 80s and the 90s; and to this date in 2004 no one has come close.<br />this is music for the underground plain and simple.  it has the power to rescue any Sum 41 fan from the mainstream, if they'd only let it.
