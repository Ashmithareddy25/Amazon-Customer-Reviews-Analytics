B008B3MZNI|5.0|This is music at the highest level, the pinnacle of live performance. I know every note of the 2 disc CD set. It is just sublime to be able to \\"see\\" that performance on Blue Ray. The sound mixing is superb. 10+.
B00914JWSW|4.0|Glad Babs is still getting her number ones out of her releases, I really love the opening song on this cd but most of the other selections are just not my cup of tea or are just other versions of songs I already own, that being said I'm quite sure as a long time fan when the next one comes out I will be buying it as well, especially if I can pick it up for the same price as this one.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|If you loved 80's music, you will love this soundtrack! I was a little fearful when I went to see it at the movies, after reading that it was originally a stage production and a musical. Well, I am glad that I did go see it. I bought the CD, and am now getting the DVD as well. This movie was all in good fun! The characters are memorable, and Tom Cruise particularly stands out as a singer. I was IMPRESSED! I think he could have an alternate career as a rocker. I've never heard anyone other than Axel Rose sing a Guns and Roses song like he did. I caught myself singing along at points in the movie, but didn't feel bad because many people in the theater were also singing along. The movie is lighthearted, and fun. If you are expecting a serious sort of drama, this movie is not for you. Even my British husband enjoyed it, and he only went along because I asked him to.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book, than you will love this.  I can't wait for the next.  Very quick read.  If you liked Fifty Shades, than this is right up your alley!
1469984202|5.0|Wow. These stories grabbed me from the beginning, and didn't let go. I read a LOT. And the twists, turns, and suspenseful moments in WOOL hit me harder than anything I've read in recent memory. I can tell you the last time a book that was trying to be scary and chilling affected me, but this one didn't, and made it seem easy. Not that it's a scary book, but those moments (along with so many others) are so well written, they really stand out.<br /><br />Highly recommended. You've probably never heard of Hugh Howey, but you need to. This is powerful stuff.

B008I34YYY|1.0|This is the new generations Plan nine from Outer Space.<br />I don't care if they made fun of people that think Nazi's went to the moon after WW II, the possibility of Sara Palin being president or even Nazi's in general, just make a good movie.<br /> I had some real hopes for this movie. A large chested blonde playing a campy Nazi how could you go wrong with that, but these guys did.<br /> If you are looking to make a cult classic take lessons from Rocky Horror.<br />Personally I think these guys need to go back to making movies for the Internet.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|I loaded this and the AntTem explorer which does work. This app never starts up. I'm hoping their support team will resolve this as dropbox is great.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Existing reviews already do a good job of pointing out the merits of this movie, but I had so much fun watching that I had to throw in my five stars. I knew Jonah Hill would deliver the laughs, but I wasn't so sure about Channing Tatum. That said, if I'd bet against Tatum I'd be paying out. He was perfect for the role and a great partner for Hill.<br /><br />Between work and school, a daily commute, family and friends and a thousand other things, I don't watch too many movies in a single sitting anymore--tend to break them up into two or three viewings. And I could never get through an entire single episode of the original Jump Street, always losing interest. Not only did I finish the movie, I watched a few of my favorite scenes twice, then popped it into the player again the next day to show someone else--someone I was sure would never watch the movie--the one cameo that everyone should see at least once. (And he got the kick out of it that I thought he would.)<br /><br />Glowing review aside, I do want to add that the film deserves its R rating. I had a blast, and I don't have to worry about little ears, but I realized more than once while watching that some of my best friends would have to wait for the kids to fall asleep before they could think about starting this film. It is obscenely funny in every respect, meaning a child walking in on the film at just about any moment is probably going to hear or see something--if not both--that isn't appropriate.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game to help past time. I give it to my kids to play when theft annoy each other during road trips. It's for sure to give them an hour of quiet time without argument.

B0042VJ1PI|5.0|\\"Castle\\" is one of my favorite TV shows, by far!! So it's a given that I love the Castle books, and I love that you can follow along with the characters from the series. I have read all of the available books, and can't wait for the next one!
B008WCP2KG|2.0|I don't care if the yellow 'glow' is supposed to be arty farty...it gives you a headache. Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.<br /><br />Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I really really really like this stylus.  I use it with iAnnotate to mark up pdf slides during lecture, and it works very well.  I don't draw with it, only highlight and write, and am very satisfied.  I really like the large diameter, my hand does not hurt writing with it.  The texture does not promote dropping the pen and the weight is just right.  The box it lives in cracks me up as well, I love it!

030788743X|4.0|I *really* didn't like the first 40-60 pages, which seemed to be comprised chiefly of name-checking various bits 80s pop culture and geekery. Some people dig that, but it just isn't my bag.<br /><br />However, after Wade/Parzival stumbles onto the first clue, the story started moving and - notwithstanding a few meaningful lulls - continued to pick up momentum right up to the culmination of the Hunt.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|An original and disturbing novel that stays with you beyond the last page. Multi layered and singular in purpose. A first novel but written with the complexity and purpose that speaks to decades of experience.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow!  I hate to say it but look out E.L. James, there is a new sheriff in town and her name is Sylvia Day.  This sequel to Bared to You is AMAZING! !  Well written and impossible to put down.  Day is the master of building tension between Gideon and Eva and then rewarding the reader with exquisite release throughout this book.  This rollercoaster ride of erotic suspense will not disappoint!

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is one of my favorite new shows on television.  And the fact that Zooey Deschanel is in it definitely doesn't hurt a thing.  I'm actually a huge fan of Miss Deschanel.  That's probably one of the reasons why I watched the show in the first place, but it is actually a very good show, very funny.  I can't recommend this show highly enough to those with a good sense of humor.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This much-anticipated book will certainly not disappoint the avid Percy Jackson fans following the series. The Greek and Roman worlds collide in the most unforgettable way, leaving the reader second guessing each and every twist and turn. All the beloved characters are given plenty of time to shine. A worthwhile book with a sarcastic, side-splitting sense of humour and an adventurous spirit.

B008M34INW|3.0|The movie \\"Get the Gringo\\" wasn't bad, and if viewers like the \\"Mad Max\\" antihero type, then they  may enjoy this feature. I wouldn't necessarily run out and buy the film, but \\" Gringo\\" is worth a look or two. And if you value your eyesight, don't write a review on an iDevice.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Don't let other reviews turn you away from reading Fifty Shades. The storyline is compelling. The writing does get in the way in places, but this is more the result of poor editing, than poor writing. Yes, some words and phrases are used over and over and get old. The plot, however, and there is one, moved me past this to keep me reading long after my normal bedtime.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Having an addiction to Pinterest on my Pc is bad enough, but now I have it with my kindle fire! the works well as long as I'm near the wireless router. There are times I have a hard time connecting but that's when I enjoy one of my kindle books, which is why I got it in the first place.
0812550757|5.0|When I first read the summary on my Kindle, I thought I was in for another sort of coming of age war book; but I was so wrong. This book is almost nothing like the previous, Enders Game. It is less of gritty war, and psychological stress, and more of a mystery tinged with the coming of age for multiple characters, a thriller.<br /><br />In the beginning, I was quite confused with the settings of the planet. For instance how he got there and where he was last, and I was quite surprised at the lack of communication between Ender and Valentine. Also the presence of Jane was confusing since it  was a given a brief explanation that didn't really answer for some of the special things Jane could do. When everybody is on the same planet, but Valentine, that's when it picks up. The names are hard to memorize for who's who, but eventually you begin to know them. Ender in this book is a speaker for the dead, but in my mind, he speaks more for the living. He exposes peoples true motives and reasoning behind things, and lays everything on the table for anybody to see. The reason that he is able to do this, to understand all the faults of others while not looking down upon them for what they have done is because he has done much worse. He killed an entire alien race, and then bore the weight of the grief of humanity on his back by writing the original book, The speaker for the dead. With this amnesty from disgust at the human nature, he goes into the town and exposes mysteries that people have been trying to solve for twenty years.<br /><br />This book starts out slow, and then picks itself up, growing exponentially! It finally reaches a crescendo, but a false one. The energy and the suspense go up yet again, to the point where you cant put the book down for fear of missing something! When you reach the end, and you can finally close the book, you are left happy, smiling, waiting for another one.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Reverting I was absolutely fascinated not knowing much about the First World War - have learnt a great deal.  It was the first ken follett book  I had read.  Have just finished winter of the world absolutely fantastic cant wait for the third book.

1401322786|2.0|Sorry, but this one just did NOT do it for me. I LOVED \\"Tuesday's with Morrie,\\" and was cautiously optimistic that this new novel would grab me from page one and hold me until the last word.  Alas, I found it preachy (in an understated way) and a cross between \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" and a story out of the Bible.  It had potential, but failed to deliver.<br />We all wish we had more time (hours in the day, years in our lives, time to finish our work, time to make a pleasant experience go on and on, more time with loved ones, time, time, and more time). Our time here is finite. Some of us accept that. Some throw their time away, squander it, even cut it short by their own hand.  How did it all begin?  Thousands of years ago, at the dawn of man, DOR discovered he could tell time by the sun. He made the first simplistic time piece and drew pictures on the walls of his cave, preserving forever HIS time in history, remembering his wife and 3 children. Milleniums passed but Dor never grew old. He had become Father Time and found himself living in NYC in modern times. He was sent there to help (or guide) 2 particular people:  Victor, an elderly man dying of cancer, who also was the 14th wealthiest man in the country. Victor wanted to prolong his TIME on earth, and planned to have his body frozen until a cure could be found for cancer.  Sarah, an awkward teenager who made a fool of herself over an unworthy boy, sought to end her time on earth because the pain of her humiliation were too much to bear.<br />In steps Father Time (or is he Superman) to save the day. But what happens to Dor (Father Time) when he stops time for his human counterparts?  Do we care? Not I, though I learned the answer anyway.  Blah!<br />I was left shaking my head at the time I wasted.  A fable teaches a lesson. I think this book intended to do that. We should not waste time, nor wish our lives away. I wasted my time on this book. Father Time would not approve.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wool is a terrific book full of rich, engaging characters clinging to survival amidst a nightmarish dystopian future.<br /><br />The imagery that Howey creates manages to stay with the reader long after you put the book down, but perhaps the strongest part of the book is the way the characters are vividly brought to life; they really are richly drawn.<br /><br />I highly recommended Wool to fans of the genre.
1607960001|4.0|This edition of [[ASIN:1607960001 The Elements of Style]] looks like some new edition of the classic for wordsmiths and students, but it's not. The title sounds right, but this is merely one of many a reissues of the original title \\"The Elements of Style\\" written by Cornell University English professor William Strunk, Jr., who wrote it 1918.

White is the correct version, the one that Time Magazine listed as \\"one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923\\" in their August 30, 2011 issue.<br /><br />I made the mistake of ordering this paperback edition a few years ago when I was in a rush and ordered it along with another copy of author Stephen King's [[ASIN:0743455967 On Writing]], as both are what some of us consider essentials for writers. Simply put, I should have read the details more carefully... mea culpa.<br /><br />There are Kindle reissues of the 1918 edition, most notably [[ASIN:B0058I7TFI THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE (UPDATED 2011 EDITION) The All-Time Bestselling Book on Writing English Newly Edited (Special 2011 Edition) The Elements of Style OVER 10 MILLION COPIES SOLD!

This particular edition does have a slightly better layout on the Kindle, and the table of contents is well hyperlinked, but no mention is made of original author William Strunk, Jr., except for his name on the flyleaf.<br /><br />Among the other Kindle editions are [[ASIN:B003GSLX5Y The Elements of Style (Original Edition)]], with the quill on it's cover is basic, and it costs under a couple of dollars. But if you're going for basic, the [[ASIN:B005IT0V8O The Elements of Style]] edition with its generic cover is a no-cost freebie. And there are other Kindle editions if you search.<br /><br />The problem with these 1918 editions is that the writing style is dated. Original author Strunk had died in 1946, and in 1959, the publishers commissioned writer and author E. B. White, well known for his [[ASIN:0061124958 Charlotte's Web]], that classic for children, to revise the 41-year-old text. This was fitting as Strunk had been one of White's professors at Cornell. White's rework of the book was extremely well received, and further editions of the work followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. White's expansion and modernization of Strunk's original became informally known as Strunk & White.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|My, My, How beautiful vocal training sounds when it is demonstrated in the latest installment of Andrew Lloyd Webber's, \\"Phantom of The Opera, at The Royal Albert Hall.\\"<br /><br />A stunning spectacular of rich costumes and glitzy theatrics!<br /><br />Once you have settled in for the opening, the vocals are bar none. The best I've ever heard or watched. Sarah and Michael were wonderful in their day, Sierra Boggess takes Phantom to a new level. Beautiful as Christine with an angelic voice make for the most enjoyable Phantom experience I have watched in many years. Ramin Karimloo in his spellbinding performance and flawless vocals of The Phantom brought a fresh impression of the beloved antagonist.<br /><br />My hat's off to Cameron Mackintosh, Another masterpiece!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Grear read. Likeable characters. I can't wait to read the third book to this trilogy.  You can't help but to fall in love with Christian.

B006VGGAC4|5.0|One never knows with these autobiographies, one wonders, what is true, what has been omitted. but I feel that Arnold has told his story the same way that he has lived his life, he promotes what he has done, and he has done and achieved a hell of a lot. The only thing I am critical about is the fact that he wants to portray himself as the poor boy coming to America with one suitcase and lives the American dream and makes it big, this is not the case in Arnold's case, he brought his incredible physique, for which he worked incredibly hard in Europe, and everything he achieved from then onwards came as a result from this physique.<br />The Book  was well written and entertaining. I can recommend this book.
B009T1TUWK|5.0|Unlike the previous reviewer, I totally thought this episode was brilliant! Although this storyline has been told before, I was totally not expecting it to turn out that way. That kid totally had me fooled! I consider myself somewhat of a crime buff and I didn't have a clue that the kid was just as responsible for the abduction and murder of those children as the balloon man himself. It was like watching a mini episode of the Richard Gere movie Primal Fear. This is a good series and I hope it stays on for a very long time!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 11 year old daughter says\\"this is one of the best books that I have read\\".  Good story and characters my 2 older daughters (13 & 11) and  I all enjoy this series.  As the adult daughter of a history / world cultures/ English lit teacher and military historian father I enjoy the accuracy of these tales as well as the characters.  Good story for 4th grade advanced readers and up.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|How did so many great actors consent to be in this film, whose story is a mound of clichés and whose script seems to have been crafted by an adolescent?
B007EECSFA|5.0|And just when I was having my doubts, Kate Morton managed to do what she does best... entrance you.<br /><br />I realistically have no idea where to start this review at, this is such a complex story with so many twists and turns and heart pulls that it is going to seem like I'm talking in a loop.<br /><br />The story flips back and forth between modern day and 1941-ish London during the Blitz. It tells different perspectives from Jimmy, Dorothy, Vivian and Dorothy's daughter, Laurel. In 1961 Laurel witnessed a dark event, which has long been a family secret and while her mother is on her death bed Laurel finds clues that push her to solve the mystery that took place so long ago.<br /><br />The way Kate Morton can write a story is mind-blowing. At just over half I was ready to give up, I wasn't feeling the attraction that I did in her other's, especially The House At Riverton. Then at precisely the exact moment I wanted to push it aside Kate Morton flings a whole plot twist at you and you're sucked back in again.<br /><br />This review obviously has little to no details about the actual story but if you have read any of Kate Morton's novel's in the past you know that any small detail given could ruin her mysterious plot. And this one had a major twist at the end. That's the strange thing about her stories, as much as I've given myself credit for guessing the correct twists, I am never able to do it with her novels.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Kate Morton, you'll love it. If the summary sounds interesting, pick it up. You will not be disappointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|War, love, incest, action, wolves, what more could any fantasy fan desire?  Complex plot, lots of characters and unexpected twists. Martin follows all the rules for a great fantasy series then breaks a few major ones. Somehow I'm still addicted. Reading them all again as it took so long between books I've forgotten how it all happened. Can't wait to get to the next book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is great the controlls are good the graphics no lag just like xbox version i wish for more updates
B007TK77QE|2.0|i found the book very confusing. Most characters had nicknames and almost in the same sentence both names were used. This just made reading difficult, as you were constantly trying to remember who the character was and also where they fitted into the story. I admit I haven' t read any of JK Rowlings other books,so I can't comment on the author generally. I would not recommend this novel.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book captured my heart, soul, and intellect from chapter 1. I am an avid fantasy reader and love everything about this book!
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was an incredible disappointment.  I tried to read it five times because of who the author is and just fially gave up in boredom. I have learned to never preorder again.  She has anounced she is writing no more adult novels because of the poor reception.  Too late to get my  money back from her<br />??
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the this book. I could not put it down. Both characters are wonderful. Will be reading this again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Amazingly addictive -keep after it, then suddenly you cannot run out of coins.  the prizes and finished puzzles contribute to upgrades.
B002QS1O36|5.0|Me and my daughter have watched this so many times throughout the years. It never gets old!!! Noted my daughter is only 15 and this is one of her favorites.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a great game, with great affects, highly recommend. Has a zoom feature which is great for my kindle fire.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These things sound like rain. Ten stars. I'm getting legally married to them once I reach a country with the appropriate laws. Period.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Story was very much like that of Dean Koontz' Odd Thomas series. Choppy sentences made it look like he just combined his notes/thoughts together.
0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell brought us back to the \\"old days\\". I was a bit skeptical, but some of the reviews convinced me that it just might be a good weekend read. If you were a fan of the earlier books, you will not be disappointed! Loved the story, loved her and Benton, and loved hearing about Lucy.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book from the first page to the last. Percy is a brave character. I wish I was a demigod. Annabeth is a brave soul, too. I love how Grover stays in the Underworld so Sally (Percy's mom) can go back to Earth free. I recomend this book if you like adventure.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was so excited to get the book because I loved the first book! But I sadly disappointed. The beginning was boring to me so I couldn't get into the book at all.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i only get the first 20 post and i can not fine out how to get them all i get them i have them all on my i-pod but not my kindle fire hd
0385333846|5.0|Vonnegut truly was a master. My favorite thing about his literary technique is that he penned stories that are enjoyable, yet have layer upon layer of meaning that, depending upon your mood, you can explore as you enjoy the book.<br /><br />In my opinion, [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel]] was his finest work. I only wish the book was longer as there is so much more he could have done with the story.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! My son watches it over and over again, singing along to the songs. It's his favorite film.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Good stuff.  Not terrific and not as sharp as Traffic Kingdom or Rock Steady (or Green Stefani's solo stuff).  But good solid pop music.
B00992CF6W|4.0|All it needs is every  feature that mine craft has and it needs to be updated when mine craft is updated on the computer
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Well, once again, I let myself be swayed by the critics and I didn't see this movie at the theater.  But I purchased the Blu-Ray.  The critics are STUPID.  This was a great movie.  It's along the lines of Transformers, but better.  The action was great.  Just the perfect balance between character-development and action.  The story made you care about the characters in the movie.  The special effects were awesome.  The special features were also great, especially the full tour of the battleship USS Missouri.  This was a well-done film that is engaging and authentic to the ships it portrays.  Don't be swayed by jaded negative reviews you see here.  This is a great movie that deserved better than the critics gave it.  One more lessen on how jaded critics are.
B009GENZKS|4.0|*******CONTAINS SPOILER*******<br />This movie starts with Leon disobeying the companies orders because they pulled him from his well deserved vacation and then went \\"oh we don't need you their now, never mind.\\" Well Leon being Leon, he decides to investigate and runs into a whole bunch of trouble, LIKE EVERY RE FILM YOU SEE, but you know, that is why we keep watching. We see Ms. Wong throughout the film and this is where the crush that is discussed throughout the game RE6 is really starting to be fleshed out. Even though it is kinda depressing late in the game; back to the movie I found the CG to be top class and the viewing from Amazon to be top quality for this movie. I have only rented a few movies and they all have been crystal clear with little to no stream lag. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the RE series as well as anyone who wants to see a story-line develop and continue to grow till the final moments.
1442346272|4.0|a must read book. an insight to the tech world of computers. more than a bio on  Steve  Jobs but a tour of the tech world.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run so much . This game is very addicting. Plus everytime you lose , you would want to beat your previous score
B00452VF4O|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first book. I am currently reading the 3rd book in this series and I am definitely planning on buying other books by this author. It is well worth your time and money.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Blood Song was very well thought out.  The charaters were fleshed out and likeable. Though there is clearly more story to be told there were no loose ends in this adventure.  I like to visualize my reading and it was easy with this writer.  There was just the right blend of supernatural and human abilties.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|On this Nickelback album it is only fair to say that Nickelback sounds a lot like Nickelback here. One pundit once said of AC/DC that they `don't put out a new album, just another one'. And these chaps certainly also qualify for being described just the same.<br /><br />So given that premise is there anything new to report here? Well, not really. Chunky guitar riffs you can sway your body to, tap your foot to or bob your head to - dependant upon your mood. A rhythm section that knows what it's doing (trust me they've had enough practice!) and lots of shouty vocal stylings from our chap Chad. Production wise they've achieved a  sound that sounds expensive but was worth the money. Lyrically you get all the boozy drinking anthems that will have you wondering why it's been so long since you had your buddies over and a raft of sexual lyrics even the aforementioned AC/DC would shy away from.<br /><br />Rounding up the loose ends the booklet is full of rubbish artwork and a couple of band shots where the boys wear nice clothes so posers can sneer at them and full lyrics to the whole show.<br /><br />As much as the naysayers might decry it the simple state of affairs is that the rock world needs bands like Nickelback - mobs that find a niche and plug away at it reliably with an intent to entertain. After all, without a mainstream there wouldn't be an alternative. And then all the hipsters would end up scurrying around in ever decreasing circles until they finally disappeared in puff of arty angst.
B005E89X7E|5.0|Another excellant Cornwell adventure. Like all his books you are instantly drawn into the hero's world. Your mind sees, hears and feels every action and conversation. His charactors always behave like real people would in the circumstances. His blend of history and artistic licence is fasinating as always.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|The Crow is a haunting masterpiece of revenge and the devotion of two lovers. The standout performance goes to Brandon Lee (eldest son of famed martial artist/actor Bruce Lee) as Eric Draven, a rock musician. Tragically, in real life, Brandon Lee died during the final filming of this movie - accidentally shot by real bullets instead of blanks.  His excellent performance in the movie may serve as his legacy.  The Crow is based on a comic book story.  The atmosphere of the movie is dark and sinister, but not at all campy as many comic book stories can be.  Eric and his fiancee, Shelley, are brutally murdered on Halloween by a group of thugs who terrorize the whole town.  A year later, with the help of a mystic crow, Eric returns from the grave to exact his revenge.  Two of my favorite bad guys in this movie are; T-Bird, played by David Patrick Kelly, a talented actor who plays a lot of bad guys - you might remember him from The Warriors, Dreamscape, Commando, or various Law & Order episodes... my other favorite bad guy is Top Dollar, played by the very impressive and enigmatic  Michael Wincott, whom you might remember as Guy of Gisborne in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.  Ernie Hudson (also in Ghostbusters) plays a recently demoted cop... he was involved in the murder case of Eric and Shelley, and when Eric returns, he becomes Eric's friend and ally. The Crow is a classic story told with haunting passion... a must for your collection.
B00932A6G4|5.0|If you are a fan of the series you will enjoy this animated movie.  Warning there is nudity and sexual scenes in the movie.
B001TODO54|5.0|Loved the story, began a little slow but well worth the wait! Great story line and great imagination, Kristin Cashore is an awesome author. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This a a very hard to put down book.  I can't wait to read what happens next.. Christian is a very complex guy<br /><br />who knows how to spice things up.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring characters and story, just couldn't even get interested. I couldn't wait for this book because I loved Harry Potter books and I sincerely tried to give this a fair chance but the dry characters and uninteresting storyline just completely turned me off.
B007A4SDCG|2.0|I liked his description and use of \\"resistance\\" which is another term for writer's block or lack of motivation. He made some very good points for artists and writers.<br /><br />However, he did drag on a bit too much about certain points. After awhile it just got silly with the talk about angels and other BS.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a great book to bring our attention to the fact that we have to appreciate the moment and not worry about the past or the future.  Highly recommend!
1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters is a wonderful writer who makes the 19th century come alive for the reader. While people all seem to rave about the twists and turns, I found they were quite predictable. What made this book satisfying for me was the character development of the heroine, the accurate depiction of Dickensian types, the skillfully rendered setting, and the author's thorough grasp on the historical period. Even the surprise twists were like those that could be found in a Victorian novel, with hidden family secrets, past actions that come home to roost, and an innocent protagonist who triumphs in the end. A great read!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Any fan of Wes Anderson's films will enjoy Moonlight Kingdom. It is similar to Rushmore, with a lighter plot and more artistic attention. Very, very good film.
B00064ADR0|5.0|At the zenith of his career Johnny Winter was THE Texas guitar slinger without peer.<br />2nd Winter is arguably his best collection of songs<br />This package truthfully replicates those original analog recording.<br />Johnny's jaw dropping solos are all there.<br />The inclusion of the Live Royal Albeit Hall show was a nice bonus.<br />Worth every penny!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Got this as a free app of the day but this is definitely worth paying for.  Nice graphics. Peaceful music. Plenty of challenges but not impossible to solve. And no bugs!!! You should try it for yourself.<br />.
0761169253|1.0|Another reviewer noted that this is a lot of fluff.  I too leafed through it in less than 15 minutes.  Nothing original in here, nor especially insightful.  The nuggets of  wisdom from the book: Do your art, feel free to borrow ideas from others, be nice, and hang around with important artists and others.  A waste of your money, but maybe worth 15 minutes of your time - if you are just clueless about the art world.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Like everyone else, I found this game slow to start with.  But once I hit about level 50, I started accumulating more coins than I could use.  Now I am on level 130 and have over 1200 coins.  I wish I could trade them for something useful.  Addictive game!
B0098VXHBG|3.0|I think the film did a good job dramatizing the disconnect between men and women and their need for play, adventure, danger, exploration, vitality in their relationships - in short everything that older marriages don't offer to the men and women who inhabit them. Juliette Binoche is always a joy to watch in any film, and the young prostitutes deliver powerful performances as well.
B008X8RSTM|3.0|came in handy finding a place I am looking for.  like how easy it is to use, will use it a lot.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|This app has sounds to help you sleep, and background sounds as well. It has some VERY nice sounds as well as some VERY bad sounds. Some tracks are awfull. You can hear the gaps (no audio) between the beginings and endings of some of them and it annoying to say the least. Who needs 2 or three \\"air conditioner\\" sounds? particularly when the biggest diffrences seem to be loudness and nothing else. It will allow you to combine diffrent sounds (up to 3) for a personal touch. One of the most annoying thing about this feature is it always wants to put the \\"air conditioner\\" sounds as a first choice. I only got the free version, the paid app may be better. In conclusion I would say for a free app the cost is right.<br />  Olin B.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game is boring.  Maybe I just don't get it but when I've played all my other games, I'll play this.
0060007737|5.0|I would suggest a person either know their target audience or product/service fairly well to appreciate the information in this book.  I got a great understanding of branding principles which can be applied any time to strengthen 'Mind Share'.  Also, the chapter on Category helped me understand how to promote my brand which is oddly enough NOT to promote my brand.  Great insight!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This isn't a deeply written piece if literary art. However, it is an entertaining, easy read, which is nice after a long day at work.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book kept me guessing until the very end.  I  was not expecting the ending.  It was a complete surprise.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I am really enjoying Total Recall.  i find Arnold to be a wonderful example of all that is great about America.  His story of determination and vision is inspiring for all.  And he did it in the Land of the Free, America.  i recall watching a TV roast of Arnold several years back and when he took the stage i found his speech regarding america to be one of the most inspiring moments i had ever had.  the book is full of stories and written in easy fashion with good humor.  i would really enjoy meeting the man.  i recommend the book highly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find some of the coolest things.  But it is so hard to put down once you pick it up!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun and awesome and it can be confusing sometimes it's hard and sometimes it easy you have to have strategy to complete each level
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved it.  Rowling vests ordinary people with ordinary failings, then creates a story one can't put down.  It will make a good movie.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|This is a must have in my household - on movie night when we have friends over this is always the opener (its only 20 minutes) and I've always had great laughs from my guests
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great calculator for my kindle fire and kindle fire hd. big bright numbers. saves last calculation. easy to use. tried several others and this is by far the best
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Amazing movie! Marvel did a great job of mixing humor and action to make this one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.
B008OJ291W|4.0|Only Jeff Lynne could accomplish something like this.  When I heard that Mr. Lynne was going to completely re-record the greatest hits of ELO from scratch, I was quite curious as to the outcome.  I'm a music aficionado, and I've heard my share of re-recordings; as you know - most of them are awful.  Most re-recordings are slapped together, pulse-less afterthoughts.  Not this time.  Jeff Lynne has managed not only to re-create the excitement and mystic wonder of Electric Light Orchestra, but to bring the additional thirty plus years of experience with him (with one exception that I'll get to shortly).  With these recordings, one feels the original sentimental joy of the song along with the thrill of 21st Century recording prowess.  The update in sound quality would be meaningless without the soul and passion that Jeff Lynne has woven throughout these fine selections.  Having said that, I must point out that the use of keyboard string sections is a bit of a bummer.  While this doesn't completely diminish my enjoyment of the songs, it does cause a slight cringe for a discerning ear that could never be fooled by synthesized violins, cellos, etc.  The fiddled-around-with-fiddles didn't make themselves apparent until \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\".  On most of the other tracks the fake strings are quite passable, after all, these are 21st Century keyboards.  However, on \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\", the strings sound like my 1985 Casio.  I'm sorry, Jeff, you should have, and could have used real strings.  It was a real low blow to your fans to use cheap sounding, fake string sections.  So, yes, I'm completely applauding the musicianship and authenticity of the re-creations, but I'm giving a thumbs down to the fake strings - hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  I have to give at least 4 stars however, because real passion went into these performances along with an astonishing level of detail.  Don't get me wrong, this is an impressive effort worthy of many plays.  On \\"Strange Magic\\", for example, you'd never know the strings weren't real.  So, it's well worth the money.  Check it out!
B007THA4FI|1.0|After the epic adventure of the Harry Potter novels, I am appalled at the lack of interest generated by such negative characters in this novel. They are not even evil enough to be interesting; just repulsive.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Very disappointed in the quality of the 3d DVD, color, 3d effects sharpness, is very poor.  I own a lot of 3d movies, this seems like a bootleg copy that is poorly done.  Wondering if some folks at the factory are getting greedy and swapping out the good ones for garbage. I found it unwatchable.  update:  I spent about 1/2 hour adjusting the settings on my tv, and it is coming in much better.  However, I don't think that this should be neccessary, never had this problem before with my other 3d movies, and yes, my 3d blu-ray player is updated.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really like the game but like others I wish that the time would not take so long that and it was easier to get jewels
0345803507|4.0|Book two much better story line than book one -- always something new thrown in although ending I did not care for but did leave the story open for another book
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book did not disappoint. I loved Bared to You, and Reflected in You was just as good. I was surprised with the ending of the book and can not wait for the third installment. The Crossfire series has been an amazing adventure!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Quite disappointed in this book. Expected much more from Ms. Rowling. Her imagination from HP was sadly missing as she brought us a barrage of small town drama, predictably starting with a tragedy and ending with more tragedy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was an interesting story, it took a little while to really get into the book.  Once I got into it, it was really good.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book was better than any of the Harry Potter series in relating the real day-to-day interactions of small town characters.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|While the extras leave something to be desired The Avengers looks amazing on Blu-Ray. The detail of every scene jumps off the screen and the sound quality is superb. If you enjoyed the movie in the theater you will absolutely love it at home.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show, and this season is really strong.  Amy Farrah Fowler as a match for Sheldon couldn't be more perfect.  I just became a fan of the show recently and have been watching a lot of episodes in syndication.  This show has an amazing cast and hilarious writing.
B0047EKHJE|5.0|As cobbled-together albums go, THE BEATLES AGAIN (also known as \\"Hey Jude\\") is about as good as it gets. The 10 songs presented on it are from singles and B-sides, and cover the majority of the band's stellar career. Not one of these could be considered throwaway or filler.<br /><br />John Lennon's lead vocals on all four of his songs are some of his most powerful ever. The track of \\"Revolution\\" presented is the one Lennon tried (but failed) to place on the [[ASIN:B00003JA7P White Album]]. Commonly labeled \\"the fast-version,\\" some spine-tingling guitar work make this unforgettable. The several Paul McCartney tunes were some of the group's biggest hits. George Harrison's lone contribution, \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" is high-energy and has an infectious hook.<br /><br />If you don't already own this one, here is a \\"fab\\" opportunity to enjoy...

B004SIIBGU|4.0|Works great.  Very intuitive. I prefer using the app than using the website on a browser. It even made me aware how great saved searches can be for someone looking for specific items. Worth the free download.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|As time goes by we see fewer and fewer films like this that are able to retain such a high level of quality from beginning to end....  The style is incredibly subtle, and blends perfectly with the story in such a way that it isn't always noticed, even when you are looking for it.... This is a fantastic looking film from a perfect print....the visuals and use of color are beautiful, with an Ozu-like use of still empty spaces.... The sound track is perfect as well....everything is right where it needs to be.... This film reminds me of Everlasting Moments (also on Criterion) in its use of imagery to tell those parts of a story that words cannot.... Dreamlike perfection....
B00631VJIC|5.0|If you like the songs on the show, this is the CD to have. Problem is, I can not get it away from my wife.
B009CPE424|3.0|this was cute i like family movies i watched with my 4 year old granddaughter it caught her attention but didnt keep it for long i may watch agian someday because my attention was diverted
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love her books!  Always killer twists!  Very hard to put them down.  Can't wait to read more books of hers.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Does a great job of setting the stage for most of the events in the Halo series.  Gives good background on where Master Chief actually came from.  This is a must read for anyone who is even remotely interested in the Halo series.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love this cover. It's sturdy and looks great. It props up my Kindle so I can watch a video or read. The price was a good deal. I had checked a major box store for covers; they didn't have the Kindle Fire HD covers and the regular Kindle fire covers were about $10 more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Love love this author can' t wait for the next book! Characters in this book are so whole and believable... you feel their pain and angst...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I give it five stars fun simple and addictive great way to pass the time<br />just like the carnival games but cheaper
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This was a horrible movie.  I told my daughter I would give it a chance.......she is a huge Johnny Depp fan, even she was disapointed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|is my background I enjoy this solitsre more than most of them not a lot of stuff just a goodtime playing cards
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick has been one of my favorite authors since I read the first Percy Jackson book and the latest installment did not disappoint. It had the great balance of action and character development that makes these books such fun to read while moving the story along enough to be satisfying yet still leaving me craving more.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|This movie reminded me of a bunch of films from when I was little---The Goonies, Monster Squad, E.T...you get the idea. I think that this movie hit the spot that I hoped that SUPER 8 would have hit, but nothing against that movie, as I did enjoy that film.<br /><br />I sure hope that this film reaches the mainstream, because it's not only a great Halloween movie, but one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a good while. Aliens versus a bunch of rag-tag crew of British teenagers. Works for me.<br /><br />IF YOU SEE THIS FOR NO OTHER REASON, see it for the unique villain/alien. It reminded me of something that I might see in an old Jim Henson film, but this thing doesn't play around.<br /><br />I have seen it in standard definition and in Blu-Ray form. I can't say that there is an incredibly marked difference, but if you are a purist and want that extra stretch of beautiful, it's there. If you already enjoy the film and you are wondering how much better the aliens come through in high-def, you can tell a little bit of a difference, I believe.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if, in about 10 years or so (or less), we get a new batch of directors that heap praise over this film and state how much it influenced them and enticed them into getting into the film industry---to make films like these.<br /><br />Definitely buy-worthy.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw looking for Sugarman not knowing I was! I came straight home, opened up Amazon, found his albums and ordered. Both the recordings of Rodriguez took me back to the 60s and opened my mind to some of the truths about relationships, passion and life. They are so personal and seductive, as is the singer.[[ASIN:B001BKVWYG Cold Fact]][[ASIN:B001TCHDPS Coming from Reality]][[ASIN:B007ZRZWOA Searching for Sugar Man (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I rented this movie because of the cast and then discovered it was very well written, directed, and produced. I was pleasantly surprised. I have lived in parts of Asia and  see so many similarities in the lifestyles . . . Being overcrowded, the ungodly traffic, street vendors everywhere and the friendliness of the local people. I could identify with the feelings of trepidation by the characters in the beginning . . . Not knowing what was ahead. The music, the scenery, the colors were an added plus for me. I would heartily suggest this movie as an enjoyable must see movie for those getting ready to embark on retirement and for those adventurers who like to explore different cultures.
B0018Q4DTY|4.0|PURE CLASSIC.. SOME OF THE SICKIST VERSES EVER. A MUST GET IF YOU LIKE OUTKAST!! A GREAT BARGAIN AT $5 IN THE MP3 STORE
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it. is awesome.  one. of the best games I have played in a long time. I hope you will keep it golng
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case is very good quality, I really like the strap holding the lid to remain closed. The seams are solid and overall it looks like a very good quality product.<br />It's good to protect the ports, but it does have to be open to load the Kindle and thats why I don't give it five stars.
B004TI5N38|5.0|One of Baldacci's best books. I loved every minute of this story, hated to put it down and did not want it to end!
1439127700|5.0|I am a presidential history buff and this book was a no brainer for me to read.  It did a fantastic job of peeling back the curtain on the relationships between the very few people who have served as our nation's CEO.  I would read this again in the future as it weaved the history of our country through the relationships between Presidents.  For a historical work, it was easy to read, flowed well and again, just a great work.
0316223239|4.0|Five-year-old Jack's days are full of the usual types of activities for a child his his -- singing, drawing, playing with his toys, and of course, asking his mother nonstop questions about the world around them.<br /><br />But unlike other five-year-olds, Jack's world is limited to one room -- an eleven-foot storage shed where he has lived since birth. Unbeknownst to Jack, his mother was abducted for sexual purposes while a college student. Despite her own unimaginable depression, anger and despair, she has decided that her son will have the best possible childhood she can give him.<br /><br />And so, when Jack becomes older and begins asking more questions, his mother -- whose name is only given as \\"Ma\\" -- decides it's time for the two to escape. Their captor, dubbed \\"Old Nick\\" by Jack, only comes in the night, when Ma hides Jack in a wardrobe so he cannot witness what happens. Nonetheless, the effects of Old Nick's cruelty affect Jack profoundly, such as when he decides to punish Jack and Ma by cutting their electricity. Not only are they in the dark, but the tiny food supply quickly begins to spoil, leaving them desperate. Ma decides that they must escape or die trying; Jack, however, feels otherwise. He still cannot fully fathom the concept of a big world outside the confines of Room. Although he loves and has faith in his mother, he thinks it all sounds like a cartoon, a made-up drawing like his beloved Dora.<br /><br />Then, of course, the question becomes one of mental health, of adapting to normalcy when one's sense of what is \\"normal\\" has been so wildly altered for so long. How can a child like Jack be taught to play with other children, when until recently he believed he, Ma and Old Nick were the only people in the world? How can he be taught not to jump in fear at every little noise, every little gust of wind? Everyday life is full of countless things that most people never even think about, yet are almost insurmountable obstacles for someone who's neverexperienced them.<br /><br />Despite the horrifying aspects of this story, Donoghue's choice to have it told through the eyes of a five-year-old lessen the intensity almost palpably. Also, hearing Jack's POV means there's no sentimentality, no pity -- Jack simply tells it like it is. And thus, it's impossible not to root for him and Ma, desperately hoping for their rescue, both physically and emotionally.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|History buffs would enjoy this as it brings it close and personal from all viewpoints  countries as well as class. There is enough drama and romance as well.  Always wanting to know what would happen next. An excellent read for politics,  events, human trials, and romance.

B007THA4FI|3.0|This book was well written but fairly depressing.  Taking place in a small village in England, it delves into the lives, relationships and emotions of a variety of people, building to a climax that one knows can't be good.  Some of the people evolve into more likeable characters than you would expect and some into less likeable characters.  Most of the characters are not very likeable.  The ending worked out well for a few and disastrously for others.
B0091REZMW|4.0|enjoying the game wish there were more than three things to find at first and the lights were on not off
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read Gone Girl quite quickly as it's a real page turner from the very first chapter. The author does an incredible job of making the reader alternate between liking and disliking both main characters. Every detail is well written and described. My only criticism is that the ending fell flat for me. There were so many ways this book could have ended, and I found the ending a bit stale. However, I still recommend reading it because it really is very well written, dark, and intense.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I usually look up different restaurant for lunch or our final destination for our days travel when we leave in the morning.

6305971099|3.0|I would have given this 5 stars had they stuck to the typical Halloween playbook and left out the oddities. Too many distracting characters stick out throughout the story. I blame this on the director. Tina was emphasized as being a dingy airhead to the point that she certainly could not have had two brain cells to click together. She kinda forgets she was just talking to Rachel earlier about a party, and chalks her disappearance up to \\"I guess she decided to go to the lake with her parents after all.\\" (Ok? Did she walk there airhead?) Tina's boyfriend was emphasized as being \\"Joe Cool\\" way, way too much - buffs the car at every free opportunity, and has zero patience with anyone (except for Tina, because she puts out for him). The director makes damn sure we know that Tina puts out, just in case we are too stupid to figure this out on our own. Guess we know what she uses that one brain cell for. Sammy's (a super hot girl) boyfriend acts way too gay to have any possible interest in her. Guess he mistook her for a guy because of her name? We know we have a couple of bozo cops on our hands when the silly music plays even before we get a word out of their mouths. Jamie is a cute little girl, but she was way too annoying with her whining towards the end of the movie. Without Laurie Strode, Halloween is about Michael Myers and what he will do next. We do have Dr. Loomis and his eerie way of expaining why Michael is pure evil, which was a plus. Halloween 5 picks up a year after Halloween 4. But going from Halloween 4 to 5, we have a different director, writer and producer and it shows! There are some strange loop holes. Are we to believe Michael escaped at the end of H4, passed out in the strangers cabin, and woke up one year later? He must have, because Michael immediately shows his gratitude by killing the stranger who took him in. An by the way, didn't the kindly stranger notice all the shotgun holes in Michael? Rachel disappears too soon from the story. I guess she acted too normal, so the director did us a favor by knocking her off early?ted too normal, so the director did us a favor by knocking her off early?
0553386794|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book. George Martin has authored the flagship fantasy series of the decade - it keeps me turning pages at a speed I can only dream pertained to my textbooks. Can't wait for the next one!
B005COO1X6|2.0|I really was question if Stephen King wrote this one.  Premise was very &#34; View From a Buick 8&#34; but much less interesting .  I wouldn't remmend it.  I was very disappointed in it.
0385344333|1.0|Oh Lee Child where have you gone?  If you want to kill the golden calf of a franchise, just stop writing.  Maybe it's too late for that.  Spoiler alerts abound in this review but so be it.  If you're concerned that you might read something that may ruining your reading pleasure then let it be right here because this book will ruin it more than I ever could.  And it will cost more too.<br /><br />  Disclaimer first - I've read every Jack Reacher book and like many, I hate waiting a year for the next one to come along.  I read this one on the first day of publication.<br /><br />My first major problem is the whole story begins with Reacher being picked up as a hitchhiker by two men and a woman.  Through a highly convoluted code between Reacher and the woman we learn that the car is hers and she has been hi-jacked.  This silly code transpires for what seems like half a book, and has no payoff, except to help fill the page requirements to call this a book.<br /><br /> How many times have we read of Reacher getting into a situation with two, three, a dozen or more men and come out as the last man standing?  Now comes this plot that works ONLY because Reacher can't think of a method to dispose of two men, neither of whom have displayed a weapon, and whom he even has isolated one-on-one a couple times.<br /><br />Reacher's ineffectiveness allow the hijackers to get away and he then feels responsible for her death.  He later storms a bad-guy armed fortress, dispatches a dozen or so murderous thugs, each of whom have a hi powered weapon or two.  But boy, those two unarmed guys in a car were too much.  Because of this the whole story is flawed.<br /><br /> And I wish Mr. Child would stop playing God with likable characters.  If this character is no longer needed in the story find another way of saying good bye rather than just killing them for no reason, or don't write them is such a likable way to begin with.  There are two totally unnecessary  deaths of likable charactersin this book.  I understand that each Reacher book has to have a love/lust man/woman sub-plot for Reacher.  But it seems like the only way for Mr. Child to figure how to move Reacher forward to his next book is make us like the woman and then have her killed.  He's used this trick before and you can pretty much bank on the fact that if a lady is involved, she will soon be dead.  And in this case there was no reason to kill her other than to give Reacher an out.  The plot was not served one bit by her death.<br /><br /> And as likable and sympathetic a character that she was, Reacher obviously doesn't care.  He shows no grief or human emotion at her passing and sets off cool and calm for his next book, in which he will find another Lee Child invention who will also be dead in Jack Reacher's wake. Only because the author uses the death as a shorthand for getting Jack to move on.<br /><br /> I'm still waiting for the next Reacher book and looking forward to Lee Child writing like he wrote before he became famous and didn't have to work at it anymore.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved the story.  Loved the plot.  Loved everything about it.  He took some what I call \\"artistic lisence\\"  but you cn overlook that in the very good plot.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|When Season 6 ended and I heard they were going to make another one, I thought, \\"OK, this way they can give it a final ending and tie everything up.\\"  After Season 6 I thought it was time.  They'd pretty much explored everything there was to explore.  The story line was, I thought, getting tired.  Then Season 7 arrived and now I'm on bended knee praying there will be many, many more seasons.  I mourned the loss of Cas and then I mourned the loss of Bobby.  But then they came back!  Not sure how much more we'll see of Cas, and he was an absolute favorite character, but one can hope. I am also missing the car, but we see some other good old muscle cars.  We also see them drive some that make you go \\"Really?\\"<br /><br />I like the Leviathan characters and most especially like that they aren't the mainstay of every episode.  It keeps every episode fresh and interesting.<br /><br />I also see a tremendous leap in the acting abilities of Jensen Ackles.  I always thought Jared Padalecki had more flexibility in his skills, playing the tender equally as well as he played the fiery.  This year I'm seeing a much wider range in Jensen.  He nearly brought me to tears in the episode where Jo's ghost came back.<br /><br />We haven't reached the final episode yet and I have to tell you I'm approaching it with anticipation and dismay.  Anticipation because every episode to this point has been fantastic.  Much on par with the first four seasons.  Dismay because, well, it's ending!<br /><br />But they are now showing the 8th season and we can only hope there will be many more to come.
B009329Y30|2.0|I loved the book years ago but it just did not transfer well as a movie. The acting was poor and it seemed more like a cheesy soap opera.

B009KHCT94|1.0|Poor acting.<br /><br />Should this be classified as an out of date satire or slapstick comedy?<br /><br />Either way it fails.<br /><br />One star for effort.  Even a poor movie requires planning and someone's hard work.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Jonas Jonasson has created true art with words. The images painted in my mind will give me pleasure long after the book has been put away. I can't even imagine the human who could  assemble this  wild ride of a tale that has been constructed with a foundation made of story blocks and fantasy mortar.   Unbelievable as it may seem, I believe that it all could have happened, because that is how life is. There is little control of everyday events, unemotional reactions to \\"news worthy\\" tragedies, and never ending smiles from page to page. I am still laughing about the answer, \\"watermelons.\\" The book?  - unbelievably wonderful!
B00136JT3Y|5.0|My experience with Pink (or P!nk) has strictly been what made it onto the airwaves for me to hear. Great for dancing, fun and irreverent. \\"I'm Not Dead\\" includes some more thought-provoking pieces that really show her range (in voice and in topic). With the inclusion of \\"Dear Mr. President\\", a collaboration with the Indigo Girls (must admit I would love to see all three of these women together to demonstrate how their shared concerns transcend the descriptions anyone may use for  any of them) and the duet with her father, this may easily be on my heavy play list. (At least when my children aren't around...and in a few years when they are.)
0688014291|5.0|I read this book in a few hours. I have started applying it and it works. At work and home. With anyone.
B00136RYXG|5.0|It's clear from the title track \\"M!ssundaztood\\" that P!nk has a sense of humor. Several of the tracks on this album (and her others) demonstrate that she has a conscience and feels compelled to use her music to address social issues and help give a voice to others who may not know how to express themselves. I love the track \\"Respect\\" for its powerful language that provides a platform for women (and girls) to establish their physical boundaries. And I thought she was all about a fun beat.

B009FZZFME|4.0|I've had dish since just maybe March, April this year, and when I discovered later down the road that Dish dropped AMC needless to say I was pretty pissed off about it. That is one thing about dish besides issues like this they don't also seem to care so much about anyone customers local ABC, NBC, CBS, or FOX local stations, we maybe about to lose one of those 4 any day now. As I say I was really pissed about the issue of Dish dropping AMC so I had gone to the mydish website and chatted with some rep on there who after a pretty heated texting discussion made her give in because as it turns out even though Dish dropped AMC they are still making customers of Dish pay for the channel. I had found this out directly from the AMC website about maybe a month or so ago. I felt it must be true otherwise AMC could have been liable for a lawsuit so I discussed that issue with the chat rep, and she eventually in turn credited me $5.00 a month for 6 months, now I know this doesn't cover the entire cost of having to pay for 3rd season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" however it is a little bit of a score for us under-dogs that are trapped under the giant foot of Television services such as Dish & Time Warner Cable
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I feel that SOME NIGHTS is a great sophomore album from FUN., at times leading me to believe that the lead singer is aptly able to invoke the vocal styling of Freddie Mercury. You can hear the influence that Queen has had upon this band, also present in the harmonies. The BAND is able to weave their influences tightly together with their own on style with aplomb, all the while making FUN.'s music accessible to a multi-generational crowd. If they continue to keep heading in this direction, musically, FUN. can only become better with time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|better than most.  lots of variations.  great sound too highly recommend.  cant beat price either!  I am done but the want more words....so here you go.  gees sorry I reviewed.  more work than worth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the hunger games series.  This book was great finishing touch on an awesome story.  The other two books had major cliff hangers at the end.  This book ended it all nicely.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Love this game.  It really pushes you to think and try harder to find the items. This is the kind of hidden objects game I like.  Would like the game to be longer and have more interactive help and clues
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Book was a great read and I couldnt put it down. The twist at the end was unexpected and I would love to see a sequel.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every teen and adult MUST read this book. It should be discussed by everyone teaching or talking about anti bullying.<br />The way the author wrote from the prospective of each character in the book is amazing.<br />This is a very special book!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun and addictive game. you end up saying just one more level and keep playing. go ahead and try it!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|His charactors are so well drawn that I wish there was another book about them. My son speaks<br />Spanish fluently and he read the first book in Spanish. He recommended it to me and I was hooked. I eagerly purchased the follow up books and enjoyed them immensely.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|A lot of the same, gets boring after awhile. Good time waster.  Looks good and plays fun enough.  I am glad that it was free. Not worth $4.99.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, it definitely did not disappoint.  I can't wait for the third book. I have already pre-ordered it.
B005OIAKB2|5.0|Amazing! I love it, rock on and yell it out!... a day to remember does it again! that is all folks!
B007SGM084|5.0|From page one I was wrapped up in the story! I kept wanting more and more.  Each book left you wondering what was going to happen nex.  I didn't want them to end.  There was A LOT of sex and by the third book I honestly skimmed over those parts, mainly cause there's only so many ways you can describe how Christian and Ana were going to climax... at some points I actually blushed from the details.  Overall, it was a great trilogy and I cant wait to see the movie (although the movies are rarely as good as the books).
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I love this book, and started it over a second time after the first reading, because I simply didn't want to leave the author's company. She does a splendid job of interweaving her recent past and childhood story with vivid descriptions of life trekking the Pacific Crest Trail, solo. There is a wisdom and a liveliness in her writing, and an extremely well-told story that had me with her all the way, through heartache, awe, reflection, hardship, and camaraderie with others on the trail. Really a wonderful read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Straightforward,  easy-to-use app which looks brilliant. on the Kindle Fire. Loads quickly and never lags during. scrolling. Five stars! (plus I'm addicted!)
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The characterization is well developed and the story line keeps you interested. Looking forward to the second book in the series.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This blu-ray release of all 4 of the films is well done and presents this great work in a new format that allows it to be seen in its theatrical greatness.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Keeping this review short, I loved the movie so I decide to get the 4 disc set.  The delivery was great.  I received the product quickly and to my surprise at a great price.  When I ordered the movie I believe the price was approximately at  $29.95 the price dropped twice. It drop even after the product shipped.  Once this happened I received an email stating that I was receiving a refund and in the end I wound up paying ~$19.95.  That to me was a good surprise.  So as i mentioned above a great overall experience.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this book!  I want to be him when I turn 100.  This book is really different, keeps you completely absorbed and although is total fiction is so believable!!!!  I recommend this to everyone who wants to read something different and cheer for someone!
B004GYY714|4.0|This app solves the radio station search issue - no need to hunt all over the web to track down a broadcast.  Just open the app, search by local o type of music or station and you are set.  Only draw back is the search time can be a bit slow.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started this book and just couldn't put it down .I thought the plot was very intriguing but was truly disappointed with the ending,  It seemed as if the author just ran out of steam, but maybe the ending reflects the compromises in life,  Good airplane read.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|The book has some interesting ideas.  The author is arrogant making statements such as what Jesus or Buddha really meant or what will happen to the world if we do not evolve.  It is a shame for much of value is presented.<br /><br />His encouragements are good to see.  I suspect he is a fine fellow, just a bit too full of himself.<br /><br />He tells us that danger lies in getting to attached to your ego.  Now, now Mr. Tolle, aren't your opinions demonstration of an ego?<br /><br />Worth reading, but you might want to avoid the last few chapters.<br /><br />Ken
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie lots of action good cast well worth renting or buying. The video stream was very good. Played very good on my kindle fire.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book was slow, to many characters and not one I truly cared about. I think it may have been a political statement of our times but I am not sure.  Ms Rowling is a really good writer of action,fantasy fiction that transcends age groups.  I am sorry she left that genre and tried something new. I would not recommend it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Another thought provoking work by Mitch Albom.  A multi-faceted story line that kept me engaged throughout the entire book.  I will keep reading his work.
B009G78EE2|5.0|First off, I usually don't listen to rap. Most of my life I've been into alternative rock and punk. I heard about Macklemore from a friend a took a listen. I was instantly hooked and loved the album when I bought it later that day. Macklemore has a way of telling a story, as well as showing that he can take a stand on issues such as gay rights. It's very refreshing to hear a rapper with a positive message, especially when you look at some of the more popular rappers at this time. I highly recommend this CD!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Take out Bane and Anne Hathaway and this movie would get 4 stars easily. While the comic book version of Bane was meant to be physically intimidating to Batman, Tom Hardy just doesn't measure up. I realize that comic books and the movie version are never gonna line up perfectly, I'm not the type to over-analyze those types of things. His voice box was intolerable the entire movie tho. I also didn't know Bane was Irish/Scottish/British all at the same time. While the action scenes were decent, living up to the first two movies was always gonna be near impossible. I admittedly may watch it again on cable when it comes in a few years. Until then I have my Dark Night and Batman Begins blu-rays to keep me company.
B004707ARU|5.0|My understanding is that this record was recorded digitally.  Even so, this re-pressing  is very, very good in my opinion.  I have heard other albums recorded digitally and remastered/repressed on 180g vinyl (Urban Hymns by the Verve for example) which still have that dead digital feel.  This release, however, is well worth owning on vinyl.  It is warm and live and rich.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What will happen next?  When last we left Katniss she was in a hovercraft heading towards district 13.<br />Synopsis:<br />Katniss wakes up in district 13 with a decision to make about her future.  Will she become the Mockingjay?  The symbol of the rebellion and unite the other districts.  This decision is not one that she wants to make.  Katniss just wants to live peacefully and hunt in district 12.  Since this is not an option she is forced to rely on her friend Gale and Fennick who helped her escape the last games.  Katniss makes the decision to become the Mockingjay but at what cost?  Who is controlling her now?  What future will she have?<br />My Thoughts:<br />Well now that the book is finished now and the wait for the movie begins.  I wasn't sure about how this novel ended.  I felt there were some questions left unanswered.  Katniss is a pawn for other people always in this series.  Where is her freedom?  I think in some ways that question will be answered in this novel.  I still enjoyed it and had no trouble reading it.  The author was successful in communicating Katniss's conflict with authority and wanting her own freedom that occasionally it made me uncomfortable to read.<br />What makes a great thriller?  For me this is a book that captures my interest from start to finish.  I am not spending a page reading about the chair in the corner.  I read another what I would term a thriller in the Bourne Ultimatum.  I felt that I got lost in the details where Mockingjay just kept moving.  What are your thoughts?

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This is not a horrible flick. I am a comic book fan. I love the action and the some of the actors, but I would love even more to see the storyline follow some of the drama of the actual book. The good guys don't always come out on top. The movies are getting a little too predictable for me.

0316228532|1.0|There is absolutely no intrigue, interest, or creativity in this book.  You could get the same amount of entertainment in picking up the newspaper or turning on the news.  Very disappointing for previous fans - the writing doesn't come close to holding your attention.  Content is distastful without providing any necessity to storyline.  Editors should provide better guidance.  Maybe sticking with fantasy would be better........

B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is so simple to use. I have tried others and they didn't do anything or I just could not figure it out. I love this app...You can do so much. Has silly stickers, blimish cover up, if you play with the lighting when you take your picture the blimish cover up can help cover under eye wrinkles and zits....I love using the stickers for fun pics of the kids...So simple to use.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Just a payday movie for the 3 stars and the movie doesn't even deserve 1 star.  A retelling of the Snow White story... after a heavy night of partying?<br />A brunette as Snow White?  Really?  Worse, a poor acting job by a brunette as Snow White.  Has she acted before?  Apparently but, you wouldn't know it by this performance.<br />And then along came... Thor?  I hope his financial advisers are better than his acting agents because, this role pretty well type casts him as Thor and he'll need his Thor money to get through life.  He acts like he's Thor, he looks like Thor on a bad hair day, and he seems uninterested in giving the role something other than what he had just completed on Thor and The Avengers movies.  Maybe he didn't get any sleep or maybe he was just unhappy because he hadn't had any time to spend any of his Thor money.<br />The Queen?  Charlize Theron best acting was when she was taken away as a child.  Oh, that's right, that wasn't Charlize playing the kidnapped young woman.<br />Rupert Sanders best directing job was when he told his aide to get him a coffee.  It's not evident he was even on set when any of the 3 stars were, what do they call that, acting.  I'll be looking for his name on future movies to make sure I don't waste my money.

B007THA4FI|1.0|TOO bad I have to rate this book.  I did not want to give it one star.  I did not like it at all, I am sorry I bought it.  I tried to get through  the book, but maybe I am too old.  Loved the Harry Potter series.  This was a big disappointment.  Waste of money.

0142000655|3.0|For about the first 200 pages, I was in the firm belief that this book would trump Grapes of Wrath. It is hard to review this book, because I would not want to turn someone away from reading it. Reading is more about the journey itself than what you get at the end most times. However, I really felt like he was going after too much with this book. It started off very bold and very focused, but after the half way mark and until the end there was so much unnecessary stuff that any other author not named John Steinbeck would never have gotten published. It's like he wanted to add a lot of autobiographical stuff in there, but he wanted to have his story about Adam and his family. When I put it down, I was left feeling that this could have been an amazing book at 300 pages. The theme was difficult to grasp, and this was not the case with Grapes and some of his other books. I am not sorry I read it. It has given me some things to think about. The language, as always, was beautifully written. But I just didn't connect with this and felt too much artistic license was given because he had done so well with Grapes. I'm a hater! Worth three stars though because the parts of this book that are good are better than any novel written in the past 50 years.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love how its challenging and fun! Sling shots and so many things! like 20 different birds. - equals extra fun!!
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Awesome start to a new season under a new showrunner.  Supernatural stumbled and lost its way for the past couple of years (that is..if you take into account that it is one of the best shows on TV) but with Carver back as the new showrunner, this episode of the new season gives every indication that it has found it's way again.  Jensen Ackles is on fire as Dean Winchester, a warrior back from Purgatory with a severe case of PTSD.  The episode sets up the new season with lots of mysteries to be discovered along the way.  Highly recommend Supernatural to anyone interested in good acting playing out a good story.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|The app does what it says it does, you can even change the color of your battery if you want, but the default is red for low and green for high, with the colors in between for different levels of charge. It pops up automatically when you plug in your charger, which I love. It also gives you readings for how long you have for each class of usage, like wifi and apps and movies. But I'll warn you, if you've had your kindle for a while and the battery life isn't what it used to be, it doesn't take that into account, it just uses the optimum battery life (that's why it's 4 stars and not 5). Overall, a great app, especially for free!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love all the Percy Jackson books but did not expect them to keep my interest for too long.  I am a teacher (and founder of the Harry Potter Book and Movie Clubs of NY)and started reading the Riordan books so that I could find other fantasy recommendations for my students. I was hooked from Lightening Thief, and each book is better than the last.  With Mark of Athena, Rick Riordan does it again! This book is a fun odyssey from beginning to end. The cast of characters is great, and I like that they are multi-cultural.  My students are neither Greek nor Caucasian, and I want them to be able to see themselves reflected in the pages of the book.  My daughter began reading the Percy Jackson series at age 7 and learned a good deal about Greek mythology  in the process.  It spurred an interest for her that has continued with The Heroes of Olympus series.  Now she's exposed to Roman mythology and it's connection to the Greeks.  The vocabulary is rich and the writing does not insult a young person's intelligence. The genders are shown to be different but equal.  In fact, an overall message is that we all have something to contribute.  I like the themes of friendship, loyalty, and bravery. Most importantly, these books are just fun to read. Isn't that the whole point - to help our young people be literate and thinkers.  Mark of Athena gives you a whole lot to think about. I love it. Thanks, Rick. I'm already waiting for the next one!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|With basic graphics, cheap interface, and with a copied design of Router, Flow could not get any worse. I hope the developer of Router puts you in court, because this is a fine example of copyright violation of a boring game that already came out.

B007THA4FI|2.0|too many charcaters, hard to follow<br />I found myself re reading chapters, Unable to engage with author.<br />Maybe the book will get better, I usually can read a book in a week or less<br />this book has taken be 2 weeks and I am only on chapter 4
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is not so bad as the critics said.  The personalities and interactions centered around the activities of the council and local power struggles are quite interesting.  The children in the story are very interesting, and the various venalities of the adults get appropriate comeuppance.  The tragedies are appropriate commentary on the world as it is.<br /><br />A realistic novel, but not so dreadful a depiction a Thomas Hardy, not so perfect a heroine as Dickens.<br /><br />A previous review here under my name was directed at another book (\\"The Care of Wooden Floors\\").  I apologize for the error.

B0098VXBIA|4.0|As a childless woman whose clock ticked out long ago there were some places in this movie I teared up. Mostly it was a pleasant way to spend time.<br /><br />OK, the main women characters were all stereotypes of some sort. I can't handle that, usually. But the entire movie seemed over blown and somewhat cartoony, so it wasn't so bad.<br /><br />The dad Dudes cracked me up. I'm pretty sure most men are as bad at taking care of their kids as these guys. But the Chris Rock character is a hoot. His oldest kid dragging a dead cat out of a bush gave me a good laugh out loud.  I could see the Joe Manganiello character's story arc from his first one handed pull up. But who the heck cares? It's not just because he is wonderful to look at, he is also a trained actor:  Joe could read the phone book aloud and most women would still watch.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice little entertaining movie. I wouldn't fight to watch it again, but once was OK.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|oh my gosh I love this movie it is so good I would certanly recomend this to someone such a good movie love love love love this movie I just love love love love it
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. It stirred my imagination. The power that was available on this planet and a robot that could creat anything  you would ask for. It is one of the few movies that I would watch more than once. It may be a little corny and slow at the start but then it  gets into the action.
0439023513|2.0|There are thousands of reviews that have already been written about the Hunger Games series.  I enjoyed the first book quite a bit, the second one, not as much and actually struggled to get through the third book and don't plan to re-read any of them.  After all the hype and the movies coming out, I wanted to know what they were about.    Initially, the overall theme seemed good,  although on further thought it is pretty contrived.  It is hard to believe, that a city like Panem could maintain control of its districts for over seventy-five years with the barbarism shown in the Hunger Games.  Children in any society are among its most prized possessions and while people might tolerate pain, famine and other suffering from themselves personally, to see their children taken year after year to feed Panem's insatiable thirst for blood, without response is inconceivable.    The style of writing is frustrating as well.  There are so many fragments of sentences floating around, that meaning is sometimes lost or, difficult to parse.  I understand using this as a way of bringing an urgency to a tense situation, like in the Battle Arenas, but it just makes reading difficult in the middle.  I liked the first book enough that I dealt with it.  By the third book, it was old and just flat out irritating.    The main character, Katniss, is pretty devoid of motivation in this book. The first book, she is motivated by love of her sister, the second book, by a desire to protect Peeta, but in this book, there just isn't anything except for hatred of President Snow.  Which is something, but it doesn't really drive her to do anything until the very end of the book.  In point of fact, Katniss isn't really even that important to this book.  The author could have killed her off in the first chapter and then written a book called \\"Assault on Panem\\" that would have been more interesting.  Even Katniss's actions towards the end of the book don't seem to have any real impact on anything, exceptto kill of some of the characters around her.  The end is forseen from the beginning, but it sure is a slog to get there.    The love triangle really falls apart in this book.  I'm not quite sure why it was ever there in the first place, except that Katniss and Gale have hunting in common and hung out a lot together.  Otherwise, he isn't a very interesting character and there certainly isn't much sizzle going on in the first place.  As time goes by, it becomes pretty clear that he is very much an \\"ends justify the means\\" sort of person, who is willing to do what it takes to win the war, at whatever cost of human life.  He's just not much of a love-interest, though.    Which brings the fact that the one likeable character in the whole series, Peeta, is all but killed off for the majority of the book.  He just doesn't exist.  And without his humor, positive out look, and deep inner-good, all you're left with is an intense, somewhat unstable Katniss to wallow in her own fears and depression.    Perhaps the goal of the author was to convey that in war, there is no \\"good side,\\" that both sides are busy with their propaganda machines and are willing to waste lives, even of their own citizens, in order to achieve victory.  Certainly, Katniss is nothing more than a tool in this book of a different spin-machine.    I guess I would recommend reading this book, if you need to know how things turn out, but if you are OK with letting your imagination fill things in, you are probably better off letting it go.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great show!  Damian Lewis has been a long time favorite of mine and he does not disappoint.  Claire Danes is spectacular and plays this character in every detail.  Every episode was intense, but so well played that you can't help but wonder what is happening in Washington right now.  Do yourself a favor and watch this show.  You won't see acting of this caliber in a long time.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|First off, this is a tangent story (series ?) to the TV show. While most of the characters are thinly disguised to protect the innocent, the stories are a bit more adult (delightfully) and have proved to be a really fun read. Rook / Castle is a bit more of a doof, Nikki / Kate is a bit more openly sensual and even more of a drop dead professional cop. She plays around, seems a bit smarter and a lot tougher than the TV persona.<br /><br />Fun to read and a few more twists and turns than I expected. I have the first two Kindle books in this series and will buy the others when the price gets a bit more realistic. Get serious guys, no print cost, no inventory cost and minimal advertising - if you can justify the price with anything but greed on the publishers part, let me know how that works. Five stars for the book, one star for the list price of the Kindle version ...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book read the entire trilogy this week hoping there will be more about the Greys.I literally read this book til the sun came up today
B007THA4FI|1.0|THe book had too many characters. The plot was very diverted into many little areas specific to the characters. All the characters were not likable or important. Sex and violence seemed to be thrown in for the sake of commercialism or to draw interest of the reader but failed. I was very disappoointed in this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book picks up exactly where book1 leaves off i couldn't put it down......downloaded book 3 halfway through so i could continue ....true ly addicting story!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was surely written by a woman. It took three books to complete a story that if a man would have written it would have been short story.<br />Yes, unbelievable. Dream on folks it ain't ever going to happen to you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Curiosity  finally got the best of me so i downloaded book 1 .100pages in i downloaded book two. its a very graphic book with a great story . literary porn if you will with a modern day romance to die for!
B007XIC1GI|3.0|First things first, while I have long been a fan of metal, Marilyn Manson's music is not my cup of tea. But having been impressed by his manner in some interviews over the years, I approached this book in the hope of a decent insight into the man. And the first chapter- detailing the bizarre sexual perversions of his grandfather- was amazing, awkward, unflinching and brilliantly told. And then after that, it seems that the ghostwriter left Manson to his own devices, leaving a few notes for the structure of the remainder of the book. I found that Manson steered away from the type of introspection and self analysis that would have interested me, and instead started pointing fingers.<br /><br />Teachers, Religion, intact, all the usual authority figures get a serve. But it gets tiring quickly. He'll attack someone for their hypocrisy and I would think...'Well fair enough.' Then paragraphs later he would gloatingly recount some wrongdoing of his own, but with no effort at regret or even self awareness. Now to a jaded old codger like me, I can find my critiques of the modern world in more appetising fare, and better written and researched as well. If you are a young fan, then you'll possibly be impressed at Manson's vehement attacks on 'the man.' But if you've been through that phase of life already, then you'll find little of interest here.<br /><br />I feel that the book never really explores who Manson really is, it's just some more publicity, cocaine, goth chicks, knives, self harm blah blah blah, the usual rock n' roll  excesses are here in the usual detail. But that's not interesting. Marilyn Manson has always sold himself as an interesting product of modern society, yet he describes the most banal rock story that any fan of music bio's has already read...and written far more convincingly than this, I might add. You'll find more suitable reading from [[ASIN:1416511946 The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]] or better yet Anthony Keidis' story in [[ASIN:1401307450 Scar Tissue]]. And those artists never claimed to engage in any great social discourse, the way Manson has sold himself to the media and fans all these years. An image that isn't addressed much at all here, and it feels like that's because it is only an image, not a true passion.<br /><br />It isn't all bad, that first chapter was utterly brilliant, but it all ends up like some myspace page by the end, with lists of rumours cribbed from the Web, standard drawings of internal organs and things embellished with some suitably 'Goth' font and poetry. Oh god, the poetry. That almost loses one star for me, but that's really a matter of personal taste so I'll be generous and leave it at that.<br /><br />One for the fans only, perhaps.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|These books have no depth and are very poorly written. There is very little description and overall the books are extremely repetitive in writing. The plot is predictable the whole way through. I was very disappointed considering these are top sellers. The world just wants to read a porno apparently.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The cast was excellent.  I bought this film because I'm a big Judi Dench fan, but I must admit Maggie Smith stole the show.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is tired of the violence, strong language and the pure trash that is coming out of Hollywood today.  It's refreshing to see a film that is tastefully entertaining.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing. but a bit annoying how you have to pay for diamonds.but still a fun seek and find game.
030758836X|3.0|This book was really good, interesting and well written.....until the last quarter. I agree with another reviewer who said that it seems that Gillian Flynn was writing and suddenly got tired and decided to just end the book. The ending was absolutely bizarre, unrealistic and ridiculous and, in my opinion, tarnished an otherwise great book. After finishing, I felt very, VERY surprised that this book is a NYT best seller with an ending like that...
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I bought this to transfer motivational tapes into MP3s.  After 10 tape transfers, the product started to slow down considerably so the output was slow and couldn't be listened to.  It seemed like the motor was overworked and couldn't spin the tape at the correct speed. It wasn't a problem of dirty or long tapes being transferred - the tapes had only been used 1 or 2 times before and they were all around the 30 minutes per side.  In conclusion, this is very cheaply made so look elsewhere.
B0091XRL86|5.0|I'm really picky about kids' movies. If my daughter enjoys it, fine, but she isn't what you might call discerning. This is one of the few that I actually enjoyed watching with her. Sharp humor, clever writing and fantastic to look at. It even has David Tennant! What else could you want?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i read the first book and it was a bit kinky but i had to go and get the second one its very interesting and you just can't put it down i admit i didn't think i would like it but now that i am in the last of the books its very addictive and can't wait to finish the last book.
B00846REIS|1.0|I was not impressed. Someone told me this book was a lot like 50 Shades - not even close! It just seemed to me like a lot of sex scenes and no story line.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book presents a fantastically detailed world that I can see in my mind and enter into just by picking it up.  I feel like I've known the main characters forever, as if they are family.  The length of this book (and its predecessor) is daunting but manageable for this slow reader.  When I am reading this book, time flies and I am lost to the current world and immersed the world of the book.  Very few books have this effect on me.  I have not watched the TV series, nor do I feel the need to.  The book has taken me there already!
0316228532|4.0|No, it's not as good as Harry Potter. Is it bad? Also no. Give The Casual Vacancy a chance. Just pretend that it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling and evaluate the book on its own merits. I genuinely liked it, because Rowling's strong point will always be character creation.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I absolutely hated this book. It was gruesomely graphic for shock value alone. Sad and morbid-I could't wait to finish it.

0451232852|4.0|I love these books and find them well-researched with some great characters.  My only objection is that he throws in sex scenes that I found to be more based on a college-boy's fantasies about women and what they want than reality.  Every character, especially the women, deal with their sexuality in exactly the same, clichéd manner.  To me, it all seems quite gratuitous and does nothing to paint a fuller portrait of the characters.  Other than that,(unless you're after a few cheap thrills) it's great reading.  He knows his history.  I did find some of the \\"collaborators\\" in the story to be rather shallowly-sketched, but, for the most part, his characters are well fleshed-out and their points-of-view ring true.<br />I have the audiobook version and most of the reading is very good, altho some of the reader's American accents are a tad \\"off,\\" esp the female voices. (Gosh, women get short-shrift all 'round here! (-;)<br />Recommended for a \\"good read.\\"
B007GCY8FS|2.0|super convuluted plot that tested the reader's credulity.childs has had better efforts.I would try samples of future books first before I would buy.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|after its blue ray release. i waited to have the 3d release. found it and i was going to buy it for $100... even though i got it from fys at $20 i would still buy it from $100. This is a perfect 10 3d blue ray experience. highly reccommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a great book. The story keeps going from the first book. You will find yourself so involved in the story that you lose track of time. I am looking forward for the next book in these series.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've been burned by highly rated books in the past, but this one lives up to the hype. The story is well told, with lot's of intrigue. The writing style reminds me of Brandon Sanderson's - clean and precise, not wasting time telling you the precise shade of blue the sky was. I appreciate that. The story is written in the same narrative style as Patrick Rothfuss' \\"The Name of the Wind\\", so if you loved that, you're going to love this. Oh, and it's LONG...a big healthy book, so the story doesn't feel rushed, and you get your money's worth. Well done Mr. Ryan. I will buy the next one!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought it had a strong beginning but weakened as the plot got more and more convoluted. Even so it was a good read.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|A very interesing and insightful book. A fresh new way of looking at how one can encourage and remind children that persistent determination, not just intellect, can be more valuable as life goes on. (Constructive thought combined with Constructive Action)
B007THA4FI|2.0|I admit it.  I didn't finish the book. And I generally finish all the books I read. I will try at some point ... probably during the summer ... to wade through this book. Part of the problem is the disappointment that this book does not live up to the storytelling reputation of Rowling. Adults must also be entertained. Page after page introducing various characters. Bits and pieces of information that I assume will be important eventually. Then finally the characters begin to interact. Still, there is no hook. There is no one to pull for.  There is no one to like. They are all depressed and depressing. I was pulling for Rowling. Like I said, I'll check back here someday. But I'm not thrilled with the idea.  I'm being generous with two stars.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The graphics really are quite stunning in my Galaxy S III, and while I thought I would find myself bored rather quickly, I'm actually rather addicted to the game.<br /><br />I started with the free version of this game and played it until it wouldn't let me continue without upgrading. I was considering the five dollars it would cost, and suddenly, it became an app of the day giveaway much to my delight!!!<br /><br />Honestly, though, I would have gladly paid the five bucks. This game is highly entertaining, and another quality job from the fine folks at Playrix.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 4 year old loves this app. It is cute and well programed. She has even learned the proper way to set a table. This app allows you to place creatures at a restaurant by taping them and then cook the dishes they desire. The dishes are realistic and the cooking process is fun and informative for kids who have an interest in cooking. Afterwards, the user needs to serve the guest and clean up the table/dishes. Finally, the user resets the table and seats the next guest. It's cute, age appropriate, and maintains her attention for an eternity.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book provides a glimpse into someone who may be viewed as different, although he really wants to be seen as ordinary.  Although I finished this book a few weeks ago, I find myself continuing to think of August and his friends.  Thought-provoking and honest - I will have my son read this when he gets just a little bit older.  I think there are a lot of great lessons here, and reading it leads you on a journey alongside these great characters.  Loved it!
B0044XV6MU|4.0|Exceptional book from arguably one of the most gifted health writers/journalists around. Enjoyed the sections on publication bias, placebos and nutritionists.

Every song is a classic, except for Cripple Creek Ferry (which is pretty damn good regardless). A stunner.<br /><br />Stand-outs include Birds (wonderfully covered by New Orleans funk band, The Meters), Only Love can Break Your Heart and I Believe in You.<br /><br />Pitchfork says it best: \\"a writer of original melodies of extraordinary beauty in full flower. It's an aspect of Young's work that can be overlooked: the guy can write a simple tune over a chord change that hollows you out completely.\\"
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Someone recommended the Crossfire series, I bought it started reading it right away, but  chapter 2 or 3 she is alreading thinking of sex. It was just too much for me! Read Gabriel's inferno instead.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was sent to my kindle and it is one of the best Rick Riordan books I have ever read. It combines both story plots, with different points of view. Prophecies, action, and hard decisions await you in this Roman and Greek clash of forces.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very similar to 50 Shades of Grey but different enough to keep me I interested and entertained. Not an \\"instant classic\\" by any means but good enough I bought the second one right away. If you liked the 50 shade series you will like this storyline.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent book! I couldn't wait for it to released and am counting the days for the release of the third book.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Wild west gunfighter and outlaw(Craig)wakes up with no memory and a weird bracelet. After a skirmish with some thugs he wades into a town under the rule of a land baron(Ford)and his cronies. Craig gains town's respect after beating up Ford's son but is arrested by an honest sheriff who wants to keep him for Federal Marshalls. Ford has other plans, we learn Craig stiffed him on a gold robbery and Ford wants revenge. After losing a good portion of his cattle after a mysterious phenomenon involving,'strange lights' and learning his son has also been arrested, Ford moves in. During a standoff between him and the law, other visitors ride...no, fly into town for their own say on matters.<br /><br />Interesting premise delivers the goods with slam bang gritty action early on and special effects rightfully left in the background with some fresh surprises and stunts. An excellent cast with Craig, Ford, and even Olivia Wilde are eventually more than fun to watch(although Ford's sometimes over the top western drawl/girth doesn't help for some less camp that this film could have used). We can see the star cast tried and mostly succeeds with real effort from the writers with characters and plot which doesn't hurt, but still beg for more.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good and deserved more play than they get, but at over two hours, perhaps less is more. The same can't be said for some clear over indulgences from the CGI department earlier than necessary with the alien creatures. This should have been saved or lessened with some clever writing and only pits the film drawing too many artificial comparisons with Alien or District 9 which hurts its potential. It really can't decide whether it wishes to be a campy sci-fi/action/western/horror/mystery or much more, yet still has good moments but with some elements that are interesting but then forgotten(that steamboat in the middle of the desert was cool and begs questions that are never resolved or played with later in the story). The gold mining plot has potential and draws some cool imagery and possibility for the finale that goes all out for action and thrills with some emotion.<br /><br />An interstellar conflict point is alluded to and gives for a decent twist with the Wilde character before the final act. But lets face it, we knew there was something with her when we saw her walk naked amongst shocked but not excited cowboys in the trailer. By this point you chuck away your eyes for originality and hope for a good finale, which the film provides without too much reach for a happy ending that I feared for Craig's character.<br /><br />Parting thought, the film was not the stinker many have said, but could have been better with less screenwriters and an extra script doctor or two. Steven Spielberg Executive-Produced with director Jon Favreau(oh yeah, look for an almost Hitchock-esque cameo early on)gives what he has, which if you like his films is usually enough, both for casual viewers and the obvious CGI nuts, though even they may feel cheated.<br /><br />Bottom line, it could have been worse under lesser hands, but better with what they had. Is that the attitude to have following a good romp? Oh well, a solid three and a half on a good day but with an extra half for drawing out the Script-doc in me, as I said, with some clever extras it didn't have to be CGI fest-which it really isn't save for some eye rollers- but that's my opinion. Enjoy.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I didn't think anything could compare to my all-time favorite, Pride and Prejudice, but this DVD is a very close second.  I especially enjoyed the intelligent and outspoken, for her time, Margaret Hale.  Not only does she recognize social injustice, she tries to do something about it by taking a stand and befriending some of the mill workers. She is a very modern woman for her time.  The man who gets in her way is cotton mill owner, John Thorton.  It's fascinating to watch how, little by little, she influences him, and he becomes a better man.  These are two complex characters that you will not tire of watching. I purchased the DVD so I could watch it whenever I wanted.  Sadly, it was stolen out of my mailbox before I could.  If I had it, I would be watching it now!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a lot like Fifty Shades of Grey, if you liked those novels then you will love this.
B00992CF6W|3.0|why isn't there animals or creepers or zombies or anything!!!!??? there's not even night only day!!! :( I don't like how its so boring! I have a kindle fire and I want to go on survival mode but it only lets me on creative!!! all you can do is build things and walk around. And you already have everything forever like your stuff never runs out! That's boring cos u wanna go find things not just always have them!!! not fun!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was great, I loved how it tied everything in that occured from the original story but in a modern way. This was a cliffhanger and SO GOOD!!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Twisty and fascinating reading with a cant put down terrifying ending. Harry Hole arrived too late to be played by Walter Matthau. Too bad  !
0525952926|5.0|After reading 'Fall of Giants', I waited excitedly for \\"Winter of the World' and it did not disappoint. We see the next generation of the families we met in the first book, and we learn the effects the second World War had on countries, governments and the people. I learned a great deal more about the politics of WW2, through the eyes of the characters. Couldn't put it down. Now I'll have to wait...a year? til the next one.
B002ZBJ6SY|4.0|I have just recently \\"discovered\\" Seether and I'm impressed with their style of music. I have become more open minded about the Genres that I listen to.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Came in good time and enjoyed the slim case. I  originally had it on DVD but its way better in Blu-Ray
B0099G3I96|4.0|They are always reinventing their sound, yet they stay true to their roots. Love the new album. Would definitely reccommend.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I tried to like this book, but had no success.  I enjoy a book where the characters grab my interet.  I kept reading but this never happened.  It finally got to the point where, after 100+ pages, I threw in the towel.  Ms. Rowling should stick to what she does best.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett offers an interesting, albeit fairly simplified, insight into the second world war period. He is good at portraying historic periods but I liked Pillars of the Earth a lot more. His writing is becoming almost mechanical and characters in his most recent book become some sort of predictable caricatures of real people. Some of his characters are changing their attitude to such an extent that they seem to become a totally different person which is not very believable. Nevertheless he makes the horrible happenings of war more accessible to a broad audience.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Read the history, gain some knowledge.  A combination of match game and history all wrapped into a strategic tile swap.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|this is an interesting game with a great screen saver thst you can build up as you play. looking forward to each new level
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Their first album was so good I was afraid of a carbon copy this time. But they avoided the sophomore slump and have made a great album. Their sound is essentially the same, but the songs are very witty and inventive.  Love it!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Good, solid songs.  It's a fun listen, and certainly worth buying.  Nice so see Rush back to being a rock band.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting and definitely made me want to buy the second and third book and I'm not usually a big time reader
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book.  Being British and born just as world war 2 was ending I heard a lot about the devastation of the London blitz. This book is about ordinary people trying to live their lives in Germany during the war. Although it is set during a brutal time and is about the plight of the jews, it is also a book about love.  I really wanted Liesel and Max to be together at the end but this was not made clear.  A wonderful book that stays with you.
B005LAII0I|3.0|I really wanted to like this film. It had some of my favorite actors in it and I really expected it to be good.  Costumes were well done and and I liked most of the characters.  The little bit of drama in this comedy didn't quite work.  The scene going into the mirror didn't work for me.  The prince didn't seem very smart and his acting like a dog looked too much like \\"The 10th Kingdom\\"
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book! Make sure to check out Rick Riordan's other books, such as the Kane Chronicles, the original Percy Jackson series and the other books in the Heroes of Olympus series.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I thought this was a well done movie.  A nice tribute to people who do a though job.  There were a lot of threats shown I never expected.  It opened my eyes to some of the real dangers out there.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Both season one and two are excellent, though I have to wonder if some actors were asking for a raise or were tired of working in the series.  I would have liked to see more character development and further involvement in the series before killing off what I would consider one of the most interesting characters of the show and his wife.  Shock and surprise in this instance (season finale) was a negative for me and I thought the writers could have done better, this is the type of writing that makes one wonder who departs next and if one should even bother taking an interest.  All in all a great series though, but the producers will have to dig deep to produce interesting replacements without ending up being a run of the mill product, don't see what is left carrying this series....as you can tell, I'm not a big fan of killing off main characters to twist the audience.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If you were expecting another Harry Potter type book from J.K.Rowling you will be very disappointed after reading the first page of this book. Lucky for me I did not buy the book with those expectations. This is very much a modern story and the language is rough and blunt as are the views of life and people. There were times while reading that I wanted to never read another word of it because of the cursing and raw descriptions of peoples actions. It made me uncomfortable. That said it is a good book and sometimes a reader needs to be made uncomfortable because there are people that think and talk and act like the people in the book. That's why I read, to expand my awareness. So, buy the book and if it sometimes makes you uncomfortable, ask yourself why.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I enjoyed the film, but I am writing about the disc quality. I received the disc and it suffered from extreme pixelation of the video. I returned the disc to Amazon (the return process was excellent) and got a second disc, which suffered the same pixellation problem. Given the same problem on two different discs, I looked for a different solution. Turns out the firmware on my bluray player (a Sony BRD S360) needed updating to work with the disc. Works fine now.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I remember being a kid and really loving happy days.  Then Fonzi jumped the shark and created an industry expression for the moment that a show/series/story crosses the line and goes down the toilet.<br /><br />GRRM could have written an excellent book 4, wrapped up the key stories, and gone down in SF/Fantasy history as the new Tolkien.  Instead he starts a NEW story line set that has little to nothing to do with books 1-2-3 of game of thrones.<br /><br />Had this been #1, it would be maybe 3-4 stars.  As #4, it flat out sucks.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|If you're listening to this, you already know about the band.<br /><br />The talent is there, music is rich and fulfilling, and the album is a must buy for anyone interested in this genre of music.  I cannot think of another non-BS album to play in the background during the fall and possibly spring event season.  This band is great for crisp evenings around a fire, or just killing off a Thursday night on the patio.<br /><br />I wish they made more money, but I'm only going to buy one version of this album.  Skip the Boy Scout popcorn and Girl Scout faux cookies and buy this compilation.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game was a great time killer for me.  but now it keeps crashing and closing down. its unable to play now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is post apocalypse.  The characters are well developed and have their flaws and good points (not flat).  The story is well developed and has multiple threads each with their own suspense.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|An easy to read, interesting account of events of the period, however, the characters are not well described so they were difficult to visualize. This book is not a good stand alone because it requires the reader to  either \\"know\\" the period or to have read the author's previous books on The Cousins' War.
0399157565|3.0|I loved the book until the murderer was revealed.  Where did this come from?  Usually I have an idea of \\"whodunit\\" but this came from nowhere.
B001992NUQ|5.0|People have no idea how difficult it was back in the 90's before Glee and American Idol.  Back then, we had to pretend to like Smashing Pumpkins and Dinosaur Jr. before finding a truly symbolic film like Fight Club.  I thank my lucky stars that Show Girls paved the way for Fight Club and now I can enjoy both on any drag-show stage in Tijuana.  David Fincher, you more than made up for all the empty promises of Brian De Palma.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have been a big Jo Nesbo/Harry Hole fan since I first read Redbreast a few years ago.  I downloaded this newest translation on its release day.  It took me a few chapters to get into the story-- which I don't remember from the previous books.  I think I have grown to like Hole as the center of the story and was almost a bit disinterested when the focus was on Gusto and Oleg.  At any rate, soon, I was as engrossed in this book as I had been with the previous one.  I was shocked a little with the ending, but, I remain hopeful.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I've been a DeMille fan since reading \\"The Charm School\\" about 1990.  I think that I have read most of his books so far.  This book, however, started off slow for a DeMille book and has gotten progressively slower since I started it.  I've read 34% of the book according to my Kindle but doubt that I will finish it unless it begins to pick up in the next few pages.  Looks like DeMille has gone the same way that W.E.B. Griffin, Stephen Coonts and James Patterson have gone, in other words, to the dogs.  At this point in the book I advise you not waste you money on it.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|Heard so much about this series since we live right in the middle of the all the filming in Georgia.  I finally decided to sit down and watch the series. All I can say now is...ADDICTED! Great series!!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|We really enjoy this movie and oftern watch it again.  Cloonie is hilarious.  This is probably one of his best roles.  I would definitly recommend it.
B00932IHGK|5.0|Never heard of this show until the Emmys. We don't have cable or satellite so this series came out of nowhere. If not for the Emmys we would not have purchased this show. The show? It's great! Clare Danes is terrific and the writing is top shelf. Give this show a chance.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Joss Wheeden is at his usual best at personalizing his heroes, then delivering the expected thrill ride.  Bravo.  Reminds me of his past accomplishments.
B000002J6H|5.0|To be joined on a first solo project by friends like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and \\"Mama\\" Cass Elliot, as well as David Crosby, Graham Nash and Neil Young,as well as others who also joined him, is an overlooked fact; one that definitely shows just how appreciated & well liked by professional musicians he was at such an early time in his career. He has gone on with so much other great work as well, that show what a fine songwriter, guitarist and singer he really is. I would recommend this recording to anyone who loves his other works.<br />While some further works by peers, Crosby & Nash, done without him have been good, the strength & flavor of him with them has always been better, and just a bit more cutting - edge musically, I think.<br /><br />Philip Colgan
B005K01VZS|4.0|What started out as gathering information and material for an eulogy, led the author (and reader) into a journey of self-examination and acceptance. I liked the back-and-forth format used by the author to reveal the differences and similarities between the Rabbi and the Preacher as he discarded some of his own preconceptions and prejudices. I think what I took away most from reading this book is that kindness and acceptance are gifts we can give ourselves as we offer them to others.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it! It's great to have my books right on my devices. Especially when I'm in a waiting room with crappy magazines.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I really wanted to enjoy this, and in fact cajoled my wife into sitting with me to watch.  She lasted about 10mins and left.  I managed about 30.  Almost every scene was improbable or downright stupid. From the 1-dimensional characters to the toy wolves I found myself in disbelief that Neeson would participate in such silly nonsense. 'nuff said.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I download a lot of games for my little sister and I always try them first to see if they are good and all of the Dr.Panda apps and they are awesome
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Most of the negative reviews seem to be from those who have built up the mythos to the point that nothing could make them happy.  I loved the original \\"Alien\\" and the fact that this movie makes an attempt to explain a lot about the first movie is pretty cool.  What everyone seems to forget is that the original movie was made with no intention of anything more and I would have been happy if they had stopped there (can you honestly say you don't wish George Lucas would have done the same thing with \\"Star Wars?\\").  As a stand alone movie it's pretty cool.  A bit long, but I never found myself getting bored with it.  They did a good job of keeping things interesting.  If you have seen the other \\"Alien\\" movies then it will be pleasing in that it kind of explains why there are the aliens, not really what they are, but how they got there, or what their purpose was.
B004KKX814|4.0|L drago destroy was a very cool bey. It is durable fun and awesome. But it is not the best bey ever. The reason is because final survive is too tall and it looses a lot of balance when it switches to the survive tip, but can surprisingly beat meteo l drago a lot. But it is a great collectors item and just fun to play with. So I recommend you get it, but not for final survive.
B001B93QSW|4.0|I remember hearing this for the first time in junior high and instantly falling in love with the music and the image.  Thirty years later and the hooks are still just as good.  Sure, the production is a bit thin and that cowbell still gets annoying, but the songs are still as hook driven and catchy as ever.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|If you dont know Harry Bosch but like cop books, dont miss this one.If you know Harry,enough said.If your new to Michael Connellys Harry Bosch series,start from book one and enjoy them all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A perfectly unperfect love story!  I couldn't put it down.  I have not been this drawn to a love story since the Twilight series.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This seeming memoir of a young woman embarking on an onerous hike of the Pacific Coast Trail which she attempts in order to discipline her life, is told with a wonderful sense  of suspense.  Her twisting of her experiences into many life and death moments made this book an interesting read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The third Heroes of Olympus book, stays in the same vein as the previous two, however, this one seems a bit scarier than the others. There is an element of horror and suspense that hasn't been there so far. This theme pervades every situation; to the point that one isn't sure any of the characters will make it. All in all, a wonderful purchase.
034580404X|4.0|Some have said this is just a manual or a how-to-book, while others find it to truly be a love story.  It definitely fits in the erotic category and farther out than many, but I found it to be quite a love story.  I'm on the third book of the trilogy, and they are very hard to put down!  Enjoy.............. (And it's not just for the very young - after all, the 70's can be spicy, too.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This was a sterling second season of an amazingly inventive reconfiguring of Holmes and Watson. It's vastly superior to the recent feature film version of Holmes, despite the talents of Robert Downey, jr. and Jude Law. Here the writing from Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss, and especially Steve Thompson is superb, with just the right comedy pitch set amidst all the thrills, mental puzzles, and emotional angst.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, as Holmes and Watson, respectively, are even more vibrant than in Season One, and when it comes to Holmes and Watson pairings over the past century, I have to say they're the cat's meow. Even Jeremy Brett from the terrific BBC productions of yesteryear would be proud, I think.<br /><br />As for the episodes themselves, the first and third shows shine the most brightly, particularly Thompson's Reichenbach, which months later still has people abuzz about the ending, trying to figure out just how it was done. Gatiss's second episode (Hound) isn't as strong as the other two, and seems to break away from the Holmes' canon a bit, but it's still highly enjoyable, just as Gatiss's Mycroft is.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|great movie for the baby boomers  a refreshing look at old age  and a lovely view of india  enough with the words
B008NW67E0|5.0|There is not one single \\"meh\\" song on here. They are all great. It was a great addition to my collection.
0345803485|1.0|This book started off very promising. It captured me from the beginning. I think the mystery of a young handsome rich man pursing a plain Jane (clumsy) girl is something that every woman fantasizes at least once in her life. So I was excited to embark on this journey with Christian & Ana.<br /><br />Then the spell was broken. The story line dragged on for forever. There was no plot.  The author neglected to give any characters a purpose for living besides agonizing over the fact if whether or not they were gonna have an active sex life together. The only time I read about Christian working was when he was on the phone.<br /><br />This was a long book and I was even longer cause I kept putting it down. I feel like this book fell short...REAL SHORT.
0765316994|5.0|Redshirts by John Scalzi tells the story of the support crew onboard the Universal Union Capital Ship, Intrepid, and all the perils they face on a daily basis. I've been sitting on this review for a while, partly because I've not had much time to write but mostly because it has taken me a long time to come up with the right words for it. I'm a relative newcomer to Scalzi, having heard lots about him and his various sci-fi works but having never sat down and read anything of his until Redshirts. My first impression - if his other work is anywhere near as good as Redshirts then I can see myself devouring the rest of his bibliography in no time at all.<br /><br />The story follows Ensign Andrew Dahl, newly assigned as a junior scientist onboard the Intrepid, complete with red shirt. Almost immediately he notices something strange - the support crew are very good at hiding, the away missions have an obscene amount of fatalities, and the officers always seemed to survive the most horrific of injuries and are back up within days ready to face the next away mission. Dahl is determined to find out what is going wrong on this ship, before the next away mission becomes his last. This is a book that exploits the concept of the Redshirt, that guy on the away team in Star Trek that you knew was going to die because he was wearing a red shirt. It pokes fun at all those 70′s - 90′s sci-fi TV shows in a number of overt and subtle ways. Decks six through ten always suffer from explosive decompression during a fire fight, consoles on the bridge blow up in a shower of sparks every time the ship is hit by an energy weapon, you know, the little things that make sci-fi TV unique. Redshirts is a book that feels more like a tribute than a parody - I found the whole story heartwarming, and never condescending. There are a couple of problems with the story, the first being that the whole story feels like a running gag and by the end you are just looking for the next punchline. The otheris that the entire story feels like an in-joke, and I feel like anyone who hasn't ever watched those 70′s - 90′s sci-fi TV shows will be excluded from enjoying the majority of the story.<br /><br />Looking at the characters, it is very easy to dismiss them at first as being cardboard cut-outs. The nature of this story is to look at the Redshirt concept, so every main character plays a stereotypical Redshirt who is trying to avoid their likely fate of either dying on an away mission or on deck six. There isn't a great deal of depth or complexity to these characters, but this has been done deliberately, fits within the context of the story, and has been executed perfectly. For those who love their characters, it will mean the book is less than accessible for about the first 30%, but once you get to the first major plot twist it all makes sense with the characters taking on extra layers of complexity because of the bounds by which they personalities have been artificially confined. That said, despite these characters being perfect for the story Scalzi wanted to tell, they are just lacking, and to be honest I can't remember any of the Redshirt's names except for Ensign Dahl and Jenkins!<br /><br />The writing style for this whole story feels like a script, which again fits in with the context of the story. This can be jarring to read during the early chapters, especially during some of the rapid-fire dialogue that goes on between the characters. Almost every line of dialogue is followed by `said Dahl' or `said Jenkins' or `said...' for whichever character just spoke. As I said, just like a script / screenplay. I'm not sure if this is typical of Scalzi's writing, or if he just wrote it that way because it made sense to the story, but once you start to realize what is going on the narrative style almost becomes a character itself and I found myself laughing a few times at the way the scene was written, not just how funny the content of the scene was. After the completion of the main story, there are three `Coda's' that act almost like short stories set within the same world. Each one is written with a different point of view style - the first is written in first person, the second is written in second person, and the third (my favourite) is written in third person. All three Coda's have a completely different voice and style but they all work perfectly and help to bring this story to a fitting conclusion.<br /><br />Redshirts is a book where your mileage will vary based on how familiar you are with sci-fi. I also picked up a copy of the audio book (read by Wil Wheaton, and in my opinion the best way to consume this story) so my wife and I could listen together during a long trip, and we were both in stitches the whole way. But when I played it for a friend they were less than impressed, especially since they just didn't understand a lot of the set-up material or the punchlines. Redshirts gets a 9.0 from me, but I completely understand if you cant get into it and don't like it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a fabulous movie!  I watched it on my flight and it held my attention the whole way.  Highly recommend it to others!
B007THA4FI|3.0|For us in the U.S. I found it a bit hard to follow at times.  I also felt there was no real end to the story.  Maybe the more accurate way to tell this is that I felt it was just a bunch of odd stories all different, but tied together, but not in a way that made a whole lot of sense.  It was slow going and I guess I just expected more from J.K.  Yes, it was a story, but I got bored with it very quickly.  No, I didn't expect Harry, but I felt there should be more depth to some of the characters and they were just so predictable.  No suspense or mystery to it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|not the best controls but other than that it's pretty great<br />i play most minecraft versions including xbox and pc but im probably best at xbox this is new 2me and stuff so it is a little weird at first
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|An Excellent Book (like all others by Beevor) - a very interesting account of the war; could have used more maps to follow the battles.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|it would be awesome just my kindle fire shuts down every time he bursts through the wall. what do i do?
B0088WFZQG|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed Act of Valor.  There was a lot of action and it seemed very realistic.  We both came away from watching this with an even greater appreciation for our military.  I had read that the acting wasn't too great....it was by actual Navy Seals.  I thought they did fine though. We watched this movie on a 50\\" plasma tv which was good for viewing all the action.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it nearly as much on a tablet or laptop because of the realistic dim lighting that was used in a good part of the film.
B007T99ENE|3.0|I was rather disappointed with this novel. Ian McEwan is one of my favourite writers but this book, and his previous novel, 'Solar', were not up to his usual standard. The prose is, as always, very good and the book is well crafted, but I felt that the issues tackled in the plot were really not worthy of an entire novel. The idea of subterfuge and a 'book within a book' came across as tired and overworked, and the story seemed to go on endlessly. One feels that the main protagonist...a young, somewhat silly and shallow character....is not important or weighty enough to be at the centre of a novel. Nor do the events and issues strike one as being particularly significant. Her version of 'spying' for her country is ludicrous and pointless. Definitely not on the same level as the author's 'Atonement', which is outstanding. I am not surprised that this book was not included in the 2012 Booker Prize list. A Stella Rimington novel would be far more satisfying!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|third book was the best of the three....found myself skimming over pages in book 1 and 2 - after all there are just so many ways of being 50 shades.  Third book actually had more of the story and mystery...so book three I would give 3 stars and 1 and 2 two stars.[[ASIN:B008BM9L72 Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey / Fifty Shades Darker / Fifty Shades Freed]]

B007S3S8HO|3.0|This toy claims to be for ages five and up, so I gave it to a five-year-old boy who's deeply into Angry Birds.  (He's got all kinds of toys and games and clothes and plushies--I'm not entirely sure he knows that it's an app.)<br /><br />After getting him all excited about the fact that I had a new toy for him to play with, we opened it up.  He took one look at all the little pieces and connectors and decided that setting it up looked like more trouble than it was worth.  He went off and did something else while his dad and I set it up.  Then we called him back in.  He looked at what we'd built, flung the two birds at it--and then we once again had a mess of little pieces and connectors that had to be carefully set up.<br /><br />What kind of five-year-old wants to go to all that effort for ten or fifteen seconds' worth of play?  It might be appropriate for a nine- or ten-year-old who's mechanically minded and would find the set-up to be a fun task in its own right--though I have to say, these pieces don't fit together all that smoothly.  But for young kids, I just don't see how this can work.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Albom's books and he does an excellent job of creating a 'picture' and tellng the story.  This story pointed out a wonderful analogy of people and how they live their lifes - it is the 1/2 full versus 1/2 empty - wanting more versus wanting less - not necessarily for the right reasons.<br />Thought provoking - a good read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been an avid reader of science fiction and other genres all my life and have read many great books. I say without hesitation this is one of the best I've ever read! Great characters and plot make this a book I had trouble putting down. I can always tell when I'm totally engrossed in a book when I come to the final pages and feel almost sad it has to end, like I'm having to say good bye to some dear friends. Wool is one of those books and I sure hope the sequel comes out soon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was very good and the second book was better.  Can't wait to read the third book.  Quite an imagination this author has.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was difficult to read. There are many characters and it takes a while to get them all straight in your head. It is fairly slow moving and leaves you feeling terrible at the end.
0307720950|5.0|This is a good book on an interesting topic.  I run cabinet shop in Toronto and have been prattling to my wife about the remaking of the industrial revolution for a few years now.  Anderson sums up many of these themes with lots of interesting stories in an easily readable style.<br /> I think there are a few things worth adding.  First while digital fabrication technology is amazing it is only as useful as the people using it.  A cnc router won't make you a good cabinet maker any more that a word processor will make you a good writer or a digital synthesizer will make you a good musician.  A synthesizer enables a good musician to become a whole orchestra almost instantly.  But a bad musician still sounds like a bad musician and a bad writer is just as annoying as ever to read. What these technologies do is allow the talented craftsman, musician, writer to be more productive than ever, and also lower the barriers to entry for the people with talent who are not part of the established social hierarchy.<br /> In my own shop I don't have my own cnc equipment. When I take on a project like a kitchen, I simply email lists of parts (doors, drawers, carvings) to fabricators not far from my shop and in some cases the parts come back to me the next morning.  My suppliers don't stock inventory, they fabricate the parts digitally and so they can produce whatever I want in whatever sizes I want.  This is the easy part of my job.  The hard part getting the clients to decide on what they want, and figuring out how to fit everything they want into the space they have on their budget.  To use a car analogy most clients want something like a \\"Hummer/Lamborghini/Porsche/Lexus/Rolls\\" for the price of a Focus. They often send me 3d cad drawings of their dream kitchen.  It is nearly always like those famous drawings by Escher.  At first glance they seem very geometrically precise, but they can't exist in 3 dimensional reality. Squaring this circle is always a challenge, and demands a combining the skills of an expert cabinet maker with those of a psychotherapist.  The second hard part of my job is fitting cabinets which are always made to be regular shapes into old real houses which are never square or level. Accomplishing this task demands the skills of an expert finish carpenter, tricks that I learned from my grandfather.<br /> In short to be a cabinet maker in the digital age you still need all the skills of a traditional cabinet maker.  However what digital technology and advances in new technology in general mean is that small shops can now compete with large factories in a way they couldn't 30 years ago.  I can now offer my clients anything that large factory kitchen manufacturers could in the past.  For example, 30 years ago complex cabinet door styles could only be made custom at great expense using traditional cabinet shop tools or economically in large batches at big factories.  Now I can order 1 door if I need it economically.  And, I can beat mass production companies hands down in terms of service and speed.<br />In many cases I can also compete with mass producers on cost. This is because I have lower transaction costs. One of the things that frightens small scale producers is the fact that labour costs of small scale production can't compete with mass production particularly if the goods can be produced in places like China.  People say \\"They make that thing in China for $5, how can I compete\\".  However, if the small scale producer sells locally they don't have to compete with the $5 labour cost in China; they only have to compete with the $50 or $100 retail cost in their local market. The goods that are produced in China have a long list of transaction costs associated with them: transportation, wholesaling, retailing, packaging, inventory, obsolescence, corporate expenses and profit, mass market advertising and promotion. All these costs mean that the widget that is produced for $ 5 needs to sell for $ 50 or $ 100 to make a profit.  This leaves lots of room for local artisans to make a living, as long as they keep their transaction costs down.<br /> Anderson points out the digital crowd is rediscovering actual reality.  I think he does not go far enough in this. People like actual reality.  One of the things little noted in the frenzy of the digital revolution is the success of the Home Depot retail model.  30 years ago building materials was a virtual business.  Materials were stored in warehouses to which customers both commercial and retail had no access. Most businesses would simply phone the supplier, say what they wanted and give an account number or use a visa and it would be delivered, much like ordering things online but over the phone. Even if you went to a lumber yard, you would usually go to a desk and order things and they would be brought out to you. Home Depot changed all this by putting everything on open shelves so people could go in a play with it.  The builders supply became playground for handy people. At the height of the virtual revolution, Home Depot took over the market for home building supplies by `going actual'.<br />  I find this in my own business.  While the web is a good way to get my name out, showing people real physical samples is the best way to close a sale.  After a visit I always make sure I leave a potential customer with a few samples to play with.  This way my brand sits on the kitchen table while they are trying to come to a decision.<br /> All this points to the possibility of a business model that Anderson hints at, but does not really explore; the return of the traditional neighborhood artisan. A few hundred years ago if you wanted a pair of shoes, or a coat or a piece of furniture you went to a shoemaker, or a tailor or a cabinet maker and told them what you wanted and they made it for you.  There was personal contact between the producer and the consumer, you could touch and feel the materials and say what you liked. People could take pride in their work and see the smiles on the faces of happy customers.<br />This was a world wiped out by mass production.  Huge production runs meant the artisan could not compete with mass produced goods.  But mass production brought its own costs.  The producer and the consumer became separated by a huge faceless corporate distribution system, which pretended to care, but most suspected really didn't. This was partially documented by Marx as worker alienation. The flipside, consumer alienation, is perhaps best documented by Monty Python.  Mass production also brings with it a whole host of transaction costs, noted above, which make it not as cheap as it might at first appear.<br />New production technology offers the possibility of changing all this.  When I go to a shoe store it is always a frustrating experience.  I always want some combination of style and size that they never seem to have in the back.  Imagine  however if a shoe store had say 50 or 100 basic shoes that you could try on for size and fit, as well as some other samples that you could use to pick the styles.  With the help of an expert shoemaker you could try on the fitting samples until you found something comfortable. Then you could use the style samples to mix and match all the colour and style details that fit your taste.  This shoe store would not have a big warehouse of boxes in the back but some rolls of material as well as some cnc cutting and printing machines and specialized assembly tools.  Depending on the complexity of the order you could go and have a coffee and then come back and pick up your order, or maybe come back the next day.  This shoe store would give you exactly what you want as well as have some real cost benefits.  There would be no packaging cost, low inventory costs, and much lower transportation costs.  (Compressed rolls of material are much cheaper to transport and store than packaged finished good). Many of these cost reductions would also be environmental benefits, such asless packaging and transport. And worker and consumer alienation would be a thing of the past.<br />This is how I run my cabinet shop and I think it has great potential. Sign shops already work on this model. Perhaps the mall of the future could look like the high street of old, with shoemakers, tailors and furniture makers crafting what you want when you want them.  The digital world provides the infrastructure and the tools, but the purchasing process would be actual and face to face.  The best of both worlds maybe?<br />(I also wrote a doctoral dissertation at Oxford which was in large part about the relationship of the world of things to the world of symbols, so I have also been interested in these problems from a philosophical perspective. My examiners, postmodernists who don't believe in outdated concepts like `reality', didn't take kindly to it.)

B008K5T5AI|5.0|Banks is his usual erudite, eloquent and consummately professional self, and gives us another long-awaited instalment in the excellent and unique Culture series. Although they are by no means a \\"series\\" in the sense that one book follows the other, certain aspects of the Culture recur.<br /><br />Reminiscent of Excession in its setting and referring to the event occasionally, everything you could want in a space opera by the Grand Master himself is there. Amusing ship names, alien species, irascible drones, seriously aggressive knife missiles and ships, Mind logic in abundance. Events unfold and then fold back to reach a climax that is satisfying, wraps up all the loose ends and leaves you wanting more. This writer is such a master of the art there is no need to leave loose threads to ensure a follow-up.<br /><br />Long live Banks, may he write another 20 Culture novels. I will eagerly anticipate, pre-buy, impatiently await and then devour each one of them.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I am a staunch Reacher fan, having read every book. That said this book seems to have been written in a hurry and by someone besides Lee Child. Too little Reacher, too much nonsense and irrelevant detail.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Such a cute book. Great message for girls too! This princess takes care of things herself and doesn't depend on a prince to rescue her.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so happy to finally have this available on the Kindle! I am using Pinterest even more! Love the way it functions.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was so excited when Pinterest finally released an app for Android so I downloaded it on my phone and my Kindle Fire. Overall I love the app - its so much easier to use than using the site through the web browser. However, the app keeps crashing on my Kindle after I view whatever site was linked on the pin. If that was fixed, I'd give it 5 stars instead of 4.
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|I am so glad they brought this series back for a second season! This is one of the great shows on t.v. that everybody can watch.  Thanks for bringing it back!

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Having heard so much about the Hunger Games,  I decided to watch this movie.  After watching it, I couldn't understand what the fuss was all about.  I found the character build to be very shallow and I just couldn't relate or empathize with characters.  So, a week later I decided to read the book and ah ha:-) , this is where you get to know them.  I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought and read the other two as well, because I just couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end.  I went back and watched the movie again, understanding and relating to the characters and their situation and it was so much better.  I eagerly wait for the next movie to come out.  4 stars because people who haven't read the book, won't enjoy the movie as much.  Funny, its usually the other way around.
1601251505|4.0|Paizo has really taken the tabletop game to a new level.  I am happy with almost all of the changes from 3.5, and the format of the book is hugely improved from D&D.  This is like a players handbook/DM guide all in one.  It's a beefy book.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Really good movie.  Realistic special effects and believable characters.  The most evil witch I think I've ever seen.  And the girl from the twilight movies made a great snow white!  It was definitely worth watching.

0618918248|1.0|Frustrated. That is how I felt trying to read this book. Spirituality is important to me and I like to read about all different paths. I think there is so much out there to learn if only you are willing to have an open mind. This includes learning from atheists as well. Their logical critical thinking is something I can appreciate. When I was younger and trying to throw off the repressive religion on my childhood free thinkers helped me figure out what I believed. Eventually after trying on atheism I learned it was not my path.<br /><br />For a long time I have wanted to read Richard Dawkins work. They did not have \\"The Selfish Gene\\" on the shelves the day I hit the library but they did have \\"The God Delusion\\". Being an opened minded person who loves to read about other paths I thought, \\"Sure I'll try this one!\\" There were sometimes I wanted to throw this book at the wall. I found I could only read a few pages at a time because I just got so frustrated. I had heard that Dawkins was hmm, rough around the edges. In this book he really came across as an arrogant jerk. He says early on in this book that he is looking to change minds. There is no way he stood any chance of changing my mind coming across the way he did. Add to this the fact that it seemed to me he kept repeating himself over and over. There is a mean spiritedness that infuses everything he says. There is an attitude that anyone who disagrees with him is stupid. I read as much of the book as I could stomach. I almost never quit on a book. It is just one of those things. I want to finish no matter what.  I want to know how it ends. In this case I could care less.<br /><br />I will say that there was some good content there. I learned some things about people that I did not know. Darwin and others like him. Mostly historical things. Some of these people and ideas I will seek out to read more about. It will be good to do that without Dawkins harsh commentary running in the background.<br /><br />Now on to less combative reading!<br /><br />D

B0061IMJ2W|4.0|Great horror program love this and have enjoyed the concept the characters and the make up just outstanding dark storyline and not suitable for young children
B009NQKPUW|1.0|In a word, dumb.<br /><br />Writing at a 13 year old level, incredibly inappropriate casting, marginal premise.  I would have expected better from Scott, who did such a great job with the initial Alien.<br /><br />Somewhere around the third sequel, the look and feel changed from believable sci-fi to MTV.  This continues the trend with hip-hop dudes and dudettes, replete with tats, attitude and street language, posing as accomplished professionals.  Of course we have to have a baddy corporate babe, concerned only with profits - no modern 'sci-fi' is replete without that.<br /><br />Somewhere, Ridley forgot about story and just went for a minimally connected sequence of effects, punctuated by \\"Oh-my-gods\\" and other shouts of incredulity.<br /><br />Diehard fans (like me) will see it at least once.  Not twice, I don't think.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game can let you have that little adventure you have been only dreaming of having. Haven't you always wanted to be chased to thedeath by something? Well here's your chance. Bad thing is.that it is glitchy on the Kindle Fire.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. Your heart really goes out to August and his family.  It's a good book to encourage antibullying, anti discrimination, character, and sympathy. Parents should read this book with their middle schoolers.
B007TK77QE|3.0|This book is well written and the characters are quite believable. Unfortunate, none of the characters are pleasant or likable which makes the book rather dour.

1595825045|5.0|This is definitely one of the best art books I own so far. Every animator should own this book. I definitely learned on how to think like an animator as well as learn about the animated series.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Not even close to the game. There is no way to touch on what the game was about so not to offend anyone or any country. But as far as the plot goes, and acting, special effects it was a very enjoyable action packed movie.<br />I'm looking forward to a sequel. It should be as enjoyable.

B008NAFU9A|5.0|Ophelia's Journey is part of The Forever Girl Journals. This time we get to know Ophelia. She works for a family in a time where conjectures and suspicion could make anyone persecuted. A fateful day, an ouroboros mark formed on her neck, causing the change of events that will transform her forever.<br /><br />The novella continuous with the paranormal mythic world of beings created in Sophia's Journey. Here we see Ophelia becoming part of this world of creatures as a Cruor. Story is engaging and it's notable the use of descriptions to heighten the narrative. Slow story that gets dynamism once the MC embraced her new nature. Takes a little time to get use to Ophelia's accent, but it is not a big drawback.<br /><br />Find the ending rushed. Felt I wanted to know more about the characters. Who knows, maybe we will see more of them in Hamilton's future projects.<br /><br />The cover: gorgeous, mysterious, great colors<br /><br />Have you read this novella?  What is your favorite character?  Mine is the Queen, she is an enigmatic character.<br /><br />What's yours?<br /><br />Thanks to the author for providing this copy.  It was used for review purposes.  This novella was reviewed according to its merits.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Very disappointing.  Too many characters, jumps around, just not enjoyable.  I was expecting better from JK Rowling but think she needs to stick to the world of wizardry.  This has been a painful read but I forced myself to finish it!  I do not recommend this book--unless you want to be bored to bits!
B0095R64AO|3.0|The quality for instant was good. The movie, even though it had some of my fave actors, Jason from HIMYM, Emily from The Queen, etc, the movie dragged

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I thought this was a great addition to the franchise.  I'm also very happy that there are still two more movies to come in this latest trilogy.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was the second book I've read by Gillian Flynn (\\"Gone Girl\\" was the first).  I really enjoyed the story overall.  I like Flynn's style of writing from several points of view and flashing from the past to the present.  All of the characters were well-developed and interesting.  The story itself was very dark and a bit gory (hence the title!).  Beware if you read before bed!  It was hard to put down, and I was dying to know the ending!  I would definitely read another one of her books, she's an excellent writer!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Anthony Hopkins' meticulous, detail oriented villain is so clever that you're rooting for him most of the movie. Ryan Gosling is the definite underdog, custom picked by the antagonist for his hubris.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Does exactly what it claims ... A couple *very* minor things I don't like, but by far the best app hands down for creating ambient sounds. Great selection, excellent volume control. HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|At firsr I was put off by the country blues sound of this album. But give Diana Krall credit for exploring new terrain instead of settling into a by the numbers format the way so many performers do.<br />Like the photos, she does look better in person.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Dont get me wrong, the movie itself is great. It's just that the DVD copy skips a scene. Like it stops and skips the scene. Malfunction. My sister, who got it from a retailer said the same thing on the same scene. (it's when black widow is with Bruce banner and he turns into Hulk for the first time in the movie)
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Fun game!  Can't stop playing. enough to keep the interest up in finding clues one by one.  Love the hidden objects in between.
B001URVSPS|5.0|Very pleased with John Legend's debut album \\"Get Lifted\\"! He has a great voice, he's a great pianist, and he is quite relatable. Love the tracks featuring Kanye West and Snoop Dogg but \\"Used to Love U\\" is my all-time favorite track by John Legend.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|First off a Kiss fan since I first heard Love Gun album as a kid 35 yrs ago.. like many of u I have every album before and since and have the highest respect for what Paul,Gene,Ace,and Peter all started and the magic of kiss they launched...I want to add I continue to support n purchase releases from Ace and Peter and remain loyal to them...But first and foremost im a fan of Kiss..and I consider a band a team..and when team has a player who chooses to play elsewhere or decides its time to slow down or have other interests and dreams like playing solo or on their own practice schedule...they can be replaced with new players..To me Hatezilla is my term for the folks that drop 1 star for this album not because they have listened to it but because they want kiss to fail with Eric and Tommy in ace and Peter's make up..if u honestly bought this album and somehow amazingly truly find it sucks then...I respect you..but not the Hatezilla!!  So many of u claim to no longer watch their concerts or buy the new music...I for one want to say Tommy has at many of the shows played his solos behind his back...not an Ace characteristic...cowriting 9 out,12 tracks on stunning new cd also is not an Ace trait..No kiss album has Ace wrote 9 tracks except for solo album.  Again just making a point not disrespectful to Ace..I love the guy. Eric twirls his drums and stands up a lot more than Peter did and is a great combo of Criss' drumrolls and Carr's power and to me a great kiss drummer. Please give monster an unbiased try and you may find again the type of album that made you love Kiss in the first place.  It's Klassic Kiss and an amazing effort!!
B007V65R54|5.0|As a math educator who wishes people understood statistics better, this is a great layperson's book that treats the topic with the respect due, but is still readable without being intimidating for those without a strong background. It addresses the ideas that people need to understand that underlie statistical predictions and, particularly, the ways things can go wrong. Highly recommend.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is very thought provoking, and provides many interesting facts and statistics about people we commonly think of as \\"outliers\\". If you are trying to sit down for 30 minutes and read a book, you may have some trouble holding to that because you will want to read more.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book is a fast and easy read.  Mark is a pretty good storyteller, the book traces Mark's development through the Seal teams up to the serendipitous occasion where he is at the right place at the right time to be selected for the historic mission to kill Bin Laden. His story is not a pound-your-chest action hero type of story.  His deliberate, \\"team\\" not \\"I\\" approach exemplifies our soldiers and particularly those in Special Operations.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|We read this book for our last book club. We haven't met yet, but I am hearing that all of the girls liked it a lot.I found Mitch Albom to be a terrific writer and am looking forward to reading his works in the future.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really loved the first book in this series and was looking forward to this one. Found it to be disappointing. There was too much nonsense, Eva was always doing something stupid or being jealous. I also didn't like all the period talk, bloating, sickness, trying to throw the reader off as if she really was pregnant. Gideon was way too secretive and I'm not sure how the ending fit together with the rest of the story. I think the Nathan storyline could have been awesome if that character was expanded. I will read the next book and I hope it has more to their relationship and deepens our love for the characters.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It is a well put together movie if young seen all the setup movies I would recommend this movie for anybody to see
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app every day, often many times a day.  I especially like the large area radar map showing the entire region.  It easily slides to show adjoining areas. The weather alerts are also very helpful, clear and understandable. This app belongs in the essential tool box for every smart device user.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My daughter (10 yo) loves the series, she is very interest about Greek God's history.....loved the book, waiting for the next one
B007THA4FI|5.0|I really enjoyed The Casual Vacancy. Ms. Rowling is a master at defining her characters. One really gets a feeling of living in a small village and how everyone's lives  are intertwined. There are far reaching consequences for everyone's actions.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Digna secuela... No puedes dejar de leerlo.  Les recomiendo empezar a leerlo el fin de semana . Ojalá y el último libro sea igual de bueno.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is a good read as are all of Child's books, but I did not enjoy it as much as the others.  At times it was too slow, drawn out.  The ending was fast and a bit improbable.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Challenging and addictive at first. Once you get so far in the game the timer stops replenishing coins and the coins are almost endless.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|This watch is big and beautiful well worth the money. Its my favorite watch and i collect them, you wont be disappionted. Delivery was fast i would buy again !!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game some puzzles are extremely easy while others are quite hard. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys puzzles.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I got this as a faotd, but it is definitely worth a dollar! The basic concept is simple (snip spider web strands to free bugs before the spiders catch them), but made tantalizingly difficult by the extra abilities some spiders have and the extra tools you can use. For many levels there's more than one way to pass, but you get stars for efficiency. The game logic is good (although it occasionally lags on my iconia), the music is good, it's quite addictive. The only thing that would make it even better would be if instead of getting a full walk through as a hint you could have the option to try to finish it yourself after each step of the hint.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and I am looking forward to the new season.  Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, if you're looking for something other than crime dramas, sitcoms or \\"honey boo boo\\" reality swill, AHS is a nice change of pace.  It kept me interested throughout and I appreciated the dark humor and irony, as well as the hint of social commentary.  One caveat, as with any of the more successful FX TV series, this is loaded with coarse language and gritty, disconcerting scenes.  If you are familiar with or watch FX's  SOA and Justified, and/or AMC's Breaking Bad and Walking Dead, then you know exactly what I mean.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is cooooollll. I really enjoy it even though I just started playing it. ive always wanted to play a game like this and I finally found what ive been looking for.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|I received it quickly . All dvds work fine. One of the corners was a little folded but otherwise it is in perfect condition .
B007THA4FI|3.0|It is difficult for me to review this book.  I never cease to be amazed at Rowling's talent.  Theme and Characters were very complex.  My problem was that I could never really get into it.  I finished the book, but I could have easily quit at any point and put it back on the shelf. There were no characters in the book that I liked or respected.  For me it was just sort of \\"blah\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|loved this book almost as much as the first. cant wait for the movie tobring to life the images created in thisbook. what a wonderful series...time to read the ybird!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game. The graphics are creative and engaging and the challenges make it more fun as you progress. I will need to check out the other games by Playrix. Hope they're as good as Atlntis.
B0086DBE62|2.0|Girlfriend wanted to watch it and since there was nothing else on TV, or Netflicks or Huluplus we rented this movie.  I fell asleep during parts of the movie.  Not a fan of Julia Roberts.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|enjoyed the free version. sea life in tank are colorful and fun to look at.<br /> only complaint i have is game pieces are small.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|Predictable, no surprises, little boring, would not recommed to anyone unless they were bored and you could rent it for a dollar.
B00932A2MC|5.0|Action was great and the plot was way better then i figure it would be and was also good for a few good laughs
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this after reading \\"50 Shades\\" and enjoyed it much more. I liked that there was more of a story line.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very consuming; did not want to put it down. keeps you wondering what's going to happen next, and want to know more. Definitely going to have to read the next two books of the trilogy.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This CD is bangin'. I love the songs. I think the melodies are killer and catchy. He is part of such a good songwriting team (The Smeezingtons). His voice is very pleasant and is good enough for some decent belting. The music is very pleasant also and just makes you want to relax mostly. I like all the songs a lot but my top three in order are probably \\"Just The Way You Are\\" (it never gets old), \\"Talking To The Moon\\" and either \\"Grenade\\" or \\"Count On Me\\". I just love this CD to death. I docked some points because the album at 10 tracks is simply over before I want it to be. Next album has to be at the very least 12 tracks for me to be happy. It wouldn't hurt if he occasionally broke away from his writing team and penned 2 or 3 tracks by himself too. However, I would still buy it regardless. I love Bruno!!!<br /><br />4.6 stars.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Like all harry Bosh's character he takes you there with him. I can not tell you how I escape from my troubles when I read all of Michael Connlley
B008K93302|5.0|the video player pro was a great investment.  i really love it because i can take some of my favorit shows with me where ever i have to go.  plus i can put some of my kids favorite shows up there to so that they can watch something that they like.  i wish that i had more memory space to put things in there.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|It was a fast paced book with new twists and refreshing characters - always surprising with a touch of humor as well!
B000FA5STS|4.0|The story has many twists and turns, and possibilities that will keep your interest high, work you in trying to figure out whichcharacter is the one who is key to the surrounding plot.  I read a lot of authors of books of this nature, and most of themare military in nature, this book held my interest untill the end, and I intend to read more of this authors work.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|before, if I ever heard someone say green day, i would think \\"ugh, another boy band\\", but boy was I wrong!<br />This album made me realize that they are a truely unique band, this album may not be an \\"American Idiot\\"  but it is a must hear and must have. cant wait for ¡Dos!
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I loved this book. It helped me understand addiction in relation to someone close to me. Even though it left me feeling a bit sad, it also gave me hope that all is not lost and anything is possible.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book gets 5 stars for me. It was delicious as was the one before it. This series is steamy and keeps you wanting to read more. Can't wait until the next one comes out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great because you can set it to remind you to read every day. It also gives you a passage and suggested reading that relates to that passage. You can also have it on several devices and it keeps track from one to another. Highly recommend!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a Reacher fan. But the last two books have put me to sleep. Not enough depth in the story. Lee Child needs to think up some better stories. Plus Reacher used to be a better hero.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Worst most abrupt, unfulfilling ending ever. Terrible writing: Weak imagery. Repetitive words. More difficult diction seems forced.  The whole story was too contrived. Just terribly stupid. Try Something Borrowed by Emily Giffin for a much sexier romance novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. Allows me to see what others like and gives me great ideas about household projects and crafts.
B0091VGAXK|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says, this movie rocked! Sure, it was a bit cheesy at times, but entertaining and fun! That being said, my husband and son would not like it because they don't  like musicals and they cannot relate to the 80's music genre like me.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great series full of twists and big reveals. Very current and interesting to watch. Acting is just stellar. This had me captivaed from first episode to last. Great television the best drama on tv right now.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoy this author's writing.  She develops the characters well and keeps you intrigued.  This story was darker than I normally like to read.  With the title, \\"Dark Places\\", I knew what I was getting into.  I had to finish the book though!  I had to find out what really happened!  However, at the end I truly visualized the murders and all the scenes she described before.  It left me feeling dark and a little bit like I shouldn't have read it. Now, I have all those thoughts in my mind.  Even with that said, I would read another book by this author.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It's another amazing novel from Riordan accompanied by another MAJOR cliffhanger ending!!! Waiting until next year's next installment is going to be difficult.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|The album is upbeat, has several songs that are fast enough to be a workout song, and has a great feel overall. I love this album and really enjoy the fact that the songs have guest singers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best of the 3 Fifty Shades books.  I couldn't put it down!!!!  Really enjoyed reading it and just stepping out of my world for awhile.  It was nice to just put the stresses of the day aside and read something for fun!!!!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My son loves the movie, but the digital copy does not work and no one seems to be able to give me a working code for it.
B009K0OTVM|5.0|This show has been nicely put together.  Just when you think it's going to be okay something else happens.  We love watching the season unfold.  There is so much betrayal; it's hard to even see half of it coming.  The plot is about a young woman who wants revenge for the atrocities that were made against her father.  She wants nothing more than revenge.  Sometimes she has a heart but that just gets in the way.  The other characters are mostly just awful people getting what they deserve.  She is good!  Her best friend is quirky and has a great character as well.
B0041045WE|4.0|Slayer's 2009 release World Painted Blood shows the band aging well. You'll find much of what you love about Slayer on the album: lightning fast riffing, screaming leads, blast beats... you get the drill. Its a solid release by a band that has a very strong, consistently heavy discography. WPB has some great highlights: Title track, Psychopathy Red, Hate Worldwide, Snuff, but also has some filler: Playing with dolls, Not of this god, a few more... WPB finds the band experimenting with new songwriting/performing techniques (for them) such as SINGING (Beauty Through Order) with overall good results and without straying too far from their winning thrash formula. As a longtime Slayer fan, I do put this one on and listen to it. It's a good record, but a bit unfocused sounding overall. It is missing some of the obvious occult themes that the band is famous for. Sure, we have some classic Slayer religious bashing (Not Of This god) but it is not particularly convincing. It is almost as if they put it on the album because they feel obligated...<br />WPB comes directly after 2006's Christ Illusion, an excellent album that links religion and war and shows much more consistency. When Araya yells \\"Ive made my choice... 666!\\" You fell the need to yell it with him... not so on World Painted Blood.<br />Christ Illusion is a much more focused and passionate release compared to World Painted Blood. Better songs make a better record.<br /><br />The vinyl pressing is beautifully done. Wonderful sonics, excellent printing and design that is carried through even to the blood soaked labels on the record. It is the first release in a while not to feature band photography. Comparing the original release with the version contained in the Vinyl Conflict box set is very minimal as they did such a good job with the initial release. The box set version has a litho wrapped cover while the sound has slightly higher levels. Very close in sound.<br /><br />Overall, World Painted Blood is a very goodSlayer album. Certainly not their best, but the band is aging well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great Book! I never wanted to put it down. It kept my interest and gave me some great ideas for my Love Life..
B007THA4FI|1.0|I HAD TO QUIT READING THIS AS IT SEEMED TO BE REPITIOUS  I REALLY LOVED J.K.ROWLINGS OTHER SERIES AND I KNEW IT WAS A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FOR THIS BOOK.  I WISH SHE WOULD GO BACK TO WHERE HER REAL TALENTS LIE.. I WILL WATCH FOR HER NEXT BOOK...
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good fast passed book<br /> with alot of action if you like this series you should read the rest of the books in the series
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This was just plain dumb.  I can't figure out what it was supposed to be a vehicle for.  Music of the times?  Not even arranged well.  Dance?  Nope.  Acting? Certainly not. Plot line?  Never got off of the written on a napkin phase.
0061245097|5.0|Once I read the first book I immediately tore through the next ones in the series, ignoring all of my responsibilities as I did. After reading this book I was just surprised that it could in fact get better. I was heart broken when Cat left Bones and this book picked right up where the last one left me. I found it highly entertaining, especially the fight between Cat and Annette and of course the notorious sex scene. This series makes you live through these characters and you truly feel something for them, you become invested which I believe is what a great writer is supposed to do. This is yet another great book from Frost.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have found this to be a reasonably decent weather app. I downloaded it after the Weather Channel app stopped working. I haven't experienced any of the problems that other reviewers have described.
B007THA4FI|2.0|J.K. Rowling needs to stick with her Harry Potter books.  I did not enjoy this one at all.  She does not seem to have a good plot and I lost interest about 1/4 way through the book.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|This show is exciting, heart wrenching and so well written. I hate that I have to wait to see season 2 until it comes on Amazon!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. The drama was over the top and left me wanting more.
B000FC12C8|5.0|Teaches the investor to look at the purchase of investments the same way we would the purchase of other things we buy.  We look for the best price on something that we want.  The book helped me to look at investment purchases from a business perspective and searching for value for my purchasing dollar.  Now I can look for high value companies and seek to get them at bargain prices.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I first saw this book at my school book fair. Since I hadn't yet become a true Riordan fan, I'm ashamed to say I didn't snatch it up immediately.  When I did, however, I loved it. This book manages to be touching and thought-provoking, but also packed with humor and action. I'm not going to describe the book here, so suffice it to say: buy it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Works great as an alternative to MS Office and with it. It's made it so I can open my projects and work on the on the go. Glad I found it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this game all the time when husband is watching something on the tv i don't care to watch LOL  i can sit in the room with him but can be happy playing my game too.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The experience was professional from start to finish. I received item as expected. The item was in top shape. I didn't have a bad experience.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!  Can't wait for the next one.  Wonder how it all will end. So many secrets yet to be revealed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|the game is really fun and the graphics are great ... also you only pay if you're to impatient to wait for things
0316228532|4.0|One thing JK Rowling does well is characters, and here is a great example. When the Harry Potter series finished it left me wanting more mature fantasy - as the series had become book after book. Just compare the first one to the last! But even though this book doesn't fulfil those desires, it's still a great read and gives us a very absorbing insight into the more remarkable parts of a seemingly normal community, one any one of us could inhabit now! For those of you ready for the next step in Fantasy, and thus left wanting by this, I would suggest China Miéville, Walter Moers or the little known J. Alastair Nash.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345459407 Perdido Street Station]]<br />[[ASIN:1585679364 Rumo: And His Miraculous Adventures]]<br />[[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was another great book, couldn't hardly put it down. Absolutely loved the whole trilogy, and ended up buying all the books.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is very helpfull. It leads us to understand who we really are and why there is noting to be afraid of. My life has taken a big leap towards joyfullness since i've read it. For sure I will read it again because the feeling is so wonderfull while reading. This book is one of those that will change the world in a much more positive way. The way off seeing things cannot stay the same after its reading simply and just as Waine Dyer said \\"When we change the way we look at things then the things the we look at change.\\" Thanks to Annita and also thanks to Wayne and Eckhart Tolle and others...<br />Claude
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I had just fell in love with their first album, Sigh No More when I decided to buy this album too. I think this album is even better. Its one of those albums where you can listen to it from the first to last song over and over. Every single song on this record is amazing. I would definitely recommend it even if you are just getting into Mumford & Sons!
0316044938|4.0|I thought the Lovely Bones was a great read, especially at Halloween time. I mean, the book is narrated by a 14 year old ghost so it's very fitting for fall.<br /><br />I loved the voice of the main character, Susie Salmon.I thought her voice was believable and mesmerizing. Sebold is great at eschewing clich&eacute;, which I truly appreciate. I found her writing at times very poetic and a little blurry around the edges. I like that.<br /><br />The one thing I found a little confusing was the way the 3rd person omniscient writing kind of floated around very fluidly. At times I had to remind myself whose voice I was reading.<br /><br />But overall I loved the point of view of this book, that heaven is what you want it to be, and that the ghosts can watch what is going on down here on earth.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game playing it all the time I would definietly recommend it to every one can not stop playing it. ok have yo get back to the game
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I think that you should give more than 60 heart coins. You should get one for each level you pass instead of having to buy them to purchase a helper. other than that its really fun.
B00136NVH4|5.0|Meatloaf is great!!!  This album really rocks it!!  He has such a beautiful voice, no matter if the song is hard rock or soft rock.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Received purchased item extremely fast. Very pleased by that. The series DVD was in excellant condition.  We have been enjoying watching it. Can't wait to purchase next season as well.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Me and my wife enjoyed this movie.  Lots of action and special effects.  Definitely a movie that you want to own in blu-ray not just DVD!<br /><br />Worth the upgrade price for sure!
B007THA4FI|1.0|In an attempt to be\\"adult\\" in this new endeavor,the author created a totally unspeaking cast of characters. No redeeming values!<br />A waste of time,leaving a thoroughly bad taste!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the whole series. This is a series that I could easily read over and over again. Can't wait for Suzanne Collins to write more books.
0316228532|2.0|Like all the other Harry Potter fans, I pre-ordered this book and anticipated reading it. Sadly when it arrived and I started reading, I waited page by page to see when any event, character or setting would call out to me to make me read on. There was none. The characters were all flawed but uninspiring. At best, this novel is a documentary of a dysfunctional small town. The author was right when she said that her success with the HP books afforded her to write a novel the critics may not like.  I would say with good reason! such a disappointing book from a talented author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Gray 2\\". I love this book. It was so good that I couldn't put it down. Because of what I heard about the contents, I decided I was not going to read it. I am so happy that I changed my mind. \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"
B005AERS74|5.0|I've written longer reviews for Maroon 5's other CD's but for this CD... only one thing needs to be said... This CD makes you want to put your hands all over (just like the name of the CD) soooo if you want that kind of music (both good in the car and in house *wink wink) BUY THIS! :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book.  It was so good that I couldn't put it down.  Because of what I heard about the contents, I decided I was not going to read it.  I am so happy that I changed my mind.  \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"
B008B1VYP0|3.0|I've been listening to Maroon 5 since they first came out. I like music that is on the top 40 lists but become bored of it after awhile so I normally only buy CD's or singles from alternative bands or people you just don't hear on the radio that often. Since Maroon 5 has always had good stuff AND I was bored at work with nothing to listen to, I bought this CD. The songs on this that are singles from the radio are just as good as they are on the radio; however, the other songs are just ok. I'm a little disappointed Maroon 5... you guys need to go back to your roots. Don't get me wrong though, the songs aren't bad for cranking music in the car with the top down or to have background noise at work or the gym. This is music I would have expected from any other band or singer, NOT Maroon 5. There are a few hidden jems on here but not many.
0547564651|4.0|This is a well written, readable critique on American education especially as it pertains to inner city youths. All the other reviews have indicated what this book is about. Mr. Tough writes that IQ is not the only thing that matters in a child's success. Sadly so many of the kids start school with problems as a result of their upbringing. And I agree with him that teachers are important and can make a difference but for many of these kids they simply are lost in the system before they even start. His solution is to teach character traits. Easier said then done. Mr. Tough tries to leave politics out of it - seems he doesn't want to offend readers or get side tracked. Since crime, drugs, abuse is so pervasive in these kid's lives I just don't see how one can leave out the moral dimension.  One thing I didn't get is why he spent so much effort writing about a chess team. Sure, chess requires disciplined thinking and practice but he really thinks this is something that can impact these kids? Implicit also is that high schools students should attend college. Here I agree with Charles Murray - not every kid needs a college education to be successful.<br /><br />Paul Tough is to be credited for writing about such a difficult problem. I think his solutions deserve consideration. His book is interesting and enjoyable to read. It contains positive stories about real people. And I hope his views are tried on a large scale and that they are successful.

Even if you don't want to buy the whole CD, make sure you download \\"Kiwi\\"!!!! GREAT bedroom song... wink wink
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|the controls are bad and it is difficult. a big stinky fart from my point of view.PIECE OF DINOSAURIC POOP.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|I initially watched this movie in my late 20s. as a 40 yr old woman now I watched it & it had a profound effect on me. the acting is Marcellus & the story is heart warming sexy & intriguing. A MUST SEE!!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Maroon 5 does it again. What outstanding music It is over the top as much of their music is. I was never a Maroon 5 when they started however; I have become a major fan. I hope they continued their endeavor to be one of the best of the best. Keep up the great music<br /><br />Ironpwr
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Really good book! Was looking for something similar to the 50 Shades trilogy and this was definitely it. Can't wait for the final book to be out!!
B009CREQJS|4.0|I've been a Green Day fan for about 15 years, I can say that this album is definitely 'old school' Green Day.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album is incredible... There have been very few albums that at first listen I've been blown away by, and it getting better and better with more listens. Fantastic!
B007MB5OCE|1.0|Sorry but the worst thing you could say is that this is not unlike Forest Gump, Forest Gump was the worst book I have ever read. This is just hundreds of pages of vignettes.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|good fun for all. the planing that went into this game is carefully designed. I'm a dad of four my wife and all the kids play this game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So awesome to be able to create my own sound combinations. I make up a different  one almost every night.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Gideon is finally more developed - although their relationship does seem to go from 0-60mph. The sex scenes are hot and do not disappoint. Looking forward to the next one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was a book I had a hard time putting down. It was a fascinating study of who people appear to be and who they really are. The way you want others to see you is often the way you want to be yourself - even if your facade is a lie. If you showed the one you love your true self - would they still love you?<br /><br />A wonderful mystery of twists and turns and an interesting look inside a marriage.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So I reread the first book and then went right into book two. What a difference, Ms.Day wrote the second book and it was seamless. Book one flowed into book two with ease. There story line had a kick to it and the love scenes were very HOT. Ms. Day did not disappoint at all. Can't wait for the the final book in the trilogy.. I would love it earlier to have as a present and to send to my friends as gifts. WOW what a game changer in the book and I love the soft loving ending. Thanks for the hope for a good love story and hot love scenes can be all in one... (loved the car ride)
B000Q9ISSQ|3.0|I enjoyed A Walk in the Woods more.  I'm a hiker.  I also thought that it was funnier.  I would recommend a Walk in the Woods to anyone.
0307730697|5.0|I recommended this book to a friend without having read it, because of all the 5 star reviews that it has received. He promptly went out and ordered it. A few days later I get a message from him saying that he couldn't put it down, that this guy (Adam) was incredible. So I drove the round trip 80km to go borrow it from him.<br /><br />Despite the unbelievable stumbling blocks that were put in his path, Adam, never said \\"I can't\\"...He always said \\"I got it,\\" then he went out and \\"did it.\\" I loved the way he was so humble in it all, when he had every reason to strut his stuff, and puff his chest out. Most of all I loved the way he was described as a fun and goofy dad. Having a boy and a girl the same age as his children really hit home for me. Even knowing how it all ends I was still, tearing up reading the last part of the book. I finished this book, on a graveyard shift at work (shhh, don't tell my boss!), and had a hard time sleeping as I kept thinking about this book, about Adam, Kelley, Nathan, and Savannah, what they're going through now. Fearless, has moved me in ways I thought that weren't possible, all the small problems in my life pale in comparison to what Adam Brown, (as well as his family) went through.<br /><br />The friend whom I borrowed this book from, made a comment; \\"If DEVGRU are the top 1% of the SEALS, what the heck was Adam Brown?\\" Well, Adam Brown was the top 1% of the top 1%, in his professional, personal and spiritual life; he was Fearless!  (Actually, I believe only the top 1% even get screened to try out for DEVGRU!)<br /><br />God Bless the Brown family, know that Adam's sacrifice has touched and inspired this man!<br /><br />\\"I GOT IT!\\"
B0015DROBO|5.0|Fast -paced, exciting, must-read  novel. A real page-turner worthy of its stellar reviews. Cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait until the next one comes out! Sylvia has an awesome writing style that I really enjoy! Write more please!
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Enjoyed reading the next stage of this series, some situations in this novel were lacking a little but still an good  read
B0098XY5VK|3.0|I love this game but the full version isn't available on the kindle. Such a waist of time.  How could this company not make sure they make money on this? I'm gonna continue to check for full version.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Love the DVD and CD's. it's a must have for all Michael Jackson fans!!!! Love seeing him in concert. He would have done do much more!!!
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I review THE MOVIE here because Amazon does not have a good place to list newly released films. Yet, I go to Amazon to find good product reviews that I trust. Perhaps this movie review might be exposed and helpful to people considering the movie, if it doesn't get too lost among the many excellent book reviews. We were fortunate to attend a premiere before the film's Oct 26 release.<br /><br />Directors, Andy and Lana Wachowski (THE MATRIX) and Tom Tykwer (RUN, LOLA RUN), collaborate to bring David Mitchell's science fiction, fantasy book by the same name to film. The complex story line begins time fragmentedly in this 164-minute venture, much like the beginning of THE MATRIX as it slowly weaves six seemingly disparate stories together. The action is reminiscent of RUN, LOLA RUN. The directors demonstrate respect for the audience's intelligence; they do not stop to pander to those, like myself, who have not read the book. Instead they skillfully allows us to piece things together, slowly towards convergence until POW, you are hooked. (Tip: Search Wikipedia by title for excellent storyline details on both the book and movie, which I intentionally omit.) For me, the connection was visual. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and others in this excellent cast play different roles in different storylines. A celestial birthmark signals the main character's progression through time. The makeup is so good that our audience could not pick out all the characters of each cast member before they are shown in the credits at the end.<br /><br />We sense the interconnectedness, the implications of reincarnation and time folding on itself, as we began to question what is humanity, what is the nature and power of our predatory behavior and the hierarchy we impose, what is the morality of using technology to enslave, what is our purpose? This is a political, action morality play.<br /><br />Memorable lines, no matter how seemingly trite in reflection, push the story forward. The language is poetry. Without planning or forethought, I found myself scratching shorter favorites down on the inside my poor popcorn bag. You are sure to list your own and daresay academics will too. A popcorn bag in a dark theatre is a poor repository, please forgive my paraphrasing:<br /><br />Our lives are not our own, from womb to tomb, we are bound to each other.<br />A half read book is a half finished love affair.<br />Travel far enough, you meet yourself.<br />Unlimited power in hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.<br />The meek are meat, the strong do eat.<br />In an individual, selfishness uglifies the soul; for the human species, selfishness is extinction.<br />Truth is singular, it's versions mistruths.<br />We must all fight, and if necessary die, to teach people the truth.<br />They feed us to ourselves. (Look for the Soylent Green joke)<br />Love will outlive death.<br />Death is...passing through an open door,...heaven...walking into a new room.<br /><br />Like a morality play, we see and fear the devil. As the epic unfolds we realize that the devil is a mirror into the ugliness, distrust and avarice in ourselves. When we yield, we face consequences in the lives of those around us and in new lives. The multiple roles, like the backward and forward of the storyline, show the characters' connectivity and the linkage between our own lives and our actions. In the Sonmi futuristic, dystopian story the totalitarian state agent who is holographically taping Sonmi's final interview before execution, asks why she risked her life for rebellion; he goes on to say that (her) actions are no more than a drop of water in a limitless ocean. She responds, what is an ocean but a multitude of drops.<br /><br />CLOUD ATLAS challenges us to want better, to be better, to think better. CLOUD ATLAS will become a cult classic and will catapult the directors from curiosity into this generation's top directors to watch. It is among my Top 4 best movies in 2012 (of which I assume, two yet to be released, will be worthy) and sure to be nominated for several Oscars including Directing, Acting, Makeup, Writing Adapted from a Screenplay and Cinematography. And I further predict it will hands down win The Academy Award for Film Editing. Mitchell's novel won the British Book 2005 Literary Fiction Award and was a nominee for the Booker and science fiction's Nebula and Arthur C Clarke awards. This is a movie you will want to see first in a theatre for the large format and then own to glean the nuances. Go and enjoy!<br /><br />It is hard to imagine how the directors could have done any better with material so complex as this. Cloud Atlas is inspired. Only the key musical composition did not keep pace. Parents because of the numerous throat cuttings and violence be warned this movie is not appropriate for children.o yet to be released, will be worthy) and sure to be nominated for several Oscars including Directing, Acting, Makeup, Writing Adapted from a Screenplay and Cinematography.

B009SJ3LHI|5.0|Great! A1 very funny. Johnny Depp is very hilllarious. i would recommend this to everyone to watch. Glad I bought it from Amazon.com.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Interesting quick little read that provides the perspective that it's okay not to reinvent the wheel every time. Plus, it's little so you can refer back to it. Also graphically cool so it's enjoyable to have. I read it first on Kindle then bought it when I saw it in the store.
B006T3RM08|4.0|I bought this in anticipation of being able to order the new Mac Mini.  So I configured it to use on my Windows 7 PC, and I have no complaints.  The bottom right corner acts like a right click all other parts act like a left click.  I am able to use two fingers to scroll up and down on a Windows screen.  The Clique looks great and I have no problems using the wireless Apple keyboard and the Wireless Trackpad together on a Windows 7 PC as I eagerly await the new Mac Mini. I would give a 5 except it is a little difficult turning on the trackpad, but it does work.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|AFter reading the wonderful reviews & for the very reasonable price I went & got the game.  It is the best gane I have ever played.  Not only for the hours of fun but also the great graphics.  It's very addicting.  I hope there'll be more.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Lots of action but predictable results. Some good humor. Needs more character development, story line and ambiguity. Like a good comic book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book and story I was hooked on bared and I couldn't put this down once I started. Can't wait for the next book of the series.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I totally enjoyed \\"Taken\\" and am looking forward to Taken 2.  I was captive to the plot and the action.  I don't always enjoy action movies, but this movie was above most action movies and I would gladly watch it again and recommend it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Compelling plot with excellent acting and fast-paced developments, this is the best show airing on TV today.  Plot points aren't dragged out, each episode is intense and keeps things moving forward.
0307593525|5.0|I have always wanted a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking. This was an affordable deal. Now I have something I have wanted for a long time. It was exactly what I was looking for.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't put it down.  It keeps you wondering what Gideon is doing. Can't wait for book 3 in December.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was good with some anticipated parts but many unexpected turns. I really love the trilogy and think that the author did a great job! I had a hard time putting the book down.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I enjoy the game however every time I close it,  I cant reopen it. unless I remove and reinstall which looses my progress.
1442355921|4.0|It was worth the reading wounding what new twist would happen next. If I did not know better I would think this story was fiction. but some times life is strainger than fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the book and i would recommend it to anybody who wants too feel the adventure in a book and people who love adventure  and conflicted books:D                                                                                       i chose a 5 star rating because i think the book is really cool and interesting and I'm sure everybody else whose read the book would agree with me am i right hahahaha:D
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva's story is so intense! My stomach was in knots the whole time I read this book! I laughed and I cried. I love the books that can make me feel the emotions of the characters and their situations.  These books are priced a little higher than I'd usually spend on a kindle book, but this is a great series and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B00474GUEA|4.0|Someone has finally worked out the formula -- this album feels like it was designed to appeal to me on every level. I have always loved low-key, melancholy [[ASIN:B0000E6XJQ electronic]] [[ASIN:B000001HYW music]], particularly when used as a soundtrack for night drives. And here we have an album with that very concept as its title! If it had come out during my wasted youth full of techno pedantry, it would have been my favourite album of all time.<br /><br />It certainly comes with impeccable post-punk credentials. \\"Healer\\" sounds like a combination of [[ASIN:B001GQXRIO Joy Division's]] \\"Isolation\\" (the drums) and \\"Autosuggestion\\" (the opening intonation), and there's a [[ASIN:B004VPAXHU Kate Bush]] cover to complete the eighties connection. It's a phenomenal cover, too, with that [[ASIN:B00002DE4H New Order-ish]] melodic pulse and that ever so lonely synth-guitar lead. And the rueful airy female vocals sing about \\"you and me,\\" and \\"did you hear about the deal they're making, oh.\\" And the pulse drives steadily forward, like a lusher \\"[[ASIN:B000FWHVKA Silent Shout]].\\" It is bliss, I tell you.<br /><br />This is exactly what that early-2000s new-wave [[ASIN:B00006BTCA revival fad]] should have sounded like -- the weepy, puffy-eyed lonely verses echoing in empty space in \\"I Want Your Love,\\" then breaking into sexy keyboards and overdubbed cooing in the chorus. A slow start in \\"Mask\\" eventually steps up into a strutting chant perfect for the dancefloor, or perhaps for driving around at 2 AM and pretending to be heroic. Close to the end of the album, \\"Let's Make This A Moment To Remember\\" is an ultra-seductive instrumental full of minor-key synths and gentle piano melodies. The deliberately sparse production makes a lot of this music seem pretty simple on first listen, but when they relax the reins a little, a surprising amount of detail emerges -- in the span of a minute, there's quite a lot going on in \\"Let's Make This A Moment,\\" layers of silk and satin and sweet murmurs.<br /><br />The concept does gets stretched thin, though. The album closer \\"Tick Of The Clock\\" is basically fifteen minutes of nothing, the barest elements of a rhythm section that sound like bits of unfinished songs. \\"Tomorrow Is So Far Away\\" might have been better without the piercing keyboards, repetitive vocals, and two-minute-long howling-wind outro; the flute-like melody should have gone in a better song. Those are just two weak spots, but together they take up over twenty minutes, over a third of the album's running time. Replacing these tracks with some of the B-sides available on the deluxe edition would have made Night Drive sound a lot more focused.<br /><br />Plus, it goes without saying, but it's probably a good idea not to pay too much attention to the lyrics. The listless, narcoleptic delivery actually does a lot to sell these flowery expressions, like \\"when I came to this world / I arrived in a storm / alone in the rain / falling out from the clouds,\\" making them sound more like half-asleep thought fragments than self-absorbed monologue. But there's just not a lot there in lines like \\"I'll be a boy / I'll be a girl / see my reflection / it's just a reflection.\\" It's all about creating a mood of luxurious, film-star loneliness, but these are the meaningless thoughts one has in the cab while being ferried between clubs, and forgets the next morning. Not exactly the tortured dancefloor introspection of [[ASIN:B001ANGPSW Hercules And Love Affair]].<br /><br />This is basically a mood piece, but it's made with impressive artistry. I don't feel like I live in its world or have any connection to it, the way I did with [[ASIN:B000003RGL Dubnobasswithmyheadman]], but it is very pretty, and I do enjoy it very much. Who knows, maybe it'll be your favourite album.
B008D1LVRY|4.0|I liked it.  My tastes are Pantera, Metallica, just about any classic rock, Judas Priest, you name it metal!  This album did it for me!  Enjoy the beginning tracks and many throughout the album.  Hellyeah pretty much sums it up!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|As a long time fan of Steven King, I was again drawn in to his story telling. Having grown up in the 60's, it was interesting and enjoyable to relive the times through the many references to life as it was back then. The creative blending of facts and fiction kept me reading late into the night. It also makes me wonder \\"what if?\\" other events in history had ended differently.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was very interesting to read about a seal's training and what their day to day lives are like, and the missions they go on and lastly the details of OBL's demise.  These men take great pride in what they do.  I appreciate the insight.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was hoping that J.K. Rowling's first book for adults did not mean profane and obscene language.  Unfortunately, that was not the case. Too bad a gifted writer like Rowling cannot take a hint from the likes of John Grisham that one can write excellent fiction without being offensive.
B0054S6N04|4.0|It was a great romantic suspense mystery, sad, but kept me on the edge of my seat. I suggest this book to anyone that wants romance and mystery together!
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|the service from amazon was as per usual excellent. the movie was the disappointment. I own other copies of this classic and this one was my least favorite although the Welles version come a close second. I passed it on to someone else and did not add it to my collection. sorry about that!!!
B006S053K8|4.0|This was my first time seeing Adventureland & I loved it. Definitely worth seeing if you're in the mood to laugh.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's fun! I enjoy playing when I need to take a fun break on the weekends. My girls like to play too.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love this app but I am confused as to why, when I go to &quot;My Profile&quot; it shows some random person there. Any advice?
B007THA4FI|2.0|I'm a big fan of J. K. Rowling and looked forward to her first adult book: not sure I'll buy another. I wasn't engaged at all until well past the first third of the book and even then I had no trouble at all putting it down. Because I didn't get caught up in the story I had trouble keeping the characters straight and this was extremely irritating. I finished the book only because it was J. K. Rowling and I thought maybe it would straighten out. It didn't.  Originally from the UK I understood the words that were uniquely British so I don't know what difference that made to readers who didn't know their meaning. I suppose because I read all the Harry Potter books that I expected a page turner with lots of action and vivid characters. This book has a small plot - a man dies leaving an empty seat on the town council that must be filled, and tells a slice of the lives of the people involved. There is no, or very slow, advancement of the \\"plot\\" and no action to speak of, although Rowling employs subjects that involve children, a cause near and dear to her heart I understand, including the dark issues of self-mutilation, rape, poverty, addiction, abuse, etc. These are all awful things that need to be addressed but I'm not sure this is the proper venue, certainly not for me, or perhaps not in the way they were presented. A more intense and suspenseful story might have worked. I struggled hard to read this book in its entirety but perhaps that is because this is not the type of book I usually read. If Rowling's future adult books run along the same vein, then she will have lost me as a reader. I don't want causes in a novel I read for entertainment. I want entertainment and I'm sorry to say this book was disappointingly boring.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|loved this book, best i have read all year! little sad at times but so well written and captivating, couldn't put it down!!
B001EJV276|5.0|Bring from the Joliet area, the movie captures the attitudes and culture of the area. Rudy is a movie that gets the whole family talking and believing in the possibilities of following a dream.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A page turner although not the best written book out there. The story is fascinating and addictive much like the relationship between the main characters. In its own way it's also quite thought provoking making you question where your hard lines are or might be.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read! Kept me on the edge - wanting to read more. Characters were likable and most intresting. Can't wait until the next book is ready as I can' hardly wait to find out what's going on with Eva and Gideon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|not only the layout, but also the inovating way of using the functions. I'll highli recommand it to my friends.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|like oblivion....I have been looking for a game like this.  Fast paced cool armorial and weapons.  I love this game
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The movie was great, but I had to turn the volume up to almost max to hear any of the dialog.  It's almost impossible to hear on my iPad or Kindle Fire.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Tired and Bored...search for new music for my iPod. I literally stumble upon this artist. I reviewed her album, and I can always tell when I like a the new artists, i get goose pimples and every track i tend to like. Emelie has managed to produce an album that is a mix of what I am use to anyway, hip hop, soul, pop rock, a little techno, R&B, drum and bass...HER VOX ARE FANTASTIC! Each song has been beautifully crafted to reflect a mix of genre in music. Her lyrics are so memorable, her songs are truly ones you will remember and will play in your head over and over again.<br />I am truly ecclectic and just giving my opinion as a fellow vocalist/musician, a lover of music and a customer. I wouldnt say I am a fan, I know what I like, and I am excited by this album, she has not produced enough music yet me to state the latter. My hope is that she will come out with another great one. Emelie is her own style, she is amazing!! She is definitely one to watch.<br /><br />Love every track and this will be in my rotation for a while.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I thought it was very good but considering just how much killing is part of the storyline, I definitely think that the movies are made to please kids, more than adults. Jennifer Lawrence was great and so was Elizabeth Banks but the rest of the acting was just okay.
0553801473|4.0|A great continuation of the story, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", but it left me hanging and did not complete the whole story.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Best Hulk movie ever made. The fight between Loki and Hulk was the best part of an already great movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the app v. the website. Just scrolling down makes the pics/images easily accessible. It updates constantly. I love it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|very fun and easy to play game. good graphics effects on this game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle hidden object games.
B0053O89WY|5.0|those guys are amazing !!!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it is a very good game it good for days that there nuthing to do and it is just fun and cool
B006UKC566|5.0|is an excellent movie !!!
0375842209|4.0|In the span of two weeks, I've read two novels set during WWII despite hating war books. I enjoyed both of them (Code Name Verity and The Book Thief) for their unique take on the genre. The Book Thief takes place in Germany as the war effort is revving up and spinning out of control.<br /><br />I appreciated Zusak's originality. Narrated by Death, The Book Thief is full of his quips and asides, which refreshes this oft recounted tale. Characters are also multi-faceted; there is no heroic German who takes in a pitiable but hopeful Jew. I'd argue that even Hitler, a man who history has been rightfully represented as 100% pure evil, manages to demonstrate complexity. In The Book Thief, actions have consequences and choices are painted with ambiguity. Zusak does not sugarcoat the truths of wartime but he does not oversell them to the point of pity porn either. Triumph and loss are intertwined because humans can never, especially in times of war, separate the good from the bad.<br /><br />I enjoyed Zusak's narrative choices as well. By choosing to narrate with Death, who benefits from near omnipresence and omniscience about the past, Zusak foreshadowed or in some cases outright exposed what was going to happen to characters. In normal circumstances, I'd expect the plot spoilers to mar my enjoyment of the novel, but in The Book Thief, it works extraordinarily well. We know the whats but not the whys, and discovering how things unfold leading up to Death's announcements is the whole fun of it.<br /><br />There is so much to analyze in this novel--the significance of colors, the facts of childhood in wartime, Zusak's style of prose itself--but what I'll remember best are two themes: the power of language and the ambiguity of humankind. Liesel, our eponymous \\"book thief\\", uses language to construct her world. Words can heal (they can make friendships; they can apologize) but they also can damage (they can start wars; they can denigrate an entire social identity). By findingthe power of language throughout the novel, Liesel becomes a moral individual. But not all of her choices, nor the choices of the many other characters, are unequivocally good. In Death's own words, he is \\"haunted by humans\\" because of their complexity of behavior, thought, and feeling. How can we be so capable of evil yet so capable of good? Countless authors have posed this question, but Zusak threads the answers (or non-answers) to this question into a broader historical and temporal fabric in a masterful way.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|is a great tv show  !!!!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|The piggies are soooo cute, and as usual the graphics are high-quality. But as a game, it's not as fun as AB.  I wish the people at Rovio would've spent the time to update the \\"coming soon\\" episode of AB Seasons or Space instead of making this new variation on the game.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|i have a problem with one of the case, it is broke at the front, what can i do with these stuff ?????
B00280LYHS|5.0|The book was wonderful. But then again i really enjoyed the series. I plan on reading it again. It was a great price too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game in a long time just like being in the arcade when i was younger just wish u got more coins to start with bc u go thru them fast
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Would read it again!! couldnt put the book down! liked this one better than the first! cant wait til the next one is out
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus is a dark, mysterious, and completely engaging series. The characters are truly believeable and courageous. Their existence in a post-nuclear war is fragile at best and their future is uncertain. This is a tremendous undertaking and I don't want this series to end. Wool could easily become the benchmark for Science Fiction. Well Done!
034580404X|5.0|The books came to me in less time than expected. I was very pleased with my order.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to order on line.
B003PVPXOE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" being a fan of William Holden.  It's dramatic in black and white but for its time, surely quite a cinematic achievement.<br />I made sure to also watch how it was made, who was chosen to act in it, etc. and definitely felt privileged to be educated on the topics.
B009KUANWG|5.0|The intro song from Casino Royale was good but this tops every Bond song before it. It reminds me of the classic Bond songs from the 60's and 70's.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The only issue is that there doesn't appear to be enough volume. But other than that it works great and has nice features.
0743487486|5.0|We had heard many great things about this book. I decided to order online instead of trying to track it down at a used book store in town. The thinking and skillset offered in this book is a very different from the norm way of thinking/acting! I highly recommend this book to anyone considered to be a parent, teacher, or in a meaningful relationship! This kind of idea set would make this world a better place to be and grow if everyone could adopt this way of thinking over the \\"old school\\" ways of thinking/parenting!!
B005B0QYMM|5.0|It was creepy,scary,made me want to see the next one. All around good scary move :) The beginning makes it seem like it will suck..give it a few...as they explore the hospital things really SPOOK up...once it starts..it just keeps going until the end.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Crashes on DroidX2 between each level at least through Rome...not sure about the rest of the game because I can't make it there. Love the graphics and the game so far though..
1932735410|4.0|So, I had the sixth edition, but studied the 7th with my study group.<br /><br />First, the 7th, as others have noted, softens Rita's acerbic tone.  The questions are still 'gotcha!', and... grudgingly... that's a good thing.  You look at the exam differently.  Her explanations of how to eliminate the answers help a lot for the exam - without getting into the exam details, many of the questions are written with a style of English which may not make crystal clear sense.  Rita's scolding and chiding (or the 7th ed softer explanation) will help you cut through that fog.  Period.<br /><br />A few comments Rita gives you:  when uncertain, and given a Risk answer, pick it.  Always pick the planning action (if you're in a planning process) or pick the evaluate action before leaping into action.  Similar tidbits help.<br /><br />My exam was made easier by Rita.  I recommend her, with adjuncts of other books, questions, and an instructor (or local-chapter) -led course.<br /><br />Good luck!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|my 3 year old  and 6 year old grandsons are really enjoying playing this game. I also  am liking it  hooked on it  . Some of them really make you think.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So much fun. Told two of my friends about it on a bus trip this weekend and they couldn't stop playing.<br />One complaint, you have to try and figure out how the game works as you go along. Could have better \\"How to play info\\".
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter was great watching it on 42\\" LG TV and worth the money I paid for the package of disc.
B007THA4FI|3.0|If it weren't by Rowling, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. The characters are unattractive. Her prose is a bit overdone--somehow it worked better in a magical world. Nonetheless, I have to say that it kept me reading.
B00887490Y|2.0|\\"The Tall Man\\"<br /><br />A convoluted plot that only becomes worse with poor acting.<br /><br />\\"The Tall Man\\" takes place in a remote mining town outside of Seattle, Washington, aptly named Cold Rock.  Within this town lies a local legend named, not surprisingly, \\"The Tall Man\\".  This mysterious figure is responsible for the kidnapping and murder of the town children.<br /><br />Jessica Biel, a nurse who after recently widowed, becomes solely responsible of her only son.  Biel, who remains a skeptic of the local legend, comes home only to find that her son has been kidnapped.  She is then thrust into a murky plot to get her son back.<br /><br />What happens after is a whirlwind of events that convolutes one another, leaving the viewing audience in a frenzy of speculation: Biel finds the Tall Man; the town is soon recognized as harvesting a conspiracy; the nurse is insane, or she's guilty.  All of this remains open to interpretation.<br /><br />Biel, who unfortunately can't seem to find her acting chops within the role, often times seems disheveled, as well as confused about the plot; something she shares with the audience.<br /><br />\\"The Tall Man\\" becomes increasingly ridiculous as the movie becomes less gripping.<br /><br />2 out 5 stars
0812992784|4.0|Salman Rushdie is known for his fiction (Shame, The Moor's Last Sigh and others), but it was The Satanic Verses which forced him into hiding and police protection.  His memoir, Joseph Anton: A Memoir, tells the story of his life with particular focus on his experience following the publication of that book.  Frankly, I have never finished any of Rushdie's works of fiction and parts of this book I had to work through as well.  However, the effort was well worth it because of the insights he provides into why he was forced to go underground, the full defense of his book and its literary origins, and how he finally was able to get back a modicum of normalcy.  Readers also learn what it was like on a day-to-day basis to deal with living under full-time protection and what it meant to his family, career, and self-image.  The book has, for me, more detail and repetition than necessary, but the emotional effect was profound.  I began to identify with Rushdie and the frustrations he faced.  Rushdie uses third person to tell his story, but I'll not give away why the book is titled Joseph Anton: A Memoir.  If you have an interest in what happened to Rushdie, his take on why it happened, and who Rushdie became as a result - this book is for you.  A key learning?  Life is not linear and circumstances will change with time - good times can turn bad; bad days may well pass from view.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Well written page turner.  Certainly makes one think about the choices and actions we are currently taking in this world.  Hope it is still (mostly) fiction.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I enjoyed this film. It's easy to attack, but I think it holds its own. Scott embraces some cinematic illogic that's practically inherent in the genre, so it makes sense within that context.<br />It's extremely different from the original Alien film. That one was kept simple. This one gets more complicated, but when you open a can o' worms, that's what happens.<br />I highly recommend the 3-D package (and I don't even have a 3-D set up). It comes with an excellent and lengthy documentary on the making of the film. The documentary increased my understanding and enjoyment of the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this book was better than the first!!! i cant wait till the next ! at least i have something to look forward too!!! i hope there is a fourth!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was totally taken with this book. You won't be able to think of anything else while readding this story. Jamie McGuire is an excellant writer and can't wait for Walking Diaster!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing! I love Peeta I cant wait to see what happens in Mocking Jay! :)  Anyone who doesn‘t read this book is CRAZY!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it, it reminds me of going to the county fair and playing it. It can be quite challeging to get the prizes to drop in the right place.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across this series at a time when I needed something to read and was careless in downloading samples. I'm so glad that I found Wool! What a great author! The storyline sucked me in. The characters made me want to root for them. Very believable. Even when the epilogue came to its end, I wanted more.<br /><br />I would love to see this made into a movie or tv series. Especially if the author wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />This is an author to watch for. Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I got the first book because it was on the best seller list, but had not expected it to be about bondage and kinky sex. Frankly, I skipped over most of that, read just enough to get the idea then went..yeah, yeah, more of that, and concentrated on the deveopment of Grey as a character as he emerged from fifty shads of darkness to become a character of substance and overcame his darker side.  I was glad to see most of that be all over with a happy ending, tho I am sure he has more growing to do.  Ana's character was probably what kept me reading all three books, hoping for a good outcome for her no matter what, in spite of the many  times I wanted to use my martial arts training on Christian.  As a psychology major, it also held my interest, especially in this last book, seeing where he was coming from and how he got this way.  An intriguing combination of wanting to confront his self absorption and wanting to give him a hug. Ruth (tag line RCC)  Wanted readers to know this review is from a womans perspective!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|this was a fun book to read and very different.  I completely enjoyed it and the characters were great,  if not believable.  That was what made it fun.
030758836X|1.0|I gotta say I am very dissapointed. This unbelievably crazy book was, and still is a best seller. I was very excited to finally be able to start reading it. The reviews were good, and I even heard people discussing it at work. I am once again let down by the reviews.<br />This book was horrible. Terrible things happening in a marriage where divorce was not an option due to the fact that the woman was out of her mind and the husband didn't have the balls to end it either.<br />The first part of the book I was totally on her side, but when the truth unraveled little by little lie by lie I couldn't believe the extent this scorned woman took things.<br />Ridiculous how they manage to get away with all the wrongs they both did and how they find a happy ending. I am so mad. They both deserved to go to prison and stay there for good.<br />Frivolous woman and clueless man.<br />At the end I'm still wondering why does he smile when he shouldn't? Why does he hide the clues instead of having the detective accompany him to find the rest of them? What was Go's part or contribution in the story?<br />(less)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fun book to read. Kept me guessing as to what would happen next. Well written. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is excellent historical fiction. It consists of facts - mostly chronological, about the beginning, course and conclusion of World War II. There are factual, documented quotations and descriptions of actual significant personalities. My only negative comment is related to the fictitious events and most emphatically fictitious protagonists and their families within the work. No one reads a work of this magnitude in a single day or even week. Consequently, as I progressed, I lost track of some of the identities, as well as mutual family relationships of a few of the individual characters in the book. This became somewhat detrimental to my perception of the narrative as a whole. Renata Laxova
0062124293|5.0|Don't pass go, just buy this book! It is a rip roaring ride to being a woman and I enjoyed every single curve.  At times a bit unconventional, but always on target, Caitlin Moran hits the bull's-eye with panache.  She puts her own spin on being a British woman in this page turner.  This was a highly enjoyable book and I recommend it completely.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  Twists and turns in the story line made it a page turner from the very beginning.  I liked the back and forth between the two main characters and it was hard to determine who had the most mental health issues.  The author developed each main character and sub-characters extremely well.  i will definitely read her other two books.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Spartacus \\"Vengeance\\" takes off where \\"Blood and Sand\\" left off and it does it great. Although Andy Whitefield is sorely missed, Liam McIntyre does a good job of taking the reigns as Spartacus, can't wait for the next and, unfortunately, final season.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very good read! Makes you realize your whole life is a count down so dont waste it! Couldnt put it down, very well written..
B0090OW7J4|5.0|Once again, Hiatt shows he's still one of the very best singer/songwriters around.  From the black humor of 'Wood Chipper' (Nick Cave eat your heart out!) to the gorgeous ballad, \\"I Just Don't Know What To Say\\" and on through the Stones-like rocker \\"Bite Marks, Hiatt delivers one musical gem after another.  If you're not a Hiatt fan yet this collection might just remedy that.  Great songs, great guitar work and strong authentic vocals.  This has just got to be one of the year's best recordings...period.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I have seen Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and absoulutely loved it. I am one to see different versions of certain types of movies. When I decided to see this version of Emma I was hoping that I was not going to be disappointed. I was not! I think I like this one better than the one starring Gwyneth Paltrow. It is definitely a must see.
B001VIMCW4|1.0|The quality of this video was so poor. Was not watchable. I have 10mbs internet service still quality is bad.  I was just waste of my money!
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Definitely not Downton Abbey. I love period piece drama but this series was lacking in some areas. Overall it kept me entertained.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun but a little simplistic.  Catchy theme song. Nice graphics. Nice for a casual type game. Easy for kids to enjoy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found this book troubling, I can and do enjoy books without the language that J.K. Rowling decided had to be utilized in this one. I was terribly distressed in what she presumed is enjoyed by all adults...sorry, but that is how I personally feel about her first \\"Adult Book\\"
B003TH41H4|5.0|i instantly fell in love with the characters of this tv show! It is just pure fun entertainment at it's very best.<br /> I also wish that Syfy would bring it back since there is more than enough books to get stories from.<br />That is one thing...since i enjoyed the series so much, i am now reading the books. I think the characters are<br />excellent  as to how i would have pictured them in my head just reading the books. The main characters at least i<br />should say and yes it does vary  from book's stories but that just held my interest even more so as i read.<br />  I just wish they had followed the sisters of the light bit more true to the book since they play larger roles in other<br />books...if they should pick this up again.<br />I think they should pick up rights and make more of this....I do not recall hearing about it when it was out...so this time maye bit<br /> more tv interviews etc before show starts so others can get hooked on it as well.

B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Brilliant and Prescient!!  A must see to understand the \\"Reality\\" world we live in today!  As each year passes, this morality play just becomes more and more uncanny in how it nails the future, a world in which we observe and are observed 24/7.  A masterpiece!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The concepts are pretty simple and some of the levels are pretty short.  However, the last one with 5 walls is a real bear. The key for most levels was to match 4 or more 7 times and use the crystal to blast away tiles. I'm not entirely sure why the altar exists and wish there was more after beating the game. Sure, I can replay levels with less time and rocks the second time around, but that's not great replay value.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|No one is free from being shot. Might make a acceptable video game. The action stunts are a little more realistic that say those in karate movies.
B008OJ291W|2.0|This is not remastered ELO recordings.  Jeff Lynn remakes ELO hits without the ELO band members.  The result is an album of songs close to the originals except not as good.  Compared to the originals the audio quality may be technically better but the listening experience is not.  The emotions heard in the original recordings have been replaced be the mechanical precision of the modern recording studio.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theatres and absolutely loved it!  I had always heard about the show(s) and always wnated to see them and then the movie came out.  I would reccomend it to anyone!  I've already watched it quite a bit now as well.  It made me want to watch all the original episodes (which I love as well).  Between watching the original series and this movie, I of course make the comparisons and notice the similarities and the differences between them.  It also made me want to read the books by Lara Parker as well.<br /><br />However, the reason I give it four stars is, is that it can get slow in some of the parts.  It of course still sticks with some of the original series, as well as stray from a certian episode that it's trying to represent.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is really good.  It's one movie that I think is really good, it just came out at the wrong time in theatres because of the other movies that were out.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the whole zombie craze - I think it has yielded too many cookie cutter, me-too spin-offs.  That said, I was very please with Walking Dead.  Faithful to the comics, it is a much deeper and engrossing experience than the cheap \\"Italian Gore Film Circa 1980\\" I was expecting.  Recommended for fans of the genre, and those looking for something different.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Concise and insightful, an important perspective.  The book is an important touchstone for the sequel to [[ASIN:147829969X God Bless The Dead]], as well as the initial book in the trilogy.  Serious thinkers, secular and otherwise, would be well served to read it.  Hitch would be proud.  Highly recommended.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I'm loving this album. \\"Wish You Never Met Me\\" and \\" Won't Let Up\\" are my favorite tracks. Lots of high energy and heaviness in this album. These guys are incredible live and I can't wait to see them again when they come back to Dallas.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lots of fun, can't get enough of the puzzle game modes.  Don't enjoy action game modes as much. Cute characters too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was not as good as Hunger Games for me but I was committed to finding out what happens to Panem, Katniss, Peeta, Gale and Haymitch and had to keep reading.  I became frustrated and/or bored with the detail-rich thoughts Katniss shared and felt that the 300 pages could have been 200-250 pages if there hadn't been so much \\"contemplation\\" back and forth.  I understood its purpose, as I do the same thing myself and I did connect with Katniss; but at points I just needed to story to move forward minus the ongoing dramatic sililoquoys.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very good book.  It moved fast enough to keep me reading until the end..and I bought the 3rd book to read, which I found just as good. I highly reccomend it.
B0060YIBLK|3.0|The book is an easy read, fun and engaging. Problem is the actual content of the 'book' (its 90 pages long) could be very easily summarized in 10 pages.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J. K. Rowling is such a wonderful writer. The characters in this book, as in her Harry Potter books, have such depth,and the stories Rowling tells are so engaging. This is a good read!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child rarely has a misstep. There's only one of his books that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. This was another success. Child's writing is so clear and vivid. I always know exactly what's happening, even during complicated settings. He's a master. Still looking forward to Jack getting to Virginia. Still sick about who is playing Jack in the movie but I can be satisfied with the books.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have read each of Jo Nesbo's books and they are all fantastic reads. Harry Hole is a tremendously dysfunctional person who I find interesting. Nesbo portrays him with all his strengths and frailties. He crafts characters you become intimately involved with and never lets the story line lag. Read all his books and be sure to read them in order as Harry's character is in a constant state of development from one book to the next.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Lets see, you shoot little birds at poor innocent piggy's. I can see the fun in it. My kids love to play this game. On long drives it keeps them busy. Maybe if I played more often I would like it more. I found it a little dull but willing to give it another shot.

B009AJDDQU|4.0|I saw this film in theaters and thought it was ok but when I saw that it was available to buy almost a month before DVD release I bought it. I think this is one of those movies that you like better the second time you watch it is beautifully shot and directed, I am hoping for a sequel to the Prometius story besides that in the Alien Trilogy
B002ZG97LK|1.0|This movie sucked the orginial was better...people really should mess with remaking classics...i would not recommanded this movie to anyone :-(
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|THe right blend of action and comedy. Excellent cast and some hilarious one liners.  I would definitely recommend this film to others.

B004U52VPS|3.0|The game is fun, especially to get an Angry Bird-loving child away from the computer. My six year old son can easily play with this for an hour or two at a time.<br />However, there are a couple issues.<br />The game comes with a deck of cards that depicts a structure you have to build with the included plastic blocks. Some of the cards show more pieces than are actually included with the game. You can use other pieces as substitutes, but I think a game should include all the pieces the instructions want you to use.<br />Additionally, some of the structures are hard for a 30 year old to build, let alone a six year old. This isn't a video game where the laws of physics are up to the designer.
0451169514|5.0|Besides a few short stories, It is the first Stephen King's work I have read. I hadn't heard very good things about him. \\"Good story-telling, bad writting\\", and all that jazz. Well, I'll agree with those who think a novel is 50% content and 50% form. \\"It\\", as you may have guessed, has a wonderful AND terrifying story. But it's also delivered masterfully; King's narrative isn't very dense, so the book is easy to digest. This, however, doesn't mean it is shallow, but rather accessible. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of detail to devour. Really.<br /><br />\\"It\\" is an internal odyssey of dramatic realization, friendship, love, passion, trauma and unnerving terror. Stephen King grabs all the important components of a good horror story, and stretches them to a fantastic lenght, while using, as the main antagonist, a creature evidently inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, an apparently all-mighty, evil and eternal beast, who makes the lives of seven already disgraced children a living hell, hell he wants to extend for all eternity, as he disturbingly claims: no one really dies in Derry.<br /><br />The lenght wasn't an issue to me, because even on the first 50 pages you're in for an amazingly hooking tale. \\"It\\" is a rather light read I'd suggest to pretty much everyone over 13 years old. I am a slow reader myself, but I finished this book much more quickly than I thought I would. I couldn't put it down until my neck started to kill me. And soon enough, I was reading it again.<br /><br />If you're still doubting whether you should read this book because you already saw the series, let me tell you, the latter is roughly the 25% of the novel; and even that 25% dies short (and censored) to its equivalent to the book. Read, read, read it. You won't regret a single page.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young and loved it from the start. Even today, almost twenty years later, it gives the same excited, thrill a minute, laugh till you hurt entertainment. The movie takes a clean but empty look at out not too distant future where the world has become a nightmarish 'utopia'. Obviously Sylvester Stalone doesn't belong in a utopia so you can see where the humor comes in. A fantastic adventure, for anyone who enjoys a little demolition, Sylvester Stallone, Sandra Bullock, or even Wesley Snipes who plays a fantastic crazy man.
0316228532|1.0|This goes particularly to all Harry Potter fans. You're allowed to love Rowling as much as you want to, but please, if you haven't already: do not read this book.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy tries too hard. But I can't even tell what it is trying to do. From the beginning until the end, I felt my intelligence was being insulted. This novel isn't exactly what you'd call \\"genre fiction\\". I'm saying this because it somehow manages to appear as a book targeting a specific audience, and at the same time it's about nothing. I felt insulted because I don't think this is an adult book. I'm sure the younger readers will find it more enjoyable, because it treats with topics that tend to appeal teenagers; I'm not saying teenagers are stupid, but they can, at least, relate more to some of the characters.<br /><br />I have to say, and I am sorry to do so: excessive use of the 'F' word, stereotipically disfunctional families, obnoxious youngsters, scattered pop-culture references, gigantic breasts and glorification of the act of smoking don't make an \\"adult\\" novel. It merely makes it seem like Rowling spends too much time reading edgy fanfiction on the internet. Because that's what this book feels like.<br /><br />Ignoring the fact of how incredibly dull the plot is, I have issues with the genre. This novel isn't \\"black comedy\\". I don't have the slightest idea where did Rowling get that from, but I couldn't detect a single bit of hilarity among the pages. I couldn't even tell when Rowling was trying to be funny, or dark. This novel isn't dark, it's filthy. It's not obscene, it's just rude. And it may be tragic, but in a rather bitter, inconsequential way. The Casual Vacancy didn't have a single redeemable feature, except for the pretty colors on the cover, and I'm sorry I read the whole thing. Oh well. After all, I don't feel right if I don't finish what I started.<br /><br />You know this as well as me: you have better things to spend time on. Please, don't let the name in the cover drive your judgment.cover drive your judgment.
B005LAII62|3.0|After seeing ParaNorman yesterday at the base theater, I have to say that I'm kind of surprised that there is such a controversy over the \\"message\\" of this movie.  First, I don't think there was any type of nefarious message; the only message I gleaned from watching this movie was the usual \\"don't judge others\\" and \\"we're all different, we're all special\\" type of thing.  Those are messages with which I agree.  In fact, my husband and I instilled what ethics, morals and beliefs we felt were appropriate for our children with the hope that they would be productive members of society and independent thinkers.  Doing such has made us confident that they are able to assess different situations and make good decisions on their own, regardless of what movies they watch, or books they read, etc.<br /><br />In other words, we're pretty confident that they can watch a children's movie and still retain what we've taught them.<br /><br />That said, I thought the movie was pretty good.  I was kind of creeped out at some of the animation, which was very unique and well done.  Some of the storyline was a bit dark, but I agree with other reviewers who noted that the darkness probably went over the heads of most children.  Also, at this point I should admit that I was initially hesitant to take our daughter because I thought the premise had something to do with demons, but after looking up reviews and listening to my husband, I was wrong.  My husband will now probably print out that last sentence and frame it, especially since he's the one who was... not... wrong.  Erg!!<br /><br />Anyway, moving swiftly along --<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"ParaNorman\\" is a Halloween-type children's movie, and was enjoyable.  I liked that Norman was able to overcome his own fear and do the right thing, in the face of majority opposition.  Courage is always an asset.<br /><br />I also laughed quite a bit at the jokes and writing, which was definitely rated PG.  The children in the theater reacted wellto the funny parts, and you could hear a pin drop whenever there was a dramatic crescendo.  No one wept with terror, and there were children from infant-teen age range present.  Our 11-year-old daughter thought it was great, and by the time we hit the parking lot she had moved on to begging for ice cream.<br /><br />ParaNorman had great animation, good writing, and was entertaining.  Recommended to others with the caveat that there may be aspects that some find offensive, so research prior to seeing is also recommended.<br /><br />edited to change title
0553801473|3.0|I loved the first three books in Martin's series. Now in A Dance with Dragon, I feel like I'm seeing the same things over and over again. It's hard for me to get interested when a new character is introduced because I figure his or her head will be on a pike in a chapter or two.<br /><br />But I keep reading, which means Martin is doing something right.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|This is a fun game that takes a little practice to figure out.  I liked it. I would recomend it especially since the author reads the comments and improves the game!
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is so stupid . This guy I know loves it but it is so dumb. Expensive. for nothing basically good for nothing
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A good sequel but a lot of ups and downs in the storyline. a must read for the series but very scattered.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My husband and I have joked about reading Fifty Shades of Grey since this summer.  I wish it had remained simply a joke.  The book itself is a total joke with no plot what so ever except for scenes after scenes of sex/BDSM.  The writing style is similar to that of a teenager.<br /><br />There are a lot better books to read than this.  Don't waste your money and time on such garbage!
B00936A0ZW|3.0|Solid guitar playing as always. This is a little jazzy for my liking, but a nice break from the instrumentals. Paul can write great pop songs with smokin licks. I'm hoping for a little more of that.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Everything you would expect from a Wes Anderson film (including the spectacular cast members) and a feel good ending as well. Just what we expected, and more. Highly recommend the film and wish Hollywood would spend more money making movies like this one. Thank you Wes, Bill, Bruce, Edward, Frances, Tilda, Jason, Harvey, and Bob. You guys are the best.
B009CPES4I|5.0|This movie shows older people as they really are...not excessively made up, no face lifts or butt tucks.  The personalities evolve during the course of the film which, in my opinion, makes a better movie.  My husband and I enjoyed the movie very much.  I plan on owning it.
B00932H7FW|5.0|I dont normally get into shows but this one is great...Watched them all in 3 weeks..<br />Just couldnt stop watching sometimes...Cause I had to know what happened...
B00881VLCE|4.0|I do love this app, a great way to put together puzzles and extremely addictive, but ads are really intrusive and not enough free puzzles, all the good sets are pay only and. 99 is too much for 5 puzzles. Would also like to be able to change backgrounds...dark puzzle pieces are hard to see, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.
B0095R76EW|2.0|It looked funny from the commercials, but wasn't really that funny. And a little depressing. i expected more from this movie that i got. a little boring too.
0500543933|5.0|A very good overview of the approach to street by a number of photographers. Text tells the story of their approach and is a good read. Well worth having
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I have to admit, I almost stopped reading fairly early on in the book. The author's religious beliefs became disturbingly apparent when, while listing introverts, she mentioned Moses and a conversation he had with God. I persevered and I'm glad I did, breathing a sigh of relief when the author touched on the role of evolution in introversion and displayed the sort of respect for the scientific method you'd hope to see in a work of non-fiction. The book is filled with fascinating studies, deep insights and interesting perspectives from a wide range of experts. It certainly left an impression on me, gave me plenty to think about, and has changed the way I see myself and the world. When, for example, I'm less social at work than others, I no longer hear that critical voice in my head. Instead I'm reminded of this book, and feel validated. I'm sure most people will get something from this book but if you suspect you're an introvert and aren't completely comfortable with that, then you especially should read this. I finished the book feeling improved by it, and wanting to know more. Thanks Susan for giving a voice to the less than vocal.
B0090EIILU|3.0|This movie was not as funny as I thought it was going to be. It was ok but I probably would not watch it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Easy to use. Nice big numbers and display. Perfect for on the go or instant need. No turning the house upside down looking for that elusive calculator.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This was the best show of 2011.  It takes a lot for me to say that: I love Breaking Bad and Mad Men. It's great to have it in my Amazon Queue. My family and I enjoy rewatching key episodes incessantly.  Can't wait till Season 2 is available.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As always, I can't wait for the next Kathy reichs book.bones are forever was excellent and informative and had a good story.she is a master story teller and ranks with the best,!
B007TK77QE|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is a searing portrait of a group of  characters in neighbouring towns that explores how even the smallest stakes can create the grandest ambitions. Filled to the brim with toxic personalities, egos, class and fiscal warfare and all kinds of terrible abuses, this is a dark and awful book in so many ways. Deeply disturbing, it is relentless in its scope and in the way it investigates the levels to which humans will stoop. But it is also  intelligently and even beautifully written. I could not put it down.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Excellent book couldn't put it down. I heard all the hype over this book so thought I would give it a go and I wasn't disappointed at all. Now to get my hubby to read it LOL
B009AHWLHE|4.0|I loved Degeneration and was thrilled to find out Capcom was making a sequel. The story line is very good, even better than the previous film. I only have a few complaints, The dialouge wasn't as good as what it could have been, and some of the voice overs were just plain ridiculous. The CG was great but sometimes I had felt like it could have been better (ironically I felt the same was for RE6). Overall it's an excellent movie and it's a must see for Resident Evil fans. Also, it was nice to watch it before I purchased RE6, it made me hyped for the game. :)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book has definitely reached my top 5 for 2013/2013. It talks about a very delicate subject namely assisted suicide. We follow a happy go lucky Scottish girl who never stops talking, who supports her family in the time of depression, and loses her job at the bakery that closes down. She finds a new job as a care giver to a paraplegic man.<br />She is a quirky girl who will not let anything get her down as seen by her reactions to the many obstacles will (her ward) puts in her way in her daily care of him. We follow their story to the conclusion of what Will is willing to live with and without. This story will forever stay in my heart, it touched my soul in a way few books ever did, and it was the same for allot of other readers as seen by the many, many good reviews. if there is only one book you read this year, this is it.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I love this game becaz it quiz your brain and wen it quiz u'r brain it make u guest quick so I can learn more but one thing I don't like about it, it times you in all the quests games
B0098VXBIA|1.0|Silly movie with nothing new to say. No laughs, no fun. There was so much material available to them that this should have been very good. But it's not. Skip it.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|The concept intrigued me but the pace was a little slow. It wrapped up neartly in the end but Took to long to get there.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is a great read for beginners. It has minimal jargon and allows people to dissect the simple secret of gaining mass or cutting down. THANKS MIKE!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This books grips you from the beginning. Pages have to be turned and you don't want to put it down.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its the best ever you battle zombies and get a zen garddns its just awesome if you like it definitely give it a five star if you can
B000SEI230|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie and loved the book better. They may have been young but who can tell you who to fall in love with without the guidance from the greater power above.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  The way she describes what she experiences, feels, and knows during her near death experience is absolutely beautiful!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book gives a very insightful look at how it really goes with our Navy Seals on a big mission.  We also gain insight into how they work through a part of the mission that went wrong and still came away alive. It made me very proud to know our strong Seals respect women and children as much as they can and still get the mission accomplished.  USA!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Absolutely best keyboard app hands down. Unfortunately it's not working anymore after I did a soft reset on my phone and had to reinstall everything. I open it and it says Not Responding:/ help me devs!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|such a gentle wake up. perfect for people who cant stand that blare of their alarm. it'll get there, but gradually and incrementaly so you will wake up before the sound startles or annnoys u
B006LSZECO|2.0|I must say the book captured my interest immediately and, yes, it was brilliant in its plot and execution, but I felt it become more tangled as the story unfolded so I was excited to discover the missing link that pulled it all together at the end.  Well, the ending was most disappointing and in fact unlikely in every way.  So, I felt the author couldn't find the missing link that would have made this novel extraordinary!  Gone Ending Gone I would have called it. so while it passed the time overall it was disappointing.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is something I will keep in my favorite area so I can reach it.  I seem to always be connected to my kendle but not always to my computer.  A good find.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story and had a surprising ending I didn't see coming.  Catches reader from the beginning and through to the last word.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It works better than pulling up facebook on my tablet's browser but is useless for me because there is no share option. Sharing posts from pages and friends is one of my favorite things to do on the site. Take that away and it is pretty much a useless app with far too many permissions.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Rarely do I find a book that I can't put down because it so comprehensively engages all of me, with its quirky but fully believable plot, the unmistakeable wordsmithing of an accomplished author, the shared insight into the broad spectrum of the human condition, and well developed, rounded characters that are very likely to do something unpredictable at any moment. I am fascinated to know how JKR could soooo nail the description of OCD let alone the other character quirks she rolls out for our enjoyment. I hoped JKR would be as good with an adult book as she was with kids fantasy, and she didn't disappoint. Eeep, hanging out for a good night's sleep tonight to make up for this book keeping me reading voraciously into the wee small hours this morning!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The novel is basically an advertisement for Google. None of the characters are particularly interesting, nor is the mystery they are trying to solve, nor is its solution.<br /><br />  The only reason I can imagine that this book has been generally well reviewed is that this author must have a large number of young friends in influential circles and is probably a charming person. The book is a shallow trifle.
B003RS5JJY|5.0|Season 4 was a great addition with all the twists and turns. Lots of subplots. Trinity's daughter was a very welcome addition.
B007V65R54|5.0|Crystal clear coverage of how statistics and chaos theory are advancing our ability to predict the formerly unpredictable. Not \\"too many footnotes\\" for me!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like the game, but there gets to a point where it is almost impossible to lose coins. Right now I have over 3000 coins, which is nice if I needed that many. The puzzles that you have to create are a nice idea, but it would be better if we could play the puzzle game. But if you really like the dozer carnival game you will really enjoy this one.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|This product is well-suited for my Kindle Fire HD. Its only shortcoming is the elastic strap for keeping the cover closed. It quickly looses elasticity. Would have been better to have some sort of Velcro strap.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Excellent graphics and amazingly fun, I'm not much for games but this one is great. Each level adds to the fun with additional challenges.
B00826B65M|5.0|[[ASIN:B009FICNMG OEuvres Complètes De H. De Balzac, Volume 5 (French Edition)]]<br /><br />Just delighted that thanks to Amazon's Kindle I now have Balzac's \\"Comedie Humaine\\" all neatly in one place, handy for travel. I'm certainly not going to review or give my thoughts on Balzac at present.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Great music, what is there to say?  This is an amazing band  Buy the delxe edition for a cover of \\"The Boxer\\", one of my favorite songs, so nice to have an excuse to expose my kids to my older musical loves.  They are willing to listen to Simon & Garfunkel now because of Babel.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Saw the movie, went home and ordered Rodriguez' CDs. No disappointment, the music is just like that in the movie, and Rodriguez is fantastic.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie but it looked interesting.  It was amazing, stunning, wonderful, my favorite movie.  It showed human suffering, joy, natural beauty, culture, religion.  I can't even describe it but I can say I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  I plan to buy or maybe even preorder the DVD so I will own this masterpiece of cinematography.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Grey is a good description of this movie since the wolves are grey, the dark, snowy setting is grey, the mental outlook of the \\"hero\\" is grey, and the plot gets ever greyer as it progresses to its inevitable end.  The language is appropriate for the kind of men depicted but still that much profanity is off-putting.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Its a John Hughes 80's film...these films were groundbreaking at the time, and I still have many memories associated with the first time watching them. But, it really holds up as an Art film so many years later. This should not be compared to films of today, as it really is a period piece. However, the acting, is timeless. This was the first film to break the third wall, shatter it really. It was also one of the first to include an Easter egg at the end. Thanks John!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am now willing to be more attentive to my husband. Submissive even. No contracts though. My Christian Grey is right here with me at home.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book,Christain and Ana have something very special and erotic.They are well suited for each other.How many women would like to be Ana?
B008JF8O9M|1.0|This didn't work and as my knowledge of how these things hook up and there is no clear help. I feel it to be a waste of time. There should be a special print app for the kindle fire.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the custom rings and fade in. Love the custom rings and fade in. Love the custom rings and fade in.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Well thought out story with side splitting sarcasm and page turning wonder.  Between the past and present this author weaves a story of a larger than life man who slides his way out of trouble time and time again.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is the best I love how the pigs are green.watch tobuscus on youtube.I'm writing ransoms thing.so don't be a critic

B003DWC6IQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Jeffery archer is a magnificent storyteller. I really enjoyed this book and was finished in a couple of days and this was while going to a full time job and taking care of a 2 year old. Immediately bought another book by the same author
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is a great item for your Kindle HD, fits perfectly and is well protected. I would recommend this if you have a Kindle HD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love these books! they are a must read. Wish there were more in the series. Go  Hunger Games. yay
B0079TQHDO|1.0|I WILL RATE THIS BOOK MINUS 100 BECAUSE I CANNOT DOWNLOAD IT TO MY ASUS TABLET.<br />I CANNOT TAKE MY P.C EVERYWHERE I GO!!!!!<br />  John.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|AWESOME!!! REALLY KEPT ME INTERESTED, NO DULL MOMENTS.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A GOOD STORY. REMINDS ME OF \\"AMAZING GRACE\\"
0679809015|5.0|I received this book as a gift for my son. It is small and perfect for tiny hands to hold and turn the pages. The pictures are colorful and fun and the flaps are the perfect size for tiny fingers to open.<br /><br />My son loves opening each flap to see each animal. I use this book as a method for learning animals and animal sounds.<br /><br />The length of the book is long enough to capture his attention but not too long to lose it.<br /><br />This is a great board book for babies and toddlers and I highly recommend it!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I am addicted to this product, but every once in awhile it is not as touch sensitive as I would like it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was looking for something after 50 Shades and his book was it.  I can't wait for the next two.  Love these characters!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As always Follett shows himself to be one of the worlds best living authors.  My only complaint is that he does not put out books faster, but the he could turn into one of those three book a year commodity driven writers and not the true author that he is now.
1451683405|3.0|Can't help being a fan of Sam Harris's work. In this case, however, I wish there had been a definition of \\"Free Will\\". We live in \\"free\\" countries yet we are all severly restricted. \\"Will\\" has several meanings. So what does free will really mean?<br /><br />Maybe we understand \\"Free Wish\\" a bit better. Are we free to dream? Possibly... or not.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a must read! Yes, kind of like 50 Shades but way more intense and better written! I couldn't keep my nose out of it until I was finished and them I read it again!!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book is very long. Martin would have benefitted with some judicious editing.<br /><br />The real disappointment here is that: _nothing happens_...<br /><br />Why waste the readers time for 1000 pages without any character getting anywhere?<br /><br />In the end, I'm disappointed that I even bothered. Save your money.
B00368PSN2|4.0|Love the movie very much. I've seen it ten times and enjoy it. Very well played out.The outlay was great and the main players were very good. Very pleased with this film.
0143117009|5.0|This is the follow up to &#34;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#34;, which told how societies rise up. This shows the opposite, how various past societies collapsed as a result of their collective actions. The parallels to our current society and those who have collapsed are obvious, and should be required school reading for the sake of all of us. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and this book is an excellent history lesson on how societies destroy themselves. Enjoyable and educational read, Jared Diamond has an smooth and passionate writing style that enables him to present large amounts of information in a surprisingly easy to read manner.
B009B50QOU|2.0|The last two albums were significantly better. This one doesn't sound like green day, not even old green day. Hopefully the next two albums will have something better to offer.
B002XUL6QC|5.0|This film needs an excellent reproduction and this is it.<br />The last of Ophuls' films, Lola Montes is fitting. The music, by Georges Auric, is wonderful and grabs the viewer from the beginning.  The camera never stops snooping around, as always, and the colors are simply magnificent.  This was filmed in the wide screen process and the director's ingenious ways of dealing with it are worth the view alone.<br />The film is arranged by the four seasons, and not chronologically, which gives it an unexpected depth.  The color scenes are virtuosic to say the very least, with the opening starting with autumn and the end of her affair with Franz Liszt.  Ophuls had the grass painted in autumnal hues!  The circus which reappears throughout the film is a daring combination of colors, again worth the view alone.<br />Martine Carol is supremely beautiful but a rather shallow actress and has been criticized by all and sundry, but her acting style actually fits her role to perfection.  Despite the title, this is not a film about Lola Montes but about her lovers.  She simply reacts to them.  This deserves to be seen in the best condition possible and here it is.<br /><br />Curtis Stotlar
B009B2U73I|5.0|very good Cd. I have always liked her music since I heard her first album a year ago.  She make listen to jazz a pleansant thing to do at night. I have always loved jazz music and rythm and blues since I can remember.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock aplooking for an alarm clock  to use, as mentioned in the description. I worked well for me. Will suggest anyone looking for an alarm clock app. I
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book, wish it would have had a few more chapters...waiting on book#3. If you loved 50 shades, you'll love the Crossfire trilogy!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You will love many of the characters in this story, but none more than the main character, August. He and his family tear at your emotions.\\"Wonder\\" is so well written,that you feel as if you know them personally.I kept \\"wondering\\" what decisions I would make, given the different circumstances that occur. I finished the book wanting to know more about August and what lay ahead for him.He is a memorable character. A very fast read, mainly because you cant't stop reading it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|There isn't much I didn't like about this movie. I think Captain America was the only thing that didn't strike my fancy. He was a bit too.....boring, honestly. Everything else was awesome. I love Black Widow. Love Thor and the Hulk. Each character received just about equal screen time. Action was good, comedic moments were timely, and story was well executed. I adore Loki!
B00471TLZS|4.0|one of my favorite movies, cheesy, but fun!!  love it when the guy is peeling off his face, it's amazing how far we have come with special effects in such a short time.
B005WKKI96|5.0|First of all I love Lila Downs and have a lot of her music.<br />This is by far one of her best.<br />I have it on my Ipod and I have been taking my walks listening to nothing but Pecados  y Miilagros for the past few weeks.<br />Thanks Amazon for recommending it.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|The Raid: Redemption is an Indonesian film directed by Gareth Evans. Iko Uwais is a cop with a baby on the way and is part of a SWAT team that must enter a decrepit apartment building that houses a vicious gangster and his many henchmen. The gangster presides on the 15th floor from a room which has many closed circuit cameras that give him  unrestricted viewing of the SWAT team as they enter the building. The plot is uncomplicated but there is a little backstory about the reason for the raid..<br />This movie is 103 minutes long and it is nonstop unrelenting action of a boot camp aerobic class. It highlights the martial arts of Indonesia called Pencak Silat. The pacing of the entire film is brisk and several fight scenes can be called classics. The scenes are furious and people use everything from their fists, machetes, refrigerators filled with gas cylinders, doors (really) to decimate each other. The action sometimes subsides but it is replaced by a nervous tension of `what is going to happen next'. The background music is outstanding as well.<br />The horror of getting stuck in a dirty squalid building and being hunted by dozens of blood thirsty killers is what makes the film so engaging to watch. Watch this film and tell me what your favorite kill scene is? The only con I found that is that this is not a movie that can be seen with the entire family as the violence is over the top and brutal. Five stars.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I LOVE SYLVIA DAYS BOOKS. THEY HAVE A GOOD STORY NOT JUST THE SEX...OF COURSE THAT PART IS OVER THE TOP!!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I have never been a fan of reggae or Marley but one cannot deny the influence the music and the man on pop culture. A very well made and interesting documentary that tries to peel away the layers that reveal the man, Robert Nesta Marley and his singular passion towards music and humanity. Five stars
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It took me a while to fully appreciate what the author was doing with this novel.  The humor was sutble at first.  It sometimes borders on being rediculous without being rediculous.  I enjoyed it.  When I put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I enjoy this app my lil girl love it. It is just the right app for her while doing her hair.
B00846REIS|4.0|PLEASE keep in mind that this stuff is fiction and should not be taken as a means of what a normal relationship should be based on...<br />Ok with that said, this a great read and is full of exciting happenings.  YES, there is a lot of hot, drawn out intimate scenes but c'mon, isn't that why we are reading this in the first place?  Ok, maybe that is just me.  Anyhow, this is along the lines of the 50 Shades series but the characters in this series ALL have some serious stuff to deal with on a personal level.  Stuff that draws you in as well as stuff that you may be put off by. That is what makes the book so interesting and keeps you wanting more.  At some point, each character is the good guy and then as things unfold you start to think well maybe not so much, these folks need help!  And then you start to think that \\"you\\" can help them out personally.  Ya\\"ll, I am tell'n ya that is how well this book is written it makes you feel like you really personally know each character.<br /><br />Great story that will have you staying up late, getting up early and buying lots of batteries as well as having a very happy spouse.  Ok maybe that's just me.  TMI?<br /><br />Just read the series for yourself and tell me what you think.  Really, I would like to hear (well read) your thoughts on this series.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|I am not a history buff per se, but rather I love politics, so I was anxious to read this book.  I really looked forward to it!<br />It started out pretty good but as I read on, it feels like it is starting to drag on.  I'm up to Kennedy and The Bay of Pigs, which I expected to be exciting because I was a young Bride at the time and my husband was in the military.  So far, I feel like I'm having to force myself to keep reading, which is not a good sign.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent read in the Game of Thrones Tradition. A real page turner filled with twists and turns, with lots of surprises!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book so much I had a hard time putting it down. The author did a great job with all of the drama. At the end I was wishing for more...but the third book isn't due until May 2013...I'm not sure I can wait that long!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I just wish it had a button to press for more like the website and once in a while it doesn't load and freezes....but it's still nice to have

B007THA4FI|2.0|Politics bore me and even with J.K. writing couldnt save the story. It was so boring, what a shame.  I had been excited to get the book.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this well-written historical novel.  While I am not Jewish, I believe it is important for all people to remember and never forget the horrible supression this group experienced.  The book reminds one of those times with a very well told story of a Jewish family and their eventual ties to another family in the present day.  I am recommending that all my friends read it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it!! It is such a great love story, more than just mommy porn as everyone say. It is a great love story for the ages. I found myself laughing from all the banter between Ana and Mr grey. It is a MUST READ for eveyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, very entertaining with several funny situations. 3D not as good as in the theater, but what movie actually is.
B009CRLTVG|5.0|An absolute joy to read. Educational and lovingly written. I highly recommend this book. It kept me captivate from start to end. We need more authors like Rushdie and the world would be a better place. It shows that a flawed person can at the same time be brilliant and thoroughly human.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio did it again with the RIO version of angry birds.<br />Everything we love from the A.B. games, Except there<br />are NO PIGS!:) Freeing the other birds and Getting the<br />Monkeys is good fun.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good. Not as good as the first but gives more insight into Gideon's character. Can't wait for the final novel.
B003MC5N28|4.0|The Giver<br />Lotte's review<br /><br />I loved The Giver the moment I picked it up. But the more I read the less I liked it and the more confusing it became. I had a million questions I wanted answers for when suddenly just like that (snap) the book ended. I couldn't believe it. It was as if the author didn't know what should happen in the end, so she just made up an ending and finished the book. If this book hadn't ended so abruptly it would ha e definently been one of my favorites!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Amazing can't wait till next book comes out.  But have to wait till end of December. Enjoyed this series better than 50 Shades of Grey.
B005HEQ8KA|4.0|This is great, but there's such a cliffhanger at the end and then it says part 2 is unavailable. Why is this? I mean,after all, we are paying for Amazon Prime, why can't we watch this one episode?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had to take a day or two to catch my breath after reading this novel (or collection, if you will) before I could write my review.  I became so attached to the characters that I feel almost in mourning.  I MISS Juliet; finishing the book left me feeling like a wonderful child of mine has left.  I've rarely read a story that works so well on so many levels.  The plot is entrancing science fiction.  Several themes wind themselves through the work, each engaging and thought provoking.  What do we owe to one another?  To what extent do means justify the end?  What is this species we call \\"human\\", really?  And of course the characterization is phenomenal.<br /><br />An interesting coincidence is that I read \\"Wool\\" immediately after re-reading  [[ASIN:B003XRELMA Make Room! Make Room!]] (the novel [[ASIN:B001QUM4IY Soylent Green]] is based on); and it felt like it could easily be a sequel (but not by the same author, since \\"Wool\\" is, in my opinion, better written).  Another work that seems thematically similar is  William Golding's [[ASIN:0399537422 Lord of the Flies]].  I won't venture to say Howey's book is better written, but his portrayal of human strength and weakness is, in my opinion, more realistic and based on real research instead of raw opinion.  I loved, for instance, that Howey worked a description of the Robber's Cave experiment into the work.  It's an important experiment that I'm familiar with from my scientific studies of human nature and it was wonderfully integrated without stepping outside of good story telling.<br /><br />One last thought:  \\"Wool\\" is incontrovertibly somewhat dystopian.  But the horror is not pervasive - there's lots of love and joy still in a world gone horribly wrong.  And neither are the solutions painted with sudden redemption, which only ever occurs in fiction.  As with all great fiction the setting is a means to an end and not an end in itself.  Bravo!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was the best hidden object I have done in a long time.  The objects were challenging, and the story was good too.
0307010856|5.0|This was my favorite book as a toddler and I am so happy to pass it on to my friends' children.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|User friendly and really fun to build your own town! Perfect for kids and fun to reminiscence as an adult!<br />UPDATE: I've been playing this game for quite some time and the latest update ruined it. Now, every time I try to plant anything or place an animal, it force closes and I lose all the progress I had made during the time I was logged on. I was so disappointed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am not very fond of this kind of game but this one is actually pretty good and it keeps you on your toes trying to find out what happened next. I love the sections where you have to find the objects, it makes me focus and pay attention. Great for a rainy day!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Although my history is wiped out with each update, I still enjoy the levels. My 7 year old son is fascinated, and enjoys figuring out the puzzles, he does use the hints when one gets too frustrating for his age.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not only was this a great who-done-it, it was also a look inside love, dysfunction, manipulation, and how we humans can justify almost anything! Have already recommended it to several friends and relatives and will continue to do so. Write more!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Casual Vacancy was page turning and very insightful of the hopes and follies of humanity. Krystal Weedon was a comical and tragic figure.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Insightful look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, brought to life by the wonderful Meryl Streep.  After watching this film, we want to watch the documentary about this remarkable woman who sacrificed so much in her personal life to serve her country.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game. Love the storyline. Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games. Hey if your still not try the free app first I guarantee you'll get it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I got this game thinking it will be something similar to Angry birds. Well I am happy that is not exactly like Angry birds. I know that sometimes spin off games are not always that good,  but this is a good game. But beware sometimes it is confusing and a little annoying. Over all it is a 4 star game.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I bought and loved all 7 Harry Potter novels, therefore was very dissapointed in this new endeavor of JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy. With the Harry Potter novels being geared towards children and teens, it was amazing the depth and breadth JK Rowling maintained through each book and all subsequent books tied up wonderfully to the very end. I am an adult in my 60's, and anticipated her \\"adult\\" novel to have the same depth and even further enhancement of a powerful story line. The plot is boring and the story line drags along endlessly. I haven't \\"invested\\" any connection to the characters, not even enough to keep the names straight as to who is who. I bought it well over 2 months ago and yet been inspired to finish it. I won't give you a plot summary as you can read that on Amazon's review. I was amazed to see it listed as No.1 on the New York Times bestseller's list. I'm sure it is selling purely on the strength of her previous works.<br />Maybe readers should check it out at the library instead of buying it. I wish I had.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|this game is fun but you can only play a few levels before you need more employees than you can get without paying real money. I don't have money to spend like that.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Much more interesting than expected. This biography reveals a complex and highly motivated individual. Perhaps understandably there is not too much self criticism except in the section on his secret relationship with Mildred and even that is not given any importance in the overall portrait of his life. Politics is a strange game, as reflected by the fact that his wife Maria waits until the day after his term as Governor ends before telling him she knows about his illegitimate son and announcing her wish to separate. A serious setback after a life filled with so many successes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great  i loved every page of this book and cant wait to read the next one. what an easy read
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friends at work were all reading and talking about this book, so my husband and I had a trip to Vegas planned with a four hour plane ride.  I thought what better time to read.  I am so glad I did! I found that I couldn't stop reading. Bought the next two books right away.  I think I read all three books in less than two weeks.  I felt like I got to know Christian and Ana personnally.  I've heard there is a movie in the process, can't wait.  I wish E L James would write a book from Christian's perspective.  Not what I expected at all concerning bondage and sex.  Was pleasantly surprised that it was more a love story.
B006M4F67A|2.0|The charactors on the \\"blocks\\" are so hard to see.  I love this game but maybe more colorful figures would be better.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|The Monster at the End of This Book is my son's favorite book so we were extremely happy to find it for Kindel. We like this version b/c he can do it himself and with the help of it reading to him, he practically knows it by heart. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009AMALLM|4.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" is good. This is how the story goes: It has been five years since the disappearance of Katie and Hunter, and a suburban family witness strange events in their neighborhood when a woman and a mysterious child move in.<br /><br />The cast led by Katie Featherston (as Katie) & Kathryn Newton (as Alex) is good. The directing by Henry Joost & Ariel Schulman is good. The story by Chad Feehan & the screenplay by Christopher Landon is good.<br /><br />The cinematography by Doug Emmett is good. The film editing by Gregory Plotkin (also co-produced) is good. The casting by Terri Taylor is good. The production design by Jennifer Spence is good. The art direction by Jason Garner is good. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer, set dressings by T. Scott Elliott, Marc Meisels & Randy Molique is good. The costume design by Leah Butler is good. The make-up design by Robert Hall is good. The visual effects supervised by Eddie Pasquarello is good. The stunts coordinated by James Armstrong is good.<br /><br />This is a good sequel in the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" series. It is scary, at times, just like the first three movies in the series. It isn't as well done as the first three were, but it is still a decently good movie. This is the sequel that you were excepting for the third movie to be, in some ways, but, in some ways, it isn't, ironically enough, with a five-year time gap that will possibly be explained in later movies, almost in a way, that the \\"Saw\\" series did.
0425263908|5.0|This was soooo much better than 50 Shades, I thought. There was much more story to it. I literally could not put it down I read this and the sequel in 3 days! It was awesome!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Having read all the Reacher stories I enjoyed this one as much as any of them. It's fast-paced and full of interesting details about people and places I was unfamiliar with. Good read.
B009GENZ12|4.0|I have to admit that I spent a lot of time being completely confused by the plot of this movie.  It did all come together by the end though and when it did, I liked it.  Some people are disappointed by this kind of movie.  It looks like a horror movie and then turns out not to be.  I liked it though.  It's definately worth watching.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I thought this books were well written.And for only 2.99 you really cant go wrong with this series.  The characters were great my only disappoint is that I have to wait till till December for the next book. It will be a long few months. Great read have recommended it to many.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is amazing. Jim Parsons is a comic genius. He continues to get better and better. Maylim Balik is giving him a run for his money.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|If you even remotely like Katy Perry you will enjoy this movie - if you don't like KP - you should once you've seen this movie.  Great view into the life of someone trying to succeed in a crazy business - entertaining - sad - hopeful - happy  - all these things rolled into one movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|The show is great. The cast and writing are both excellent. I highly recommed all the seasons. We are getting closer to finding out who the mother is.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You know it was great book, when you keep thinking about it for days after finishing.  I had problems getting into it in the beginning, but then I couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app!  Have it on my phone and Fire works great on both  Now I can pin anywhere as well as see my boards as well as those of the people I follow.  Much easier than going to the web on my Fire and doing it.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I've been meaning to read this for a while now and finally decided to pick up/download a copy. I'm not going to be disingenuous and say it was the greatest book I've ever read, but Gaiman has an excellent writing style that compelled me to keep reading through the very end. I tend to read a little faster than the average person might so I ripped through this in about 5 days.<br />For an entertainment to value ratio I have to say that American Gods delivers. I recommend you pick up a copy today.<br /><br />-Kelley
B009AMALGM|2.0|Paranormal Activity has become the \\"Police Academy\\" of horror films, with a sequel each year targeted at a particular type of audience, with a similar plot and familiar characters each time out. This year, the pickings are very slim, as this is by far the worst film of the four. Scares are few and far between, the acting is terrible, and the film is ALMOST IDENTICAL to Paranormal Activity 2, with the same exact ending as Paranormal 3.<br /><br />With a budget this big and a devoted audience, it is an insult to the integrity and to the intelligence of the loyal fans to put out a lackluster film such as this. They have obviously run out of ideas and are already rehashing the same scenes over and over again. Unless you are a huge fan of the franchise, don't seethis film. Not only are the first three better, but they are almost identical.
0525423281|5.0|~4.5/5<br />[Also available on my blog (with extras!).]<br /><br />I love this book. It was amazing and Cricket and it was just so good and I want the next one and Cricket. Cricket, you guys. Cricket.<br /><br />He is the best thing, ever. Just, ever. I love him. I want him. I want my very own Cricket. Please?<br /><br />Um, so, anyway...<br /><br />I read Anna and the French Kiss over the summer (and finally posted the review a couple weekends ago), and loved it. Immediately after reading that book and the excerpt for this one, I wanted it. It sounded amazing and Cricket seemed more my type, and I did not want to wait, at all. I even waited longer than I wanted to buy it. But once I got it, I simply could not wait any longer. I kind of wanted to, just to prolong the amazingness that it was sure to be, but that didn't happen. I read the book in two days without even meaning to, and it was over much faster than I wanted it to be.<br /><br />I wanted to meet Lola and Cricket and find out why Lola has a problem with the Bell twins and read more about Lola and her two dads. And, trust me, my excitement was for a reason.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is about Lola, a girl who likes to dress as a different person every day, including extravagant outfits and wigs, even making some of it herself. The Bell twins, Calliope and Cricket, are part of the family that live next door to her. Calliope is an ice-skater, and Cricket is an inventor. They've moved in and out of that house, and Lola has dreaded their return ever since the last time they left. And now they're back. And Lola has a boyfriend.<br /><br />This book was just as good as the first. Just as well written, with just as good characters. I don't think it was particularly better, but I do like the love interest more. St. Clair was awesome, but Cricket is just nothing less than amazing.<br /><br />The romance in this book was amazing. Lola is with some other guy at the beginning, who at first I didn't mind, but later turned into quite a jerk. I was happy with how things ended there, though. And where things went after it with Cricket. Even before that, Cricket was amazing. What he does while she's with Max is really sweet, even though Lola should have backed off a bit, and their relationship before he moved was really nice, even if a bit bittersweet.<br /><br />Cricket is charming and adorable; he talks fast when he's nervous, and he's completely devoted to and in love with Lola, and he feels a little left out, and he's so smart. He is just... everything I want. Which, yea, creates a bias, but I am completely okay with that. Because I love him.<br /><br />And Lola at one point, realizes something about Cricket that is so awesome, and then decides to work harder for him, which is awesome. And she also decides that she wants to be fully herself before she can be with him, which is fantastic.<br /><br />This book took a bit different direction than I thought it would, but it probably just made the book better for me. I was expecting it to be about Lola falling for her friends older brother, and then to have a falling out with her friend, and maybe something to happen with the boy. That is not what happened. Instead, she fell for Cricket rather early, and wasn't very close with Calliope at all. Her relationship with Cricket was strong, and started everything, and it's just... You just have to read it to find out, because I don't want to spoil any more.<br /><br />Lola has two dads, and while maybe we could have gotten to see more of them, they were awesome. The best dads ever. And Lola has a best friend, Lindsey, who wants to be a detective, and is a great best friend to Lola. And even Calliope, Cricket's twin sister, is a really interesting character. Some things she does aren't that cool, but she turns out alright.<br /><br />Oh, and there are some cameos! I was expecting to see Anna and St. Clair, but I wasn't expecting them to show up so much. Which was a very nice surprise. They are adorable and sweet and I loved seeing them together, and Lola's conversations with them. I'm excited to see what cameos there are in the next book.<br /><br />I just love everything about this book, okay? And I want the next one right now. But, of course, the next one isn't set to come out for, I think, another year or something. Which is much too long.se.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I was looking forward to reading JK Rowling's venture into the adult literature area.  As a librarian I know what her books did for young adult/juvenile literature.  There are many social mores I don't understand in Casual Vacancy because the Brits appear to be much more caste conscious although not as conscious as color of skin.<br />The book is well written but it will not be a book I will read over again.
B000I9X67W|5.0|Amazing movie, especially if you are also a band geek :)  its all about drumline (duh) and also all other sections of the band<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone!  5 stars!

B009NQKPUW|4.0|For a science-fiction film it was very well made. Nice high-tec gadgetry and very good picture especially in HD. Good storyline although i thought it could have had a better storyline. Compared to other science-fiction films, this is one of the best in that category i've ever seen. Just wondering if this film had something to do with Aliens. Not quite clear on that.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|From first to last track. Rush - bigger than life. This is a great album and the remaster is fantastic.

0316228532|4.0|I bought this book at Costco,wasnt going because of all the 1 star reveiws. Took me awhile to get through it. Read about 50 pages and stopped to read a book on my Kindle Fire. Then I started it up again. It is slow going  and took me awhile to remember who is who. But then it got more interesting and I couldnt put it down. I really liked it!
B00136JS12|5.0|For you classic rock fans Boston is a must have. The music transcends generations and is still played on the radio today. In my opinion every song is awesome and worth having in my library. If you're under 30, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
B00064VR0W|5.0|We saw Rod Stewart recently at a concert in Houston.  I wanted a recent memory of the event,and this is it.  The venue is different, but is voice, music and style are unbeatable in my estimation and he put all his energy into the concert.  Having seen the Moody Blues at Albert Hall, getting this dvd allows us to relive the recent event here and provides us with a memory of the great Albert Hall.  If you are a fan, you will love this.
184195392X|5.0|I loved this book and I have now read it twice and undoubtedly will read it again...and again.  I consider it a great adventure story, a hugely emotional drama and, certainly on several levels, a life lesson.  I don't believe that Pi or Richard are stand-ins for something epic like God and Everyman, but I do believe that in the read you might get a glimpse of something outside the realm of Darwin. I have hesitated to write a review of this book as it is a bit like quicksilver...tricky to capture and imminently changeable, but here goes anyway.<br /><br />Briefly, and especially as many people here have already outlined the plot in detail, Pi is a boy with a serious interest in several spiritual paths.  The first part of the book follows his adventures in seeking out these theologies as well as his general growth and his family's circumstances, i.e., they own a zoo, they have decided to move to Canada for a more secure life and they have set sail on an ocean liner with their contingent of animals when a violent storm hits and the boat sinks.  Pi's family and all aboard are drowned.  Pi survives and in the second part of the book, ends up in a lifeboat with several animals, the most significant of which is a large, reasonably ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  The tiger makes short work of the rest of the animals which leaves just Pi and the tiger facing each other at either ends of the boat.  I like to think that in addition to being a truly great and unique plot twist, this also represents adaption and hence survival because that is what these characters must do in order to live, and against all natural order they must do it together. Martel's writing is lyrical and magical and very emotional.  He paints a distinctive and vivid picture in the reader's mind and made it difficult, at least for me, to close the book and go to sleep.<br /><br />In a way I think the ending (which seems to have caused much controversy?) is really left up to the reader to writefor him/herself and I prefer to write it pretty much as Martel described it.  Did I see God?  Who's to say...would I know if I did?  Probably not. I do know that it's a smashingly good read and I highly recommend it.
0393343405|2.0|&#34;The Swerve&#34; would have made a good 150 page book.<br /><br />The problem is that you can't really sell a 150 page book in the current publishing world, so Greenblatt wrote and wrote and wrote until he had a morbidly obese 368 page book. The padding is outrageous and makes what would have been an interesting topic into a highly tedious one. In his &#34;Will in the World,&#34; Greenblatt was able to work from sketchy and fragmentary data to craft a readable and engaging work. Not this time. And of course, the underlying premise, that a single Latin poem helped &#34;the world become modern,&#34; is not taken seriously by historians. Most people had probably never heard of &#34;De Rerum Natura&#34; until they picked up this book.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Loved it! Story was good, action was awesome, and the effects were just right. This review process is a little annoying though!

B009329ZF2|4.0|I'm not sure why this movie was called a flop. I really enjoyed it. It had comedy, adventure, drama, and a lot of action. I would watch it again.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although I never read the Harry Potter series, it s easy to see why Rowling has become such an iconic writer. Her writing style is both perceptive and realistic. The characters are very believable. The story does not have too many twists and turns but it is captivating. The novel becomes very dark at times...almost disturbingly so. Yet you cannot help becoming attached to the the characters. All in all, a very good read.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I didn't expect much from this game but it has been fun.  The backstory is a bit tedious but it's a beautiful game with some interesting puzzlers.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is so great. I find it very challenging which I love. I love how you have to find a way to get the pig to cross the finish line. I love angry birds but I just find this game more entertaining! its a must download!

I live in Iowa and we are not nearly as remote as Lee Child makes us out to be.  I have read all of the jack Reacher series and this one is way below the mark.  Will I buy the next one?  Yes but I will expect much more than this book delivered.<br /><br />JJP
0345337581|5.0|This book is terrific.  I have the 1970's edition but wanted to make sure I always have this book available.  The techniques taught in this book are used by me on a daily bases, even though I'm retired.  The methods used are easy, fun and very worthwhile.  If you get only one memory book I suggest that this is the one.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Review to come I've been catching up on some much needed reading, giving my book shelves and Kindle lots of TLC and so I'm hopefully back to blogging full time. Whew! It's been a crazy month and a half but I'm back in a rhythm and much happier to be reading once again. For some reason, I've been drawn to reading romance novels and less strictly YA books. That's not to say I'm not going to be reading and reviewing YA books, but I needed some fluffy books to get me relaxed and reading... and these did the trick! I picked up Reflected in You even though I said I wouldn't be reading another of Syliva Day's books... never say never I guess?<br /><br />Reflected in You picks up right where Bared to You ended. Gideon and Eva are trying their hardest to get through their issues and get to know each other better in order for their relationship to work. Their whirlwind romance hasn't missed a beat and they are heading full steam ahead into both of their pasts and what could be their futures. When demons from Eva's past come to the present, Eva must come to terms with her fears and the fact that Gideon might turn away when he finds out about her tragic past.<br /><br />As I stated previously... I really did not enjoy the first book very much. Bared to You was a confusing and sexually charged, 50 Shades of Grey wanna be. Another huge problem that I had with book one was the excessive use of the \\"c\\" word as a sexual endearment... not my thing. This being said, I was surprised that I very much enjoyed reading Reflected in You.<br /><br />For starters, the characters were more developed in this story. While we still don't know what happened to Gideon and why he has so many issues, there were less holes in the plot and much less confusion. Readers learned more about Eva, her family and her past and we were able to understand her issues a little more. Eva also had more guts and self respect in this installment. Instead of being wishy-washy (I love you, no I hate you...etc.) she actually stood her ground and was not easily pushed over. It was refreshing to see her as a stronger female lead.<br /><br />The plot was also much more exciting! In the first book, we were treated to constant fighting between our leads... and not much else to be honest. There were some cat fights between jealous ex's and some weird kinkery, but the plot really had no meat. I was disappointed to say the least. Reflected in You remedied my complaint and exceeded my expectations. There was more mystery and intrigue and I found myself on the edge of my seat a few times during this read. This book was just plain written better.<br /><br />Even though the books in the Crossfire series are not the best reads of all time, Reflected in You changed my opinion of these novels and I am anxiously awaiting book 3 in November.<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)<br /><br />Review brought to you by Allison from [...]d was not easily pushed over.

Even though the books in the Crossfire series are not the best reads of all time, Reflected in You changed my opinion of these novels and I am anxiously awaiting book 3 in November.    7 out of 10    Happy Reading :)    Review brought to you by Allison from [...]
B007SGM084|5.0|These are very good books to read for entertainment.  Once I started them, I couldn't put them down. They capitavate your attention and keep it.  They are exotic and for aduly reading only, but very detailed. I enjoyed them thoroughly.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|It started off well, but seemed to drag and then wandered. It seemed to be written with \\"making a movie\\" in mind. A littlf far fetched.
0316228532|5.0|I cannot believe that I read the same book that the reviewers with the one-start ratings have been tearing apart page by page. I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I went into it it with trepidation since I loved the HP books and expected to be disappointed.  I was thrilled by the multitude of characters populating this tiny English town.  If anyone lives in a small town like I do you will agree that while we think we know everybody's business, none of us are aware of the nasty dark secrets behind our neighbor's closed doors.  All these characters are well drawn, have depth and will walk around in my brain for a long time to come.  I hope people give this book a chance because it is well worth the read. I look forward to Rowling's next endeavor.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|This is another masterful piece by one of Rock's great giants.  He hasn't lost anything over the years.  Van is the man!
B008K5T5AI|3.0|I spent the Summer re-reading all the Culture novels, so they're fresh in my mind for comparison. There is usually something that resonates long afterward; a character, a concept, a turn of plot, but why does The Hydrogen Sonata leave me empty?<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be a problem with narrative drive or pacing. The book zips along and there is plenty of action. It could be the characters. While the primary Mind Mistake Not... is the most fleshed out character, the humanoid protagonist is thinly drawn. There certainly isn't a scene stealer like Demeisen or Skaffen-Amtiskaw in this book. What was the point of the familiar other than a lost opportunity? No other Gzilt had a familiar. Then there is the question of motivation. The entire Gzilt society is behaving (appropriately) like a High School senior class in May, but what is the motivation for everyone else?<br /><br />The book feels quickly written and disconnected. At this point, if Banks writes a culture novel, it will translate to a certain amount of money. I'd hate to think this was his motivation, but it doesn't feel like it was a story he 'had' to get out of his system.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata has all the elements of a Culture novel that I'm deeply interested in such as an important musical reference, plenty of chatter among Minds, and a setting that allows for the examination of deep philosophical questions. Does it matter? This question comes up multiple times. Arguably, it is the point of the book. It is also how I feel after finishing it.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|We enjoyed it.  The music is great and the acting/violence worth the price of admission.  They sure don't make 'em like this anymore.  Recommended!!
0525952926|5.0|This book is the second in a triogy and it certainly meets expections.  The first book was \\"Falls of the Giants\\" and \\"Winter of the World\\" takes up where the first left off.  If the third is half as good as these two books, I'll be a happy reader.  They are both sweeping tales of the first world war period and the second world war period, concerning five families in different parts of the world -- very good reading!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love the international perspective of BBC news. App loads fast, easy to use. I love the convenience of loading a newspaper on my Kindle. It's fast, easy to take with you. I also subscribe to local newspapers on Kindle so having them all in one place is nice. Would recommend.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I felt this was a presentation of a journey of a focused individual who had recognized his natural calling to become a military professional, and, the best of the best.  The read was enjoyable and clearly presented to make it easy to not only follow but thoroughly understand and thus feel a part of it.  God bless the strong men willing to perform a mission they are repeatedly called on to accomplish, so that others don't have to.
B0095R64AO|2.0|The title on the video should be a clue... disappointing.  The movie is overly drawn out.  I couldn't wait for it to finally get to a good ending.
0525953728|2.0|too much extraneous information.  the book is billed as the Bin Laden mission  and actually that is only a small part at the end of the book.

B000YDAZ08|5.0|I found this boot to be very well made, the sole is non slip and very secure, the wookmanship is very good, and I really like the way they fit and feel.  I was able to ware them for 8 hours the first day and they felt good all day.
030758836X|5.0|Holy cow!<br /><br />Writing a review for this book without giving anything away will be tricky so this may be a shorter review.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are just hours away from celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary when Nick, still at work, gets a call from his neighbor that his cat is outside.  When Nick arrives home, he finds that not only is his cat outside but that his front door is wide open and his wife is missing.<br /><br />The police arrive, a report is filed, the crime scene examined and Nick is continually repeating his innocence.  However, no matter what Nick says he still becomes the prime suspect because Amy is so very clever and not just clever but patient.<br /><br />The story is unimaginable and I'm now afraid of the author Gillian Flynn because for her to make up with this story is scary.<br /><br />Definite recommend!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had a different app for pinterest but it kept freezing up and force closing.  it also stopped letting me pin anything or I would have to pin to the wrong board because I couldn't change it.  I deleted that one and installed this one instead.  ive had this one for a little over a month and haven't had any of those problems.  it is very easy to use and makes using pinterest on my fire much easier.  I love it!!
B00338QENI|5.0|This story was well crafted and provided insight into science without being dry....but the real story of Henrietta and her family moved me so, Henrietta should be remembered in every household as her unknown contribution has affected us all. God bless the Lacks family!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book was good but the same sexy words and phrases repeated so many times that I would just scan the pages until the book got going with the story again.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I know some will find fault with this movie but it is a super hero movies i believe you need to sit back and enjoy the<br /> ride remember how it was when you where a kid and just let you imagination go wild don't over analyze things<br />I thought the effects where great and the cast was good I even liked the Bruce Banner replacement all in all a fun movie
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|With the exception of the first generation, which has a different cable, I now only have to carry one cable to insure continued reading on my Kindles. Not only am able to charge my Kindles through a computer but also directly through a power outlet.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and have read every one of them. \\"A Wanted Man\\" didn't disappoint. It was action all the way through.  I especially enjoy the step-by-step logic employed by Reacher in every situation.  The characters are always surprising and never who you think they are at the initial impression.  My only confusion came toward the end of the book because of the scientific and technical reasons for the wrap-up.  I had to read that section twice before it began to make sense.  My big complaint is that Lee Child doesn't write the Jack Reacher fast enough!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie is very entertaining this my son love it, he couldnt keep his eye off of it.this movie gets five star* we loaded it on the kindle definitely worth buying .
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am a J.K. Rowling fan--at least until this book.  From the beginning, I could sense that this book was going to be a \\"downer\\", however, I was determined to give it the attention I felt it deserved.  I read the entire book, and there was not a single scene that made me feel good.  The characters were self-centered, selfish, dishonest, and downright mean--teens and adults alike!  The situations, while probably true-to-life, were depressing and dark.  When I finished the book, I was in a royal 'funk' for a couple of days just thinking about it.  Maybe that is the sign of a good book (having the reader 'think' about it afterwards) but I didn't like feeling that way.  Unless you enjoy reading dark and depressing stories, you better steer clear.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a very dark snow white. I liked it very much, just hated the ending. They could have ended it better since it doesn't look like there will be a sequel.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was very hard for me to get into. Not that the writing was bad, just not feeling the story line. But, I still feel JKR is brilliant. Maybe she should stick with Children/Young Adult...?
B009AMANBA|4.0|Although \\"Lincoln\\" takes place over the space of its final four months, this is not a Civil War movie in that there are only two battlefield scenes. And as graphic and grisly as they are, both are rendered superfluous. The film, instead, focuses on the president's need to ram the 13th Amendment banning slavery through the recalcitrant House of Representatives before the Civil War comes to an end.<br /><br />As such, \\"Lincoln\\" is the antithesis of an \\"action\\" film which might explain why the audience I viewed it with contained few, if anyone, under the age of 40. Instead, its core power comes from scenes of people talking, discussing, and in many cases shouting. Mid-19th century America was a crude, raucous arena and the most exciting scenes take place on the floor of the House where members regularly heckle, browbeat and insult each other. In fact, the eloquent verbal savaging of one's political opponent is so lively that had C-SPAN existed then, it would be the most entertaining channel on television.<br /><br />One of the joys of \\"Lincoln\\" is that you are so immersed in the time period, that it is difficult to leave the theater afterwards without getting disoriented. You can feel the mustiness of the furnishings, the chill in the meagerly heated White House, and the constrictions of the clothing. Politics is a game so corrupt that the bribing and manipulating of politicians is openly accepted and Honest Abe is not averse to playing it to get the votes needed to pass the amendment. Ever the lawyer, he knows that the Emancipation Proclamation is not legally binding and that the eventually reunited Southern states will not heed it. Hence, the war can end with a Union victory with slavery still a fact of life below the Mason-Dixon Line.<br /><br />The passing of this landmark addition to the Constitution is always in doubt. The racism of the era is unflinchingly demonstrated, one of the core scenes being when fire-breathing abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens (an acerbically delightful Tommy Lee Jones) cannot avow on the House floor that all men are indeed, \\"created equal\\", knowing that such a radical declaration will alienate the swing votes.  The idea that black Americans (and all women might) someday get the vote is met with outcries of rage and disbelief.  It is a deal with the Devil that Stevens makes and he knows it.<br /><br />Much has been made of the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role and it is indeed a tour-de-force. Midway through, you forget it is an actor you are seeing instead of the actual personage. His Lincoln is sensitive, melancholy, profane, at times riled and always funny as hell, ready at the drop of the hat with a story or tall tale, most laced with R-rated language. Gangly and awkward, were he to run for office today, he wouldn't survive the first primary. Give Day-Lewis the Best Actor Oscar now and save us the ceremony.<br /><br />But I would give a Best Supporting Actress nod to Sally Field who fought for her role as Mary Lincoln. This sad woman, plagued by depression and migraine headaches, devastated by the loss of her son, Willy, is a study in iron tragedy. She both loves and hates her husband for his exalted occupation and his aloofness and the scenes where they argue over their children, both living and dead, have a poignant immediacy. Field inhabits Mary as much as her counterpart inhabits her husband.<br /><br />While not as great as I had anticipated, I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about it and relishing the characters and scenes from one of the most momentous epics of American history. Spielberg has always had a hit (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\") or miss (\\"Amistad\\", \\"1941\\") relationship with history but this latest offering is truly in the first category.y delightful Tommy Lee Jones) cannot avow on the House floor that all men are indeed, \\"created equal\\", knowing that such a radical declaration will alienate the swing votes.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|ok, so i was really exited to see this film... i read harry potter once. my biggest dissapointment was roo... i mean cmon. the actor was about 12 and a half years too young. i was also very disappointed in the severe lack of sexual content. i mean the matrix had a full on sideways sex scene that this movie could have really used. but hey im not mormon so idk.<br /><br />i never actually read the books but i really feel that the movie should have been more like the cover. some movies arnt like that, and its very sad to me.<br /><br />as far as the actual plot... roo really needed some more screen time, as well as other charecters needing a lot more development. there really needed to be more time spent on plot development. i really wanted to know more about this world... i mean i dont even know wjat planet this was supposed to be. im guessing neptune because its blue.<br /><br />I digress, my only other complaint was that the movie was very slow... i mean talk talk talk. i really wanted to see some killing. this movie was suppsed to be about the hunger games but they only seemed to be hungry in district 12. and we spent like HALF the movie there, and the other half was spent in ballrooms and bullet trains. it needed to be more like the expendables... it just dragged on<br /><br />to sum it up... no development, no plot, very little (if any) sexual content, and little to no action. i give it a 9/10<br /><br />i like books...

B000001DQI|5.0|When this album came out in \\"73\\",I had turned 18 and was always into rock music and riding Harley's and at that time I had told my mom that when I died I wanted Funeral for a Friend played at my funeral and I also wanted to come back as the seat of a Harley so I could be between a guys legs forever!!! My mom now 85 still reminds me of some of the stupid things I said and did when I was 18 but I still love this song,I think this and Madman across the Water are my alltime favorites.Elton takes the phrase PIANO MAN to a whole greater level better than anybody else in my opinion.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|The Harry Potter franchise has left such lasting impact that, throughout the viewing of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, I half-expected Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to apparate and lend a hand to their beleaguered old mate. A Hammer Films joint, THE WOMAN IN BLACK makes for elegant British gothic horror. It tells a dark tale of numbing loss and unholy vengeance. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first venture into cinema, post-Potter. And yet he's still dabbling in the supernatural.<br /><br />Susan Hill's eerie 1983 bestseller had already been adapted as a television mini-series in the 1980s and as a stage play, but the rejuvenated Hammer Film Productions thumbed it up for a go on the silver screen anyway. Daniel Radcliffe, all of 21 years old during the filming, plays widower Arthur Kipps who after four years still grieves for his wife's passing. His inertness has adversely affected his career at a London law firm to the extent that he's a hair's breadth away from getting sacked.<br /><br />Arthur Kipps gets one last chance to make good. He's dispatched to northeast England, to a remote village in which outskirts looms the creaky Eel Marsh House. In this ruined mansion, ringed by treacherous marshland and accessible only by a causeway, Arthur is to sort out a deceased woman's estate. But since this isn't an episode of SUITS, the spooky very soon emerges.<br /><br />A curse holds the nearby village in thrall, or not a curse but rather a vindictive spirit. Arthur's arrival is met with instant suspicion from the inhospitable townspeople, most of whom fear what Arthur's meddling may further stir up. Faced with brusqueness at every turn, Arthur Kipps presses on. And while he's so emotionally closed off that he rarely exhibits a reaction to the alarming stuff going on around him, the film does a very good job of jangling our nerves. The scares are of the make-you-jump variety, cheap but very effective and more restrained than garish. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does well in establishing its ghost story ground rules. We find out that the menacing figure that fleetingly graces your peripheral vision - a veiled woman clad in black mourning garb - is targeting children, is forcing them to engage in gruesome self-extermination. So, right there, a measure of tension is lifted. We know Radcliffe's character is moderately safe. And there isn't a child prominently featured in the film for whom we have a rooting investment. Arthur's young boy Joseph (played by 4-year-old Misha Handley, Radcliffe's godson in real life) is barely in it.<br /><br />Set in the Edwardian era (thus placing this story somewhen between 1901 - 1910), the film's biggest ace is the marvelously ominous set design of the Eel Marsh House. It's one of the spookiest haunted houses seen onscreen in recent years. As ever, in the auspices of a ghost story, children's toys very much become these creepy artifacts. I thought Radcliffe does okay. He plays a repressed widower and you may wonder why he doesn't panic more or just plain clear out when that empty rocking chair starts rocking or disembodied footsteps are heard or that distant window pane reveals a spectral woman gazing out. I think Arthur Kipps sees these unsettling events in another way, sees them as evidence of an afterlife in which he can reunite with his dead wife. One gets the sense that he deliberately seeks out the unrestful spirit. It's up to you whether this undertone exists and if it's communicated by Radcliffe's rather reserved performance. Also, with high tide closing off the causeway, where was he gonna go?<br /><br />THE WOMAN IN BLACK is rich in atmosphere and broodingly gothic. It's a restrained but effective chiller. Certain moments made me clutch the armrest. Perhaps one knock is that while it does maintain a thread of steady suspense, I think it fails in delivering that big payoff. It falls short of that epic grand guignol. It's touted as the most successful British horror picture in two decades, and so were you at all startled when Hammer Films announced a sequel, the story set to take place during World War II?<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio commentary with director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman<br />- \\"Inside the Perfect Thriller: Making THE WOMAN IN BLACK\\" (00:09:32 minutes)<br />- \\"No Fear: Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps\\" (00:04:05 minutes)d when Hammer Films announced a sequel, the story set to take place during World War II?<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio commentary with director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman<br />- \\"Inside the Perfect Thriller: Making THE WOMAN IN BLACK\\" (00:09:32 minutes)<br />- \\"No Fear: Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps\\" (00:04:05 minutes)
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I started reading Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels back when he started writing them. Like all the rest, this one will hold you from beginning to end. The only problem I've ever had with Reacher is that he is just too good. There is nothing that he does not excell at. It's always interesting to find out what new thing he will have to overcome in a new story.<br /><br />To make a long story short, this is not the best of Mr. Child's work, but it is still a lot better than most alternatives.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, would I have bought it? You bet!

0374214913|4.0|Ever read a book that surprised you because it had so much in it that you love? This book did it for me (and I read the palpable, papery version). Technology, books, libraries, museums, secret societies, puzzles, typefaces, design, art, and yes - knitting (brief, but I got a kick out of it). In short, it was a nod to the things that you read as a child which profoundly affected you and will always be a part of you. And it was about friendship, too. Great, gorgeous read, and it left me smiling. When's your next one out, Mr. Sloan?

B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin deserves his double Rs.  A Dance With Dragons has only two drawbacks. One, readers must wait at least until 2015 for the publication of the next title in the series.  Another, in comparison other books of similar genre seem juvenile, or inane, or both. As with the previous books in the series, the story is enthralling and the political maneuvering of the characters intense.  Fantasy aside and besides the scientific bent of the maesters, correspondence to actual medieval life is thoroughly satisfying.<br />[[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire, Books 1-4 (A Game of Thrones / A Feast for Crows / A Storm of Swords / Clash of Kings)]]

B006VGGAC4|3.0|I have always been a fan of Arnold's movies, though he always seemed like he had a huge ego and a big mouth, and of course I was just as grossed out by the affair he had with the housekeeper as everyone else.  The book didn't change my mind about his ego and mouth, but it did make me see a softer side that made me like him more.  The pictures in the book are great, the ones of him holding his newborns on his chest while they slept were touching.  I was amazed by how he grew up and what his early life was like, and even more amazed at how he really visualized what he wanted in life and just went for them with single-minded purpose.<br /><br />The parts about bodybuilding and his political career tend to drag on.  He goes into great detail about his workouts and his thought processes and that was not so interesting. The parts about his life in general, meeting Maria, meeting and hanging out with her family, etc., were what I bought the book for and I found those parts very interesting.

The past few years have proven to be a bit of a disappointment, but this book will stand the test of time. It is the closest thing to a classic that has been produced probably since the 90s as far as teen fiction is concerned. It does contain some heavy subject material, though, and is likely more appropriate for older teen and adult audiences.

B009CCBCU4|5.0|The Highlander, The Rise of the Aztecs<br />  By Zoe Saadia<br /><br />Reviewed by R. Murry<br /><br />  The Highlander is a well thought out historical novel that portrays real people doing what their nation-tribes have done for years.  The main characters are young leaders breaking out into their own pre-determined adventures.<br /><br />  The elders are determined to control their situations in the world.  The young people (Coyotl, Kuini, and Izrac) rebel that world in their own way to change it for others and themselves.<br /><br />  Ms. Saadia brings this out in detailed conversations and confrontations that propels this intriguing developed story forward, keeping the reader's attention.  The reader will not be bored with historical data.<br /><br />  The young people are the future and the only names that are important: Coyotle, the emperor's first born son, wants to change the way things are done - social reform.  Kuini, the great warlord's son, wants to change breakdown bearers between peoples.  Iztac, the princess, wants to liberate herself and others from their bondage to the way men think.<br /><br />  Zoe Saadia makes their points clear, using well developed conversations.  Although these young people are not Aztecs, they see common ground in others, where the elders don't.  Especially Kuini, The Highlander, in his confrontations and communal exchanges with the only Aztec - The Aztec Warlord.  To a point, the Aztec influences Kuini's decisions. Against the Aztec and his father's wishes, Kuini becomes a warrior in Coyotl's father's army - their enemy.<br /><br />  In this end is a new beginning for Coyotl and Kuini, which may include princess Iztac. Fate will determine that end.<br /><br />  Saadia's novel is an excellent lead in to the next chapter of the lives of these three young leaders.  I for one will continue to read the series, because of the enjoyable read of book #1.  Will you?
B000056JYC|5.0|I loved Frampton in the 70's and love him now.  He gets better with age. Hopo he sells more albums.  Just the greatest.
B008SVFX96|5.0|This is a great album, Richie brought us the best of him. I would like to see him in concert. Thank you.
0606235434|5.0|Book what I expected. Hard cover and in perfect condition. If your into martial arts or a big fan of Bruce Lee I recommended you buy this book.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I have read all Harry Potter books two times, and i thoroughly enjoyed them. I needed to read this book even after reading the reviews. The reviewers seemed concerned about the use of the \\"f\\" word. I read all the time, and that didn't even show up on my radar. My problem with the book was that I really did not care for any of the characters so I could care less about what was happening to them. I only finished the book because I had started it. I have to say I was disappointed. I hope Rowling will write another book with characters like Harry,Rob, and Hermoine(my personal favorite) in an unknown world. Harry Potter was magical.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it worked fine until last update but since then it starts to act like its downloading and then stops. i used it all the time for music but now i have no resource for music without paying. PLEASE FIX IT!!!!!!!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was extremely exciting, mysterious and had a lot of surprises.  The scenery was extraordinary and the screen effects were beautiful.<br />I'm sorry to see the series be over.  Thank you Amazon for getting me a great price and fast delivery.
B004J4WLPU|1.0|I was extremely confused and disappointed in this story.  It's about a sister that is trying to find out who killed her sister after it had been ruled a homicide and it's anecdotes of the surviving sister talking to the inspector about all she's done to find the murderer, but then the end is so confusing that I couldn't understand if the whole thing was in the sister's mind or not.  Very disappointing.  I hate wasting all the time reading a book that ends so bizarrely.  Would not recommend it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Too many new stories  were involved.  like the deathly  <br />  hollows it just kept on and on.<br /> i  do admit  it keeps  me guessing
B000001FKY|5.0|This is an essential album to have in one's collection if you are in any way a DEF fan - I have no idea how I overlooked it for so long. Glad I was still able to get it!
B009B50QOU|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from the first album in this 3 part offering. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it sounded like old Green Day (Dookie, and before). Definitely worth the price I paid, which was $5.00!!
B00846REIS|4.0|this is written almost too similar to 50 shades of gray but i like the story better than the other because it's got more to it that just repetitive sex
B004A8EI9M|2.0|It's a shame, really...  The first few episodes had enough depth to give me some hope that this wouldn't be \\"just another zombie show.\\"  The writers even managed a few sympathetic portrayals of the Big Bad Monsters, effectively reminding the audience of their lost humanity and taking things beyond the realm of cheap horror-show thrills.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />(Hey, you know there was a \\"but\\" coming...)<br /><br />A successful TV show should do two things consistently:<br /><br />1) Develop likeable characters, and<br />2) Present a strong plot.<br /><br />No complaints on the characters; there are enough quirky personalities there to work with.  Unfortunately, blood and guts and severed limbs have taken the place of a decent plot, and the increasingly farcical appearance of moaning, slavering idiots rapidly devolves from creepy to funny to just plain boring.  Every decent director should know that an unseen (or rarely glimpsed) movie monster is much scarier than one that's constantly in your face.  Yet what do we have?  Herds and herds of zombies shambling around in every episode, boring the audience to tears.<br /><br />With all due respect to the long-standing cinematic zombie tradition, that just sucks.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This Ridley Scott movie leaves me thinking that \\"Alien\\" was a simple fairy tale. This was more suspenseful than \\"Alien,\\" and more action packed and scarier than any sci fi movie I've seen since the late 50s. The special effects and CG were mind-blowing. The Iceland location shots, spectacular. It was like a good novel. -- I couldn't put it down until it finished. I'll be watching it again soon. There was so much going on, I'm sure I missed lots of interesting stuff.
B001MDXOBQ|5.0|This an amazing album start to finish. Not a bad song on the album. One of the best songs on the album: The Faded Line!
B007TK77QE|5.0|The book was great. Rowling shows that she masters adult fiction at least as well as youth fiction. Buy the book if you feel like doing it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I just received this book and have not had a chance to read it, But any book Jo Nesbo writes is always a stay up all night page turner.
B002HFJ77S|3.0|I read her books between heavier works.  She writes very light, frothy novels which are very predictable.  Despite this I find them amusing and fun.
034580404X|5.0|Really enjoyed all 3 books. I would so love to see book 4 come out with Christian Grey's view.. I would so recommend these books.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|Marvel Has awesome superheros and Daredevil is one of them. Ben Affleck plays Dredevil and he's awesome at it. Jennifer Garner plays Elektra and she is awesome and georgeous in her outfit. Collin Ferlle Plays Draedevils Main Nemisesse Bullseye and he rocks and Michael Clark Duncan Plays the Most Dangerous and powerful Villian in the marvel universe The Kingpin. Though the Kingpins is White i still don't think you could of picked a better actor to play The Kingpin but Michael Clark Duncan. and when are they going to Make Dredevil 2. I hope they keep all of the original actors if they do make a sequel. This movie is awesome. The action is awesome the costumes are awesome and so is the story and actors.  If you have not seen this movie then you should. one thing i don't understand if the movie companies are all set on blu rays then why don't they put the special features from the two-disc special edition dvds on the blu-rays. isn't blu ray supposed to hold more and be alot better than dvd. oh, well guess you can't get everything. don't see how hard that would be. spend more money and get less. thats the only complain i have about this blu ray. i have the two-disc special edition of this movie and i want the blu ray but i'm loosing all the special features.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoyed the Misborn trilogy and decided to give this a try. It is well written and creatively conceived. I only wish there were more completed books in the series.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This movie is awesome. i loved the original alot and i love this one to. i liked how it was not as much of a reemake but more of a reebot. like they did not redo the same story. i liked how the maine characters followed the book to find the center of the earth. this is a great family film full of wonder and excitement. who knows maybe there is another world within ours. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Waiting for the sequel. Well done. Some sadness on the characters.<br />Good holiday read for kids in high school.<br />Au revoir
B0094BB4TW|2.0|only loads the first page of news feed and then wont load anything else. uninstalled and reinstalled app and still not working.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first one and loved it, better than the movie.  Had to get the second one, so at 1am I finished the second book and couldn't wait till morninbg to start the 3rd book.  I recommend them to everyone, my 12 year old nephew also read them and loved them.  Read it you won't be sorry.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|Entertaining introduction for non-verbal comunication. Offers themes that fasinate the reader with non-verbal comunication and makes You to want more. The book contains exellent photographs that makes it very easy to understand the examples and the bibliogarphy offers the reader a wide range of exellent further reading.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got this game Bc 1i love Perry 2 I played the free one also Bc I have a Perry pet (pillow) so if u like where is my water I am sure u will like this 2 :)
B003X27L9U|5.0|This story is shocking, depressing and sad but brilliantly written. If you have kids you wont sleep for a while, just considering what the author puts her characters through will make you shudder, a book to make you think through consequences and Thank God for the life you have.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I found the book to be somewhat interesting.  The story flowed and I was able to keep tract of the characters.  At times, the vocabulary was a bit too flowery.  It seemed more like a narrative of the social classes rather than a novel.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|Great movie. Definitley not a kid's version of Snow White.  Keeps you engaged, not bored. Hope there is a sequel.
B003SI9WYG|2.0|I thought this was a Halloween animation project. It's really a Christmas musical.  It doesn't really fit either holiday.  Not Tim Burton's work in my mind.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Although you might think it strange given the many Emmys associated with this show, my wife and I just discovered it recently during the summer \\"drought\\" of shows. In short, it deserves its awards.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This is the first music by Pink that I have bought.  I love the whole album. Every song is really good.  The price made it so that I could purchase this a good price and if I didn't like it no big deal.  Great music at a great price.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book I fabulous. Its very engaging (didn't want to stop reading. Its similar to another series I recently read however crossfire had a better story line. Hope there is another one in the works!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I have used this box with the following:<br />i5 2400 3.1Ghz CPU<br />16GB Kingston HyperX DDR3 1333Mhz<br />60GB OCZ Vertex 3 SSD<br />160GB Velociraptor for Steam games<br />Gigabyte Radeon HD7850 2GB<br />Samsung Blu-Ray reader/DVD Burner<br /><br />I have used this to play all my games.

B000002GK1|5.0|Though 1994's \\"Superunknown\\" is generally looked upon as Soundgarden's apex, 1991's \\"Badmotorfinger\\" is the album that put Soundgarden on every rock fan's radar, and is arguably their \\"purest\\" album.<br /><br />Production:<br />Like their previous releases, Badmotorfinger (BMF) is full of grinding guitars, wailing vocals, and edgy rhythmic chaos. However, unlike their early records, BMF refuses to drift off into aimless murky garage-metal (like in \\"Ultramega OK\\") or delve into raunchy, ugly subject matter (check out \\"Louder than Love\\"). While those two records definitely had their share of fantastic material, BMF's consistency and overall musical quality leap galaxies ahead of its two predecessors. This is thanks, in no small part, to its razor-sharp production, which manages to keep the guitars clanking and grinding like chainsaws, and the amazing vocals WAYY up front. By 1991, Cornell had finally found his \\"sweet spot\\" as far as his singing capabilities go. He had found a balance between hitting high notes and giving his singing patterns the hooks they needed. Kim Thayil's monstrous guitars are right where they should be, and the rhythm section of the band is mixed in appropriately to keep a firm, rock-solid pace to each and every performance.<br /><br />Material:<br />As stated before, BMF finds Soundgarden at a very balanced stage in their career. The songs are still riff-driven, but the riffs contain hooks that far \\"outshine\\" the (occasionally) overblown Sabbath-esque riffage of their early career. \\"Rusty Cage\\" is arguably the best album opener of its kind, with a squalling-yet-distant opening riff that evolves into a quirky, fast-paced metal gem. \\"Outshined\\" contains possibly the most catchy metal riff EVER outside of the standard 4/4 timing. But in true Soundgarden fashion, the song doesn't feel off-beat or unnatural at all. \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" starts with a slow bass riff and a chiming guitar noise before becoming a familiar-yet-inspired rock music beast. \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" is absolutely mindblowing, and from start to finish will have your head spinning like the helicopter blade-like beat that fuels it. \\"Face Pollution\\" is punk-rock inspired, and is mostly in average territory, but it's still fun to listen to. \\"Somewhere\\" is where Soundgarden starts to experiment with both psychedelia and alternate tunings, thanks to the Eastern-influenced songwriting of new bassist Ben Shepherd, who introduced some truly vital elements to the band. \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" is a foreshadowing of the dark, unsettling atmosphere that would dominate their next album, and it's a very intriguing listen. \\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\\" is a Thayil-dominated rocker that will have old-school metal fans banging their heads until it ends. \\"Mind Riot\\" slows the tempo down and reminds me almost of a pop-punk song, had it not been for the atonal-yet-melodic guitars, and it's one of their most underrated numbers. \\"Drawing Flies\\" is a balls-out bluesfest, this time written by drummer Matt Cameron. \\"Holy Water\\" is very disconcerting and discordant, and its subject matter only makes it more disturbing. That said, it's melody will get under your skin with repeated listens. \\"New Damage\\" is possibly the most abrasive song on the album (besides \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\") and I didn't particularly care for it, although it's not a bad song per se.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The album cover itself is one of the most memorable I've seen, with a bizarre cyclone-like symbol superimposed over what looks like a shot of an audience at one of their shows. The font used for the band's name is my personal favorite, and I even drew an identical logo on my backpack in high school with white-out. The booklet contains all of the lyrics from every song, although you have to open the entire sleeve because the lyrics are written entirely horizontally. The band shot is one of my favorites, with Chris donning a bad-ass \\"Soundgarden\\" leather jacket, and Matt striking a \\"I'm too sexy for my tight pants\\" pose. It's the perfect representation of a band who's finally hit their confident stride.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This was the first Soundgarden album I've owned, and I don't regret it one bit. Although it's not my favorite Soundgarden album, I do believe it is the most representative of their fundamental sound. In a year where more popular bands from Seattle were changing the world with albums dominated by anthems (Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\"), Soundgarden took a decidedly different route and released this noisy, balls-to-the-wall gem. Although they didn't achieve worldwide recognition until 1994, BMF still stands as perhaps every metalhead's favorite grunge album, and is arguably the heaviest album to come out of Seattle. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br />\\"Rusty Cage\\"<br />\\"Outshined\\"<br />\\"Jesus Christ Pose\\"<br />\\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\"<br />\\"Mind Riot\\"<br /><br />Final Score: 9.2/10<br /><br />Fun Fact: This album landed a spot in Guitar World's Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time, at #45 (beating Metallica's \\"Black Album\\"). :D
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|reminds me when I would take the kids to an arcade and spend $20 to win $2 prize- just crazy fun!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Ms. Rowling's previous well known output had no bearing at all on the pleasures to be found in The Casual Vacancy.  I found The Casual Vacancy to be a psychological page turner.  I couldn't wait for each additional detail to be revealed about her score or so of richly drawn, credible and complex characters.  Her portrait of adolescent turmoil and miscalculation is every bit as astute and compelling as her portrait of a decades on marriage.  I preordered the book out of curiosity and was richly rewarded. Knowledge only makes me a fan.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Loved this movie- I was prepared to be disappointed as I am a major fan of the original Dark Shadows- A totally different, fun and very creative take from the original- Tim Burton does not disappoint! The sets, makeup, special effects, cast, direction is incredible! My only two dissapointments: Alice Cooper was cut in the middle of his performance- At the very least, he should been allowed to finish and given more time- And, more time given to the original cast- Afterall, they were the ones responsible for the Success of Dark Shadows- if you blinked you probably missed the fabulous Jonathan Frid, the original Barnabas- All in all, it is a fun movie for everyone- Perhaps there will be a sequel!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Addictive and extremely aggravating!  You work so long and hard to get all prizes in a tier; only to see the last one go off the side.  Most prizes are dropped to the sides where it is impossible to collect.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. Highly addictive as I read it three time in a row. There was an error in the Kindle edition that repeated part of a chapter so I bought the actual book to have a copy that didn't have the error in it. I'm so excited for the \\"Walking Disaster\\" to come out next spring and promise if you like most of us have ever fallen in love with a bad boy or an intense all consuming love this book will certainly bring back some great memories!![[ASIN:1476712042 Beautiful Disaster: A Novel]]

1475143389|5.0|Mike sorts out the differences to achieve an athletic body. I've spent seven years on PTs, masses of litterature, 100 of hours reading through articles on the web and I can assure that Mike is spot on. After three months I compare the results of my training before and after BLS. I use Jefit since 12 months so I get a very good picture of my progress.<br /><br />The most striking development is that I have increased my muscle strength with 10-20% with half of the volume I was lifting before. This means less time spent in gym, avoiding to get chronic pain in shoulders and lower back and psychologically easier to maintain discipline and endurance.<br /><br />I also changed my eating habits radically. From low carb and low GI to a more balanced menue. I used to suffer from viruses and catching could every third month due to not getting enough energy for my training, which of course lead to unnecessary halts in the training. Now I have perfect health.<br /><br />The best thing however is that my grilfriend says that my body looks better and more muscular than ever before. Now she starts Mikes &#34;Thinner, Leaner Stronger&#34; profram for woman.<br /><br />Thank you Mike!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I wish I could say this was a good book. There were certainly part of Pines that kept the reader in suspense and were real page turners. I pushed forward looking for the next of those moments, but all-in-all the book did not have a complete coherence.<br /><br />The main character is a hero, but a failure. Most of the people in the book are shallow and the plot lacks much depth.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|No sophomore slump here.  Mumford delivers a very enjoyable album.  I originally was not big on \\"I Will Wait\\", but listening to it in context with the whole album, its now one of my favorite songs.  The Paul Simon cover is just a great bonus.
B007THA4FI|4.0|At first; I did not like the story; however, I found the author engaging and the more I read the more I became hooked on pursuing the story.  I gave it a 4 because the writng was excellent however not necessarily my usual type of novel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a calculator application that does what a calculator is supposed to do.  It does it simply and it does it well.  I downloaded it the morning I was to help a friend negotiate the payments on a car she was buying and it was very helpful.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|Well written, good special effects, nice pace, bring the popcorn.  Downey and Law have a good movie buddy relationship.  The Sherlock movies have been fun, engaging, not predictable
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Great cover/case.  Fits my Kindle FireHD perfectly.  Works nicely as a stand too!  Would have liked a deeper shade of red, but that was not an available color option.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Having read the last several works by Child, I now find the theme to be oft-repeated to the point of \\"ho-hum\\" mundane...Jack's hitching across some dark flat land of Kansas, Oklahoma, now Iowa, it's always \\"dark\\" he gets picked up, meets FBI chicks, searches for bad guys to head off a catastrophe...ending up inside a dark behemoth of an abandoned, discarded federal building...in the middle of frippin' \\"nowhere\\"...end of story.
B008NABUU8|2.0|The controls are very difficult. It is impossible to see where the construction material is at any given time (as it is under your finger), and with no &quot;snapping&quot; and an unhelpful grid (non-symmetrical and without indication of center), it is nearly impossible to do.<br />I had also hoped that there would be some kind of learning curve. However, no learning about bridges was to be had.<br />The one bright point of this game is the color change shown based on the stress each section experiences as vehicles move over it.
B009LAP7OE|5.0|I love this show. I love that they have regina's mom in this season and a whole lot of new characters. Can't wait to see how it all plays out!

B005KTZ05G|5.0|Great product, incredible amount of joints. Much more than when I was a kid. I purchased it to use as a model to reproduce a full sized costume for my nephew (10 years old, not used professionally). The details and layers were amazing, I was able to use a magnifying glass and recreate the intricate details of the buckles. All in all, awesome. There were one's way more expensive, but I don't see why anyone would need something beyond this one.

B008KMHFJY|3.0|I read this book because the reviews were generally good. It was said to be a YA version of 50 shades. I liked the characters the book was well written however, after 50 shades I cannot read YA, I couldn't relate to the characters but that's expected since I am not YA anymore. I love a good romance and this book did have me going.

B000JCK3ZG|2.0|A movie like this should appeal to both fans of the comics and folks whom have never read the comics, and only know the x-men from the previous movies.  I believe it fails both of these audience segments.  Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of Scott's death, which then effects the lack of tension between Logan, Jean, and Scott.  Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of Professor Xavier's death.  Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of rogue taking the cure.  Non-comics fans will be like, \\"why the hell does Jean just stand there all the time?  Where did all the really important characters from the previous movies go?  Why does a man that just moved an entire bridge ever lose any battles?  If I was this let down, how must the comic book fans feel?\\"

B0026145WK|4.0|A little short on the \\"believability\\" side , but GREAT on \\"possibility\\" side . i mean COULD one REALLY pull off all those stunts and action a Liam Neeson does  ; its POSSIBLE , thoe not truly believable . HOWEVER , the THINKING side ; father lost daughter to criminals ; OH YEAH !! all that destruction and MAYHEM is possible . i would give this movie 10 stars for keeping the action in  REAL WORLD . the ACTION is excellent and done with MUCH forethought and planning . Liam's character chases down a CARTEL of sex slavers wrecking half of FRANCE to find his daughter ; simple , basic theme covering all human time and emotion .<br />  if you want explosions and \\"RAMBO\\" , it aint here , AND still gives you a similar feel . \\"Never mess with mama bear\\" a common phrase .... well , watch this movie and see what POPPA BEAR might well do . OH YEAH !! not enough humor , is my only true complaint . too intense too long and still movie compels one to watch it over again .<br />  STUDY for the underlying REDEMPTION idea woven in story base . Many a blue collar guy will feel a good ARGH ARGH !! POWER !! near the end .<br />  POP the KORN and enjoy a wild ride where the GOOD GUY WINS .

B008XNZMOU|5.0|I think Taylor will be able to please both her old fans and gain new fans with this new album. It album has songs that are reminiscent of her most popular album, Fearless, while also including songs that are different from the sound we are used to hearing from her. Overall, I think it has the perfect combination of country and pop, and will definitely be on repeat for the next few months.<br /><br />1. State of Grace (4/5) - A heavily drum-based song, this song is definitely different than any other Taylor song. But I like it because it carries a good tune and it's different from what you would usually hear on a Taylor song.<br />2. Red (5/5) - One of my favorites. There's some banjo accompanying the song, but the song as a whole is far from being country. The chorus is ridiculously catchy, and this song can easily be put on repeat.<br />3. Treacherous (4/5) - A softer song that didn't stand out at first, but after listening to it a couple more times, I'm starting to like it more because of it's simplicity.<br />4. I Knew You were Trouble (5/5) - The song ranges so much in emotion, style, and pace, listening to it is like riding an emotional rollercoaster.<br />5. All too Well (5/5) - My favorite song from the album. More pop than country, I love the beats that carry the song and the emotion that transpires through Taylor's voice as she sings.<br />6. 22 (4/5) - I might be biased on my opinion of this song because I'm 22, but the lyrics seem to say exactly what I feel at times. Upbeat song that reminds me of chill Friday nights.<br />7. I Almost Do (2/5) - This song doesn't stand out much, but I guess the lyrics will speak to those who aren't just yet completely over their exes.<br />8. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (4/5) - To be honest, I didn't like this song when it first started playing on the radio. I thought the lyrics were under-par. But I'm not going to deny that it's a pretty catchy song, and the more I heard it, the more it grew on me. Perfect angry song to sing along to.<br />9. Stay Stay Stay (2/5) - Sadly my least favorite song on this album. It reminds me of something that could be on Taylor's first album. It's more country than the other songs on the album, and the lyrics are a bit on the immature side.<br />10. The Last Time (4/5) - This is the duet with the lead singer of Snow Patrol. It's a bit on the slow side, but I love the chorus. Reminds me of Breathe from Fearless.<br />11. Holy Ground (3/5) - This song doesn't stand out much, but it's fast paced and intense.<br />12. Sad Beautiful Tragic (3/5) - The slowest song on the album, this song reminds me of Dear John, which I was never a big fan of.<br />13. The Lucky One (2/5) - Another one of those songs that doesn't exactly stand out.<br />14. Everything Has Changed (5/5) - The duet with Ed Sheeran is nothing but win for me. This song ranges more on the acoustic side, and is simple in both its tune and lyrics. For fans who love some acoustic guitar as part of a song, this will be a sure win. It's one of those Sunday morning kind of songs.<br />15. Starlight (5/5) - A happy song overall, I like it because it's fast, upbeat, and echoes the feelings of being in a budding relationship.<br />16. Begin Again (5/5) - Another one of my favorite songs. It's a slower song with a peaceful melody. The song starts with Taylor echoing memories of a failed relationship that has her thinking relationships are bound for doom. But as the song progresses, she starts to see things in a new light and hope is once again revived. I really like it because it reminds me of Taylor's old songs like `Love Story' or `Fearless'.gry song to sing along to.<br />9. Stay Stay Stay (2/5) - Sadly my least favorite song on this album. It reminds me of something that could be on Taylor's first album. It's more country than the other songs on the album, and the lyrics are a bit on the immature side.<br />10.

B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick Lamar made a dent in the Hip Hop world with his mixtape Overly Dedicated back in 2010. In 2011 came the release of his highly acclaimed album Section.80 featuring immaculate production, great conceptual stories and high caliber lyricism from Kendrick Lamar. What makes Kendrick so appealing to me is the fact that he is from Compton, California, a place where a typical rapper would glorify the lifestyles of the hood such as gangs, drug dealers, being tough, etc. however Kendrick is quite the opposite of your stereotypical rapper from the CPT; he covers multiple topics of the hood from different angles from male and female perspectives as well as in first and third person view. Kendrick is quite the lyrical tyrant, and at the age of 25, his subject matter is very mature for his age. In an age where Hip Hop is being saturated with rappers such as the horrible French Montana, Lil B and Lil Wayne clones, Kendrick Lamar as well as his Top Dawg Entertainment family is slowly helping resurge lyrical Hip Hop with great content that kids could benefit from hearing in the near future.<br /><br />As for the album, \\"good kid, m.A.A.d city\\" is the major label debut album of Kendrick under the multi-platinum juggernaut Aftermath Entertainment, a label created by Dr. Dre whom has helped spawned successful careers for artists such as Eminem, 50 Cent and another Compton Rapper The Game with \\"The Documentary\\". Aftermath Entertainment has had a history in the past of signing artists, but never generating any solid album releases which include Raekwon, Rakim & Bishop Lamont; but luckily for Kendrick, Dr. Dre has faith in the fellow Compton MC to the point of releasing albums for him as soon as possible, which is rarely seen from the good doctor with the exception of Eminem or 50 Cent. This album is a concept album covering certain aspects of Kendrick's childhood living in Compton as well as his affiliations with his ghetto peers and family which is clearly heard  throughout. This album serves as reflective journal of Lamar's experiences growing up whether it be about drugs, women, thug life or just self-insecurities and aspirations, this is a very cohesive project that will surely expose Kendrick to a broader audience as well as give his loyal fans some new material to vibe to.<br /><br />Track By Track Review<br />1) Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter - A great introduction track that serves as the opening sequence to the story. The story follows a young Kendrick falling for a girl named Sherane and all adult acts that follow. The character of Sherane pops out throughout the entire album either a person based on a real-life girl of Kendrick's or as a metaphor for the hood of Compton being the temptress trying to pull Kendrick into the darkside. As the story continues Kendrick steals the van and gets ambushed by some hoodlums in black hoodies. His parents than gives him a call and ask where he is at. As a song, its not great but as an intro to the album it works. 3/5<br /><br />2) B**** Don't Kill My Vibe - this song reminded me why I didn't like Kendrick from first listen back then, his voice can be awkwardly strange at times, and the hook for this song exemplifies that. But now that I have listened to Kendrick for almost 1 year and a half now, I've learn to listen past it. The song is nice and catchy with beautiful strings in production, Any Hip Hop song that takes time to incorporate real instruments into a song is always commendable. In this song Kendrick is basically reflecting his inner thoughts about his past and new found fame. 5/5<br /><br />3) Backseat Freestyle - Kendrick just going off bars for bars on the GOOD Music Producer Hit-Boy track. The only flaw I find with this song is that I find it more fitting on a mixtape rather than on an album. However, if you listen to the skits before and after, than the context of this song fits perfectly. But as a stand alone song, the production by Hit-Boy wasn't mindblowing to me butat least it wasn't complacent the whole way through. Kendrick Lamar was on his ignorant ish and even had his 2Pac moments haha.  3.5/5<br /><br />4) The Art of Peer Pressure - Great track, a story of a young boy riding around with the big boys getting caught up in grown man business. The story of how innocence can easily be lost when influenced by the wrong group of people, or in this case \\"the homies\\". Although the title does indicate the act of a person being pressured, the lyrics tell otherwise. As the story goes on, you realize that the character isn't actually being pressured at all, he just acts and adapts to the lifestyle he is surrounded by, but the interesting thing is that he never resists, he deems it as normal activity just because he grew up in that environment. Kendrick is always in top form when he is telling a story and this song is no different, the dark and eerie production adds great dramatic effect to the song as well. 5/5<br /><br />5) Money Trees feat. Jay Rock- If you are a Kendrick fan prior to this album than this song will feel right at home with you. This song kind of takes me back to his Overly Dedicated days with the mellow beat as well as a funny adolescent hook that Kendrick likes to do. It's nice to finally have his fellow Black Hippy partner Jay Rock on a Kendrick Lamar album because he was M.I.A on Overly Dedicated and Section.80, which was understandable but also felt incomplete (to me anyways).  I love the song for what it is; it's one of my personal favorites that I love to bump in the car. Ya Bisshhhh. 5/5<br /><br />6) Poetic Justice feat. Drake - Kendrick is known for his smooth and rapid flow, this song is a perfect example of that simple fact. Has a very sexy Janet Jackson sample roaming in the back ground, this song caters to the ladies in a sensual matter. It's rare these days to have a love song from a rapper that doesn't contains lyrics that refer to their male genitalia all the time, but like the title implies, this song is like a love letter to the females in a poetic manner. I prefer this Drake over braggadocios Drake any day..If there's one topic Drake can be consistent with, its women. The only complaint from me was that the hook could've been executed better, I would've actually preferred for Drake to try to come up for a hook for this song. This is an obvious next single so expect to hear this song a lot in the near future.  4/5<br /><br />7) good kid - Continuing from the last songs skit, here is where the story comes back into narrative and the concept of the album really comes to fruition. Produced by the legendary Pharrell, you just can't go wrong with that featuring a very eerie clarinet. Great lyricism from Kendrick and even Pharrell even contributes on the songs hook.  4/5<br /><br />8) m.A.A.d city feat. MC Eiht - The song for the Hoodlums. This song is maniacal with so many different things going on. Schoolboy Q's signature \\"YAWK YAWK\\" is hilariously incorporated within the song. Kendrick documenting the things he has seen and experienced in the mad city of Compton filled with bloods and crips running around, seeking vengeance, and even Kendrick's experience with laced marijuana which is what actually drove him to sobriety (true story). Mid-Song the song shifts into a different monster; the legendary MC Eiht makes an appearance and drops a little knowledge of the OG lifestyle. The 2nd half has also has 90's westcoast production with synthesizers and talk-box vocals. I loved the track, one of the best on the album. 5/5<br /><br />9) Swimming Pools (Drank) - The single that has taken the country by storm. Great production by T-Minus, great verses from Kendrick albeit a little short and an incredibly catchy hook. The album version contains an extra verse which makes the song that much better for me personally, and the skit at the end ties in with the album concept. One of my favorites of the album despite it being a little overplayed. 5/5<br /><br />10) Sing About Me/I'm Dying of Thirst - Running for 12 minutes, this is the longest track on the album as well as one of the most complex. These are 2 songs merged into one, but if you're listening to the album in its entirety than I doubt that you would even notice. \\"Sing About Me\\" tells the stories of 2 different people. It's hard sometimes to really pinpoint the perspective of the story because each verse feels like it is about someone different, 1st verse tells about a character that got shot from the previous song's skit. The 2nd Verse was a bit of a surprise because it connects with his previous album Section.80, and apparently whoever this character is, is the sister of Keisha.  The song is very bi-polar as well, once it switches up it goes from good to sad which is what I'm pretty sure what Kendrick intended. \\"I'm Dying of Thirst\\" contains a mix message that I still can't decipher, but the theme of this portion of the song is death and rebirth. I love songs that make me want to listen over and over and try to figure out what the story is. 5/5<br /><br />11) Real feat. Anna Wise - First I wanna say that the person who produced this song, Terrace Martin, is probably one of my favorite producers as of now. Fans know that Terrace produced \\"Ab-Soul's Outro\\" on Section.80, which was a masterfully crafted song that was essentially a jazz instrumental, and my personal favorite song on Section.80. This song feels like a dream, the light production with light clashes with the cymbals in the production. The only complaint I have with this song is the overly simplistic hook by Anna Wise, it felt lazy and uninspiring just reiterating \\"I'm real, I'm really really real\\". It was an extremely boring hook man and I just can't seem to force myself to like it. The end of the song also features an emotional skit of Kendrick's mom, just speaking to him. There is just something emotional of the words that the mother was speaking, it's a word of encouragement for Kendrick to become a man and leave behind the world he has grown accustomed to but never forget it and just become a role model for the kids tryna make it out of the same situation. It reminds me of the little monologue from (Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins) \\"A man is just flesh and blood and can be ignored or destroyed. But as a symbol... as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, everlasting\\". 4/5<br /><br />12) Compton feat. Dr. Dre - The last track of the album features the Godfather of everything Compton, the legendary Dr. Dre. As the closing track, Kendrick and Dre go back and forth to celebrate the city of Compton. I believe that this song ended the album perfectly, however I find the song to feel a bit generic at times. Not taking anything away from the song, because Just Blaze did an incredible job on the production. 3/5<br /><br />After listening to the album multiple times, I have to say that Kendrick created an amazing album thats consistent, diverse and substantial. The mini interludes mixed between songs really enhance the story Kendrick is trying to tell and each and every song just flows seamlessly.  For me personally, I will still rank Section.80 slightly above this album, mainly because I felt that Section.80 was more ambitious as far as production and storylines. But I still love this album, this is a great debut album for (the still growing) Kendrick Lamar, while I may not say this is a classic album just yet like I'm sure many Kendrick Lamar fans may try to imply, I will say that this is easily the best mainstream hip hop album of 2012. #HiiiPoWerng is like a love letter to the females in a poetic manner.

030758836X|4.0|I found the book to be thrilling and chilling all at the same time. The premeditation in this book is startling yet believable enough that you find yourself admitting you thought out some of these things. You wouldn't have the foresight or patience for carrying out this scheme....or would you?
B005IQZB14|5.0|Bravo Cheryl!  Having done what I set out to do myself once upon a time...  Without regret Cheryl Strayed writes an honest tale. Humans should read this to aide our understanding of peace, trust, and humanity.

B005XQ973M|5.0|This book gives a very vivid picture of the atrocities commetted by the Japanese Military with the blessing of both higher military authority and the Japanese government. It also points out the fact that even today the Japanese continue to try and revise history and  either put the blame on someone else or claim that it never happened.<br /><br />Very few Japenese were convicted of war crimes. This may be because of the fear that Communisim might spread out into the Pacific through Japan, from either China or the USSR. And it was felt that Japan was needed as an allie to prevent this from happening. This seems to makes the allies a party to the Japanese Holoccost, if only by omission, in which more human lives were destoyed than in the Holocost in Europe.<br /><br />If your a history buff, this is the book for you. If your not this book may give you better insight into how a nation can teach racial hatered to its military so that the individual solder will look upon anyone who is different either racially or ethnically as something other than human, something to murder and rape with out thought or pitty.
B008133JZG|5.0|I really loved this series...sad we don't get it here in the states, but happy they have it on netflix and amazon prime for free viewing. after seeing this series and then the new one \\"elementary\\" just coming out...this one makes the other one not so good. just the way they put together the thought process of sherlock is great..and the actors are awesome too! even though there are only a couple of shows per series, i like it cause sherlock does take a liovie more time to develop and it's like a mini movie every time!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the publicity, soon to be a movie....my reading group decided to give it a try. I just read the first book and it was enough!!!! Couldn't get into the book 2 and 3.... Shallow characters, sex,sex and more sex.... just disgusting....I do not have enough words to describe how bad this book is.  Giving an Oscar to a porn movie and writing a good review of this book is the same thing. No wonder why sex is the best business in the whole world. I'm sure the movie will be a success and make lots of money just not from me.... The author is repetitive, Holly crap!!! and Oh shit !!!! are said in the book many many times, Anastasia keeps talking to herself and is just too much.... The whole book she talks to herself!!! Oh Crap!!! Very poor writing style from the author. Grey wants Anastasia to eat so she will be healthy and strong enough for more sex?? and more sex and more sex???  Please do not waste your time in money in this garbage.... there are so many good books out there.... I do not know where all the 5 star reviews come from.....
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I went in without expectations, having had not read the books, and was pleasantly surprised. One could call this the anti-Twilight, with a likeable heroine who's bold, assertive, and can act for herself... unlike a certain Sullen Idiot caught between a sparkly vampire and a mangy dog-boy. The film is well paced, telling the story of a cynical, dystopian world where the deaths of youth are used yearly for entertainment. Jennifer Lawrence fits the leading role quite well.
B007PFD90G|3.0|Too many names, most of which dont mean much to the ordinary reader.<br />Apart from that, very interesting.<br />Freedem to write whatever anybody thinks must be upheld (in my view)
B004UPANAI|3.0|This movie steps back in time and retells the story of Wolverine, the people he knew back in the day, and the reason why he ended up an amnesiac. It has more potential than the film carries out. The movie version of Wolverine is the only version of the character that I can tolerate, but this one, which messes with previous movie continuity and works around with some of the material from the miniseries that revealed the character's hidden past, comes up a bit short, particularly in the depiction of Deadpool. There are some good elements- Taylor Kitch does a reasonably good Gambit, Brian Cox is replaced as a younger version by the always good Danny Huston, and Jackman continues to play the title character with a gruff likeability.
0525952926|4.0|It took me a while to get into this one (I read the first book in the trilogy some time ago, and I was trying to remember the various families, etc.), but then the book 'took off' and was very satisfying! A worthy continuation of \\"Fall of Giants.\\" Follett is amazing in that he keeps track so well of all of his plot threads and sizeable cast of characters! His historical research and richness in details, as always, is first-rate. By way of a criticism, though, I found some of his sexual depictions a bit unsettling, and those seemed to crudely distract from rather than add to the narrative focus. Follett was clever by avoiding a mere re-writing of other classic WW2 historical novels such as \\"The Winds of War\\"--instead, he follows the basic unfolding of the actual historic events and their major players, but stays largely in more 'minor' territory. This made the familiar events seem quite fresh and new! I'm eager and ready now for the 'third act' of this captivating trilogy...
B008673ZAQ|3.0|the novel was more frustrating than sexually charged.  it still has great characters and worth the read.  I just didn't enjoy the storyline as much this go round.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't normally read science fiction books but the reviews on this series were so good I figured I would try something new.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well written each book was and how story came together.  This would be an excellent book to base a Sociology class on.  Great job!
B005DKLPF6|5.0|The fifth opus from Atlanta prog/doom metallers Mastodon differs quite greatly from their last, 2009's \\"Crack The Skye.\\" For starters, it is a significantly heavier and more viscerally-satisfying affair. Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher's massive avalanches of excellent, downtuned, Sabbath-y riffage, and Brann Dailor's bullying, Melvins-esque drumming see to this. Furthermore, 2011's \\"The Hunter\\" is a lot more concise and compact. Indeed, although their arrangements are no less complex or technical, the songwriting has altered this time around, as Mastodon now seem content to just kick out the jams (motha!), trimming down excessive progressive wankery, superfluous fat, and/or ornamental flourishes. The songs' playing times have been trimmed down significantly, too. Whereas \\"Skye\\" had only one track under five-minutes long (and two that were well-over ten-minutes), there are only two tracks, here, that crack the five-minute barrier. All told, \\"The Hunter\\" actually has more in common with 2002's major-length debut, \\"Remission,\\" but even those two are two very different albums. Come to think of it, none of this quartet's records are the exact same. (Hence, if nothing else, they at least deserve credit for never releasing a set of songs that is a simple rehash of any of their previous works.)<br /><br />The ball gets rolling quickly and steadily with \\"Black One,\\" a track that almost sounds as if it could be a b-side from the \\"Leviathan\\" recording sessions. Its thunderous rhythms are comprised of crunching, grumbling bass grooves, jazzy, polyrhythmic drum slamming, and towering sludge metal riffs. But no matter how good this opener is, it is almost (almost, but not quite) overshadowed by its successor, \\"Curl Of The Burl.\\" An abundance of soaring, skyscraper guitar harmonies, instantly memorable choruses, and infectious \\"ooh\\" sing-along refrains make it quite possibly the catchiest and most commercially-accessible (read: hit-single-worthy) tune in the Mastodon playbook to date!<br /><br />\\"Blasteroid\\" again dives back into the muck with sludgy guitar licks and busy, pummeling, rapid-fire drumming. \\"Stargasm\\" continues to stomp you under foot, storming forward with thundering, Southern sludge-filled grooves, grinding, lumbering rhythms, and ultra-hefty bass bottom. Some more epic melodic choruses -- that are soaring and have stadium-sized vocals that are clean without descending into emo-territory -- are blended into the mix, here, though, too. Similarly, the hilariously-named \\"Octopus Has No Friends\\" also has instinctively memorable, cleanly-sung choruses to go along with its usual abundance of ominous doom riffs, beeping, grumbling -- and, at times, almost funky-sounding -- bass lines, and superbly dexterous drumming. And so does \\"All The Heavy Lifting,\\" which features another terrifically catchy and epic chorus that will be bouncing around your head for days. Oh, and how about the tune's crunchy, chunked-up riffing and rolling bass groove, are simply icing on the cake.<br /><br />The album's second half takes on a concertedly more progressive approach, with cuts like the dreamy title track entering the fray. It is an acoustic ballad with shredding, unorthodoxly bluesy soloing, supple crooning, and screaming guitar harmonies. It is also the first epic on the record to be over five-minutes in length. But there is still plenty of heavy stuff to be had, here, too, as \\"Dry Bone Valley,\\" which is a very brisk and bludgeoning number backed by thrashy, fiery, buzzsaw picking and punishing blast beat-esque thudding, proves nicely. And the whammy bar-soaked solo that comes ripping through the mix is simply icing on the cake. \\"Thickening\\" works likewise, fading-in with a melodic guitar and bass intro before suddenly, dramatically flying in the opposite direction, as huge, ultra-tasty, chug and churn guitars (which evoke \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" very closely, by the way) come storming in. A handful of other fairly dazzling solo flights are included, too.<br /><br />Then things briefly go back into experimental territory again, as the listener is dealt a sudden, dramatic curveball in the form of \\"Creature Lives.\\" It has a really trippy, new wave-y intro that would not be out of placed coming off of a Skinny Puppy or KMFDM outing, followed by miles of deliciously melodic guitar and bass work (including tons of stunning, jazzy guitar soloing). And \\"The Hunter\\"'s final remaining piece of pure prog metal -- \\"The Sparrow,\\" a very Pink Floyd-ian, five-and-a-half-minute closing semi-ballad backed by an acoustic intro, harmonic, accompanying bass line, and totally air-guitar-able melodic solo -- comes soon thereafter. But not before the band drop two more absolutely brutal cuts: The merciless and booming \\"Spectrelight\\" and the machine gun drum-driven \\"Bedazzled Fingernals\\" (again, don't let song titles fool you; the music is 100% serious, I swear!).<br /><br />Stripping this review of its fat, Georgia's finest metal collective couldn't suck even if they tried to. This excellent record is but one more piece of evidence of how very true that fact is. It should please all fans of the band and the sludge/doom and progressive metal genres. Plus, if you're new to Mastodon, you could do a lot worse than to start right here, too. So, yeah...definitely \\"Hunt\\" this album down.ded, too.<br /><br />Then things briefly go back into experimental territory again, as the listener is dealt a sudden, dramatic curveball in the form of \\"Creature Lives.\\" It has a really trippy, new wave-y intro that would not be out of placed coming off of a Skinny Puppy or KMFDM outing, followed by miles of deliciously melodic guitar and bass work (including tons of stunning, jazzy guitar soloing).

B004SIIBGU|5.0|very useful app. I use ebay quite frequently so this app comes in lots of handy when I need to check on items I have won ir bidding on. this app also has a lot more features. I highly recommend this app, its a great resource.
0812993292|5.0|I read this book in a couple of days last week - so unassuming - and yet, at the last page what a powerful impact it had.  I always love novels that peel away at the characters and plot, carefully revealing their motivations, weaknesses, and strengths.  I always end up thinking who would play the parts in a film version, so I could share the story with my husband who does not read fiction, though loves watching it on the screen ( poor man, I know).  I settled upon Bill Nighy as Harold and Helen Mirren as Maureen ( though she would need brown hair, I think). And what a great chance for some cameo appearances! For those of us who probably will never get the chance to walk across the English countryside, we could see it through Harold's burgeoning appreciation for what one sees in life when one slows down to walk through it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|fun game by rovio but with a twist,  you actually are playing as the pigs instead of the angry birds. this is another addicting game by Ricki, I would recommend this app to anyone who likes rovio products and its free!
0714864803|5.0|I find the recipes in this book unusual but still down-to-earth. I love the Lebanese kitchen and this book does a great justice to the Lebanese cuisine!
B005HSL626|5.0|I like how you can change your sword, and the background of the game. I also like all of the different game modes you can play to keep the game entertaining. also the game is free. I highly recommend this addicting app!
B000MPOF4K|5.0|I am a fan of most Twinings teas and bought the Traditional Afternoon not having tried it before. I was not disappointed.  I find it is a nice pick-me-up at work in the afternoon.  The only complaint I have is that it is not available in the US.
0525953728|5.0|You will love this book.. it is almost as if you are there. It gives details of the day to day activities.<br /><br />The dedication that takes place in the work day of our Marines and the Seal training - amazing.  It makes you proud of these young Americans.  Bless Seal Team Six.  They are Real Heros.<br /><br />You will be glad you purchased this book.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|As usual, Darren Hardy always has the simple solution to difficult situations. He never fails to deliver an insightful<br />and funny solution to the obstacles we face everyday.  In todays world, with all the challenges there is to overcome,<br />Mr Hardy is always in tune and on top of solutions to these hurdles.  I am very blessed to have been introduced to him and the<br />knowledge is has to share!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Fabulous, just fabulous.  I listen over and over.  Beautiful ballads on this one.  The great shame is the loss of the body of work that Rodriguez would have created if he had had just some success here.  Someone should do an investigative piece on why he didn't make it here.  But so happy we have these two terrific albums.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Although the book was suspenseful.  I found the ending very upsetting I was waiting for justice to be served. On a discussion with several other people who read the book they felt the same way
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez is amazing.  Beautiful music, poetic lyrics and lovely voice -- the whole package.  Can't believe he wasn't a big star here 40 years ago.  But better late than never.  And what a presence.  A guru, actually.
0345803493|2.0|I will admit, the first installment of Fifty Shades had me hooked. I think it was because Christian was so mysterious and Ana was so out of left field that the chemistry building between them kept me hanging on. I really thought the second installment would have done the same. Unfortunately, all I wanted to do was gauge my eyes out with a letter opener. I wanted to stop reading at Chapter 6 but I hung in there and finished the book. I was highly disappointed.<br /><br />First, the sex was over the top and quite repetitive. I really wish the author spaced the sex scenes every 5 chapters or 100 pages. Give us something to work our hormones up to. Alas, that didn't happen. Christian and Ana were having sex every few pages. I wound up skipping over every single sex scene between them. I was tired of reading about Ana biting her lip, Christian telling Ana how beautiful she was and Ana coming all around him. Ms James, could you use any other sexual phrases or detailing??<br /><br />Second, the characters got on my last nerve. From Ana's insecurities about not being enough for Christian and Christian begging Ana to never leave him, both characters are obviously made for each other. Oh, and how long is Ana going to dwell on Mrs Robinson (Who we later is Elena Lincoln and thinks Christian should be with her and not Ana)??? Seriously, ENOUGH! Christian must have told Ana that Mrs. R was in the past at least 20 times. It gets old!<br /><br />Third, what was the point of the scary, ex stalker sub, Leila, coming back into the picture? It gave the reader something to look forward to (a twist in the story, perhaps) but it was a complete fail. The only thing it did was cause a little bit of a stir and Ana witnessing the Dom/Sub power between Christian and Leila. This made Ana more insecure causing us to read about her insecurities for another 5-10 pages.<br /><br />Fourth, was there a plot other than Christian telling Ana he loved her and coming out with his demons/issues? If thatwas the plot, I'm sure it could have been written in under 250 pages and not drawn out to 500 pages. Too much \\"fluff\\" and unneeded nonsense.<br /><br />These books do not live up to the hype of the media. I can't believe they are considered best sellers.
B007SGM084|5.0|I like it. The writing isn't the best but I like it. I was really surprised I could buy it as a bundle instead of each book individually. That was an added bonus and is what lead to me purchasing it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have not read a Grisham novel for many year, as I had been disappointed in my last few.  I thought I would try this one because of the good reviews, and I am pleasantly delighted.  This one is fun.  If Grisham keeps this up he will be back to being my favorite author again.
