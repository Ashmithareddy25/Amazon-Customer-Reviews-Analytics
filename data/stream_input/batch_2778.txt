0345803485|5.0|Wow...these books are so good. I cant believe how much I enjoyed reading them. I could not put it down.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great book, taught me a lot and had a great impact on my life and the privileges I have. I recommend it for everyone of all ages but especially high school students!
055380684X|5.0|Interesting read for parents and coaches, it gives a multiple view from all over the world.  I like the way it uses sports, music, and other examples of practicing greatness.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|If you love action, you've gotta see this movie.  It offers the viewer many twists and turns.  It keeps your attention and the action never fades.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|Love 2 songs on disc but still not sure if I like the whole CD. Probably would not but again
B002VWNID6|1.0|I ordered this DVD about six months ago.  I did not open it immediately, because it was for a special occasion.  Last week I opened it and began watching it.  First the volume would go up and down, so part of it was so low you could not hear the words.  Then about half way through the movie the DVD just stopped and we could not get it to play again.  I love this movie, but it really irritates me that a brand new DVD was ruined the first time I used it and because waiting so long to watch the movie I am unable to return it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love this box. It makes it easy to store, charge, and recharge while keeping the unit safe and dust free. It's worth your investment.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is a pretty good game.  Like the different puzzles and hidden object games.  The graphics are very nice.  I am playing relaxed mode right now.  It's a fun game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  The characters are believable.  It shows that people are virtually the same the world over.  Family and love and joy of life whether we live in Texas or Afghanistan.
B008Y5QTRG|5.0|A great movie with action, heartbreak, blood, mystery & love.  Can't beat it!  Can't wait for Kick-Ass II.  It should be exceptional.
030758836X|5.0|Very good book, a real page turner. I couldn't put the book down until the last page,A good thriller for sure!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Good blending of neuroscience and fact, disapointed in lack of discription for &#34;Heaven&#34; though. Thinking Dr. Eben is keeping the best to himself....perhaps leaves room for book #2. Overall, I enjoyed learning of his journey.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Excellent story!! The switching from one time period to another annoyed me some, but I do see the reason for it!  Very well written and a great plot!  Thx😃
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Another deft, considered and substantive offering by QotSA. Josh Homme is 40 and this record reads and sounds like a slightly sour mid-life effort that I find tinged with a Floyd-like disappointment in life. But I think rockers are pushed to their best when they choose to lug this particular stone up the hill, and these guys do it with such a unique bravado it's hard not to love. I hear a lot of Bowie in this record in JH's voice inflections and song compositions. I like the addition of piano and love that they really explored some new soundscapes with this effort. They were missed, and I'm glad to see them back on top!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to play. It is easy to play and you do not need to be connected to WiFi.
0525478817|5.0|I have never written a review on a book before, and I'm a heavy reader. The Fault in our Stars is a work of perfection. Thought provoking and incredibly insightful. This book made me laugh out loud and cry. I have also never re-read a book before. This one will be an exception.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Love listening to this cd over and over. Play it while at work in the office, and while cleaning the house.
1577314808|5.0|What a sweet enlightening book ! Eckhart Tolle has awakened many souls and continues to again with this book. Worth it !
B001UW58WW|5.0|Love his music, so much fun to listen to. Excited to watch the video's that come with the cd. Enjoyable!
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary/encyclopedia is the best one I have ever found. The ability to translate foreign words and phrases is very important for me and in all the time I have used it there has only been one that it would not translate. I highly recommend it for the discerning reader.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a very entertaining game.I enjoy a game that is mind stimulating. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
0756666937|5.0|If your child plays with Legos then you need this book, Highly recommend it for all kids of all ages.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Made me feel like I was back in high school with my first love. Such great, believable characters and a fun story, with a slightly dark twist to it. It gave all the feeeeeels!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Used to play this game all the time. It's to bad u can play a limited number of games. Unless u want to spend some cash.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great movie aand we love the soundtrack as well. Have watched it multiple times and will continue to do so.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Not sure what to say about this film except to encourage you to see it.  It's dark and violent, but at the same time light and humorous - in a way that only a Tarentino film can be.  Plus it's an Oscar winner!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Love the music in this soundtrack. Listen all the time in the car on my way to and from work.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|The very first time I played it, Akinator guessed the actor I was thinking of (Scott Caan).  From there my husband and I tried different people and he got it right every time.  Fun game to waste a few minutes here and there with.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Great app, only thing I don't like is that for Kindle Fire HD it's one version away from others, and I want to have the sketch option as well as the video. Thats why had to take a star. Other than that it's a really epic app :)
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this little game except for when I got to the levels where the spiders start.  More than once we've been in the car with hubby driving and me playing when one of those dang spiders show up and I give a yelp.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had it all: humor,grief,and love.  Very well written. This book was a quick read because I could not out it down even when reading through tears
1400064287|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it told of different situations and the insight was terrific. I would recommend it to someone looking for reasoning of life in general.
0345525558|5.0|Being a foster parent of teenagers I appreciated the authors ability to portray the skewed thinking of many foster children in our system.  Thanks for the enlightenment!
B0025KVLVA|5.0|The Beatles were a tidal wave to hit the states. I remember them on Ed Sullivan and watched my kids go crazy over their music, I also loved most of their songs.
0345529057|5.0|Song of Ice and Fire, (4 Vols.): A Game of Thrones / A Clash of Kings / A Storm of Swords / A Feast for Crows is a very easy, long, and enjoyable read.
1475143389|5.0|I prefer to think of things very scientifically and rely on facts and research in pretty much everything I do from fitness to buying a pair of shoes.  That is what you will find in this book by Mike Matthews.  Bigger, Leaner, Stronger has helped me immensely in achieving my physical goals and at the age of 33 I am in the best all around shape in my life.  I still have a long way to go but as Mike explains, results take time and patience.  Mike first goes through the proper diet plan for the goals you want to achieve.  If you want to cut some fat off he has a plan for that.  If you simply want to bulk he has a great plan for that as well and since purchasing his book, \\"The Shredded Chef,\\" it has helped me achieve my weight goals without sacrificing taste.  I can cook!  After working on your diet the fun comes with the workout plans.  They are precise, easy to follow, and take no more that 45 minutes to an hour to complete and with about 30 minutes of Cardio mixed in later in the day.  Finally Mike goes through his guide to supplements which are also vital to a good plan.  After following Mike's plan for 2 months now I have lost 13 pounds and am seeing huge gains in muscle definition already.  Follow Mike's plan and then his one-year challenge at the end of the book and you can't fail. Enjoy and thanks Mike!
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie is an all around work of art.<br />One of the best movies ever made, made better.<br />A must in any library
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd done with true justice to it legacy. Felt like I was reading a graphic novel. Fan Boys and Girls rejoice. Someone was actually paining attention to the true essence of JUDGE DREDD.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I found this to be a great kick in the butt.  This I<br /><br /> A well written, great guide for anyone with a dream. That would be all of us.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is a true gun slinger movie, no holds bard. The acting and store line are the cream of the crop. Sam Pekin paul, and Sergio leon would be very happy. If the duke was around, I think he would want to be in this movie.
B00CHOPEKI|1.0|First, the doll was look different . be sure to look at the box two photos at the top of the page .  damaged also barbie  Red shopping bag was worn out!<br />How could be ? It wasn't new barbie looks second . Anyway The damaged box ruins the doll's value further down the line . I don.t like it
B005KA188S|3.0|If you don't try to think of this as a remake, but another telling of a vampire story in the fright night legacy than the movie is very enjoyable. The acting is great, but special affects lacked.
1594204217|4.0|The latest quirky food book by Michael Pollan is titled, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation. Pollan explores the ways in which the fundamental elements of fire, water, earth and air can transform things that are great to eat and drink. The process of cooking with these elements also transformed Pollan and the ways he cooks, and can transform a reader's connection to the food and drink we consume. The structure of the book presents how Pollan tries to master one recipe using each of the four elements. I liked his writing and enjoyed reading about the adventures he pursued in cooking. Foodies and those who love cooking are those readers most likely to enjoy this book. Also, if you watch the Food Network or any cooking shows, you'll probably like this book.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|The perfect rethinking of a classic. Now a modern day classic in itself. You will not be disappointed. Very gory and bloody. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
034580709X|4.0|Those readers who love character-driven crime fiction can be voracious in wanting to consume every word written about a favorite protagonist. To satisfy this demand, we can finally read Jo Nesbo's first Harry Hole novel, The Bat. Set in Australia, the younger Harry behaves just like the older one: impulsively, doggedly, intoxicated and creatively. In Sydney, Harry is introduced as \\"Holy,\\" so that may be how his name should be pronounced, although Nesbo, whose name is pronounced \\"Yo,\\" has become reconciled to being called \\"Joe\\" by many English-speaking readers. All Harry Hole fans will love this first installment to help round out the story of this great detective character. New readers can start here or elsewhere and find a well-told story and a complicated and compelling protagonist.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|I purchased the $1.99 upgrade for the game but the new content never unlocked! Basically like being stole from! Beware!
140006922X|4.0|A brouhaha following Reza Aslan's interview with Lauren Green on Fox News boosted sales of his book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. That's good for Aslan and for those readers who might not have picked up this book had they not heard all the buzz. Aslan is a scholar and a Muslim who presents a very readable and accessible narrative about the historical Jesus. His scholarship draws on the work of many others in recent decades who have explored all sources of information about the historical Jesus. Aslan notes how the theology of Paul about Jesus the Christ overshadowed the historical Jesus. Both the historical Jesus and the Jesus of faith are worth reading about, and Aslan's book will provide a great basis for book discussion among both believers and non-believers. If the minor kerfuffle over this book gets people from different religions talking about faith, that's a good thing for everybody.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|I have to admit I am a huge Twilight fan. So when I saw this on sale I jumped on it and ordered immediately! As soon as it arrive I opened the package, which contained no invoice or any paperwork. Next I pulled put the DVD only to find there was no \\"Wedding Cover,\\" no \\"Special Features,\\"... It was literally just a Blu Ray disc of the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 1. In fact... There wasn't EVEN A COVER on it.<br />Thinking I made a mistake I checked my order online, nope I order the movie that is describe in the picture.<br />I had to call Amazon to have them correct the problem. Thank goodness Amazon has AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, because they were able to help me find another seller and they credited me the difference for the inconvenience.<br />Be leary about this item!!<br /><br />I wouldn't even give this a star if that was an option.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was good,but it wasn't like amazing. if u know what i mean if like temple run you will like this app so in all i think u should get it and its totally  worth it!!!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Five finger death punch has put out another great album with a great bunch of songs. The live album is also pretty good.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of action, decent plot, nice chemistry in the casting. Willis can still carry the right kind of film plot.
B000FC130E|5.0|I bought this to get me through a long car ride (I am already a big Gain an fan, and you should be too). Quite possibly the first time I've ever wished that a ride took longer.<br /><br />Absolutely splendid fantasy, and delivered perfectly.
B003WH765U|5.0|Have always loved the movie.  Was able to purchase a used one for a good price. Arrived quickly and is in excellent shape.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|exciting and full of &#34;that may even happen&#34; someday.  Love the characters and most of the story lines.  Try this show.
0451209338|3.0|After hearing Daniel Silva interviewed, he caught my interest and I hoped that his books would, too. I'm not a big reader of genre fiction, although I do like a good spy story. This had an interesting plot and Silva is very competent at getting the reader involved in the story and moving it along at a brisk pace, even while taking time to build character. But he falls into the common trap of making every character an absolute. The bad guy has been eluding all the good guys for years, is charming and ruthless, etc. etc. etc. The good guy is the best at what he does, but is world weary and tired of the game, yet gets back into it because he loves his country. The girl is a model when she's not a spy. These cliches are too common and I'd have been more interested with characters that were less perfect. Sadly, not every author of spy novels is a LeCarr&eacute;.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am not much one for Romantic period dramas, but I am head over heals in love with this mini series.
140006922X|1.0|Ancient myths, misquotes, historical and Scriptural errors from well known frauds repackaged in a new cover. In Zealot, Aslan merely displays his contempt for Christ and truth, and that he is not an authority regarding God. He is not a believer in what his own faith claims about Christ's death. It is amazing that Islam is allowing him to get away with calling The Qur'an a lie, but it proves another fact about Islam. Islam is not concerned with academic or spiritual accuracy, if that Islamic heresy (\\"blasphemy\\") can cause the destruction of something that causes Islam to fail in the presence of truth. Islam says Jesus did not die, but he will return to kill Christians and burn crosses with Muslims. Then Muhammad is not the seal of the prophets as he claimed, another little nasty detail. (Islam is seeking and already has a Jewish \\"savior\\" that is leading them. He is a remnant of Hitler.)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was a great game for kids to play and the different theemes of the gave it a new twist everytime that it switched
B003YMNVCA|5.0|I have been tried this book since I came from Saudi Arabia and I like it . there is eBook that I can use it for my kinde and I can read it wherever I go. the cost is very very good for this book.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I absolutely love the movie, and I can replay it in my head every time I listen to this soundtrack,
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the minions.. they are too cute &amp; hilarious :)  the rush game is addictingly fun too!  super adorable graphics - just like the Despicable movies.
B00DQQZNZW|4.0|All in all a solid CD.  A couple songs I do tend to skip which is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|WHEN UU RUN OUT OF TIME FAST FRWARD YOUR CLOCK AND YOUR COINS RETURN.EASY SS THAT so try it if u are out
B007RE0RR8|4.0|I got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. Shes a huge fan of these Monster high dolls and everything that has to do with Monster high lol. Very interesting dolls though lol. She will love it :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever I have had it for a long time but they really should make more updates but otherwise it is awesome game I love it
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its worth playing for small children sometimes even adults. its a fun litlle game that will entertain the whole family.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|The acting in this movie is excellent.  Plot and storyline are a little depressing but watch until the end.  Perhaps it will make you appreciate your childhood or have empathy for others stories.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the game but I think they should Give u gems when u beat your high score like 8 and then it should be easier to turn when u are in the baskets
B00846REIS|5.0|I got this book after reading the fifty shades series. They are similar stories so far but, this is still a good read. I will continue on to the next book.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|It shipped REALLY fast to my surprise. It came in looking brand new with a few scratches here and there but it was probably from being shipped. There's no actual flaw to the case and the CD with the lyric book is perfect. I've waited 3 years for this album and I'm so happy I found a copy at such a low, low price.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this app, I have used it for a few years now and have never had an issue.  I love the customizability of alarms and snooze settings.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I didn't know that the primary intelligence officer involved in tracking down bin laden was a woman. I found that very interesting, and the character was well acted.<br />This film engaged from the opening seen to the last. It was so intense I had to pause it a few times to catch my breath.<br />A retelling of the events surrounding the removal of osama bin laden that honors all involved.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, I was sad it had to end! Reminds you how precious life is and to never take  anything for  granted.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What needs to be said, other than that season 5 dishes up even more of what we've come to expect from this series, which shows no signs of growing stale.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|While I liked the CD, when it arrived the case was shattered.  This made it unsuitable for gift giving.  So however it was packaged it was NOT packed well to have it all broken when I received it!!!  :(
B0053O89IS|5.0|Even though a short season, it is fully packed with an intense punch of thrill and excitement. The character complexities just make me fall in love with everyone at the Jeffersonian.<br /><br />Kudos to you Hart Hanson!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome because of the changing atmosphere, goals and challenges. Easy for kids and challenging for everyone.  Once you start it is hard to put down. One of my favorite games by far.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I purchased the UNO game for the Kindle first.  I should have saved my $0,99 !  This is a much better game for free.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Great mind blowing ending. Never new that it was coming. I would recommend this movie for friends to watch. Suspenseful!
1439153663|5.0|If you liked, or in my case LOVED The Help, you will also Like/Love this book!<br />I was immediately sucked in by the Prologue and soon realized this book would not disappoint.
B000XCZGPE|5.0|What's not to love? This is the beginning of gangster rap that has talent. This isn't overly sampled crap with some guy talking over it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Great game will enjoy for hours....some levels are just hard but challenging<br />would highly recommend to my friends<br />Make more games like this
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This I  a fun game it is not a fats game u have to have patience. But it is very pretty and fun.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I loved using pinterest before I updated the app on my kindle fire. Now I cant see the bottoms of certain pins. So if I want to see a post and there are small words at the bottom, I can't see what it says.<br />Also I have had to force close the app so many times.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This episode was amazing and the quality was unbeatable.  I really like watching episodes from amazon I never have any problems with anything.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Who knew cricket could be such a naughty game?  Gabriella was both witty and edgy.  Mr. Hardy does a wonderful job of keeping you laughing (and sometimes blushing) throughout the entire book.  Gabriella, the book and the character takes on class warfare in a wonderfully funny and charming way.  This book was clever, scandalous, funny, well written and most importantly entertaining.  Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I may be an adult, but this game is absolute FUN! Love the fact that it's a free game makes it even better!!!!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. There are many parts of this book that everyone needs to hear. The improv rules are a must for anyone in sales, and honestly everyone is in sells whether you know it or not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|such a fun game very addicting as well i would like a new update p.s if you have mineecraft on xbox tu12 update is<br /><br />almost done
B004LROUNG|5.0|It is extremely sad to see the way our great laws are abused by sleazy and greedy lawyers, who are ruining our founding fathers' dreams of building a fair and just country built on morals and principles!!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Loved season two even more than season one. Finally let Nick and Jess come out about their feelings for each other. Can't wait for season three.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I've never actually had the chance to play the game.  Every time I open the game my Samsung Galaxy S3 starts vibrating and won't stop. Even when I've tried sharing the settings the only remedy is to close out of the game and completely reboot my phone.  I'm disappointed.  So, instead of playing I simply uninstalled the game.  Hope it works for others.
B00755MHXG|5.0|I got this based on the many many 5 star reviews and I wasn't disappointed. I am not good at writing book reviews so I will just say it was heart breaking and inspiring and I will definitely be reading it again.
B009POHHR6|4.0|Interesting take on the superman story. Don't read comics ever and I'm more of a marvel fan. But this was really good.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I really like Christopher Eccleston better than the previous actors who played Doctor Who.  Billie Piper makes a great companion.  I have already watched it twice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app ever! I downloaded this app when it was at the end of the Paris hunt.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is fun... would recommend to those that like puzzles. Makes you do review to continue game. I do enjoy it though... hopefully this works.
B001NA6096|5.0|I enjoyed this flick. I dreamed of something like this happening to me back in college so it was fun to see it play out on screen. :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought that this book was very inspirational. About how you can overcome challenges and make the most of opportunities. I liked this book and I highly recommend it.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|We had this movie on VHS, then on DVD and finally on Blue Ray.  It is a classic Vietnam War movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's fun. unlike some games that have gems and coins you don't<br />have to use real moment too move on. The sharks are a little too cartoonist like how the great white looks like a fat angry dolphin with large teeth ,but overall it's fun and addicting 5 stars.
B0065AVS0K|4.0|Lots of actors I like to watch.  Lots of hot women (for you men out there/women who are in to that too.)  Lots of plot twists, if you like that.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This  app is great to find out ho  much per cent I have left on my kindle! I truly recommend it!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved all the books.  Can't wait for the other two to be released.  The content was enthralling and was realistic, not all fabricated.  The love story was very passionate and a pleasure to follow.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Can't seem to put it down, Love it!!! Such a great time passer ! Very addictive. Definitely not sharing this game with my husband!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved all the books in this trilogy.  I was at a loss when I finished all of them and immediately started re-reading them again looking for content I missed.  There was a lot!
B00CRJSWBQ|3.0|Timely delivery, easy installation lovely features and looks like a solid board. I got the board cause I wanted a board that handles a windows 8 OS but it seems like some of the on boards drivers do not surppot windows 8 as my system refused to boot after some drivers were installed, had to install only the basic drivers to eneble me use the board... Should update my bios and try again if the conflict still remains.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the passion and love these two shared.  Asside from the graphic sex, the love story that grew was overwhelming.
B0036G8IQS|4.0|T<br /><br />his made me want to read the series<br /><br />It was really good I hope you do enjoy this a amazing book
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book and wish there would be another one to sum of their lives and challenges as with most relationships.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun, but it wouldn't load for a couple of days and when it did I had lost everything including my high score and all of my bananas, it even did the tutorial like I had never played before, I had to start all over.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM AND I LOVE TO LISTEN THESE SONGS MAKE ME HAPPY AND I THINK OTHERS WILL AGREE WITH ME! ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THESE SONGS WE ALWAYS ARE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM A LOT!! I KNOW OTHERS WILL LOVE IT TOO!!
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I've got a Withings scale which works well so I was inclined to go for the Pulse when it was available.  My hope was to get time distance, and calories for my daily hikes.  I've been using RunKeeper on my Motorola Droid Bionic but it is a heavy battery drain.<br /><br />Synch with my phone is somewhat unreliable.  I've had to reset the Pulse 4-5 times over the month.<br /><br />The Pulse is small with a really nice little form factor.  The rubber belt clip works great.  It is so light you don't even notice you are wearing it.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the numbers produced by the pulse (at least for distance and cals) seem really unreliable.  I've compared GPS-based phone and RunKeeper results with the Pulse and the Pulse reports an actual 2.1 miles walk as 3.0 miles in length.  The calories reported also seem way off.  I've written to Withings and all they say is that they are working to make the firmware more accurate.<br /><br />As things now stand, this device is useless to me because the results are so inaccurate.  I don't understand why the company would ship a product like this without doing better quality assurance.<br /><br />Bottom line Withings is that you should fix your product and be more careful next time.
0152067043|5.0|My 2 yr old loves this book as she has been learning her colors and likes to make sheep sounds. My 4 yr old enjoys this book even more because she can use the pictures to help her clue in what the sentences say. She loves reading this book to me.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|My nine year-old daughter and I have been playing almost non-stop for the last few days. She loves it and we will look for more.
0399230033|5.0|This is one of those books that gets a five star rating for many reasons. First because it is a combination of pages with words and pages with only pictures. Second, both my children love this book. It's become the most requested book at story time, and I catch my two year old often sitting on the couch flipping through the pages. Third, I love the illustrations! The facial expression of the wife (when she sees all the animals in her room) makes my children laugh every time. We actually checked it out many times from the library until I decided its a must to own.
1401923119|5.0|I love this book so much that I ordered 2 more to give to others.  It explains every thing in a way that is easy to understand and validates energy practices from a scientific point of view.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Ok, so maybe it's a little cheesy and over the top, but for someone who used to rush home from school so I could catch the animated G.I. Joe (because KNOWING is half the battle!) it was right up my alley. The characters were pretty damn spot on and watching Firefly and Roadblock duke it out (no pun intended...) was pure eye candy. Also, they really did a good job with Cobra Commander. If I can get my hands on that outfit from this movie, I have this years Halloween costume! If you seriously enjoyed the animated television series, this movie is for you!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Suspenseful, edgy, and full of the magical twists that make Neil Gaiman's work so intriguing.  His ability to create characters that remain true to themselves and resonate with human emotion make it easy for the reader to suspend disbelief as the characters walk along the razor's edge between fantasy and reality.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Bought this toolkit so that I could change the battery in my MacBook and it has become my new favorite toolkit. It goes everywhere with me in my computer bag.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Don't miss this movie.  Watch it again.  really really good.  Hoffman and Cruis are perfectly cast, believable, touching.  Everybody should see this at least once.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|Dixit is one of my surprise favorite games, but after seeing the same cards come up game after game it is a nice change to have some new ones in the mix.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|If you've seen the original then this takes a little time to grow on you, but it will. Rank it along with the Good Shepard, Spy Who Came in From the Cold, and Enigma. If you enjoy espionage then you will enjoy this.
B00013RC8O|5.0|You can't rent it anywhere,can't find it on netflix or hulu so why not own it? Just as good as I remembered thanks. Quick shipping too.
0316044695|5.0|This is a great read.  I am drawn to &#34;True&#34; stories and this one is definitely worth the time to read.<br />I truly appreciate the background information he gave.  Helped me understand what these guys go though to keep up safe.
B008YCMM2A|4.0|Transitional Miles with a hell of a great band, all virtuousos in their own right.  This \\"lost quintet' sound was not fully explored in studio so here is a record of its live offerings shortly before before and shortly after Bitches Brew.  Both dates are solid but it's interesting to hear the difference in just a few months.  At the Antibes date in Summer the repertoire still consists of some ballads and late 60s stuff, albiet with a full out electric approach.  By the time they get to Stockholm later in Fall after the BB sessions in NY in August, they are full bore electrically rooted in the new modern material and the throttle is wide open. (Ironically Corea's elctric piano goes out early on this night so he finishes w/ an acoustic.  This presents an exciting and unique sound and this recording is one of the great Miles live dates in my book).<br />Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the mono sound, especially in France, doesn't capture the full dynamic range and, though a Berlin concert is included on dvd, it would have made sense to offer this on a cd as well.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I have all four Castle seasons and the third season was just as excellent as the other's. I'am looking forward to the fifth season coming in September!!!.  L swisher.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I want to  say thanks to the creator of this game because it's very good and I was looking for  something like that, it's just as I expected. I highly recommended if you want to put some mystery in your life. I love it. Thanks.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book will definitely need to be made into a movie. It's very visual, and I can't wait to see it play out on the big screen. Very fun, romantic, exciting, mysterious. A page turner.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I'm a loyal Mitch Albom reader, and always pick up his latest book.  After reading the Time Keeper, I really appreciate every minute of each hour and handle it very carefully.  Time is a very precious comodity, that, sometimes, we abuse, misuse, or don't appreciate it.  This is a book, I can read several times, and always appreciate it and find something new in the message.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Casting was excellent.  Plot was very good.  Action movie while at the same time developing the characters enough for you to have an interest in them personally.  Recommend to anyone.

B000HVHM5S|5.0|Great theme, great movie. If you have ever liked the books Brave New World (Huxley) or 1984 (Orwell), you will love this movie. It takes the idea of &#34;Big Brother&#34; to a whole different level. Really makes you think. The scripting in this movie is also unbelievably eloquent.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the HBO series first and thought I would be bored with the book...but was pleasantly mistaken. The book gives the characters a little more depth. I read it in 2 days and moved on to the 2nd in the series. Loved it.
034580404X|2.0|First when I got it, it was not the box set, just the three seperate books so I was a little upset. Then I started reading them. I will NEVER recommend these to anyone! Horribly written and the grammar police in me keeps coming out. Her first bj is to a man COVERED in soap and the bdsm level is minimal. I will be writing to the author to tell her how I wasted my money. DON'T BUY THESE!! The only good thing was the person I bought it from!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  It's amazing what you can find on this site.  Everything from recipes, to home decorating, to things to do with your kids.  I go on this site almost every day.  I am giving a baby shower in a couple of weeks and I have found some very creative ideas to use. both in decorating, recipes, gift ideas etc. Who ever came up with this is a genius.!!!
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|Even though it's Chick's first release of all-new material in many years, I nearly passed when I saw the cover. A garish portrait depicting Chick clad in a suit of armor, lance in hand, riding a horse? And didn't we do the knight-on-a-horse thing before (Romantic Warrior) and make it look...a bit cooler? Can you maybe lower the mask?  Uh oh...<br /><br />I should know better by now. Corea's self-indulgent costuming on his album covers never told the listener anything about the quality of the music therein. I'm remembering his get-ups on the covers of The Leprechaun, My Spanish Heart, Secret Agent, the Mad Hatter ... all of which had silly covers and stellar music within. This is one of those albums. Ridiculous cover, seriously good music within. So Chick can wear whatever he wants, as long as the music delivers. And, good news, it sure does here.<br /><br />The first half of The Vigil contains predictably good music played by a great band. Recognizable Corea chord changes and arrangements. Solid back up players. For the most part, Vigil sounds like what you might expect; a classic Chick Corea release in a way that should please Corea fans and jazz fans alike. No big surprises, but very listenable music.<br /><br />If there was anything missing for me early on, it was a bit more fire. The truly exciting moments that make me want to hit replay. As the CD progresses, however, great moments start to accrue. \\"Portals to Forever\\" has excellent electric and acoustic piano passages, good interplay; a great electric solo by Hadrien Feraud.<br /><br />\\"Outside of Space\\" with Gayle Moran on vocals. What can I say? It reminded me a bit of the composition \\"Drifting\\" from Secret Agent (1978). Lovely piano, nice arrangement, but it doesn't save the song for me. But it's only 5 minutes.<br /><br />And then all's forgiven anyway with the final tracks, which make this a definite must-have CD.<br /><br />\\"Pledge for Peace,\\" featuring Ravi Coltrane evokes the spirit of later John Coltrane effectively in its intro and outro. Then it moves into a very spirited, aggressive acoustic number, with Corea giving a stellar performance, angular piano lines, exciting. Not to mention excellent support from the band.<br /><br />\\"Legacy,\\" is another standout, this time with Corea showing his chops on electric keyboards (in a way that is, to my ears, more exciting than I've heard in recent years). Stanley Clarke is on bass for this one. A very strong, loosely structured piece with a nice hook. It sort of recalled \\"Got a Match\\" in composition, but, for my taste, much more satisfying.<br /><br />A nice live version of a very hot \\"Hot House\\" (not part of CD configuration but I assume available as a download?) has great solos all around and completes The Vigil on a high note. It's in these last few tracks that I felt the fire I was seeking, and it is considerable heat.<br /><br />The Vigil is a generous CD. Those who remember vinyl may recall that 17 minutes took up nearly an entire album side. \\"Pledge for Peace\\" clocks in at 17 1/2 minutes, \\"Portals to Forever\\" is over 16 mins. And that's just two songs -- there's seven tracks, most of them long, giving time for the musicians to stretch out nicely with memorable solos. With more than 80 mins of music, most of it outstanding, it's going to give you what you hope for.<br /><br />So shield your eyes from the cover long enough to buy it. Then close your eyes and enjoy it.ane effectively in its intro and outro.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Once again someone tries to remind us that not all great minds are acknowledged publicly. Had Tesla not been so selfless, he could have been wealthier than Morgan and those who lacked the humanity to improve the world without first filling their own coffers.  I found this an excellent read and hope to steer others toward it.
B008UX2UIO|2.0|As a satire and parody it was quite funny, but not a book I would have ordinarily chosen. This was a book club selection and one I was glad to be finished with.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was amazing. I finished it in a day and half because I didn't want to stop reading it. It kept me wonderig what next. Now one of my  favorite books ever

B00COGXGNQ|3.0|This movie wasn't terrible. I decided to watch it because I do like Julianne Hough. She does a great job with the acting...I just think the storyline was a little predictable and actually left out a lot for build up of the plot. Could have been made a lot better...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Really works for my kindle fire it rings loud,and also it works when your device is off. Really good .
B00D4PDJMY|4.0|This album sort of reminds me of Lamb of God's Burn the Priest album. It is just so raw and heavy like that one. If you are a fan of Pantera's work, I would suggest tracks 4 and 5, as you can definitely see some Pantera elements on those tracks. One thing I will say is that this is an album the listener will either hate or love. My suggestion is to give it a few listens as I have come to like the tracks a lot better each listen.  Like everyone else out there, I am waiting for a Pantera reunion, with Zack Wylde filling in for Dimebag...let's keep our fingers crossed.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I read this book twicw as I enjoyed it so much and wanted to understand all of the characters completely before starting the next book. It is a complicated web, but i just had to keep reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has a similar premise as Jetpack Joyride and Temple Run but what makes it different is the course is always changing.  Not just the scene changes but the obstacles also.  This keeps it challenging.  The game is also very cute and funny!  Definitely a keeper!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Love everything about this movie. I do wish the DVD had more extra's included though. DVD quality is nice and the sound is great too.
B00867GKIK|5.0|I have today I might enjoy this movie more than my children. We watch it often. My son loves the dogs and my daughter thieves the flying house with the balloons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|one of the best shows EVER! Acting, costumes, plot - everything is top rate. I hear all the time...&#34;once I started watching I was hooked&#34;

B006LSZECO|5.0|I read a review of this book and ordered it for my iPad.  It is a great read and it took some time to figure out the culprit.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|This movie would be really good if you completely forget about the first movie. The first movie the joes was this huge operation. In this movie the joes looks like is basically a 10 man job. I also don't remember them saying anything about what happened to the original cast besides duke?
1878424319|2.0|Because I love Oprah, I bought this book she highly recommended, to me it was hard to read, his language seems to be something other the English, so I found the book to be confusing, I might try again, but not my fav.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is well written and compelling.  That being said, I wish I hadn't read it. I will forever worry about the future of the main character and anyone who comes in contact with him.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I recommend this product to everyone! This thing was so steady it was surprising! For 20 bucks i highly recommend it. My friends hand shake terribly but he even  was very steady while using it! And its dumby proof. Get it!
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I purchased the Buddy in January of 2013.  It was awesome.  Then in mid June the Buddy began having problems.  No one could hear me talking.  I reset the phone.

1401322786|5.0|I have all of the Mitch Albom books that I have found and I have never been disappointed. His stories have a way of making one reflect on their own life and the choices that are presented on a regular basis. Highly recommended for all ages.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|This is an extremely angry record, though it has it's playful points like all 'Ye's albums.  Moreover, this record sounds like one side to an argument with a Kardashian.  In fact, I'm almost sure that most of the lyrics on this record are what he would've said to Kim Kardashian if he could've thought of them in the heat of the moment.  That's why there was little to no publicity regarding this release; furthermore, this is a testament to how easily this style of music can be produced.  You don't need to be talented necessarily, you just have to know how to hold a grudge and have a computer.<br /><br />Knowing Jay-Z helps too.<br /><br />(I'll bet Bruce Jenner works out to this record.)<br /><br />It's no \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" and the album title and some of the lyrics reflect a different hubris more evident on this record than others, but still a solid record with it's 1-2 singles as per all Kanye West albums.  The album won't change your life but it is an interesting perspective into an artist that appears distracted and unable to coalesce his personal life with fame and his reputation as a hit-maker as he attempts to lay new tread to old ground.  All in all, this record sounds like a teenager yelling at his parents over some tiny, inconsequential detail that had major personal, social repercussions; a passive-aggressive record to say the least.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|This guide didn't really meet my expectations.  I wasn't as in-depth of a guide as I hoped it would be.  It briefed through areas that I desired more explanation.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this as a gift at the request of my 14-year-old daughter who has read it several times. She is an avid reader of everything from tween sci-fantasy to adult literature including Greek mythology and English classics.
B000FC11A6|3.0|I really wanted to love this book. I'm an electrical engineer with probably a passing familiarity with cryptography but the background to understand it. I love the premise of this book, and the plot was actually interesting and well done too. I loved the technical parts and the history was intriguing. But there were a couple of aspects of the book that I personally did not enjoy.<br /><br />First of all, I'm finding I agree with Orson Scott Card's theory on writing, using the \\"American Plain Style.\\" In his words that means, \\"the author tries to become as invisible as possible, bringing the reader to see things as if experiencing them along with the character, instead of having a writer constantly commenting and interrupting the flow of the story.\\" This book takes the opposite of that approach. It took me months to get through the first one quarter to half of the book. It seems like the plot is secondary to his showing off his witty prose. Make no mistake, he has a commanding vocabulary and often his writing is amusing, I found myself actually bursting out laughing in a few spots. But, more often than not, his tangents just really get in the way of moving the plot along. If I wanted depth I'd read philosophy.<br /><br />The other problem is his ending was just too...abrupt. Yes, the elements are there of wrapping up the story, that's not the complaint. It's just that most writers really make you feel like it's a climax, maybe draw out the action and meaning of what's going on. For him the last few pages and chapters move at an accelerated pace, one that I wish he'd maintained throughout the book. In that sense it's kind of the reverse of how it should be. Maybe some people will like that, I don't.

B002VHI8J0|5.0|This was a beautiful story, with a bit of something for everyone - history, science fiction, romance, mystery. Well done
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was apparently written for young adults and teens but, it is an excellent read for adults, as well.  The characters are throughly built as the story progresses.  The author puts them into the story so well, that you begin to care about them.  You just see them in your minds eye.  But, it is the suspense and mystery that keeps the pages turning.  I can only hope the sequel will be as good.  Looking forward to it's coming release.

Sin.\\"  Even includes a mainly instrumental track \\"Diary of a Deadman,\\" a poetically spoken track reminiscent of the instrumental \\"Canto 34.\\"  Must purchase for FFDP and hard rock fans, and a must listen for those interested in a very unique interpretation of the LL Cool J track, \\"Mama Said Knock You Out.\\"

I can't wait to see what other developers do with it.<br /><br />The only thing that's a bummer is that Amazon sent an email promising the 3 month free netflix subscription and they haven't delivered on the promise. If you promise something, do it!

B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun a way to take up your time. If you have free time I would suggest this app.<br />I play it about ten to fifteen minutes a day.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game took all 7000 of my coins for no reason at all.<br />I wanted to start off on el machos lair but it didn't let and instead took all my coins. so ya I hats this game
B000025WWO|3.0|Nothing special about this rather low key interpretation. There are many far more exciting recordings of these works, such as Ashkenazy, Andsnes, Volodos, Ortiz, Wang, Argerich, Grimaud, Richter, Weissenberg, Lugansky, Lazic, Gavrilov, and many more. I have always gone back to the various recordings of Ashkenazy.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown's story of political & scientific<br />intrigue is a real thriller. Washington politics<br />aside, you wonder is this, could this really<br />happen.
0316066524|4.0|Well.<br /><br />Dave Eggers once wrote that he spent an entire month reading this when it was released. And added that it's impossible to mutter an \\"eh\\" when finished with it, saying the book will change your life for the better.<br /><br />I think he's right about it changing things.<br /><br />The first 15 pages stormed me. Then, I felt David Foster Wallace was merely trying to impress and masturbate onto pages in some self-loving way that Jonathan Franzen can be prone to coming close to; after appx. 150-200 pages, however, that went away.<br /><br />This book is filled with subjects and words and places but it's coherent, funny, inspiring and disgusting, bewildering, simple and complex. At times it felt like a drag, but mostly it's really, really good.<br /><br />Every sentence feels thoughtful and sincere, and at the same time, I got the feeling (which is still in-place) that's simple; all you need is genius.
1400067820|3.0|The central insight of this book is important and deserves more attention. Unfortunately, reading it feels a little bit like being buttonholed at a party by someone you initially took to be charming and interesting, but turns out to be an insufferable, obsessive and self-absorbed windbag. Take heart! If you stick it out to the end, you may end up being amused, if not charmed, by Taleb's rambling rant. I was at least.<br /><br />The main idea (really a riff on his earlier two books) is that many systems - in e.g., nature, economics, social life, and politics - can actually benefit from (or be made stronger by) exposure to stress and/or volatility. Attempts to enforce stability and protect the system from stressors often are counterproductive and lead to even greater harm - when the big blow-up, the Black Swan event, eventually occurs. So very often, the right prescription (whether in medicine, economics or other areas where modern man is prone to intervene or \\"do something\\") is actually to do nothing at all. Not only will the patient recover, but will likely be stronger in the long run.<br /><br />Good advice, and the imperative for policy-makers to \\"do something\\" is certainly strong (maybe overwhelming) in today's political world. But one gets the feeling that Taleb is a crank, given how far he takes the theme - almost rejecting modernity itself in the process. His ranting against banks and finance and corporations (especially ones that sell us evil things like tobacco and soft drinks) begins to seem anti-capitalist, despite his repeated pleadings in favor of free markets and against statism. (I guess he thinks we should have simply banned tobacco, possibly Coke and Pepsi as well, but then would he trust the government with the responsibility? Certainly not the central government of a \\"nation state\\"! Maybe Mike Bloomberg?) In his section on the ethical consequences of his anti-fragility framework he seems almost socialistic, or at least in denial that the individualshould be at the center of ethics (hey, man, we're just here to pass our genes along, not to focus on \\"happiness\\" in our own lifetimes, right?). And he uses the anti-fragility theme to pedal some idiosyncratic (if not bizarre) ideas about exercise, medicine, diet and even the use of sunscreen (which he comes down against).<br /><br />Along the way we get to endure the list of things and people that Taleb deplores: financial models, professors (especially economics and business school professors), bankers, accountants, Thomas Friedman - it's a long list, and at times his antipathy is almost Krugman-like. He should lighten up - most employees of big companies are just trying to live their lives by their best lights, and their \\"middle class values\\" may be just okay.<br /><br />The biggest beef I have with this book in the end is, even if you accept Taleb's description of the problem, what's to be done? Nothing in here to point the way other than more people seeing the world as Taleb sees it. In the last section, for instance, he talks about the agency problem in big corporations and well-known problems of the motivations of politicians and \\"public servants\\". I see no incremental value to viewing these problems through Taleb's lens of anti-fragility. Public choice economics and corporate finance theory (I know! He hates economic and finance theory!!) identified these pathologies in the 1960's and `70's. The issues are not novel; the problem is how to fix the institutions to address the bad incentives.<br /><br />But if you don't mind spending the whole party with the smartest guy in the room (no one would be quicker to identify himself as such than Taleb himself - just imagine all the books he reads (and carries with him on airplanes - no e-books for him) and his ability to quote the ancients on every subject!), then you might get a laugh or two out of this book. And it just might make you think about the world a little differently. I guess that's worth the effort.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|It works well for me. I especially like that it will announce what alarm is going off. My only complaint is that you have to go into the menu to start the timer.  It would be nice if you could just click or swipe to start the timer.
B008476HBM|4.0|So interesting the way Austin wrote in the 19th century. Reading was hard to get through, and sometimes hard to understand. However, 19th century and 21st century human nature is exactly the same.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|I love John Mayer. Or at least, I used to. I feel like this album doesn't have as much variation as his previous ones. Still worth listening to though! Good sound quality.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|My grandsons, ages 13 and 16 wanted to watch this, so we did and it was enjoyed by all of us. An interesting take on an old fairy tale.
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Overall I like the album...it's not the album of the year, but it's not a dud either.  Definitely a step in the right direction...worlds better than what Geoff Tate is doing at the moment.  Hopefully they continue on this path.  Queensryche is relevant again!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Admittedly, this movie appeals more to men than to women because it is dripping with testosterone and manly things, but if you can enjoy a story that leaves out any romantic relationships, yet surrounds you with a fine cast of characters, then this movie will hold you captive and leave you begging for more. I can scarcely wait for the sequel that debuts around the holiday season. I like movies that give me characters that I would enjoy hanging out with, and the dwarves, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, are just fun and entertaining. I especially respect the way all the dwarves in this flick take care of each others backs and are always stepping up their game for whatever the occasion calls for. Then watching Bilbo transform from a couch potato to a brave life-risking friend and comrade who ascends to heights of heroism that seemed highly unlikely, well, that was like a father watching his son hit a grand-slam to win the game for his team. And by the way; the special effects and scenery are stunning because this was shot in the natural beauty of gorgeous New Zealand. The costumes were nothing short of perfect and the soundtrack was entoxicating, especially the lamenting song that the dwarves sing about their overthrown home which now belongs to Smaug, the dragon calamity that hits hard and ferociously.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This app is great and easy to use. I play balloon tower defense on the computer and this is just like it with more cool stuff! This is much better than going to coolmath and trying to play it. DO NOT GO ON COOLMATH AND TRY TO PLAY IT! This app is absolutely perfect and you should definitely get it.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I ran across this series purely by accident and I'm hooked. I watched all episodes in the first 4 seasons in 3 weeks -- that's a lot of episodes. It's It's a sci-fi series with awesome characters, my favorite being Walter the mad genious scientist/doctor. Lots of good, bad and ugly scenarios with a little romance sprinkled in. It reminds me a little of The X Files but then not. Best I can say is try it, I think you'll get reeled in hook, line and sinker like I am. Enjoy!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|It serves me right for not reading about the book!  I just looked at the author not realizing it is a book for the younger generation.  I gave it 3 stars because I assume it is probably ok, but have not read more than a few pages and probably will not read further.  Next time I will pay more attention.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it isn't one of those books the author does a good job on in the first and then only continues to write for money not for the readers. Mr. Dashner continued to  intrigue the reader by giving them lots of unknown mysteries to ponder on, but not discourage them by slowly feeding more information.I would highly recommend this trilogy to a friend ( and already have).
B000WAEK0E|5.0|It was fabulous!  Van Morrison is an exceptionally talented artist.  I love every number in this collection. Why do you require a certain number of words for a review?
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It would have been hard for Red to miss on the rating chart for me because there wasn't a major cast member that I don't absolutely enjoy their work and have enjoyed their work.  Every single name I saw during the opening credits was a draw to this movie for me.  Still, the writing was fun, it seemed to flow in an organic manner that allowed easy suspension of disbelief even though there were some truly ridiculous moments that verged on slapstick.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|Music before it's time. Carlos Santans was showing way back when that he was not only a rock star but a broad minded musician who took his music to places other rock stars don't even dream of.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|Everyone was excited over Avengers. It made over $1 billion in the box office and was a huge success. Well, because of that, it was a gimme Iron Man 3 would be a smash hit as well. But here's the problem. The movie made over $1 billion in the box office, but the movie itself was a massive let-down.<br /><br />For starters, the film is called IRON MAN 3. Meaning Tony Stark as Iron Man. But at least 98% of Iron Man sequences are the suit controlled by Tony from another location or by Jarvis. And when Tony did get in the suit? The suit was rendered immediately useless by someone with Extremis powers. The Mark 42 was a joke. It kept falling  apart, and that joke got old FAST. But they kept using that joke. Even in the end when Tony looked like he was about to be killed by the \\"real\\" Mandarin, he spots Mark 42 coming while Jarvis controlled suits are fighting Extremis soldiers, he says, \\"the prodigal son returns\\", and it immediately fell apart. I remember hearing everyone around me laughing at that scene. And all I could think was, \\"what, you still think it's funny after the first 20 times it fell apart?\\"<br /><br />What the movie got right: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.<br /><br />What sucked about the movie: You name it, it sucked.<br /><br />For starters, they build up the Mandarin as this dangerous terrorist, even doing this big thing showing that he has the President willing to cater to him to protect innocent people. Then when Tony confronts him, without his suit of course, I mean, who wants to see an Iron Man movie where he's actually wearing the armor? When he confronts the Mandarin, it's revealed that this big bad terrorist is just an actor hired by Killian (the \\"real\\" Mandarin) to distract people. That way while the FBI and Shield (oh wait, SHEILD isn't in this movie, even when the President is kidnapped, Nick Fury doesn't even send one agent to help) will be chasing the actor and not the real threat. Killian kidnaps Pepper, pumps her full of Extremis, whichmakes her invincible, and when she falls into fire, she doesn't die.<br /><br />In fact, Pepper beats the bad guy! After every suit Tony uses to try to beat the bad guy is wrecked, Tony is left whimpering in a corner while Pepper beats the bad guy. Pepper is all upset because Tony spends more time with his suits than with her, so he blows up all of his suits. Then in a voice-over narration, Tony reveals that they cured Pepper (even though it was mentioned that there was no cure). TOny has his arc reactor removed from his chest, which he didn't think to do in the first movie? Then Tony looks at the remains of his house, and says, \\"I'm still Iron Man.\\" Yeah, because blowing up all of your suits and removing the power source didn't effectively neuter you from being Iron man or anything. I forgot to mention the freaking kid. They do this lame bit where Tony is hanging out with a little kid who helps him when he's in a small town investigating an Extremis explosion, similar to what injured Tony's friend Happy (who thought that name up?). The kid saves Tony at one point. Meaning Tony spent more time being saved by other people than by actually being the badass the first 2 movies and Avengers painted him to be. Oh, and the \\"invincible suit of armor\\" was easily broken by the kid. The kid just popped a finger off effortlessly. Which might explain why Tony destroyed all of his suits. The more he made, apparently the worse they got. Must have been shame, not pandering to his woman.<br /><br />This movie sucked. After a solid Phase One, Marvel has started out Phase 2 with a big ole turd. Pass it up. Maybe rent it, but don't buy it. Frankly, the only movie from Phase 2 that seems to have any real potential is Thor: The Dark World. And that'll obviously be ruined by the fact that Natalie Portman has been upgraded from supporting cast to main cast. Meaning she'll probably beat the bad guy while Thor watches on.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really hooked on this show as a whole, love the characters, the stories, definitely worth watching. I am through both season 1 and 2, will be getting to 3 shortly. Have to love amazon prime!
1577314808|4.0|We purchased this because we lent out our other copy and it was never returned, so I guess they liked it too.  We have other self-help books by this author and my husband really is getting some self understanding about how to live in the now and not let the clutter of the past influence your life.
0765322889|5.0|The book itself is amazing: beautiful (and often underrated) writing; a rich, complex story; and amazing settings and characters. The paperback edition is well made, and after two teenagers reading through it there are no noticeable wrinkles or creases in either the cover or the pages.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Not up to the standard of the other two books. Had too many characters that were unnecessary.  Never understood the purpose of the book. Was not cohesive and jumped from one character to another without reason.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|Nice fable. Just a little short for my liking. Have to read it again to grasp the message(s) of the book.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I always liked Daft Punk and I had to listen a few times for this one to settle with me but after a while I grown to like it.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I don't like scary movies/ TV.  My friend got me started.  It's scary, but really good!  And who doesn't love Kevin Bacon?
B003097B64|3.0|Pretty good amount of music for such a small price. But I guess the music doesn't stand out. If you are a fan you can't beat the variety of songs.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There's a lot of beauty to be found in Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It's a haunting, lyrical, spell-binding tale, full of fluid prose and sharp insight into the human experience.<br /><br />Gaiman has a unique ability to meld reality and the amorphous, dream-like states we sometimes find ourselves in.<br /><br />In this story about a man who returns to the farm of his childhood friend and relives the nightmarish events of a time in his youth, Gaiman brings out the tenuous nature of memories, especially childhood memories. And because this is a fantasy piece, a lot of the memories seem unreal, and yet Gaiman infuses them with enough detail (a boy eating porridge at a kitchen table, a kitten's comforting purr against the cheek) to make it believable.<br /><br />The prose is as fluid as the story, effortlessly gliding between the ephemeral and the concrete: &#34;... the peculiar crinkling of space on space into dimensions that fold like origami and blossom like strange orchids.&#34; And every once in a while, he will slam the reader against a jagged truth that makes you pause: &#34;She was the storm, she was the lightening, she was the adult world with all its power and all its secrets and all its foolish casual cruelty.&#34;<br /><br />It's a very good story. And if there's any criticism to give, it's that the ending is - perhaps - not as resolute as some would like. But then again, the entire tale exists in a kind of dream realm, where things have no beginning and no end.<br /><br />So maybe the end is perfect.
B001NA6096|4.0|It was a good movie... like being a fly on a wall for a few hours of someone's life... some awkward moments, some happy and some sad moments.  Liked that the ending left it open for another adventure.
0812982622|5.0|Brilliantly written & researched.. Extraordinary view of contemporary N Korean, even when it enters into fantasy. My book group, one and all, we're taken by it.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Fortunately, Kindle Fire presents FB in an easily scanned format, easy to comment on.<br /><br />As always, the portability of both allows me to sit back and relax with them, instead of sitting at a full computer like a work assignment.<br /><br />I do like the way FB moves into photo galleries and back down the friends list.  (My stylus has become part of my hand!)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I would recommend this to everyone I know! Tell You're friends about it!
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I have loved the energy, the emotions, the dancing, the music, listening to the songs and watching the videos.  Finally seeing it in its entirety was a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The characters went through some very familiar struggles to succeed, frustrations taken out in anger, and managed to work through it all.  Heroism was tempered by fear of failure, which made eventual triumph more real and more engaging.<br /><br />I watch monsters and superheroes and war movies so this was a great way to reconnect with reality.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|It was a cute book. I enjoyed the poems that were very relatable for us kitty cat owners. Short read but it's very entertaining.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|What a great app!  I listen to the concentration sounds while I'm at work, I listen to the sleep sounds sometimes at night when I'm having a hard time falling asleep.  You can make your own mix of sounds and there are a ton to chose from. Highly recommend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I love it! but one thing you should do is make creative have monsters and let you use chests.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Pretty sure this app caused my Kindle to start malfunctioning. I ended up having to do a factory restart and lost a lot of stuff.  Very frustrating. In addition, it was a huge waste of time. Free or not, don't take the chance.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Easy to move about the diagram.<br />Would increase skills if it was timed maybe.<br />Would like an example of &#34;how&#34; to play more skillfully rather than just matching tiles.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I purchased this for my kids because they are obsessed with Slender Man.. I played it once and thought I was going to have a panic attack.  The kids could spend hours playing it -- it's a great app
086571701X|5.0|Well organized and written. Check her web site out it's listed in the first chapter. I feel that Sylvia's Aquaponics system is the best that I have seen. Low maintenance and reasonable cost.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I really like this game.. I've only played it a handful of times but it's a challenge.  My daughter (8 y.o) plays it also and likes it.  It's a very simple concept, but not as easy as you would think.
1611761808|2.0|There are parts of this book that are totally praiseworthy. Beautiful prose and poetry of Afghanistan. One gets the feeling that, because it's been six years since the author's last book this became a series of hardly related stories. There are so many disparate threads running through the book. The reader is apt to get lost. This particularly true when a minor character's family history in Greece becomes yet another story..... Actually a good one but totally irrelevant to The Mountains Echoed.<br />I have loved this author. Until now.
B005ETA5K2|3.0|Better than without, but not by much.  It may have been the RV park system.  We had a good signal but could not always hook up to the internet.  Bummer!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book brought you into the character and you waited and watched  her grow. The flowers were her tools of communicating  with her outside world. The flowers were her words and world.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Love every track from this album!  Ed has got amazing talent that I hope well take him far!  Each track has fantastic lyrics and unique instrumentation.  However some songs don't depend so much on lyrics as they do on emotion but which Ed delivers quite well (and is also what many artists lack today who are on top of the charts)! My favorite tracks at the moment would probably be Give Me Love or Drunk
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was enchanting. A bit confusing at times with the staging of events at different time periods. Nevertheless, this added more mystery. Hope it ends up being a movie.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Bingo Blitz WAS, I repeat, WAS, my most favorite game!  I am very disappointed with the developers strategies to make a buck or two more!  The lack of puzzle silhouettes in each room added to the $ of each bingo card really limits room completion!  This in particular makes it really hard on the limited rooms that come out.  Change the $ of bingo cards and make puzzle silhouettes appear 10x more often I may not deplete this game.
159562015X|5.0|I like the new perspective this book offered for self-discovery.  It's a positive theory, the book is easy to read, and the test results were amazingly accurate.  This book/toolset is great for team-building.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The game is great because you get a scratch every 45 minutes to earn coins and the game is realistic and earn objectives after a game and you can play with your friends or online .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was just challenging enough to keep me interested but not difficult enough to be frustrating. its a great game, I only wish they had more levels!!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My 3-year-old granddaughter loves this game, BUT, almost everything she wants costs bling, which you have to buy with actual cash! This MIGHT be ok for adult or even teen games, but is ridiculous for young childrens' games! How do you explain they can't buy what they want? If you buy the full version, you should be able to buy everything with kibble. Also, children should NOT have to wait hours for their new pets to arrive. They quickly become bored and stop playing. One glitch I have noticed is with the movie theater. You should be able to click on the stage for the animals to play without the pop-up appearing to watch previews. You should only have to tap on the filmstrip to watch the previews. Other than this, it is a very cute game.
B00DULWFZE|4.0|Sorry for the corny title, but I'm very happy with this album. It's different, it's moving and it has Kevin back! :) Breathe is an excellent song, but my favorite is Show 'Em (What You're Made Of). Good job boys!

B000CNFC76|5.0|I am a sucker for period pieces and I love under dog stories about early sports figures.<br />Love the clothing and the time period.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Good game but I would like to play more instead of keep waiting to to get free chips to play but fun game anyway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! When I have extra time this is what I'm doing.  This is good for any age group.  Kids or adults will love this.  The minions even make noises.  I'm fifteen and love this game.  If you like the movie this is a must have!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is really fun saving the world. I've always wanted to do that. There are more options on the tablet version that are not available on the iPhone version. I like being able to engage the enemies on the ground.
B009RH9J7W|3.0|The case itself is nice. Doesnt swivel 360 degrees so to charge battery have to swivel the other direction. Auto sleep sometimes comatose.  Sometimes doesnt put kindle into sleep mode.

B004JZBGWI|4.0|I don't have a lot of apps.  My expectations are great and then problems and limitations result in my deleting the frustrating app.  ColorNote exceeded my expectations and is used throughout the day.  I love and work with the Google products of e-mail, calendar, drive, and tasks.  However, when an idea hits me or the need for a reminder arises, I don't always find myself in wireless range for my tablet.  ColorNotes resides on the tablet, phone, Kindle Fire.  You add a reminder and sync when you connect to wireless.  Once you sync, your phone, tablet,  and Kindle Fire are sync'd.  You don't have to wait for wireless to add a reminder.<br /><br />The only problem is the app does not work on my computer; however, the authors say they may develop the program/app to do this in the future.<br /><br />Great problem solver.

B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|This was a fun movie.  If you turn the sound off and just watch Noomi Rapace's hands and facial movements, you'll get your moneys worth.  Economy of movement to convey feelings and emotions.  The plot moves along briskly, but this is not a fast-paced movie.  Quite night on the couch.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Much in the same manner as its predecessor, A Clash of Kings is an absolute monster of a book. A complete behemoth of exemplary storytelling talent that requires the upmost attention and participation from the reader, providing just as much entertainment and exposition as the reader is willing to commit. This isn't a light read for a day at the beach or a brief plane ride, prepare to sacrifice a great deal of time and effort if you're considering reading this series and getting the most out of the experience. If you weren't a fan of the amount of commitment required from the previous book, then you should have no interest in its sequel. As for the actual quality of the book itself, George R. R. Martin has proven once again that he is among the highest caliber of fantasy writers, crafting yet another epic tale with such an astonishing sense of scope and memorable characters that it's once again apparent why this series continues to galvanize both readers and television viewers alike. However, there are quite a few issues that detract from Clash of Kings' overall gravitas. It succeeds as a worthy successor to the masterful Game of Thrones, yet it doesn't quite reach the same heights as its predecessor.<br /><br />With a book of such an enormous magnitude, it can be quite daunting to get into, let alone write a review that successfully does it justice on all accounts. I'll start with my favorite aspect of the series: the incredible world-building. As I said, George R. R. Martin is among the absolute apex of fantasy writers. The amount of detail and mythology he interweaves into his fiction is truly stunning; made even more impressive by the amount of believability he instills within the reader as they sift through the pages. There are slight undertones of magic and mythical beasts such as dragons and white walkers, yet the more fantastical elements never overshadow the amount of believability Martin has built the series' foundations around. It's a world that feels truly alive and absolutely gargantuan in comparison to other works in the genre. With the ever-changing narrative constantly shifting between the cast of characters, the reader is continuously treated to a plethora of settings. With each new location working to further immerse the reader into the fiction, and make the world pop out of the pages. From the searing deserts of Qarth, to the frozen tundra just beyond the Great Wall; the scope is simply unmatched. The icing on the cake is the believable, and very authentic medieval dialogue that permeates the series. Each of these elements contributes significantly into making the land of Westeros one of the most well-realized and iconic fantasy realms ever conceived by one man's brilliant imagination. Say goodbye to real-life for a while.<br /><br />Many aspects of the previous novel carry over into Clash of Kings: political intrigue, multiple character arcs, and the series' morally ambiguous tone. However the context of the story differs substantially. Whereas Game of Thrones was akin to a political thriller, Clash of Kings plays out more along the lines of a medieval war story; complete with all the backroom deals and cloak and dagger subterfuge that has come to be expected from the genre. Fortunately Martin conveys his tale in such a brilliant manner that it avoids becoming just another generic fantasy romp. An unfortunate downside to this however is the lack of twists to spice up the narrative. Make no mistake, there are a decent amount of plot elements and sudden revelations that'll keep you engaged, yet it lacks the same degree of unforeseen plot twists that its predecessor had. The result is a highly enjoyable, albeit a much more linear story.<br /><br />Yet it's the memorable cast of characters that is arguably the series' strongest attribute. In my opinion, this is where I become a bit conflicted on the series and why I can't give this book a five star rating. This book is chocked full of so many characters that I cannot possibly summarize my thoughts on all of them, so I will instead give my thoughts on the most predominant ones and their lasting impact on me. The two characters which Martin wrote brilliantly were the twin mothers of the story: Cersei Lannister and Catalyn Stark. Catalyn's personal grief towards her separated family was perhaps the story's greatest emotional highpoint; whereas in contrast, Cersei Lannister is devilishly cruel and manipulative in her pursuit to secure her family the Iron Throne. Where her character truly shines is through her own reluctance of being born a woman in a predominantly patriarchal society. She's easily one of my favorite villains in recent memory. Like the majority of the characters in Clash of Kings, everyone shows human signs of triumph and defeat in their mad dash for power, or their pursuit of salvation in the eye of the storm. No character is without their flaws and nobody is walking away from this conflict without some scars.<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum are the characters that unfortunately didn't click with me in one manner or another. Keep in mind that for every character I dislike, there were at least two more I loved in this book. I'm certain to garner a large amount of flak for this, but I personally don't enjoy the story arc of Jon Snow. With so many character arcs intertwined in the civil war for the Iron Throne and those simply trying to survive the chaos.  It significantly hurts the pacing and overall sense of urgency of the narrative when the reader is seemingly ripped out of the moment and forced into a conflict that has seemingly no effect on the rest of the book. Jon's ordeal beyond the Great Wall feels completely isolated and irrelevant to the larger scheme of events that transpire. I'm sure he'll become more relevant in the later novels, yet as for now, I find his character underwhelming and his arc bland in comparison to the others. Contrast this with Daenerys Targaryen, another character who is largely isolated from the main events of the book. Unlike Jon Snow, Daenerys doesn't suffer from the same issues that plague Jon's chapters. Daenerys is an upcoming monarch who will undoubtedly have a massive impact on the events transpiring in the series. Like her dragons, she emits a greater presence that threatens to shake the foundations of the world. In other words, she feels integral to the story despite being isolated from the main events.<br /><br />Yet the character that drags the story down the most is unfortunately Bran Stark, a character that has completely overstayed his welcome. He succeeded in eliciting sympathy in the first book, yet now he's nothing more than a dead-weight that completely brings the narrative to a halt. Throughout the entire one thousand plus pages, Bran does nothing but whine about his broken legs while basking in his own dreams of transhumanism. It was saddening to see him suffer in the first book, yet he goes through little to no development in Clash of Kings, instead repeating the same morose thoughts that we've already seen far too many times in the previous book. It's hard to care really when the entire kingdom is engulfed in civil war with people dying by the hundreds. His broken legs feel insignificant in comparison. Which is why I was so surprised that Rob Stark wasn't given his own story arc. Unlike Bran, Rob has a massive impact on the story and actual development to undergo. In a book based entirely around the conflict of warring monarchs, it's truly bizarre that Martin hasn't done the character justice by providing him with his own chapters. I find the premise of his character far more compelling: a young boy forced into the horrors of war and the burden of leadership. All the wasted time moping with Bran could have been productively used on Rob instead.<br /><br />My final issue is one that even the first book suffered from, albeit to a much lesser extent. This series has far too many minor characters than Martin knows what to do with. Most of them end up feeling like a list of names rather than actual characters that have any real effect on the story or possess any semblance of characterization. Trying to remember every minor character in each story arc can be quite a taxing challenge for the reader, again this isn't a book for casual readers. This problem also diminishes the strong theme of family that was so endearing in the previous book. It's not completely absent, yet the companionship found within the Stark family felt like the heart of Game of Thrones. It gave the first book a great deal of character and further invested the reader in the combined fates of the characters. I'm hoping to see more interaction between the major characters in the next book. The minor characters simply don't offer much to care about.<br /><br />Make no mistake; Clash of Kings is a brilliant novel that die-hard fans of fantasy will devour. It isn't without its faults, being some characters feel underwhelming and the overuse of minor characters is a little trying at times. Yet the positives easily outweigh the negatives; the story and scale are both truly epic, the world feels alive and believable, and the tone is morally ambiguous and undeniably intoxicating. Here's to hoping my issues are remedied in the sequel.

The film is a 2 hour long masterclass in cinematography, set, costume and production design, the works. And the images are just so hauntingly pretty, utterly mesmerizing from start to end.<br /><br />I'm also enjoying the supplementary materials, including a new interview with critic Tony Rayns. I was also suitably impressed by both Maggie Cheung & Tony Leung's impeccable command of English during the press conference at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2000.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again, what's wrong with a good guy for a hero? I happen to think they exist...I have one at home, and maybe Nicholas Sparks is tired of too many writers bashing men. Sorry for the bunny trail...I was reading some of the one-star reviews on this book. How could any reader say that the 'bad guy' (I hate spoilers, so I won't elaborate) wasn't scary? I guess she's never known anyone in an abusive relationship. Yes, I prefer my heroes to have a few faults, as it's natural, but that's not what this story is about. It's about overcoming your fears, the will to live, the strength to make a new life, and if it touches just one woman who might be in this same situation and gives her the power to escape, great.<br /><br />Now, onto my review. As always, the story is well-written and easy to read, and a perfect escape from life. And that's why I read. Without giving away spoilers, I'll just say for those of you who are cautious about which Sparks' books to read without crying for days afterward, this is one of them. Yes, you'll shed a few tears, but the good kind. I'll add this to my other favorite Sparks' books, 'The Lucky One' and 'The Last Song'.<br /><br />Oh...and of course I figured out the twist...but it was still great.

0714845183|5.0|To see more pictures from the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />John William Waterhouse is a British painter of the Pre-Raphaelite order. This art book (published by Phaidon Press, well known for their visual art books) is a splendid collection of the artist's bountiful collection of work.<br /><br />The prints of the artists' paintings in the book are big, clear, crisp and faithful to the original. ( I've seen a few of them, especially Lady Of Shalott in Tate Britain, London. )<br /><br />Most of the art work are also reproduced on individual pages and not split across both, which makes for easy viewing.<br /><br />I am no art historian and cannot vouch for the quality of writing in the book, but based on the quality and quantity of Waterhouse's paintings the book comes highly recommended.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Anybody who thinks that this product isn't fantastic for the money is looking at it from the wrong perspective. Let's pause here and think about what the product does, and how much you have to pay for it. Now think about other products that do something similar, and how much you have to pay for those...The ability to use your smartphone or tablet as a remote is a nice feature, but having the ability to wirelessly share your laptop screen is fantastic! Granted if you're trying to stream video from your local files, it will tend to be a bit laggy but if you're just attempting show the family portraits this product is fantastic! Another great product from Google.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm really surprised at all the glowing reviews here. And the price gouging here is horrible too. If you do buy it go to Best Buy - I waited a week. Anyway, this thing is very limited.  I did the install, tried to \\"cast\\" and got extremely choppy video with no audio.  The icon turned red, indicated there may be a problem with my internet connection speed, so I checked it.  18 mbps.  Really?  Tried another tv, also tons of lag, but audio worked this time, so I figure something was up with the surround sound on the first tv.  Anyway, the only way to make it bearable was to drop the video quality to \\"standard,\\" but even then there was noticeable lagging more than I'm willing to put up with.  Returning it.

0064471837|5.0|I will freely admit to being initially wary to read this book, having never read any of Garth Nix's other work. But even a sceptic cannot resist being pulled into this novel. It's a colourful, fully-fleshed world filled with wonderful characters with so much to offer. There is just enough mystery to keep you hooked, and enough left unsaid to keep you waiting for more. I love that he writes his characters flawed, as human beings are flawed, and that heroes are not all they are cracked up to be. I especially love how refreshing his take on many supernatural and fantastical elements are- not everyone can pull off necromancy, or the underworld, or magic in general. Now an avid fan, I cannot recommend his books more!

Little did I know I was in for a very pleasant surprise. Sabriel is a fantastic book with a great story, great setting, and great characters. Few books really immerse you into a fantasy universe in the way that Sabriel manages to. I would recommend this book and the rest of the Abhorsen trilogy to anyone.

Or maybe she doesn't end up with Sam...who knows for sure, since she ended the series and we just have to speculate?? I hated this book!!! Totally hated it!!!

B0043X1FL8|5.0|The story behind this movie is nothing short of astonishing as well as very moving. It is a true story of a compassionate doctor who tries to help solve the mystery regarding a group of patients who have withdrawn into a coma-like existence and live within the confines of a health facility with little hope for recovery.<br />The story will stir your heart, leaving you with thoughts that hope endures even when prospects are nil.<br />I've watched this movie before and this is one that is worth watching now and again.<br />The acting is exceptional. Robert DeNiro is a favorite actor of mine as is Robin Williams. Love this movie.

B002GHIPYI|4.0|A surprisingly great sounding HiFi Headphone for 30-ish dollars.  Its sound quality is really jaw dropping for its price range. Its sound signature can compete with headphones in the 75 to 100 dollar price range. However, its clear that at 30 dollars they had to cut corner's somewhere and that place is materials. While being pretty sturdy its clearly made of fairly cheap materials. Also the sound while Bright can occasionally on certain recordings can easily veer into the harsh department. However these Can's respond well to EQ so just round that treble off a bit on the end and you get Astounding bang for buck.

0738711500|5.0|I am new to Tarot, and have wanted to learn for a long time.  I am recovering from surgery for a month, so I thought this would be a good time to start.  The deck is quite pretty; the artwork is beautiful.  Some cards are a little different in the symbolism than a standard RW deck, and sometimes it slightly alters the interpretation.  For this reason, I am also studying a standard RW deck, and using two additional books for more interpretations of the cards.  Overall, I think this is a good set.  The book is helpful, and may be a little short on card meanings, but it's a good place to start.  Really learning Tarot will take more intense studying from other sources.  I am happy with this purchase.

B00DVXVMT6|4.0|Chimaira released their newest album \\"Crown The Phantoms\\" last week, which was their seventh studio album of their career. While I haven't been a real fan of them in the past, I decided to give this album a listen after hearing the first song, \\"The Machine.\\" This track has a really solid chorus with a nice hook that's backed by a thundering riff that reminds me of something that might appear on a Lamb of God album. The one thing I disliked about this band in the past was the vocals, but I enjoyed them in this song. Their lineup changed quite a lot from their last record to this one, so that may be why I liked this one. \\"No Mercy\\" is another memorable track that features some chilling vocals that can resonate with many people, despite its slightly repetitive nature.<br /><br />\\"All That's Left Is Blood\\" provides a very heavy, in-your-face type of song that will fire up any fan and get them headbanging for sure. \\"I Despise\\" provides the ultra-heavy song that combines with intensely angry lyrics and a sick intro. It's not the most intricate song, but it has its purpose. \\"Plastic Wonderland\\" has some wonderful guitar work as well, although it's not the greatest song other than that. Once the interlude, \\"The Transmigration\\" hits, the album begins to drop off a little though. The title track is just average and I don't care too much for \\"Kings of the Shadow World.\\" The second half of \\"Spineless\\" is great though, especially the breakdown right before the guitar solo. Great job by the band on that one.<br /><br />One other thing that I like about this album is that the tracks mostly are able to stand out from each other. That's one major problem in the metal scene today, and Chimaira accomplishes it with this record. The first half of the album is very strong, and it's strong enough to make up for any mediocrity in other songs. I think this is one of those albums that will grow on you the more you listen to it, so I recommend it for any fan of groove metal or just metal ingeneral. If you haven't been a fan of Chimaira in the past, now might be a good time to start.

The kind of novel you read and thank the writer for saying the things we think but wouldn't dare to say. Well developed characters and excellent dialogue. Worth buying as a gift or for yourself. I'd just like to note it's more of a young adult book but necessarily for teens only.

0064471837|5.0|I stumbled upon this book by chance while working as a librarian at my old high school. Being a lover of all thing fantasy, the cover caught my eye, so I picked it up one day while on a break. I started reading it, and I was hooked almost immediately by the wonderful writing, great characters, unique setting, and exciting plot. I have since read the rest of the trilogy and am happy to say I have become a real fan of Garth Nix. He is a masterful writer. Readers, both male and female, will find themselves cheering on the female lead Sabriel. Obviously I have added this book to my fantasy collection and do re-read it from time to time...It's that good!!!
B000AP04KQ|2.0|After reading other reviews I figured this was a great movie to watch.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />There was potential for Office Space to be a great comedy but it just never got off the ground.  The characters never developed and Jennifer Anniston's part was terrible.  Wasn't her fault she was just given a bad script (and other actors)to work with.  I think they just used her name to sell more tickets as this was during her run on Friends.<br /><br />After the main character (I can't remember his name as there was nothing to remember) gets hypnotized and starts to not care at all about working at Initech it was about to get interesting and then it just fell flat.  The producers could have gone in different directions to make it a good movie and they dropped the ball.<br /><br />Mike Judge seemed to do the same thing with Beavis and Butthead in his MTV days.  His shows just always seem to lack something and finish way to early with a workable story line that could have ended much better.
0763644765|5.0|I checked this book out of the library for my first daughter and she loved it so much that I bought a copy. My second daughter loves it even more. We are working on using the potty at a younger age - this would not be much fun for a 3.5 year old, but it's great for a child into &#34;Good Night Moon&#34; or similar board books. Actually, my daughters love all of Leslie Patricelli's books, so I would recommend them all, but this is probably their favorite.
B00AEFY0F2|4.0|This really is an excellent movie but I gave it only 4 stars since it said the aspect ratio was 1:33: to 1 which is a full screen movie...this is a wide screen movie which personally I really do not care for. It will be watched though since we do have a wide screen TV and my husband I am sure will enjoy it.Thanks
B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9, in my opinion, is Avatar done right.  Both movies deal with themes of discrimination involving aliens and the main character eventually siding with the aliens and having to fight against his own people.  The story and themes in both films has been done to death, but District 9 manages to do it in a way that does not feel so cliché.  They both have amazing special effects.  However, District 9 produced great effects with a much smaller budget.  The main character, Wikus (Sharlto Copley), while I do not like him much at first, does not feel like the stereotypical hero like Sam Worthington's character in Avatar does and he feels more real.  I bought his plight more and his transition from a naïve person to liking the aliens feels natural.  Plus the film is very violent which makes the action more exciting for me.  I definitely recommend this film, but I would caution in letting your children view it.  The film is very dark and not for everyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A heart rending, masterfully written love story. Full of compassion and dignity. It beautifully describes the bittersweet  rollercoaster that our human live is.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a very fun game!! it was hard at times but made it thought! my kids really had a great time helping me
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is the perfect complement for the Plantronics Voyager Legend.  It protects the headset and charges at the same time.  I could not ask for a better case.  I've had it for several months now and the case has held up very well and allows me to go days on end without having to charge my headset.  I only use my headset a few times a day and I only have to charge the case maybe once every 1-2 weeks depending on how much I use it.
B0029ZA3H4|3.0|I feel if you read this book as well as The Thank You Economy like I did you wasted your time, both books seem to be a copy of each other. Maybe I missed something but I don't think so. Read one of them but save your money and don't buy the other.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was a little bit dumb but still funny.<br />I would definitely read it again if I had to .
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Music and England are two of my favorite things.  There's plenty of each in \\"Quartet.\\"  It could have been uncomfortable seeing old people because I'm of a certain age, but these people were talented and, except for one, they were civilized.  I would recommend the movie.  Even if it's not your cup of tea, it's short enough that you won't have wasted too much of your life.
B000BMYWYC|5.0|Bought this at a local hobby shop for about 6.00 bucks or so.<br /><br />The product is great. I like the thickness and shape of the glass bottle, and the ridges on the cap. Once removed, you'll notice a very fine applicator brush connected to the cap. The brush nearly reaches the bottom of the bottle (Which is kind of redundant - Unless you're using this as a primary modeling glue for American/non-snap fit kits, then this stuff will last you a VERY long time.).<br /><br />The cement itself is great. When applied to most model-kit plastics, it will slightly 'melt' the outer layer of plastic, which allows you to cleanly press and fuse parts together. This is wonderful for Gundam parts that need fixing. Most glues create an outer 'shell' of glue (and it usually looks nasty) that doesn't hold objects together... this stuff literally fuses a part together, making it near impossible for it to separate unless you repeat the reason why the part was broken in the first place! :p Haha.<br /><br />All in all, 5 stars. Great super-thin cement, easy to apply to odd and small areas, fuses parts for a near perfect hold, and will last at least a few months to a couple years. I've had mine 6 months already, and I'm not even a quarter way through the bottle. And NO evaporation! :D
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app works perfectly but I uninstalled it because Lookout said it contains malware and adware. Looking for another alarm clock app.
B00080DIWE|4.0|I bought this at a local hobby shop for $15 bucks. I highly recommend you check your local shop to see if they come cheaper. I'm not sure why the parent company would up-sell it while their 3rd-party counterparts sell them for less. Usually the opposite is true, lol.<br /><br />the stand is great. Comes with a piece for holding car models, and the regular circular stand with various holes and slits to hold parts.<br /><br />I use toothpicks, BBQ sticks, and Tamiya alligator clips (the 4-pack) for the holes. The Model Stand itself also comes with 4 flat-head clips (NOT the alligator clips). These are alright, but they tend to suck at gripping most small parts. Hence why I also bought the alligator clips to go with them, as they hold MUCH better and are designed for use on this particular stand.<br /><br />The stand itself does swivel, so it's not all that great for hand painting. Even while spray-painting using cans, I've had to be careful now to put too much pressure on a single part, otherwise the whole stand begins to turn. Not a big issue.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it would work with airbrushing. Better, I assume, since you can control air pressure with an airbrush.<br /><br />all in all, good product, I'd recommend it to anyone that models/paints cars, tanks, and other military vehicles.<br /><br />As for a spray painting base, you're much better off grabbing a fat piece of styrofoam from your last (or next) appliance/electronics purchase, and using BBQ sticks and alligator clips (NOT the tamiya ones -- you need the ones with the prongs at the end to wrap around BBQ sticks), and just stick all your parts on that.
159514188X|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It is amazing how how much people really do impact our lives and the decisions we make.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed it t. his game not to hard once you get the idea of collecting and using the objects. Its a fun game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game. This is the ONLY game  I have ever purchased cuz I don't buy games but it was so worth it. Can  wait  for  the  sequel!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. I cant wait to show it to my sons. they'll love it too! ive played this game for hours.
0679805273|5.0|Not one of my favorite Seuss books, but still a classic.<br /><br />Bought this one to have my daughter's preschool teachers sign at the end of the school year. The idea is that you get all of their teachers to sign in the book then you give it to your child when they graduate high school. Can't wait to do this for my sweet girls!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A good quality game,  it's even more fun if you are a fan of the movies!! Highly recommend this game!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really well written. The book concentrates on three families, all connected through the most unlikely circumstances. I couldn't put the book down. And the cherry on top is the epilogue. It will leave you speechless.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|The game appears to be like the boardgame.  I am having trouble seeing all the options and find it difficult to win.  Maybe with more practice I'll get better.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|When I pay for an app I DON'T expect to be bombarded with adds! Too bad I didn't read other reviews first!
B004TJ1H32|5.0|received it and it was in great condition. will be ordering movies in the future. no scratches and what a funny movie
0064471837|5.0|This book is fantastic! This fast paced fantasy will keep you on your toes and frightened the entire trip. Well rounded characters, dazzling settings, terrifying undead and magical foes, monsters, allies, mysteries, and all along the way I was spell bound.  I think I've turned every page of Sabriel more than a dozen times, and on every trip through its story I find something new to love.<br /><br />Sabriel is the smart, but hesitant teenage heroine. She is realistic, unlike some heroine's she isn't an idiot or a natural adventurer, but she learns fast and does her best to make good decisions. Her search for her father leads her to some rather terrifying places, even to walk in death.  Though death is no stranger to her.<br /><br />Does the walker choose the path or the path the walker.
161655164X|4.0|You may be getting a lot of the art that was featured in the in-game gallery, but it's nice to have it in the format of a coffee table book.  Fascinating for those interested in the visual art that is needed prior to programming, and a great game to use in this format.
0399160450|4.0|As always, Hard Cover weights like 3 pounds, not recommended for vacationing, nor for every night sleep. keep it in mind
1616550414|4.0|I wish it didn't dedicate a third of the book to Skyward Sword, but the rest covers the entire series loyally.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|what were u thinking really a help guide but no game. be forreal. ibought two kindle fires for kids.tbey hate it. the buttons dknt even press right. every word needs edited. everything about the kindle fire is dumb.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Maybe I am just used to using this App on the IPhone, but I don't like the interface as much.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it lots. very awesome game. its addictive. no prodlems.  I have a very hard time pulling the silly slthing down.
B009X00E18|4.0|Case is good.  Does what I expected it to.<br />I looked at a few cases at the lower end of cost.  Cases in general are expensive for what they do.<br />Unfortunately it is inline with all the others, If you go less you get less, you want more you have to pay a lot.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Excellent book to read for business, personal or development.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to grow and develop.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|I have tried this several times and can not tell any difference with it installed. I cannot recommend this app at all.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|There are very few movies out there that I regret spending $3.99 for unfortunately, this is one of them. It looks like the aim in this movie was to produce a creative artful piece - that mark was missed. You have to pay close attention to follow the story line too bad there's not much there to grab your attention.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Gripping! Could not put it down! Read in two days! Wonderfully written and can't wait to read the next two books!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I find this by far Hosseini's most complex novel.  One really has to pay attention to keep the story lines straight.  I wasn't particularly interested in the Afghanis before I started The Kite Runner, but Hosseini certainly draws his readers into his world--and what an interesting world it is!  Of his three novels, &#34;Mountains&#34; should set Hosseini's reputation as a major writer in this century.  Maybe he can do for Afghanistan what Dickens did for Victorian England.  I hope so.
0064471837|5.0|This book was one of the earliest Garth Nix novels I read, and it is by far one of my favorites. The characters are both strongwilled and perfectly faulted. This novel shows the many battles that everyone must face (battles of willpower, earning trust, letting go, upholding beliefs) and those that are unique (facing monsters, battling the undead, using magic).<br /><br />Above all though I admire the dedication to world building. The world he creates is imaginative, rich and full-bodied with fresh and creative takes on a classic fantasy structure. South of the Wall you have a society that is fairly modern and similar to our own world (circa 1930, in my mind) meeting with the high fantasy magic of necromancers, mages, and clairvoyants. There is a meeting of worlds and struggles to make sense of the nonsensical, there are old fashioned castles and tanks, magic airplanes and steam trains. While we don't get to see much of the world south of the Wall, it lends a unique dichotomy to the perceptions of the characters.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this novel and all its sequels to anyone who enjoys fantasy. I would also recommend any other book written by Garth Nix for those who love to thoroughly explore strange new universes, he has yet to let me down in that area.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Khalid Hosseini brings his sympathetic yet clear-eyed touch to his study of the role of women in the Muslim world. How can Americans understand a society which treats its women as these women are treated?  The only thing I can say is that these women's pathos and nobility are like Greek classical drama.  And you know what the Greek women did to the Greek men.
B004RL9T50|4.0|It was a refreshing spin on a familiar story of finding yourself. kudos to the creation team on this one.
B00E193TM2|5.0|It's everything you expect from FFDP. Aggressive, unapologetic, and leaves you wanting more. Dot your eyes and wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell are my favorite tracks, but every song is great. I really couldn't find one song i didn't care for at all. It's a must if you're a fan already but if  you're not this album will make you one...
B005NFVZTM|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie. I liked the villians and the heroes. They came off better than the X-Men 1-3 cast.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Since they change the format the app is hard to read and those silly games.I just want the weather and go back to the original format.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is fun and easy to pay. I've just downloaded it and I believe I am already slightly addicted to it lol just needs to be easier to zoom in and out but that could be me being new to the game and my kindle
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|My husband absolutely loves this show.  The drama is good, the action is great, and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|If you like the backstreet boys this is a great cd! It has all the hits and much better than the other greatest hits cds out there!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Love it, just like the Black Sabbath from the old days. If you liked the old band, you will love this CD.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I absolutely love this cd! It has to been the best one so far! I saw them in concert and the show was amazing! They performed most of these songs and having this cd brings it all back to life! Highly recommend! They did a great job with this one!
1400069289|5.0|I take issue with a couple points (what the author attributes to willpower I attribute to mindfulness, and Rosa Parks planned that bus action with MLK on purpose) but overall this book is really good.  I learned a lot and have been telling others about it.  Thank you!

B00DUGCLY4|3.0|don't like not being able to skip when stumped!  otherwise it is a great brain workout. fun and entertaining while inspiring creativity.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This is a great combo-pack for both the movies! We got it as a gift for our son who is a huge Ghostbusters fan!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I have a Galaxy Tab 2 10. We are homeschoolers and I have a second grader and preschooler. For the preschooler I am using the More Starfall Pre-K Curriculum in pdf form. For the second grader we have several unit curriculums in pdf, like Intellego's K-2 Astronomy.<br /><br />For larger pdf files, like what Intellego has, it takes a bit to load . However I can load them in polaris office or the kindle app almost immediatly, so this is an app issue, not my device's issue. Smaller files load quickly. I have not had it not load any files, just had to wait a bit for them on some.<br /><br />I am in the process of working out the coming school year and this has been a wonderful tool. As I'm reading through and writing the plan I can also make notes or suggestions on the actual curriculum to remind myself then, instead of trying to cram it all in the planner or printing out the pdfs to have in hand (like I've done in the past when planning). So this is saving us paper and ink (& the money they cost)- which is a big plus. I really love the notes, highlights and word boxes. Since I have two for the first time this year I have been trying to line up learning as much as possible so they are on complimentary subjects at the same time (so that field trips and crafts will be relevant to both children's studies). Being able to note right on the curriculum where there are tie ins between the two grades has been especially helpful.<br /><br />However, you can only read the notes in the repligo app. It does not save to the pdf so the notes aren't visable unless you open the pdf with the repligo app (I have tried polaris office and the kindle app- neither display the notes on the pdfs from repligo). I don't have a big problem with this, except on protected pdfs like intellego's I can not make notes because of the pdf permissions say it can't be edited. So something is messed up here. Since I can see the notes are being saved on the app, not the pdf, there is no editing issue. If the developer could fix this (either by saving notes to the pdf so they can be seen on any pdf reader, or by allowing the notes (which are clearly not edits as they are not saved within the pdf file) on all pdfs I would raise my review by a star. Either fix would be worth the extra star, as either option adds a lot of usability to this app.<br /><br />Also, I read the review about being helpful for knitters and agree. It is also great for crafts, which are often pdfs or ebook pdfs from craft sites. Many knit/crochet patterns I do are pdf downloads from Ravelry. Being able to make notes, comments or mark place on my tablet is awesome :)<br /><br />I read this has internet permission, I'm not sure why it does though. It works fine without internet on. I took 2 stars off for the odd permission, not saving to the pdf/not working on all pdfs and clunky wait time- even with those this is a solid 3 star or better app, for our purposes.eveloper could fix this (either by saving notes to the pdf so they can be seen on any pdf reader, or by allowing the notes (which are clearly not edits as they are not saved within the pdf file) on all pdfs I would raise my review by a star.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It explained a lot that was contained in the other Hobbit films but I liked explanation and the theme of this movie much better than the others. There seemed to be too many drawn out action scenes to satisfy the action junkies but the theme throughout was worth it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing book I would give it a 10. The story is just a great book and I loved it. It is sad that kids are scared of his face but what they  don't realize is what he is like on the inside. They don't understand that inside him is love and kindness. They also don't realize what he feels like in the inside and what his true feelings are. God made his face like that, but what he wants is people to realize what he is like on the inside and what his feelings are, not what he looks like. This is a book I would recommend this book to you. Another book similar to this one is Out of My Mind. This is another book I would reccomend to you.JL, age 10
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had read the book and had looked forward to seeing the movie in the theater. Sadly I missed it while it was playing so I opted for the home theater and Bluray version. This DVD did not let me down. It was a tad long but worth every second of my time.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. At times I laughed a little or smiled, but most of the time I felt like crying. I believe that it is wonderful to know what happened during the Holocaust so that if it ever comes up again people will know that it has to stop. I love that the book is written from Deaths point of view. And how it doesn't keep its point on what happens in the concentration camps, but in the regular German towns.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|the first time I heard Buble..I instantly fell in love with his music and his voice! music that calms the soul
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I pre ordered this cd, I had to wait up to an extra week to get it, when it came in a packaging envelope I was ecstatic! I opened it up, the cd was brand new. I listened to it before I had the cd and cried happy tears. I listened to it five times in two days, I got it from amazon by bmg music club. I love soldier, Madeleine, show em what your made of, trust me, and in a world like this. After 16 years and counting I'm still their fan.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love it love these kinds of games i try to play them all they are so fun a must play
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This started slowly and progressed to 2 main characters destined to be together. A few twists later the story became interesting.<br />Lonely characters in a small county that tried to make do. The orphanage part of the story was hard to read and understand how cruel people can be. Especially people of the cloth. Just a sad story but at least it had a happy ending.
1452126577|5.0|For anyone who looks at this animal you have to love him.  He makes a bad day better with his looks and comments about life in general.  Try it and you will be hooked.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Interesting connections one wouldn't imagine are explained.<br />Things happen for a reason.... interesting reasons that I certainly never would have thought of.<br />It's a very readable book.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I truly do like this game. I really do. I meen, what's not to like? Cool music in the background, u get to play live with really people, and there's TUNS of cool other things like buying presents for people and stuff as kind of motivators.<br /><br />  BUT...........<br /><br /> The uno flaw in this game is the fact that you have to pay money for each round, if you don't want to wait 45 mins each time for a scratch thingy.<br /><br /> Anyhoo.......<br /><br />So that's what I think. I mean, over all, the game is really good. I think you should get it.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This was like the best book ever. The party scene from Roddick's party head so cool. Best book in the world
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game!!!! I play it all the time! Me and my friend, every time he comes over, it's us taking turns playing this game! Get it! ... NOW!

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really fun for me, and my grandma to play. I like the harder levels  tiny bit more than the easy ones. And I ans so close to finishing it!
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|bought this and was disappointed because it won't let me play I had a kindle fire HD if you have one expect not to be a ble to pick your map DO NOT connect to face book (the cause of the glitch
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Well what I mean is sometimes if I press the back button on the app it goes all the way back to the YouTube menu,and sometimes it will automatically go to some video I didn't even click on. Yeah it is good at playing videos,but it also has a few flaws that get hard to deal with as you continue to watch videos on the app.I actually just got though with watching videos on this app and it made me upset that I wasted my time on this. I truly don't believe this app deserves any stars,but
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Silly movie at times!  I loved the music so much that I bought the soundtrack. I also loved the actors.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I'm very lukewarm on this book as it seems parts of it were thrown it for little reason (Ms. Swanson for instance) other than to lengthen the book.  People seem to come back from the dead far too easily with often unbelievable plot lines (trained lions, really) and there is a confusing cast of characters, too many IMHO.<br /><br />If you are new to Preston & Childs, do NOT make this your first book, you really need to read the series before this one, otherwise I think you'll be completely lost as there isn't much back story given.  The history of most of the characters is long and deep and without it, the whole story seems far too unbelievable to be enjoyable.<br /><br />In fairness to the authors, it is extremely well written, moves along at a good pace and has lots of action although much of it too far out there to be in the same zip code as realistic.  And of course, it had to end with an opening for the next sequel so diehard fans will be happy and those less enthused may feel that enough is enough, end the series and move onto new material.  I would put myself firms in the later category.
B005K17RU0|3.0|would prefer that the current weather conditions and the weather radar be the intro screens. don't want to have to page deep into app to see what is happening outside now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ton of fun and addictive. Gru and the minions are here for a who's the best of a minion contest. Grab points and grab new minion outfits and battle a new villain
0380977281|4.0|By coincidence, this is the first book I've finished since The Thief of Always by Clive Barker. These books are both fairytale types, and if you exclude a bit of blood and (if my count is correct) exactly two curse words from Stardust, then both books could be enjoyed by all ages.<br />That being said, because they are both short, fairytale books by authors who specialize in dark fantasy, it's hard Not to compare them. I do think The Thief of Always is better than Stardust, mainly because \\"Thief\\" was a book I could not put down (literally, I read it in about 7-8 hours), while Stardust, unputdownable for the first 150 pages, loses just a touch of its charm. Still, it's an entertaining ride and well worth the read for those who want nothing more than an entertaining, enjoyable piece of imagination.<br /><br />It's what you'd expect in a fantasy story . . . odd characters . . . unique language . . . impossible worlds that exist and so on. All in all, it's a fun book, absolutely worth reading. Fans of Gaiman, as well as fans of fantasy, will certainly want to add Stardust to their reading list. Looking forward to the movie now!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have the first game in this series and this one is just as good.  I highly recommend it.  I play it on the Kindle Fire HD and an Android tablet.  Works well on both.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I would recommend this adapter to anyone needing a high quality one that won't slowly break the hdmi input on my mac mini
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This program has been my default alarm clock since I bought it over a year ago.  It allows me to set a number of useful features, including choosing what sound(s)/song(s) to play, able to set multiple alarms, label what each alarm is for, set repeats for individual days of the week, make it more difficult to snooze/dismiss (like setting math problems), etc.<br /><br />It's better than the alarms I've seen on my phones in the past, and definitely superior to an alarm clock you'd plug in.  The free version isn't even stripped down at all (it just has a small banner ad at the top).  I definitely recommend this program.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game had a blast playing it. Can not wait till more levels are made. I think that I am going to be addicted.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is an amazing escape into another world. Having a strong female heroine is both inspiring and refreshing. The characters have such dynamic personalities the reader feels as if they really know them and form a relationship with them. Readers will be sucked in and want to devour every book in the series.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|The borrowing of themes and memes from other sci-fi movies can't be ignored. Thus deduct a star for lack of originality. But the special effects and beautiful cinematography are (to use a clich&eacute;) truly visually arresting. (That it's not completely CGI makes a huge difference. Are you reading this, Mr. Lucas?) The acting is actually really good. (Cruise gives a great, nuanced performance ... for once.) I regret missing seeing this in the movie theaters or Imax. The \\"extras\\" in the Blue Ray are not overwhelming. But they are interesting. It's not clear why the deleted scenes were deleted. They all should have been left in. If you can overlook the borrowed thematic elements then you will love this movie.<br />P.S. Almost forgot -- the sound track by M83 is fantastic. It adds to the overall quality of this movie. I've got it play-listed on my Spotify account. I have actually been listening to it all summer since it came out.
B0000549B0|3.0|I had only seen snippets of the classic film previously, and remembrance of those is what led to my purchase. Jimmy Stewart's Elwood is an appealing character the first few times he's on the screen. But over the course of the film, he comes off as being sickeningly sweet and overbearing. The storyline is darker than I had thought also, with the genuine health condition of  alcoholism and a farcical treatment of family members throwing relatives into mental institutions against their will.  With all that going on, the 6 foot plus invisible rabbit can't save the day.  Oh, and the DVD &#34;extras&#34; are worthless.  Watch it one it comes on broadcasts TV.
B005EVE8WG|5.0|Amazing, highly technical musical artistry with an 80s feel. Beware, however... You'll have a hard time going back to most music actually recorded in the 80s. After listening to these guys, the classics sound simplistic and mundane.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome competitive and caring it Is really fun I love this game every one should play this cool game
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|As an actor and filmmaker myself, as well as a huge fantasy fan, I truly have trouble understanding why people are so viciously critical of this movie. They call it stupid, but I would argue it is less stupid than the majority of Hollywood films, especially considering the inherently campy story at its base. Mamoa has magnetic charisma and, I think, serves as an excellent anchor for a mostly mindless (by design) action flick.<br /><br />Personally, I would say this is a more dynamic and entertaining movie than the original Conan the Barbarian. I would definitely recommend it for fantasy lovers, understanding the story at its base is intentionally overblown.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My name's Leah and I am 12 years old I actually finished these books awhile ago and have been meaning to write a review for some time a really really bad one but when I tried I just couldn't upbraid them the last book pretty much broke my heart I get really emotionally invested in my books and when I read the paragraph where peeta tried to kill katniss, if Suzanne Collins was near me I would've done something I would regret but when I finished it and cooled off I realized that even though I wanted her to rewrite it I couldn't think of another way to end it  (exept for finick not dying)  because peta going insane almost broke her but still motivated her and prim dying brought the truth to light (but her doing nothing but singing was a little weird though I get it) and there's always the movie which I hope will be a little different but not much the first one wasn't as good as the book cause they only showed peetas shall I say sensitive side not his more aggressive side like in the book and that was a huge mistake but the actors were pretty spot on and another thing in the movie katniss doesn't have a kinda friendly relationship with effie or her prep team but cinna was awesome in the movie OH Ya I don't see why cinna had to die and not be imprisoned or tortured but his dress was amazing I can't wait to see it in the movies like many others . Anyway I probably bored you half to death (if anybody besides me reads these things , which I highly doubt) for now. :-)

B0052GACNM|5.0|Happy 88th Birthday to Tony Bennett! It's almost impossible to believe that 6 decades have passed since he first graced our ears with his incredible voice but even more breathtaking is the fact that he is still performing and recording! One of his favorite instruments outside of the brass and woodwind sections is the piano...and grand pianos have 88 keys! That's one key for every year he's been on this earth...I don't think I'll ever look at another grand piano and not think of him as long as I live! There are other configurations on the grand but those are rare exceptions...one having 92 keys and another having 97 and both made by Boesendorfer, not Steinway! His most recent musical offerings feature duets recorded with a very eclectic group of wonderfully talented artists. Now, I don't own an Amy Winehouse CD nor do I own a Lady Gaga CD or DVD and I wouldn't have thought either of these ladies would do justice to anything Bennett has sung in his varied career. Boy, was I ever wrong!!! Their voices compliment his on a grand scale. Along with the ability to do justice to the songs comes the trademark Tony Bennett way of feeling and interpreting great music...I think all these wonderful artists have &#34;IT&#34; in spades!  In fact, they're so good I'm looking forward to a Duets III and IV even...given the talent out there today as many Duets CD's as his voluminous songbook can support!  Happy 88th Tony and let's all remember to Keep The Music Playing!

B00005MP58|5.0|I missed all the hoohah when this was first aired in the late nineties due to my postgraduate exams. Finally when things settled down, I borrowed this from the local video shop. To my amazement I watched the 4 part miniseries in 1 sitting! Then watched it all again the next day! It was Darcy-mania!<br />Out of all the different large and small screen adaptations, this one captures the essence and in my opinion, is the closest rendition of the the Jane Austen novel. I believed this role of Darcy catapulted Colin Firth to superstardom and earned him the reputation as the thinking woman's sex symbol. To me, he is the ultimate Darcy. Move over Laurence Olivier, Matthew MacFadyen, David Rintoul, fine performance but still just acting.<br />The bubbly piano music, the costumes, the cast were just superb. Andrew Davies did a great job creating this champagne lightness and upbeat style shows again that he is a master of BBC costume dramas.<br />Of course I bought my own copy plus 3 more to give to my female friends, who I believe we're all infatuated with Colin Firth, even the 70 year old retired grandmother.

B004JVXTL8|3.0|Not ever having heard of 'reality' films, the first I saw had me in its grip for some time before the more obvious 'things like that do not happen' came on. From then on, it was an  OK movie but not much more. By the next one, I was beginning to get bored by the method. So it was with this one. I was easily drawn to the characters and situation, began to get a little bored about 15 minutes in, and by 35 was eager to get on with it. The first ' it can't happen',  well after the 'happenings' began, put me in a  more judgmental mood, and there I stayed. I have found much more willingness in my mind to completely suspend judgment in a well done 'normal', movie, science fiction, conspiracy theory, etc., where we all know we are engaged in a fictional story, than I am in these pseudo-reality ones. Of course, this is only me and I cannot generalize beyond that very limited range.<br />At any rate, the actors do a fine job in helping make this seem to be reality, the script is good, and, for any who can suspend belief, it should be quite entertaining. For others, well, judge for yourself.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Have become a fan of Will Robie series.  Kept me on the edge; found it  very hard to put down
B000P0I4O4|4.0|The fact that there is little novelty in the script and an almost 'by the way' conspiracy theory, doesn't alter my pleasure in seeing Morgan Freeman and John Cusack do their stuff along with a competent cast. There are no script highlights that occur to me, no major failings. Its simply like watching a  90 minute episode of your  favorite manhunt television series.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Like many other things that Google does, you could say this is &#34;Beta&#34;.  I just don't understand why a company like Google, with the resources that they have... Why they can't make a polished product that is positioned well ?  It seems like everything they do, is &#34;Beta&#34;.  Meaning that, your expectations should be lower, that it isn't finished, and you shouldn't expect it to work properly.  It's a cop-out.  Apple, Google is not.  Apple would have never released something like this, working they way it does.  You have to appreciate they way Apple works on a product, under wraps...  Then announces it - With everything working that day, polished, and most often positioned just right.  This Chromecast is not the case.  But maybe you can't complain much...  Because it costs only $35 and boasts features that have a low-expectation &#34;Beta&#34; classification.  That is quite frankly, kind of lame though.<br /><br />  What it comes down to, is that this thing barely lives up to the expectations you would have, after all the fluff they announced at their keynote.  It's supposed to work with your phone and iOS devices, they said...  But when you get to the Chromecast set-up page, one of the first things you see that is a let-down before even using it, says &#34;iOS setup Coming soon&#34;.  So I had to set-up on my MacBook Pro.  They had a comforting &#34;Don't worry it'll work with your device after being set-up&#34; type of message though.<br /><br />  In the setup, there's a link that says &#34;get the Chrome extension here&#34; or something to that effect.  When you click on it, it of course doesn't take you to extensions and takes you to a Chromecast tutorial video page.  Maybe the web link was Beta ?  (haha).  Or maybe it installed it without me knowing or seeing it ?  But,  I had to go to the extensions gallery manually and run a search for it.  Funny that the name &#34;Chromecast&#34; is taken by another 3rd party extension.  So the extension for Chromecast is called &#34;Google Cast&#34;.  Another little detail where Google fails to streamline & standardize, is with their branding.  In the Applications folder on the Mac, Google Chrome shows-up alphabetically under G for &#34;Google Chrome&#34;.  After installing the App for Chromecast, you'd expect it to show-up under G for &#34;Google Chromecast&#34;, right alongside Google Chrome.  But no... It shows up under C for &#34;Chromecast&#34;.  Not a big deal, but another detail missed here.<br /><br />  So on to trying the thing out...  I'll give it to Google on this - the way the Chromecast icon shows-up on the YouTube app on my iPhone & iPad - without me having to update the apps on either....  That, is magical.  So, I tested watching YouTube videos on my TV.  First off, I don't really watch many YouTube videos on my larger TVs.  I watch YouTube videos on my iPad & iPhone, or computer sometimes. Because, the resolution of those videos is a mixed-bag.  You may find HD videos… But the reality of it is, that you're going to find lower resolution videos in abundance.  And they just don't look good on a bigger TV.  The lower resolution videos, you almost have to watch on a smaller window or device, so that you can even make out what's really going on.  Both my TVs already are smart TVs with a YouTube app.  But because of navigating an on-screen keyboard on the TV with a remote, the Chromecast method of watching a YouTube video, barely one-ups this.  One problem, is that when I was watching a video on YouTube via Chromecast, I wanted to change to another video, in the middle of  the previous video still playing.  When I did this, the newly chosen video just wouldn't play.  I got stuck with a gear turning and nothing happening.  This seems to happen less on my iPad than on my iPhone.  But it's pretty frequent.  Hmm, is this Beta too ?<br /><br />  Next I tried to cast a tab from Google Chrome on my computer, to my TV.  At first the, video is jagged and elements of the webpage were distorted.  But this smoothed-out after alottle bit.  The text (even very large text on a webpage) looked crappy.  I'm the only person on my wireless network, sitting 6 feet from my wireless router, which my TV is hardwired to.  And there is a very significant lag & time delay of displaying webpages.  For no explainable reason, sometimes the lag was much more significant than at other times.  Again, with me being the only person on the network.  Playing videos on CNN.com, from a Google Chrome Tab to the TV, was kind of cool in concept.  But, the audio was way, way off.  Also, the video was jerky.  And I have 50 down, 25 up Verizon Fios. I don't think internet connection is an issue here.  Also, casting a tab happens locally over the wi-fi network.  I discovered this same video played without being Chromecasted, with no delayed audio and without the jerkiness.  Maybe we can blame this on the fact that, casting a tab from Chrome is.... You guessed it - BETA !<br /><br />  So what is this Chromecast thing good for ?  Maybe the occasional YouTube video.  Maybe if you just had to show something from the internet on the TV, although not reliably.  For Netflix, I was already a Netflix subscriber and have 2 iPhones, an iPad, a Roku player, and two newer Samsung smart TVs.  The Roku & Smart TV Netflix apps are too easy to use, so why would I use my iPad or iPhones to start a movie ?  Maybe so I can avoid having to enter a search in with the TV type remotes... Would be the only reason.  And the YouTube thing... It's really a novelty.  In reality, alot of us are watching youtube videos on YouTube's website maybe not in Chrome, or watching a YouTube video that someone posted on FaceBook.  And those videos won't play on Chromecast.  Only videos you watch in the YouTube App will go to Chromecast.  That is weak.  And you can't cast a tab from your iPad even if you're using Chrome.  I updated Chrome in my iPad to make sure, but no option for Casting the tab appears.  Ipersonally, rarely ever sit a watch TV with my laptop.  If I'm looking something up on the internet or browsing FaceBook or YouTube, it's on my iPad.  Maybe, just maybe they'll expand this and let you cast any tab from Chrome in any device to the TV.  And hopefully it won't be Beta, and won't be jerky with audio out of sync.  I guess I'm not so mad about this thing, considering it cost only $35... And I supposedly got the 3 months free of Netflix.  Making it cost less than $15 essentially.  But I have yet to get the e-mail that I am supposed to receive within 5 days with the Netflix redeem code.  I mean, I know Google pulled out of giving the Netflix promotion.  But I qualify because I purchased it within the time period they stated.  Unless they're going to back out on this now.  Another thing you notice with the Chromecast, is the packaging and accessories you get with it.  The packaging is too expensive for the price.  You also get an AC to USB power supply, a USB to USB micro cable with a nice Velcro strap on it, and a short (maybe 3-4inch) HDMI male to female extension cable with gold-plated plugs.  I did have to use the USB cable from my TV's USB port to power the Chromecast, although my TV is a late 2012 model with three HDMI 1.4 ports and should've powered it.  But it makes you wonder how much money Google is making off of this thing.  Google sitting on piles of money.  And the most likely reason for this Chromecast is seems... Is probably for mining your data and viewing habits, or trying to drive people to Google Play, & advertisements.  Maybe they're trying to find a cheap gadget they can plant in people's homes to help the NSA bug people....Who knows.<br /><br />  To sum up what I think about it.  This thing is cool for a dongle, yet weak for a set-top box type device.  I'd say Google Chromecast is a device that is not ready for primetime.  It's not clear what it's good for at this moment.  But it definitely doesn't do what it's supposed to do, very well.  But it does it.  Maybe it's a poor-man's AppleTV... But isn't that the position, the Roku LT takes @ $49 ?!  They can't really be compared though.  Because this thing is an HDMI dongle.  I'm not sure where the Chromecast fits-in between streaming media players and smart TVs etc.  The Chromecast might be good for that person who refuses to pay for content or buy a Roku & AppleTV.  The person that watches video from a computer/websites and wants it on their TV.  Maybe it's for the PC user - Who thinks bad behavior like this is normal and doesn't mind the jerkiness or out-of-sync audio (Haha, I'm a Mac guy).  It might be good for someone who doesn't have a Smart TV.  This is great for the people out there, that don't know the AppleTV or Roku boxes exist.  Let's face it, the AppleTV works pretty well and Airplay mirroring most definitely works better than Tab casting on the Chromecast.  I actually don't own an AppleTV believe it or not.  But even though the AppleTV is referred to as Apple's &#34;hobby&#34; product... It still works better than Google's (Beta) Chromecast.  If you're that guy that thinks using a computer is going to sit down at your desk with the monster tower computer, and you're looking for a way to watch the crap you download off torrents etc., that you want to see on your big TV.... Then this is for you.  Maybe if you're that guy that complains how Macs are too expensive and that a PC cost 1/3rd the price, then this, at $35 (versus AppleTV's $99), is for you.  If you're hoping it'll get better (like Windows 8 & the Surface), than this is for you.  Can't afford the Roku ?  This is for you.  Don't want to be &#34;down with the system&#34; and don't want to pay for cable, or buy an AppleTV , or Roku... Maybe this is for you.  If you're against iTunes, paying for content, subscriptions, etc.  And you have to somehow play your web browser or adult material from you computer to TV.... Then this could be for you.  Maybe your one of the few, that is a bigGoogle Play user ?...<br /><br />  Otherwise, this is another disappointing release from Google.  Get an AppleTV, get a Roku.  They work.  Too bad Google is just blowing smoke again.  I think they suffer from a &#34;rich kid&#34; type of syndrome.  They just don't seem to have the hunger and fight, to actually make something successful and highly polished.  They just throw stuff at the wall, to see what sticks and call it &#34;Beta&#34;.  Why ?  Because they can.<br /><br />  Will Chromecast beat-out the AppleTV or Roku ?  Absolutely not.  Add this to the string of badly positioned & non-polished products that won't be a success.  Like the Nexus Q,  Google phone, Nexus tablets, and Glass.  Only difference with this is, they sold more of these things because of the price point and false advertising/incentives.  Now I'm so thrilled & excited about this product (sarcasm)...  That I'm stuck between - wanting to return it, wanting to sell it, and wanting to keep it for the cheap price.  To see if it improves at all....  Knowing that I'll hardly ever use it.  If anything, this has made me want to buy an AppleTV even more !  So, I am biased, because I am an Apple user - Not an Android or PC guy .  But I know there are all different kinds of users.  PC users that have iPhones, or Apple users that have Androids, etc.  So, the wise-cracks about Windows & Android are all in fun.  But why shouldn't something like this, just work the way it's expected ?  I would love to see Google make something awesome and maybe give Apple some competition....  Maybe raise the bar.  But that just isn't happening yet.<br /><br />  I will give Google credit, for maybe creating a new category of devices. By inventing an HDMI dongle type of device which uses your mobile device or computer as the User Interface.  But what is it worth if it doesn't really work well ?  It's a novelty.  And in reality, how much are you going to use it on a daily basis ?  I can use Netflix just as easily without using the Chromecast and not have to have my Mobile device tied to it at all.<br /><br />  Speaking of Netflix, Google did the bait & switch, false advertising.  I think this was something to get people to go crazy and buy the thing, creating this artificial demand and hype for a product that is really mediocre at best.  Later they pulled out of the Netflix promotion.  Then they said that people would get the Netflix promotion if they bought it on the day of introduction.  Then, they said there was a cutoff time on the day of promotion.  It's been lie after lie.  I can tell you one thing - I ordered the Chromecast on the day of introduction, before 5:30pm and I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY NETFLIX CODE !  After 10+ days !  This has all been pretty lame of Google to do this.  Even at $35, this is disappointing to me.  At least Amoazon customer service is good and they're supposed to have a rebate representative contact me.

B0045TYDNC|5.0|This is a great product, gives much tighter seal than the LF-1, and it easier to put on and get off. I want to convert all my lenses to this cap, however, Amazon won't let me order the 6 caps I need.<br />I can only order 2 because of \\"limited quantity or low price\\". Excuse me??? My local camera store had plenty of them and gladly sold me what I wanted for the same price than Amazon.

B001BC2ZS6|4.0|This book is a fast read. It is classic, but it's not as dull as  lot of classic books are. Steinbeck never babbled on about anything, and there is more dialogue than anything else. I liked that because I am a theatre nerd, but some people might want more description. It is fast and nothing really happens, but at the same time a ton of things happen.

B0089LOG02|5.0|From the first page of this book, I was hooked. I loved everything about it. It flowed easily, the characters were compelling and interesting and there was little to no &#34;fluff&#34; - those unnecessary descriptions that bring nothing to the story.

B00C50NV2M|5.0|I have never been truly impressed with 3D content.  After seeing Avatar, I thought it would be the next big thing, but quickly grew tired of wearing the heavy, ugly, and big active glasses I purchased for my Sharp Aquos HDTV.  I replaced the Sharp with a 70\\" Sony, that uses passive 3D technology.  I wasn't sure it would compare to the active 3D on the Sharp...oh how I was wrong.<br /><br />First off the Sony passive glasses are very light, and comfortable.  I find myself sitting through full movies without even needing to \\"rest\\" my eyes, ears, and nose.  I've even gone to the fridge a couple times not even realizing I was wearing them.  A+ on design and comfort for these glasses.<br /><br />Second is the picture, the lack of actual moving shutters, gives you a much brighter clearer HD picture.  I even re watched Avatar to compare.  The difference really is night and day.  I was a bit worried the passive glasses would lack in the picture department but I was blown away by the difference.  I don't know if its just me but it seems objects pop off the screen a lot more with the Sony passive glasses.<br /><br />Lastly not needing to charge these is a huge plus.  I recall having my parents over to show off the 3D technology and not having any glasses charged for my Sharp set.  Needless to say dad let me know how \\"amazing\\" the 3D picture was...or lack thereof.<br /><br />Only setback I had was my Sony TV didn't include the glasses (it was supposed to) but Amazon credited me the cost of 4 pairs and I purchased them locally to avoid waiting.<br /><br />Overall excellent product, great fit and comfort...highly recommended for any passive 3D TV owner.

159463176X|5.0|Another great book by Khaleid Hosseini. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the story. When I finished the book I felt like I should start over and read it again. This book is best read without (long) breaks inbetween and it is easy to do. I felt if I put it down for a few days I got confused about the characters and who is related to who. I wish I had drawn a family tree of the different lines of family when I started the book. That would have made it much easier. This is my advice to new readers. Keep a chart at hand of who the different characters are. I will probably read this over and do just that. It will make the story come together even better. If you are good keeping track of a lot of characters you might not need to do this.

0064471837|5.0|The writing is lovely, the world is inspiring, and the story lines are captivating.  A wonderful trilogy that keeps the reader engaged and entertained the whole way through.<br /><br />I sometimes have a difficult time relating to female characters written by male authors in fantasy novels.  The heros of Garth Nix's books are interesting unique people who just happen to be of the male or female gender.  I would love for my children to see Sabriel, Touchstone, Lireal, Sameth, Ellimere, or even Nicholas Sayre as heros to strive to emulate.  They are real heros with difficulties to overcome, tests they sometimes fail, and striving to do good in the end.<br /><br />Great for all ages, adult and child.  Read with your kids, or alone all night in one sitting.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|this is the classic uno game, fun and addictive. however you have to pay to keep playing, that is just plain excessive, even tho this game is supposedly free and haves ads it still charges you to keep on playing.. do not download its not even worth it

0064471837|5.0|This book has a very special place on my bookshelf; it's the first book on the shelf I have set aside as a shelf for my all time favorite books. And for good reason too! Garth Nix creates and writes fantastical worlds that are fully fleshed out and beautiful, and the characters that act within it do it in a way that is believable and fin. There are no words to express how much this book means to me. I never tire of recommending this book to everyone I meet.
0064471837|5.0|This book (and the rest of this series) is easily my most beloved and remembered read as a young girl. I highly suggest Sabriel to anyone, whether or not fantasy novels are normally to your taste. If they are not, there is a great chance that this novel will win you over.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has written a book of suspense and insight. He has managed to take us to four countries and their people leading up to WWII, during and after. He helps us invision what went wrong during this historic time and what went right. He makes us see how the Nazi's were able to step into power in a downtrodden Germany, how they were defeated and the sacrifice and bravery that it took. He draws us in to the \\"human aspect\\" of each side of the war. Thank you Mr. Follett for sharing these lives and their stories....
140006922X|5.0|One of best books I've ever read on bringing clearer insight into who Jesus was and what his teachings and mission were about.<br /><br />This account of Jesus of Nazareth and his followers is the most logical I have ever read. While the author freely admits there is a shortage of historical information on Jesus of Nazareth's life, he gathers more than enough tangential information to accurately paint the historical environment and situation that Jesus operated within.<br /><br />Yes, this book is polarizing, as evidenced by all the 1-star reviews claiming the author is either unqualified or inept. It's just the usual response to a book on either religion and politics: where logic and common sense have little bearing on the emotions of engrained superstitions. And yes, religion, any religion, is a superstition, which is nothing more than \\"belief without evidence.\\"<br /><br />But, in my opinion, the most poignant facts provided in this book are contained in the last 4-6 paragraphs:<br /><br />  \\"Paul's conception of Christianity may have been anathema before 70 C.E. But afterward, his notion of a wholly new religion free from the authority of a Temple that no longer existed, unburdened by a law that no longer mattered, and divorced from a Judaism that had become a pariah was enthusiastically embraced by converts throughout the Roman Empire. Hence, in 398 C.E., when, according to legend, another group of bishops gathered at a council in the city of Hippo Regius in modern-day Algeria to canonize what would become known as the New Testament, they chose to include in the Christian scriptures one letter from James, the brother and successor of Jesus, two letters from Peter, the chief apostle and first among the Twelve, three letters from John, the beloved disciple and pillar of the church, and fourteen letters from Paul, the deviant and outcast who was rejected and scorned by the leaders in Jerusalem. In fact, more than half of the twenty-seven books that now make up theNew Testament are either by or about Paul.<br />  This should not be surprising. Christianity after the destruction of Jerusalem was almost exclusively a gentile religion; it needed a gentile theology. And that is precisely what Paul provided. The choice between James's vision of a Jewish religion anchored in the Law of Moses and derived from a Jewish nationalist who fought against Rome, and Paul's vision of a Roman religion that divorced itself from Jewish provincialism and required nothing for salvation save belief in Christ, was not a difficult one for the second and third generations of Jesus's followers to make.\\"<br /><br />As such, and based on the construction of the New Testament, the religion of Christianity is based on human creativity, interpretation and manipulation, and on a number of self-serving agendas, and not on the teaching and life of a man named Jesus of Nazareth. Why? Because the true religion of Jesus of Nazareth would have been based on the letters of James and Peter, and most definitely not Paul. Christianity is a man-made religion, just as is Judaism and Islam.<br /><br />Most humans have a need to believe that they exist for a reason other than just being part of God's creation, unwilling to base their happiness on fulfilling the role God intended, and thus they have the need to believe in an afterlife, which is the \\"drug\\" most religions feed to their congregation. There is nothing more \\"human\\" than a driving need to believe in a human's self-importance and thus need to have a life hereafter. This book contradicts that drug, and just as a junkie will do anything to get another fix, so too will all the superstitionists berate this book.<br /><br />If you have an open mind, then you should read this book. And then you can continue to believe your superstitions, but with possibly a little more knowledge of how all those superstitions came into being and how the mission of Jesus of Nazareth got manipulated into something it was never intendedto be.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I have really come to rely on these headphones. For years I would buy 2 to 3 pairs out of time and place them and gym bags and car storage in order that I always knew that I had a pair to work out with in the event that I forgot My primary pair. They were great because they seemed impenetrable to sweat and sand and heat and cold. The price points I have seen for the past five years or so has fluctuated between $7 - $11.  With in the past few months, however, I have watched these prices double and then double again on Amazon. I am not sure what is going on but I presume there must be a manufacturing/supply issue.  I would concede that these headphones are certainly worth $10 or so however I would not even pay $15 let alone $40.  That being the case, I have rated these headphones as only deserving of one star but that is specifically due to the unconscionable price of $40. Conversely, if they were appropriately priced I would definitely rate them for to five stars.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|My feeling is that a lot of people think of this device as something it isn't. In my opinion, the Withings Pulse is not a pedometer. It is an activity tracking device with the added benefit of a highly accurate pulse rate detector as well as a basic sleep quality monitor.<br /><br />The real value of the Pulse is in the Withings Health Mate reporting website. It has been reported that distance measured and actual steps taken may not be accurate and this may likely be true but it's also relative. What is important in my mind is the trend over time. What difference does it make if you know you trekked 9500 steps and the device reports 10500 steps if your long term average is only 2000 steps per day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at present, the Health Mate website doesn't show an accumulated history of steps taken as a graph over time but Withings has a track record of constantly evolving. I predict that there will be continual innovation with this device as users report their experiences and suggestions for additional features.<br /><br />A couple of caveats: Setup is not all that intuitive. The getting started guide is not detailed enough. I was able to activate and pair my device but had the feeling that I solved a Rubik's cube after completion. Regardless,I have not had one problem in the two weeks since with every day usage. One suggestion that I have is to charge the device for 8 hours once received. You will have to resist the temptation to tinker with it but you will have better success in pairing with a fully charged unit.<br /><br />For persons who want even more information regarding usage, there is a Facebook page which is constantly monitored by a representative of Withings. They seem to be extremely responsive which further tells me that this device has good support and most likely a bright future ahead of it.<br /><br />So if you think of this device as a long term activity tracker and not simply an immediate monitor of your 10K run, I think you will be more than satisfied especially as the statistical reporting improves and evolves over time.<br /><br />I am genuinely impressed with the features of the Withings Pulse and I believe that they have executed their vision well. I never leave home without it.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|How does one describe the literary masterpiece contained with the confines of this book? Simply put, you don't. As portrayed by this book, time, being the slut she is, does not heal all wounds. We are stuck in a loop of pain and pleasure though many are dealt a bad hand. Mine is another comment that may be seen and forgotten; but I write in in the hopes that it will inspire someone to read. I saw an abundance of positive reviews and, being a fan of all things Green, I gave it a shot. It did not disappoint. Some books and authors are comparable to prostitutes. Appealing to the basic feelings and emotions of humanity, forcing itself onto you. A great book does not need to lower itself to meet the needs of the lowest common denominator, it is written for those who read. It is rare to come across such a fantastic and poignant work of literature. I have purchased many books over my lifetime, however short it may seem to some, but I like to think that I know when I come across sometimg great. I was driven to tears in page after page, i set the book down only to cry and think about the fragility of life and hope and how life finds away to take away all hope when we have just been given it back. The fault, dear Reader, is not in our stars, but in our selves, striving to become things we are not and losing what he have just when we think it is withing our grasps.

0064471837|5.0|It wasn't a book that I would have normally picked up in the bookstore when I was a kid. But something about the cover and the description captured my attention, so I skimmed over the first page. Next thing I know it's closing time, and my dad finds me spread out across the aisle halfway through the book with cramped up legs. Needless to say I convinced him to buy me every single Garth Nix book there was on the shelf and was finished reading them within a week. So then I reread them. They provided me with an awesome escape from my reality; in real life I was an awkward, goofy, clumsy Aspey with bad hair but great posture who wanted to be chosen first for something. But in the books, I could be Sabriel. I could be strong and assertive and finally I had a role model who wouldn't judge me. And even now, at 21, I can still read the Abhorsen trilogy and take something new away from it. The more I understand about life, the more I understand Sabriel. It's a book that I will read until it either crumbles with use or I go blind. But then I'll buy a copy in Braille.
B000H1RFKA|2.0|I was anxious to watch this movie because of all the glowing reviews. In fact, IMBD gave this movie a 7.7! Normally, they are pretty reliable so I decided to give it a shot. I'm here to set the record straight...this movie deserves a 5/10 AT BEST. The beginning was very slow. Initially, I forgave it for this because I realize a movie needs to build the plot and introduce characters. Well, when the plot finally picks up steam, you're left with a whole lot of buildup for a rather dull climax of events. I guess I could equate it to waiting 45 minutes for an order of fast food. People, save your time on this one and watch something else. OR...go ahead and watch it. I can only hope you enjoy this movie more than I did.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob has an interest in baseball and baseball stadiums that is not well known to most fans.  I saw him perform in minor league baseball stadiums and amusement parks over the last few decades.  He 'hit a few out of those parks' while performing, and has done the same with most of his recent studio recordings.  Tempest is a home run.  But it was a very high lofted hit..... I had to listen to it a few times before I could see it 'clear the fence'.  Tempest, Roll On John, and Narrow Way are just three from this collection that show Dylan's diverse writing style, his bands' superb chops, and his great phrasing of the lyrics despite an increasingly gravelly voice.<br /><br />With anyone else telling the story in Tempest, it would be a throwaway.  With Bob, it is intriguing and compelling. Bob meanders but doesn't wander through the story.  Anyone but Bob would have trouble holding the listeners' attention to a song like Narrow Way.  The straight forward music isn't compelling.  Rather, it is the path Bob takes with the lyrics, which we can't know until we follow him all along the Narrow Way, to the end, that holds your attention in this song.<br /><br />Bob's recent decade-long hitting streak has been done without the use of 'music steroids' (synthesizers, background singers, auto-tune, etc.), unlike the rappers and 'The Boy from The North Country' do to prop up their empty music.  I haven't heard any rappers or pop idols of this generation sample his music.  Once the young generation discovers Dylan, those pop idols may quickly lose their appeal.  Roll on, Bob!
0316228583|5.0|This book is a very uncomfortable book to get into. Let's just get that out of the way. And I think I know why.<br />Let me give some background on myself: I grew up in a small town very similar to this book. Very many people who read this book grew up in very similar communities like this village. And for that I think that's why it's so hard to get through. Because this book looks at the hard facts. The book doesn't have a clear good and evil side like the Harry Potter series did, mostly because life isn't divided up into 'Good' or 'Bad'. For that reason this book is hard to get through.<br /><br />But once you get into it, you invest yourselves into these characters. You want So-And-So to win the election and you want So-and-So to get a stick shoved up his ass (Opps, minor spoiler). These people might as well be your neighbors. I walked away from this book wanting to rant about how awful some of these characters were. I wanted to step in and save some of these characters. I wanted Krystal to have a better life and come hang out with me where she and her brother would be safe (Opps, more spoilers). This novel is a beautiful study of the human condition. I walked away from this novel sobbing ugly gross tears because of how close it is to real life.<br /><br />In short; Don't pick up this novel expecting Harry Potter. Just forget about it. Pick this up if you want to invest yourself in a tale of very complicated people doing complicated things.

B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I have loved Justin since he was in N'Sync. He really grabbed my attention when they kind of went R&B right before they broke up. Justin (naturally) took that vibe with him to his solo studio recordings. Now that it's 2013 the 1st part of The 20/20 Experience is here (it's been here since late March). Anyway, the CD is good. I like almost all of the songs on the album and the bonus tracks are solid (I really, really like \\"Dress On\\" which has this charm about it vocally during the bridge that I can't get over). The album can be testing because most of the tracks are overly long. It can be really annoying. Like some other reviewers have already said there are a couple of tracks that are only 3 or 4 minutes which is fine. I myself don't mind long tracks as long as they keep you interested. Some of the tracks here though are long for the sake of being long. I see he wanted to mimic the feel of some of his tracks on [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]] where it was part song and part awesome interlude. However, not all the songs that are extended in length keep your attention every time you play them. I think he totally overdid this idea and listening to the album in full can become tedious at times.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the deluxe are as follows: \\"Dress On\\", \\"Tunnel Vision\\" (my favorite on the standard edition), \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\", \\"Pusher Lover Girl\\" and maybe \\"That Girl\\". \\"Suit & Tie\\" is a solid single and it totally grew on me. \\"Mirrors\\" is alright. I guess I like it more than I hate it but it could be better.<br /><br />The album as a whole is pretty decent. I like how there isn't really a whole lot of pop going on here and that all in all it's probably his most R&B-driven record to date. I love the occasional throwback feel to some of the songs too. The album's real downfall is that many of the tracks are just too long and could have easily been cut by 2 or so minutes. Other than that I'm happy how it turned out. To be honest though I don't really listen to the album anymore and I most likely won't be joining Mr. Timberlake on his excursion of Part II.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a book which became an essential part of me growing up. It is a fantasy, however it is extremely atypical, and you will not find any of the common \\"tropes\\". The methods of magic, necromancy, and \\"lore\\" are each well-structured, imaginative, and logical, and through the book everything you need to know is explained. For further background and \\"lore\\", the squeals \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsan\\" cover the history in more depth, however Sabriel works well as a stand-alone book (if you can resist reading more surrounding this amazing world!).<br /><br />The characters are very human, and we find out the personalities of each not through except such as \\"Sabriel thought this man was very rude\\", but through interpretation of their actions and words. This leads to characters which are so real, it is difficult to imagine that they don't exist.<br /><br />A major factor which lends to my personal adoration for this book is that the settings are quiet and beautiful, and again so very \\"real\\". From the peace of Wyverly College at night, to the barrenness of Sabriel's flight through the snow, the story is incredibly visual and beautiful.<br /><br />However, my favourite aspect of these books is the magic system. Charter magic is so beautiful, logical, and unlike in most fantasy stories is accessible to all, which jointly adds to both the realism and enjoyment factors of this novel.If one day someone offers a Charter Magic 101 class somewhere locally, I would be first in queue, not to wield power or show off, but just to be part of this beautiful system.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed the series and love the chemistry between them Eva and Gideon. However, if this was the end of the trilogy, I would demand a refund. There are too many open ended stories in the last book.
B000006IUQ|5.0|It's hard to find a movie with suspense that will keep you watching to the end anymore.  This movie did it.  Highly recommend
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast was VERY EASY to install - perhaps not Google's intent - from my Amazon Kindle.<br /><br />Tried to install it from Chrome on my Ubuntu laptop but installation program suggested otherwise.  When will popular devices, apps, etc. recognize that there be Linux?<br /><br />I \\"cast\\" from my Kindle Netflix app easily.  Would love to cast from Amazon Prime Video, but it doesn't work and as much as I love Amazon, their videos are RARELY close-captioned.<br /><br />If there is a gripe, it is that once \\"cast\\", Kindle doesn't know what is happening, i.e. movie progress - time shown/time left.<br /><br />Chromecast is a GREAT product!<br /><br />Dennis
6304711905|5.0|Couldn't seem to find this movie in stores so came to my trusted amazon site to find it without problem for a great price.  All time favorite movie, must see for everyone!
B005CVWWJY|2.0|The starting point of this book isn't that different from the book Daemon from Suarez: reclusive gaming mogul dies of cancer and organizes a game that starts after his death that will change the world. In comparison the plot of Ready Player One is much weaker and surprisingly shallow. It's a teenager coming of age novel and even for those standards pretty dismal. It has some nice moments though, so it's not completely a waste of time.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My 5 month old loves to jump in this! The seat is very easy to turn so I don't have to help him reach the other toys. I highly recommend this!
B008RXYOKY|4.0|As an owner of a brand new MacAir, and owner of a 5 year old custom built iMac and 3 year old MacBook Pro with numerous firewire 400 and 800 accessories, this cable was much needed.  It works flawlessly.  Looking at the cable, it is overpriced by at least 50% (otherwise 5 stars); however, since it only costs $29, instead of $15, everyone with firewire accessories will just have to grin and bear it, and ante up until competition enters this niche market :-(
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|like the first 2 in the series, I am carried to where each person is. characters are well developed and imagery is superb.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This concert is a torch compilation at best and can bring you introspection and reflection as you see her perform each song.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much its so fun to ply on long car trips and play against friends and do all of the stuff it has to offer
B0073ODRKG|5.0|&#34;Everybody Come on Dance and Sing...&#34;  That is what you will do when you hear this entire collection of albums from the world's biggest music star.  A Must Have...
037571457X|5.0|Had to read this for a Gener Studies class and it was very interesting. It is in a comic book format, so the pictures help portray the author's childhood well.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Rented for date night with wife. One of those potentially heavy movies that we were always worried about enjoying. We were so wrong. GREAT flick. Tense and fast moving. Definitely worth the time and money.
B005HSL626|5.0|I could play this game forever It is very addictive and it is free This game is so much fun you never get bored playing this game Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids loves taking care of their horse! They like to give her treats, fix her food, and compete with her!
B000I9U8VO|3.0|The women were amazingly portrayed as strong, determined, intelligent, free thinkers, and boy did I say strong? This is a good thing. It was a really action packed film. However on the down side, it was just so violent.  Not for any young children.  With just a touch more editing it could have been less so.  Too much stabbing people to death for me.  Just a personal bias against using violence solely for entertainment sake.  Not family friendly.  Older teens and adults only. Strong portrayal of women with the one exception being Rogue who sadly fits the traditional female stereotype.
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|This is a classic for car chase films, and features the basis of the modern front drive sedan, the Mini Cooper, which also featured lots of power in a tiny vehicle.  Has lots of British humor, and features legendary actors.
B0081336FO|5.0|The new Sherlock's production quality is excellent, the acting is outstanding, the surprises make it worth showing up for, and the twists on the original titles are quite original.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This game is the definition of what mobile gaming should be: pick up and play and have fun. Not much thinking required.
B004D2A04M|5.0|I use this thing 5 days a week. Works great with my Fenix LD22. I always wore a mag light with the oem holster. The holster that comes with the LD22 is junk. This is the holster that should have come with the flashlight.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Usually newer horror films do not impress me. However, Sinister does not fall into that category. It is a wonderful horror movie, and a must see for anyone who likes the horror genre. The ending is a little &#34;I saw that coming,&#34; but other than that, wonderful! Plus they are making a sequel, so get to watching people!
B00A285OOW|4.0|If you enjoy Phillipa Gregory's book this book will enchant just as much as her previous. It falls in the middle of the pack as far as her novels go , enjoyable but the real strengths are in the further depictions of established characters--the glimpse of their lives after the end of their respective novels--in this case Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort. The greatest point of this book is how it serves as a bridge between her Tudor series and the Cousins' War Series. Some of the depictions and Gregory's decisions will bother some, particularly those of Richard III and Henry VII but its hard not to enjoy the description of the young Henry VIII.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The E Books I have bought lately do not download to my Samsung Android Tablet. Don't know where they download to though as I am informed that they have been downloaded. Only the books that I buy on the Android download to the Android.
0307476073|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. The way Cheryl wrote about her mother's life and death was truly engrossing. It gave me some real perspective on the relationship I have with my own mom and not taking things for granted.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like the different color choices and it does protect my Kindle Fire HD very well.  I will recommend this.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I have bought several of these sony headphones over the last couple of years.  The product is good for 3-6 months based on usage.  When I bought my first couple of them, they were around $7-$10, which really makes the product a good deal in that price range.  I just recently came back to buy another one and noticed it was around $40!!! That is crazy for this product! The seller must be confused!  Any how, if you can get this product for around $7-$10 as before, then it is worth buying but if you are thinking about paying $30-$40, WALK AWAY NOW!!!  Hopefully the seller will bring it back to its correct price range because I do not know anyone who will be content paying $30-$40 for this product!
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a fantastic read for young-adults as well as a fun journey for experienced readers. Nix creates compelling characters living in a world that uses many sorcery and necromancer archetypes explored in this trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics lots of things to do and see, I suggest it for horse lovers. Lots of horses and missions to unlock. It's a fun thing to do when your bored.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It helped me with a plain text version of my book. But it needs to be updated for picture books as well. Maybe it has been since I downloaded it? Either way, its a good reference.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|My one weakness is British historical/romantic fiction.<br /><br />This program is purely magical and the camera work/scenery of the beautiful British countryside draws one in like a magnet. The sun glistens just so on the lake in the background creating the right Victorian magical backdrop for the plots about country folk in a small hamlet vs. their \\"town\\" friends and rivals.<br /><br />I am quite envious of Miss Lane, the lady everyone goes to for help and how she always knows, in a the end, the right course of action to take. Laura is gorgeous, naive, and pure of spirit. I love the way they let her be a real young person in the early seasons (crying realistically all over the Post Office and fields of a broken heart). Mr. Brown is a tower of strength as he quotes chapter and verse but he's also a real man who loves the vicar's prim and engagingly nice daughter. Zillah (the maid in season one) was wonderfully sharp and honest and I never thought they could top her, but Minnie brings her own quirky personality and observations to round out the cast of characters living at the Post Office.<br /><br />The town is filled with other people who add to the charm of the programs. We get small glimpses of why the Misses Pratt are the way they are in several episodes. We see how real they can also be when they put aside their conceit and stuffy behavior and allow themselves to just be themselves.<br /><br />Lark Rise has so many alternatives to the town people. Queenie and her lazy old man, Twister, Alf, his ma and pa, his siblings, and the Timmins clan all have stories and hopes and dreams and we get to see bits of them. Robert Timmins (Laura's pa) is not about to lose his pride, even when he loses his livelihood time and again from standing up for his beliefs. Emma (Laura's ma) wonders where the years have gone while doing all that washing and baby raising. Laura is caught between both worlds and tries to balance the old with the new as she grows up.<br /><br />These programs are visually stunning. I live in a gorgeous part of the USA(NH) so I can easily look out my window and see shimmering lakes, meadows, and sun shining just the right angle to create beautiful vistas. Therefore I appreciate the use of the camera and the scenery in another lovely part of the world, in a small village in England.<br /><br />Watching Lark Rise to Candleford is like opening your drapes and peering into a long forgotten world and being invited in for a cup of tea by some very good and realistic friends. Get to know these friends and you will want more of their company and details.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I'll put this ranked up with only two other soundtracks, maybe 3. Passion, by Peter Gabriel, Gladiator and Last of the Mohicans. That's it. Based purely on the emotional response the music generates within me, those 4 stand above the rest. This has a shot at #1. It's that good. Maybe some of that rests with the quality of the movie itself but the soundtrack is an integral part to that emotional response evoked from the film's viewing. A must own.
0812983459|4.0|Halfway through this wonderful book I described it as a &#34;sweet story&#34;,  after finishing I realize it has a deeper message. Parental guilt, I happen to carry loads of it, and somehow a quiet couple in rural England share these same feelings. We do our best and solider on. Very well developed human characters I could relate to. Wonderful story, beautifully written.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie: an old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson by Mitch Albom is a heartwarming memoir about a student and his final class with his dying professor. This is a beautiful story about the wisdom of a professor, dying of ALS named Morrie Schwartz.<br /><br /> Morrie, known as coach by the author Mitch Albom, is a wise, funny, and endearing professor. Morrie teaches us that in accepting death we learn to live. Morrie imparts wisdom regarding family, marriage, death, and society.<br /><br /> I had heard about this book for awhile now and had never read it. I am glad that I finally picked it up the other day because it is as profound and as memorable as I had been told.<br /><br /> Tuesdays with Morrie is a small little book that is filled with many nuggets of wisdom for everyone. Everyone could learn something from this book, the most important being to enjoy life and live in the moment because no one knows how long they have left. I am extremely glad that I have added this wonderful book to my collection.<br /><br /> Tuesdays with Morrie will make you smile. It will make you laugh. It might also make you cry. It is a wonderful book.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love Quell and Quell Reflect, but this game takes the best of those two and multiplies it by 10.  Tons of fun challenging puzzles with layers to each of them.  Visually the best of the games too.  If you haven't tried the Quell games I recommend you do.  But be warned, they are addicting!  Enjoy!
0061474355|5.0|This book (and the other two in the series) is phenomenal. It has everything that a epic, well-imagined universe should have. The characters are amazing, the story is amazing, the world is amazing. I recommend it to everyone!
B0059WTMLW|2.0|I love sudoku and never cringe at the harder puzzles but figuring out how to use the options on this app was harder than any of the games.  I liked that it was more colorful that other apps that I had seen but there were so many options that were not very intuitive that I seldom play this app at all.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|My first impression as I began watching \\"Next\\" was its similarity in plot to \\"Deja Vu,\\" starring Denzel Washington. Although I prefer Washington as an actor over Nicolas Cage, Cage proved to me an ideal choice for this quirky film and plays his part very well. Loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short story \\"Golden Man,\\" Cage's protagonist is also named Chris and he reluctantly decides to battle against the forces of evil (unnamed terrorists with a nuclear weapon). His own secret weapon is that he can visualize in advance various scenarios that would play out in reality, depending on one course of action or another. A little like Bill Murray in \\"Groundhog Day,\\" but with higher stakes.<br /><br />Chris meets an attractive woman (Jessica Biel) at a diner and would just as soon forget about his chances at heroism, but an FBI team leader (Julianne Moore) prevails upon him to help track down the terrorists. Along the way, he skillfully avoids several brushes with death and seems to connect all the dots in such a way that he, Liz (Biel), and Callie (Moore) all survive and go on to defeat the terrorists. Except for one major glitch. And so, the movie ends with an unexpected twist that makes it even more satisfying and worth watching. Fr. Dennis
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|But still worth viewing.  Some big stars being silly in yet another casino movie but it was still fun and if you're a fan of any of the stars then it is worth seeing.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I have seldom picked up a book that kept me both guessing at and doubting my own conclusions throughout the entire book.<br /><br />The descriptions are so vivid, so tangible, I felt as though I visited the circus tents right along with the characters. A VERY complicated plot made simple by the storyline. I really enjoyed my time spent in the \\"Night Circus\\"
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So many series wind up as dead ends.  This, tragically, may also have done the same. But the Wheel turns as the wheel will. Well done.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is a great album with some additional interview information on it.  Michael Jackson will be missed.  If you have this album/CD, I would also recommend his \\"Off the Wall\\".  It also is a great album by him.
006178480X|5.0|I love smart authors. I love authors that expect their audience to be at least a little intelligent. I love authors that can do all this while writing a good story. Yes, this is an action/mystery series. No, this is not classic literature. But finding quality, well written mysteries is difficult.<br />If you haven't read a Sigma book this is not the one to start with, but it is one of the best of the series. The characters in the Sigma books are action scientists. They have degrees in physics, engineering, history, archeology, biology, and medicine. Not only are they smart, most of them are former members of the military and can handle themselves under fire. Rollins has created a cast of well rounded characters that he takes time to build over several books, but he is not afraid to kill one off every now and then.<br />This book starts off with a comet passing near the earth, and scientists are taking the opportunity to study dark energy, and the curve of time and space around earth. But something goes wrong, and the satellite come crashing down to earth in Mongolia. The last image it sends is a picture of the eastern seaboard, burning and in ruins. It hasn't happened yet, but the calculations show that it will. Can the Sigma team follow the clues from ancient history and find what they need to stop it? And at what cost? Brush up on your ancient history and theoretical physics, and settle in for a really good read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Holy cow this game is 100% addicting. It is like potato chips... you can't have just one.  Only bad thing is when you run out of credits.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|jonn scalzi was a master story teller,and this text promotes him to grandmaster ! the book starts nice and easy then ramps up in the middle only to explode with greatness at the end.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I have read the book series and am happy with the movie. I am super excited about the 2nd movie that came out just today, it looks even better than the first. I bought this movie under $10 and that is an amazing price for a good movie on blu-ray to add to my collection.
044022425X|5.0|AMAZING. This is the continuation of the Outlander series. If you haven't read the previous book in this series, you MUST do that first. However, once you get caught up into the action and adventure in this saga, you won't be able to come up for air! As soon as I finish one book, I'm already ordering the next. These books are GREAT!
1451695195|3.0|After reading PROOF of HEAVEN, I honestly wanted to give full credence to Eben Alexander's supposed encounter with the afterlife. His descriptions of this experience are detailed but still believably vague and quite attractive in many respects. I also like the fact that Dr. Alexander does not attempt to validate (or invalidate) any one organized religion or creed according to his NDE. Prior to becoming ill and having these experiences, Alexander had been a fairly undecided, disinterested, liberal Christian; yet, interesting enough, he often refers to the God that he apparently encountered as \\"Om,\\" which is, of course, a basic phoneme/pronoun in Hindu-Buddhist mantra.<br /><br />Much hinges on Alexander's claim that, due to the fact that he was in a coma induced by E. Coli Meningitis with his cerebral cortex completely shut down, his experience is more valid than most other NDEs:  \\".  .  .I was allowed to die harder, and travel deeper, than almost all NDE subjects before me. As arrogant as that may sound, my intentions are not\\"(78).<br /><br />After reading portions of \\"The Prophet,\\" an article Luke Dittrich published in ESQUIRE {August, 2013}, I STILL want to believe Dr. Alexander's account but feel compelled to take it with a healthy dose of salt. Most importantly, Dittrich refutes Alexander's fundamental claim that he was completely comatose, quoting one of Alexander's attending physicians--Dr. Laura Potter, who Alexander makes frequent reference to in his book--as stating that the alleged \\"coma\\" was medically induced and the author's cerebral cortex was NOT, as he claims, in a state of total shut-down. Thus, Alexander's experiences could easily be due to simple hallucination. PROOF of HEAVEN, for the record, contains a brief \\"Statement\\" at the end by Dr. Scott Wade, another attending physician who verifies Alexander's claim that he was indeed in a completely comatose, vegetative state. Alexander describes Wade, btw, as \\"a friend and a neighbor\\" (105).<br /><br />And who's to say? It's possible that Dittrich's article is full of disinformation. Given the serious allegations Dittrich makes, however, it's hard to see what he could gain from trying to discredit Alexander unduly or what motivation he would have for lying about the author and his book. Along with Dr. Potter's statements, Dittrich alleges (with documentation) that Alexander has been subject to several serious malpractice suits, has lied in an attempt to cover up his malpractices, and, perhaps most glaringly, has been fired by several hospitals and prohibited from performing surgery due to his past blunders. That in itself does not disprove PROOF of HEAVEN; nevertheless, seeing the way Alexander touts his credentials as a neurosurgeon without mentioning any of these factors, it does raise questions about his essential credibility.<br /><br />Like many others, I have a serious interest in NDE studies and yearn to know more about what/whatnot really happens when we die. I could go on and on regarding PROOF of HEAVEN's more attractive and less credible qualities. In the end, though, if any of us want to have any hope of learning anything about this enormous question, we have to look at all the accounts rationally, laying aside the tendency to simply go with what sounds good to us. And that's the toughest part of it all.<br /><br />Some other, perhaps more reliable, books I would recommend (all three are also by M.D.'s): [[ASIN:0062517392 Life After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death]], or anything else by Dr. Moody, [[ASIN:0061452572 Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences]], and [[ASIN:0307731715 To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story]].And who's to say?

0545265355|5.0|I ordered the hardback book set for my pre-teen daughter as a gift, and was very pleased with this set. The display box is heavy-duty cardboard, and makes for nice storage for the books, so she can display them on her dresser.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked this book, but it's very depressing, you have to be in the mood to really appreciate it. Also I believe the end was a bit too much.
0385335997|5.0|AMAZING. This is the continuation of the Outlander series. If you haven't read the previous books in this series, you MUST do that first.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book because ti has everything a great book must have: very interesting main characters, a different sense of reality, but most of all, because it has a great silver lining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love all the minions in the game they make it so much fun i play it<br />everyday almost everyday
B004SCN2F6|5.0|During both turn based gaming with a randomized event system, Star Trader has many hours of replayability. With the various achievement awards, factions, classes, and progressively unlocked difficulty variances, it is an amazingly well thought out tablet rpg.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game other than the fact that I want more than ten levels. It kept me occupied for a few hours and I got stuck for a while on some levels. I love puzzle games and adding the hidden aspect was even better. I highly recommend playing this game.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Loved this book. Kept me interested in it. Hope a movie is made out of this one. Would suggest reading it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love the game but it sucks that every new game has an ad.  Skip the ads and maybe it would be more enjoyable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the entire series..... waiting for the next book to come out. Very descriptive, I think better than 50 Shades of Grey.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Good movie watched on a long flight from HI.  It's so easy to download movies and watch - good job.  The only complaint is the sound was not very loud - maybe up the volume a bit.  I had new earplugs so don't believe that was my issue.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the entire series..... waiting for the next book to come out. Very descriptive, I think better than 50 Shades of Grey.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun enough, but I guess I just don't get the point. I feel like I'm missing what's going on because sometimes you start from the beginning if your minion gets hurt and sometimes it starts from other places.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the entire series..... waiting for the next book to come out. Very descriptive, I think better than 50 Shades of Grey.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read these books 13 times!!  It never gets old! Greatest love story ever!!!!!!  This one isn't a stand alone read, but my favorite of the three!
B004TL3R24|4.0|I have tramped around quite a bit now with this strap. It's comfortable and easy to use for the Manfrotto tripod I have. I don't know how it would do with other brands.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been using these for 6 months now, and I can tell this is exactly what I was expecting. If you want a headset you'll be using for several hours, and not only for gaming, this is the headset you are looking for.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-They are really comfortable, I use them for several hours straight and doesn't cause any pain.<br />-Battery life lasts around 6-8 hours, since I charge them all the time I'm not using them, I rarely have to use them with cable.<br />-Wireless.<br />-The size is fantastic, I don't know a single person that finds this headset small.<br />-Mute light, you can easily tell when your mic is muted, and the mute button on the headset is handy.<br />-Mic quality, I use them for voice chat a lot, and no one ever complained about hearing me wrong, or too low.<br />-Macros, you can configure them for whatever it is you need. You won't use them much for gaming, specially if you've got a keyboard and a mouse that already have macros, but those three G buttons are great for multimedia. The ability to pause/play from a distance is really great while watching a movie, it's like having a remote for your PC.<br />-Volume wheel, it's really precise.<br />-Great materials, it's still as good as new, and I've been using them since I bought them.<br />-And finally, the sound quality... it's awesome! It can really help you in some games to identify where the sound is coming from.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-When the Dolby surround switch is off, the sound coming from the right is louder, drastically reducing the sound quality. But I can't think of a reason as to why would anyone want to disable the surround, therefore I take this as a minor flaw.<br /><br />Overall, I give this product a 5/5. It is exactly what Logitech says it is, and I highly recommend buying this headset.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Had the old app installed and when suddenly it was updated to this new version.  The old app was MUCH easier to operate and gave me all the information I wanted. I want the old app back!  I definitely would not have upgraded if given a choice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its fun and well I just love the minons. id deffinitly refer this game to a friend.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|this was a good and entertaining movie.  If you are a Die Hard fan, of course you have to see it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Needs more. I kind of get bored. But I like it. I just need a little something more. Just more options on aiming or a scope type option maybe?
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I have not read the books but apparently Tom Cruise does not match the book's description of its main character.  Nevertheless, Tom pulls it off.  Entertaining.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very simple to navigate from one game to the next. Not complicated at all. Lots of fun. Will share this app with other people.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|All the puzzles are solvable and there is a pretty good variety to keep you thinking.  I enjoyed playing it.
B0001I561E|5.0|Movie is awesome. DVD cover had a few cracks on the side, but it was still worth the wait for this awesome movie
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great game to play! The kiddies can learn to count while learning to play the game. You should download it NOW!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Glad this was free...stuck on level 3....have a saw....won't cut through anything....entered color code....did nothing.....another place to enter some other code but nothing else alludes to any combo of 4 anythings to enter....can't see anything else that would help solve....any thoughts anyone? Have clicked on everything in the room but nothing else happens...... No installation issues on KFHD..just frustration!.Seems like it could be fun.....if it had a hint or help function.....3 stars for potential...Would go with 5 if there was a way to get some help...just a little help...a hint..something!

B00DURILJ2|5.0|Gritty film about two young boys who live on the Mississipi river, growing up and learning about life, love and girls.  McConaughey plays the kind of adult that touches their lives as kids, and afterward, they're not the same.  The experience changes them forever, and goes on to influences them in many unseen ways...all a part of the growing up experience.  Great film.  Well acted.
B0090SI582|1.0|As a native american, I grew up dancing with wolves, so I was expecting wolverine to be a native american, but no, they chose an italian guy to play him. I am a full blood cherokee, and back in oklahoma, my tribe was hunting for food all over the woods. We used bows, and arrows, and tomhawks.<br /><br />My father then invested in a casino in the city where he became a billionaire, so no longer were we hunter an gatherers, instead we lived a rich and wealthy life.

B0090SI582|3.0|I wanted to give this 2 stars but when you hover over the 3rd \\"It's ok\\" comes up, yea that will do. The movie is just that....it's ok.<br /><br />The first Wolverine solo film kept you engaged because you wanted to see where it all began; this movie's plot was ridiculously boring and predictable, not to mention pointless. There are some good fight scenes with a bunch of drivel in between, a lot of yawn moments in fact that had me looking at my watch. The Viper was a forgettable villian, just a cliche evil sexy villian chic. The only interesting character was the little asian ninja girl who was just awesome.<br /><br />Other than that bleh, save your big money and wait for the $1 Redbox rental. Not a bad movie night flick, just don't blow $50 at the movies on it.

B000002LCK|5.0|Great condition; Substance is the best album ever done by New Order. Be sure to get Disc 1 and 2 since Substance is a 2-disc collection.<br /><br />Thanks!
030758836X|1.0|I threw the book -- hardback, no less -- into the trash bin immediately after I finished. Rampant and cheap misandry and misogyny. Unsatisfying ending. SPOILER ALERT: Man descends into the depths of hell with his psychotic wife ... to preserve his life?  Yeah. Not.<br /><br />If I could give this a negative rating, I would have. This book is on the best-seller list? I cringe if this is what passes for acceptable mystery writing. I'd support my critique with examples but I'm too disgusted at the moment.<br /><br />Utter garbage.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark always delivers a good read.  Although I had an inclination of who the guilty person was right out of the gate, I found her telling the tale suspenseful.  She has been on top of my reading list for years and I try to never miss a book.  After a while one begins to sense the outcome and sometimes I get fooled.  It is always a pleasant and relaxing read for the beach or anytime you just want to &#34;get away&#34; for a little while.  Someone picking up one of her books for the first time probably would not be as fine tuned to the ending as I was but it's in how she goes about weaving all the pieces together that I find most fascinating. She draws her characters very well without wasting words.  I recommend her work highly.
B006M3JVD6|5.0|What an amazing person Jaycee is! What she endured and her story of survival is truly incredible.  We all possess an inner strength, that if untested, never know exists.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|An amazing book of one man's brain dead experience which makes it different from other near death experiences I've read.  The fact that it happened to a neurosurgeon made it all the more interesting.  He reports the happening as he remembers it.  He looks at it from a medical point of view.  I read this book shortly after the death of my husband and was not completely comforted as I thought I would be...so it has given me much to ponder.  I believe it is what happened to Dr. Eben Alexender and his was a miracle.  It certainly gives the reader a great deal to think about and is probably the most comprehensive account to date that I've read, excluding the lives and deaths of our Saints.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a great and easy read, hard book to put down. I look up to these men, one day hope to become one. For now I train yo hope that one day you can meet the men I read about. One of the best books I've picked up ever.

0064471837|5.0|I came across Sabriel at the awkward age of 14, and it was exactly what I'd been looking for in a book.<br /><br />Strong, capable-yet-not-infallible teenage Sabriel takes a journey through a dilapidated kingdom to save her father, whose powers to send the dead back where they belong are legendary. On the way she picks up unusual travelling companions Touchstone (a man she found petrified, naked and attached to a boat) and Mogget (a sharp-tongued cat with mysterious powers - sounds cheesy, but it works). Their progress is dogged by creepy undead creatures set on killing them - honestly, some of these things are terrifying - which Sabriel does her best to ward off with the use of her father's bells. Each bell, rung correctly, holds a different power over the undead, and Sabriel soon finds herself becoming more and more like her father.<br /><br />Something that's always stuck with me was the relationship between Sabriel and her dad. Often in young adult fiction characters' parents are dead, missing or just otherwise unaccounted for. But Sabriel's father played a huge role in the book (despite not always being present), and their relationship was real and flawed and I could relate to it. It was this, along with the magic and adventure and romance and mystery of the story, that kept me flipping pages til the end.<br /><br />Twelve years after I first read Sabriel, it's still got a spot in my heart. Going back to read it now is like catching up with an old friend. Read it.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|Good movie  idk if I would say its great, but its good. And hey, tommy lee jones stars in tho film, so it's nearly impossible to go wrong with this film.
0553350005|5.0|I love buying books and especially like a book that has been well taken care of like this one I bought.  I would buy from this seller again.  Hopefully we who like HOLDING books and enjoy the books kept in FREE LIBRARY shelves.  Reading is a GOOD THING.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|But maybe I will change my mind.  Good movie and now I want to see that Oblivion movie as well.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|This is a really stupid movie.  If I had know what it was like I would not even have thought of getting it.
0060516402|1.0|Totally useless stuff. Read the book - \\"The Halo effect and eight other business delusions that deceive managers\\"  by Phil Rosenzweig  to understand the facts and worthlessness of this book. The authors made a lot of money , the people who read it and believed the untrue,  ended up delusional (and not know it).  I guess all is good!
0345803485|5.0|Very interesting to read....Couldn't put book the down...read all the  way to the end...Would recommend this book to others....Excellent book...

B00C8YOIR2|4.0|R2R (LoP) Dead Medium<br /><br />I received a free copy, through LoP, in exchange for a review.<br /><br />Strict and antisocial in life, May is the epitome is the old crotchy lady, who lives down the road.  She has one visitor a week, Margaret, that rubs her the wrong way, but it is a tradition for her to come, for tea and cake.  One gathering ends unlike the others and May finds herself on the other side of life or horrifying to her, death, with a mess in the kitchen. She finds herself in the unlikely of situations, helping a fellow ghost, down the street, by trying to come up with a way to speak with her daughter. Through this, May realizes that the living can actually hear her; she is a dead ghost medium and she is in high demand. Ghosts start to come, to have the chance to speak with their loved ones. Get Margaret and her crew of friends to perform seances, with May, throw in some dark tales of a darker force out there and some wine and well, things happen.<br /><br />\\"Now calm down and be quiet so I can think,\\" May ordered. She didn't have the faintest clue of how to resolve Penny's dilemma. She had no real experience with death or its after effects other than when Mr Kibbles had passed away. All she knew about ghosts and ghouls were what she had seen in old Abbot and Costello movies. It seemed that the supernatural never had much trouble snatching the limelight on the silver screen. In the real world it was a different matter entirely.<br /><br />Great, funny story, with fun and ridiculous characters. I could see this as a play or tv show, almost Monty Python-esque! Loved the way it ended, with the guardian animals watching and waiting. Great job!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|Given the legendary status of the 1982 classic of the same name, watching this re-make without any comparison with original proved to be impossible. So I watched it twice, the second time purely to digest this film on its own merit. Overall, I believe that it was a respectable attempt to capture the magic and sweeping majesty of the 1982 version, and that the cast took this enterprise seriously, but it was not a great film. The success of the original was, to a large degree, due to the creative team and the cast's ability to transport the audience to a different world, a world of high adventure prior to recorded history, and kept them there for the duration of that film. In this regard, Arnold's limited acting ability, strange (at the time) accent, equally strong accents by some of the other cast members, and stilted dialogue did not hurt the effort; in fact, these factors actually enhanced the film by presenting to the audience a sense of exoticism that people could rightfully expect from a mythical world tens of thousands of years ago. Arnold's rather thin acting skills actually gave his cinematic interpretation of Conan a sense of bombastic grandiosity, which is why Conan is still one of Arnold's most celebrated roles. The original film was also balanced very well on a character and a thematic basis, which is a sign of the creative depth of the original team. On Conan's side: Conan's indomitable masculinity was balanced by Valeria's raw physical femininity; Conan's implacable strength was balanced by Subotai's wit, speed, and deadly accuracy. Thematically: Conan's physical power and strength of will were balanced by Thulsa Doom's towering charisma and insidious intellect. The entire cast was giving enough material to be memorable, especially the bad guys. The portrayal of Thulsa Doom by the incomparable James Earl Jones created one of the most well-known villains in cinematic history. Even his henchmen were memorable: who doesn't remember the hulking bearded blade master who was finally bested by Conan and Valeria, or the Hammer Guy? Despite their relatively few scenes, their treatment in the film gave even minor characters enough credibility as powerful bad guys not to be taken lightly in the context of the film. The music, despite the times, is still celebrated as a master piece.<br />For the new film, from the poster and still shots, it would appear that the film makers captured the Conan from the books: imposing, dark, and brooding. The stills of the veteran actor Stephen Lang as the antagonist Khalar Zym were also impressive. From what I can see, serious money was spent on creating sets and visual effects for the world of Conan. However, it was the delivery that was off. The speech and mannerisms of the cast all came off as too modern, too familiar, and in some cases, too slick and polished. So despite that the visual aspects of the film were attempting the transport the audience to a different world of fantasy and adventure, the cast's acting and speech kept bring the audience back to the here and now. This is especially disappointing given how successfully Jason Mamoa portrayed an ancient warrior on the small screen in The Game of Thrones. Also, other than Conan and Khalar Zym, none of the other characters were given enough material or treatment in the film to be particularly noteworthy in the context of the film. They could be easily dismissed as \\"henchmen 1, 2, 3\\" \\"damsel in distress,\\" \\"happy pirate buddy,\\" etc. It's not a very engaging film that can grab and retain the audience's undivided attention from the beginning to the end. In this regard, I don't blame the actors, they are all decent to good actors for the most part, the script, directing, and editing have much to do with the success of a film, and these elements did not mesh very well for this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, but did not like the ending (hence why I didn't give it 5 stars).  Seemed like the ending could have been done differently perhaps so that the 'bad guy' doesn't win in the end.  Just didn't care for the ending overall I guess... Kind of a let-down.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|The author has a natural ability to communicate whether it be by the written word or the lectures that you find on You tube. He instills a confidence in you that he knows his subject inside out and that comes across in this book.<br /><br />This is a great, easy read. no over the top maths to get your head around as it's not required in order to understand what the author is putting across. This is a subject that has walked a well trodden path in recent years in popular science books but this is the book that others will be judged by. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
0064471837|5.0|In the Abhorsen series, Mr. Nix has created a world unlike any other ever dreamed of.  A world where a young woman learns not to fear death but to embrace it, fight it, and accept it over all odds.  Sabriel is a character that is refreshingly believable for a fantasy world where Magic and Modern coexist.  She has her faults, her strengths, her weaknesses... and sometimes just that little bit of awkwardness that is in all of us when going through life and meeting a few friends (or more than friends) along the way.  The relationships between characters, friends and enemies alike, are defined in such a way that makes you want to keep reading, to know the characters themselves more within the pages of such an amazing series.  It is a book that can hardly -if ever- be put down and for years after it will be read again and again.<br /><br />I personally have read the entire series again and again over a span of at least ten years and it still remains to be my favorite book series.  In my heart it still ranks above the Harry Potter series and any other that has come along in the past ten years.  And it will always remain my favorite.  From Sabriel, to Lirael, to Abhorsen and even Across The Wall the world of Garth Nix will continue to be my favorite to imagine and read about over and over for years to come too.<br /><br />Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen is a book series that has true heart-felt fans.  Like a little niche, though it may not be mainstream in popularity, it more than makes up for in its steady, loyal and constant fandom.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really do not like science fiction - I never even watched Star Trek, but I consider this the best movie series ever made. I have watched these episodes three times and now that I have it in my library, will watch it for years to come!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game and challenging.I found it easier on some floors than others. Definitely a great app to get! Will anxiously await upgrades for additional levels.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I am not into sitcoms but when I watched this with my son, I thought I would buy a set. The settings are kind of &#34;ho-hum&#34; and the actors aren't legends but put these together with some really good writing and you have the magic of a show that has survived on its own for many seasons. Light, interesting and a lot of fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun it keeps me busy and I can challenge me friends on face book and twitter
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is not as intense about their pasts as the first one was but it is more about their relationship and whether it will survive the ups and downs. In this book you have people from the past returning and trying to pull them apart. I don't want to give away any spoilers but know that this book was just as good as the first with a little more love an information given in this one.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book drew me in from the first sentence. The story is compelling, and beautifully written. Can a child raised without love ever learn to trust and love another person? What about if just as she is beginning to trust, it goes a little awry. Can she overcome the damage? This book is often painful - you want this poor girl to get over it and let someone in, and every time she comes close, she can't do it. Finally she finds a place for herself in a flower shop, and that is where her life begins to slowly turn around. I predict that you will love this young woman and root for her. In the end, the most important love she finds must come from the most difficult source - herself. And, along the way, you will learn the language of flowers, which, it turns out, is a lovely way to communicate.

B002M3SP28|5.0|I knew nothing about George Mallory before I started this book but now want to learn more.  Jeffrey Archer does a great job bringing the adventures of Mallory to  life.  A very interesting guy whose life was cut way too short.  Some day we may know the true store of his final day- did he really make it to the top of Mt. Everest?  I for one believe he did. The book of course incorporates a lot of fictional assumptions- the conversations, etc, but that does not detract at all and makes the book way more readable than a straight biography.  I highly recommend this book.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|5++++++ S.T.A.R.S!!!!<br /><br />I love the Crossfire Series so much that when I went to Europe, I bought the UK, French and Italian version.<br /><br />I don't even speak French and Italian.<br /><br />Let's get the nitty gritty out of the way for all of those who were disappointed, I just don't understand that. I didn't know what I was expecting in Entwined with you, I mean, we just found out ... (if you haven't read the first two, stop reading this now) Gideon killed Nathan, I mean, sheesh...<br /><br />\\"You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you. \\"<br /><br />Uh... No ...<br /><br />YOU.OWN.ME.GIDEON... there I said it!<br /><br />Yes, Entwined with you was not dramatic AND IT WAS PERFECT TO ME! Yes, I said it! I am all about drama, but I needed a break from all the crazy stuff from Reflected in you and I am 100%, over-the-moon, capital S! SATISFIED!<br /><br />\\"I was in love with a flesh-and-blood man, one who made mistakes but learned from them, a man who was trying hard to better himself for me, a man who wanted us to work as desperately as I did. \\"<br /><br />And yes I agree. I really liked Gideon in this one. He just seemed a little more crazy and a little more all around... dominate, male, alpha, cave-man like... do I need to say more?<br /><br />WHO DOESN'T WANT THAT?!<br /><br />\\"The only way for a woman to get my attention is to be you \\"<br /><br />And yes, there are a few things that happened which was kind of like what? But I kind of liked it because it was shocking, different and it really rounded out the whole Eva and Gideon dynamic (we all know what part I am talking about)<br /><br />My one and only and SUPER TINY compliant is that I felt the ending and when I am referencing \\"ending\\", I am talking about the last few pages, it all seemed a little anti-climactic and no, I didn't want a cliff-hanger. I mean, I got exactly what I wanted, an opening to book 4, BUT I just expected something else.<br /><br />HOWEVER... I LOVED Entwined with you. It was different from Reflected in You, but still passionate, engaging, steamy and just all around perfect.<br /><br />Review is written by Jacqueline's Reads - > [...]twined with you.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First of all, I find it funny that currently, most of the people who reviewed this have not even bought this yet.  Now with that said, I bought it on the first day it was offered.  I've had it over a week now, and I love it.  I have 3 small children under the age of 5, so cords connecting my computer to my TV are tugged and pulled and constantly tied into various annoying knots.  Now, I can watch youtube, foodnetwork shows (I got rid of our cable due to costs), and other great things on the TV without having to wait until the kids get to bed.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Easy to use<br />No cords<br />rather simple to set up<br /><br />Cons-<br />They don't tell you about the extra power cord, though if you have a USB port on your TV, you don't have to worry about it.<br />Some laptop/desktop issues which aren't too bad<br />I still haven't found a way to lower the netflix resolution since I'm on a data plan with a set gb limit
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I could give HOPELESS 15 stars I would. I don't say this often and I think I am a pretty harsh reviewer, but I absolutely LOVED HOPELESS. This book was an amazing read; everything from the cover, to the title, to Sky and Holder's characters were just pure perfection.<br /><br />I don't even want to write the summary of the book because I didn't even read the summary prior to reading HOPELESS. In my opinion, a summary isn't even necessary. Collen Hoover is simply a GREAT writer. I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat , both books I read in one sitting. I actually had HOPELESS for a few days, I didn't want to read it right away because I was saving it for a day I could devote completely to the book and I am so glad I did, other than the few bathroom breaks and lunch break, I didn't stop reading until the last page.<br /><br />I wanted to read an epic, gut-wrenching, pull your hair out novel and I got that by ten-folds. HOPELESS had everything I looked for in a novel, it had romance, betrayal, mystery and drama. I was worried Hopeless would mirror a lot of Collen's previous book, but it didn't. I felt like I was reading something new, fresh and very RAW. I also even enjoyed the few pieces of the puzzle Collen sprinkled throughout the book. I had an idea of what I knew happened, but it really was never confirmed until later on and it didn't matter to me because I was enjoying the ride itself to really care if my theory was correct or not.<br /><br />I am on a Collen Hoover high and it makes me want to go and read Slammed again so I can get my fix. I can't wait to see her at her at her book signing in January and I wish she had more books out so I can read them.<br /><br />HOPELESS is an incredible book, I 100% recommend !<br /><br />Review is written by Jacqueline's Reads - > [...]

B0087GF8ZG|3.0|It's really just okay. It's good for what it is - a portable, battery powered light, but I was just wanting more light.  While I don't really have to change the batteries that often, it's still a minor inconvenience to do so. We have this in our coat & shoe closet near the entryway of our home and I was really hoping for something that would illuminate the little 5x5 closet space so I could find my shoes easier in the morning.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really measure up to the task.  I will run an electrical conduit through my ceiling and use a traditional light switch in the near future.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This is a fun game.  In some ways, it's similar to Tetris, but in this game you get to change pieces already in the board, not the ones dropping down.  I picked this up today and have spent a surprising amount of time playing.  It's held my attention as a simple, fun break in the routine game.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book was just as great as the first! I absolutely loved it! I only wish she would write another about Mia and Adam
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This is an awesome movie to see in Blu-Ray. Superior sound and video quality. Great addition to my Blu-Ray library.
6303027016|5.0|sad but funny rendition of a soldier in the Vietnam war and how he tries to make it more bearable for his fellow troops<br /><br />  and his innocent affections for a girl there got him in trouble.  Movie is light hearted at times and classic Robin Williams<br /><br />  introduces a comical element,  but never the less re-lives some of the sadness involved with the war.<br /><br />  GOOD MOVIE.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|High quality sound an video you would expect in a blu-ray. This is an awesome movie to boot, so it is a great additional to the library.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed &#34;Joyland&#34;  and couldnt put it down!  Not a horror story if that is what you are looking for.  But more like a crime drama.

B00D3V85FA|5.0|Disregard the handful of 1 or 2 star reviews given for this album.  This is Sabbath from the old days, but with modern production values.  It is HEAVY.  I'm a little saddened that Bill Ward was not able to play the drum tracks & I'm not sure why he wasn't.  I assume it may have been health issues since that is something that has happened in the past with him.  But honestly, if I hadn't known beforehand that he wasn't on the album I would have probably never suspected it was anyone else.  As far as Brad Wilk's performance goes, you can tell he was thinking \\"What would Bill do here\\" in the studio, but still was able to make it his own.  Geezer Butler has the strongest bass presence I've ever heard from him.  I've always thought his style was just too busy,  great player, but just too busy.  But what a difference a couple of adjustments on the soundboard makes..  this sounds amazing.  Tony is still coming up with those demonic riffs and his bluesy style really shines here.  And Ozzy, well, he's still Ozzy, and that's a good thing.  He's not \\"Crazy Babies\\" Ozzy though, if you buy this album expecting to hear something from his solo albums, or any of that sound-alike crap you hear on the radio today, you are going to be disappointed.  Old school Sabbath fans will love this album.  So, like I said - ignore the butt-hurt few who gave this record negative reviews and give 13 a chance!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this toy in order to help my child develop three dimensional perception. I can’t imagine it not helping with that and at least hand and eye coordination. Obviously this is the hardest level, but I also bought all the levels below this one. No regrets.

0486284735|5.0|Wrote this review for the Livermore Public Library 2013 Summer Reading Program:<br /><br />Movie director Joe Wright described her as heroic.<br /><br />Oh, no, not Lizzy Bennett. He admired Lizzy's ridiculous mother, Mrs. Bennett who's entire purpose for living is to see her daughters married. Mrs. Bennett goes to great lengths to get this job done and provides the lion's share of the comic relief in Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />It is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, of course, and her affection for her sister Jane, who hopes to be soon engaged to Mr. Bingly. Jane Austen's masterpiece has been the model for the Romance genre since it was published in 1813. The language may be dated, but it is a surprisingly easy read for a classic, and it's light tone makes it something of a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Austen breaks a lot of modern rules for writing fiction, telling what is before showing it stands at the forefront. However, her style tends to make circumstances and characters far easier to understand for modern readers. At the core of the book are the way Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy relate to each other.<br /><br />Darcy's absence from most of the text, however, gives him a ghost like quality, as if he is only haunting the minds of those thinking of him. And those thinking of him seem to universally despise him. Why is it that Lizzy Bennett cannot stop thinking of this loathsome man? Into this intrigue land a pair of suitors who have their own faults that Lizzy must discover, overcoming her own prejudices that colour her view of the men in her life.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is about misleading perception and how the world we live in may be very different from the world we see. As simple a read as it is, it is a complex story with a simple heart, and more than a few laughs. It would win no awards for style with modern editors, but it is still a masterpiece and well worth reading.

0743297334|3.0|Wrote this review for the Livermore Public Library 2013 Summer Reading Program:<br /><br />Robert Cohn is a sober, former College Boxing Champion supposedly working on a writing career in Paris. Robert Cohn is the only sober character in The Sun Also Rises, alcohol flows freely and the characters seem to eat it for sustenance whether they're drinking Martinis in Paris, or Rioja for the Running of the Bulls in Pomplona.<br /><br />What Robert Cohn has in common with his friend Jake Barnes is his affection for a Lady. The genuinely titled Lady Ashley has taken up with a very bankrupt lush named Michael, who hates Robert, loves Jake and is the fourth in this complex relationship between these four people.<br /><br />Hemingway's economy of words is on full display in this novel, and I could not imagine trying to speed read this book, as every word counts. Part of the problem with The Sun Also Rises is that it is written for a contemporary readership, so Hemingway takes for granted that much of how life is lived in 1926 is common knowledge.<br /><br />It is the responsibility of the reader to understand some of the things he mentioned. Fortunately, these items are few. I would recommend watching a good movie that features a similar setting and dialogue before diving into this novel. It is short enough to read twice in a week, so one may grasp its finer points, and to, perhaps, do a little research on the period

0684803356|5.0|Wrote this review for the Livermore Public Library 2013 Summer Reading Program:<br /><br />Blow up a bridge. That is the mission assigned to Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Blow it up at at the perfect time for it to be blown up, and that time is not set... he must know when to do it, and he has to figure that out himself.<br /><br />This is how the story of Robert Jordan, an American Expatriot opens, in the midst of the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway does a great job setting the scene, describing just enough detail to put you there. He also manages to give you a nice taste of Spanish culture, and it's various attitudes.<br /><br />The Spaniard's love of seafood is featured in Pilar's description of Valencia, Spain is second only to Japan in seafood consumption.<br /><br />What is very interesting is the dialogue. Hemingway goes to great lengths to accurately translate the way Spaniards speak to each other with formality. There are a lot of Thee's and Thys, and the structure of the speech is a little difficult to get used to.<br /><br />It took me a while to understand why I kept reading things like \\"I have indescribable and unprintable and I have forgotten the obscenity password.\\" Indescribable, unprintable, and obscenity probably have more to do with the censors of 1940 than anything else. Still, it does a nice job of conveying the notion that an obscenity in Spanish carries a lot more weight than does one in English.<br /><br />This novel is high adventure, and Robert Jordan, his political affiliations notwithstanding, is a hero's hero. If you decide to look into reading a book that sits among the list of classics, here's one that truly deserves the title!
0316044695|5.0|All I need to say is buy this book and read it. You won't be disappointed, that's for sure. Great story.
0307277887|5.0|No problems, came on time, looks like it's supposed to etc. I love it and I have no comlaints! :)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Their updates continue to give less info, insert more distracting  graphics and more ads. Loosing the nuts and bolts presentation of data, for whatever reason. I assume revenue enhancement. I seek a more direct informative application.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the series. I bought the the first and second book and cannot stop reading. Its so great on kindle you can look for characters and definitions. GREAT 5 STARS
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|I watched this immediately after seeing Olympus has Fallen and I expected them to basically be the same movie but I was surprised at how much better this movie was compared to Olympus. The movie has plenty of action scenes, heart pounding suspense scenes, and even a few comedic moments. Definitely check out this movie!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Pretty fun and easy to learn if you aren't very familiar with mahjong.  Definitely getting better with each level and looking forward to opening up more levels.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I downloaded all the free weather apps 3+ stars and above, this is the one I kept out of about 6 or 7 altogether. This app is pretty customizable in that there are three views... It shows temp (actual, feels like, hi and low), pressure, wind speed, humidity, precipitation and visibility. You also choose whether you would like the hour by hour forecast or extended day by day... BUT it just so happens that if you choose the nicest looking layout (in my opinion of course), the text layout, that you can see both extended and hourly forecast without having to change anything under settings.<br /><br />I just absolutely love this app and although it doesn't have multiple pages which include graphs and videos it is perfect for someone like me.<br /> *I did download (and keep) the NOAA weather app and 1W (awesome radar type maps and graphs - also has UV index and facts upon startup) for the bells and whistles.
0064471837|5.0|Getting through your teenage years is hard enough for most but having to drop out of school, start a quest to hunt down your missing father in the land of the dead with a sarcastic feline and a man who has been encased in wood for centuries as your companions makes most accounts of high school years seem like a dream. Add to that the fact that your powers only work in a part of the land where modern technology doesn't work (no GPS or social media, what!) unspeakable things are drawn to you as soon as you use them and you could be lost forever beyond the Ninth Gate and you've got yourself quite the adventure! Sabriel is a story for young and old alike, middle aged too, about a young woman fighting for what's right while taking on responsibilities beyond her years. If you want a read filled with action, supernatural adventure and that is near impossible to put down (don't schedule anything important), this is the book for you!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I thought this was a good game. Great take on swipe puzzles. Well worth 99 cents in my opinion. I played it on my kindle fire 1st gen. and had no problems. It was well rounded when it comes to the transition from easy puzzles in the beginning to harder puzzles at the end. Trying to get all the combinations was great for replay value. I look forward to more levels. Overall great game well polished with good graphics.
6305882592|1.0|This is a wonderful film, one of my all time favourites BUT..Re: my previous comment. Yes the product arrived within the advised time, but I have to tell you that I have just played the DVD purchased and have found it an absolutely appalling copy!!! It is way too dark  to see and the volume is barely  audable. Unwatchable!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|The LED light makes a brighter light and the on off toggle button works great. What you give up is the candle option and focusing of the light.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could not put it down. A tender love story with nothing maudlin. Will and Louisa are two beautifully written characters that will have me thinking about them for a long time. A special book.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Historically entertaining. I purchased this movie because I now live near Gettysburg and wanted to know more about the battle.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|Kids absolutely love all the water features/slide.  Only one of the extra blow-up toys had a hole in it upon delivery, but no big deal really.  I's bigger than you think!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb racing is so much fun to play!!!!and if you like racing and seeing people in thir car flipping over well then this is the game for you.......and there's no adds!!!!
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|I love everything about this app but that when shopping by department it only shows best selling. If that was fixed it would be 100% amazing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game if you like the ones at a carnival you will love this, even better you don't have to spend money! I think this app is fun for all ages even really little ones could play it.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|What isn't to like about this app? I've been captivated by the moon since I watched the Apollo 11 landing live, as a six year old. Neil Armstrong even answered a question I posed to my Mom & Dad, all the way from the Moon. &#34;Why does it look like he has knee pads on?&#34; Moments later Neil gathered up some moon dust and rocks and opened up a flap on the knee of his moon suit and stowed them. Whenever I see a beautiful full moon over the lake, Chicago, or anywhere I'm at, I'll pause and spend 15-30 seconds gazing at it and losing myself in its beauty. Harvest moons, Blue moons, and the recent Blue moon on the Equinox, I like them all. This app lets me take a moment out of my day to enjoy the moon, even when it is to cloudy, or there is too much urban light pollution.
0064471837|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago and was hooked on the storyline. After completing Sabriel, I immediately went out and ordered the rest of the trilogy and recommended it to all my friends.<br /><br />The story centres around Sabriel. A likeable character who must cross over the wall to the Old Kingdom to rescue her father. With tensions building and a resistance to her fate, can Sabriel rescue her father, the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre?<br /><br />Sabriel is a wonderful book that really grips the reader, dragging you into the world of spirits and magic. Entertaining and suitable for a wide range of readers, this is a must read.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Haven't yet used the Record feature, but I like listening to the Station I listened to in college, KBCO, and checking up on news from towns I've lived in in the past. I just wish there were more Chicago PD zones on the police scanner channels.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For the first time in a long time I am seeing games go back to the true adventure game style instead of the hidden image stuff
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|This game works great on Kindle Fire and provides a unique spin on traditional strategy-based RPGs. The basic mechanics work by matching like pieces to create attacks and build walls. With skill you can start building combos, creating links, and dealing more damage. It's fun and unique, so give it a try.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I've been waiting on a great sci-fi film since District 9, and this one is real solid imo. Great acting, music, story, special effects...an awesome package. Cruise and Freeman really nailed their parts and what a twisting plot. I like that this movie makes you think for yourself rather than spoon feeding everything to you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Kept me thinking and on my toes! I can't wait for more levels. It helps to have scape paper handy to jot down notes.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|hard to make a mobile app as big as facebook into a small screen and still work well. Good Job
B008JFUO36|1.0|Instead I received The Bourne Legacy!  Can't rate what I didn't receive.  This was a gift and as it turns out my brother would like to keep it but now I am afraid to re-order for fear of getting another wrong product.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|pretty good app, not too bad.<br />fairly accurate,<br />time is accurate<br />good display.<br />I would recommend this to others interested in weather apps
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|I always enjoy Vince's work but I cannot claim that I am an especially devoted country fan.  But hearing a review of this album on NPR recently prompted me to download the MP3 of this album and and wish to share that I particularly enjoyed this album.  The Bakersfield sound is more to my taste than the saccharine of too-much-reverb-and-a-crooning-choral-group-behind Oprey sound that was more or less comtemporaneous to this style... No criticism of those artists, mind you, but this is simply my preference.  Vince and Paul hit it squarely, covering Buck Owens and Merle Haggard... My only wish is that Vince had felt inspired to include perhaps another 5 or 6 songs, for this album is just too short!  This well worth the collecting... a treasure for music fans, not just country.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|very creative<br />love the options<br />seems to do well with my kindle.<br />don't have any problems with the app at all
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is exactly the type of device I have tried to make out of hacked Apple TVs, a Raspberry Pi (running Xbmc), and a Sony Google TV (the older, blu-ray one).<br />I love the Youtube feature on my GTV where I can control Youtube on the TV from my Youtube app. It makes Youtube watchable on TV since you can surf new videos and add them to the queue from your phone/tablet while watching them on your TV.<br />Chromecast creates a similar experience for Netflix, although you can't queue up videos to watch.<br /><br />Usability right now (Aug 7, 2013), I would sum up as - It's a remote for Netflix, a Youtube play list manager, and google Play player.<br />It has a lot of promise., and I can't wait for it to work from Plex and other apps.<br /><br />Chrome tab works, but if you view something like Plex videos in browser, it delays by at least a few seconds, and audio often is off just enough to be noticeable.<br /><br />There also doesn't appear to be any security on it, anyone on your local network/wifi can usurp control of your TV by selecting cast to it from their device. It would be nice if you could manage permissions by google account, source phone/tablet device, and destination chromecast device.<br /><br />It would also be nice if they just added casting to the Google TV.<br /><br />If you want a cheap Netflix player, or a Google Music on your TV setup, or a remote queue manager for Youtube, buy one now. If you're going to make Plex, or some other app work for it, there ought to be a developer hookup site, as I would gladly donate my second one to get faster Plex/other app support.
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty accurate as far as weather does<br />displays as intended<br />weather app is nice and has very pretty display<br />would recommend it to others
B00499QUK2|5.0|This series is the best TV you can ask for. A smart show, sans the gore and violence. Very entertaining and engaging.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Not sure how they promoted this movie and whether maybe it was just the timing of it's release. So with that said, I wished I could have seen it on the big screen and not on my 42 inches LCD. Tom Cruse did a great job as always, I know some folks may not be Tom Cruse fans, but he makes you believe in the movie.<br />Great Movie!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Awesome book but very predictable<br />I'm starting to wonder why they are the smart ones. I figured out how to get out of the maze before they did
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|I loved this. I am a huge Scarface fan and I feel like I have been waiting for this book to come along. At last, all the information and analysis of the movie in one place. This is better than an audio commentary. Highly recommended!
B00632HWOG|5.0|YAHOO<br />Very good product, easy to access. It is convenient, and can be used almost anywhere, at home, at the store, at work.
0064471837|5.0|I first read this when I was 13 and immediately bought the trilogy! I'm now 21, in college, working two jobs, and still I MUST re-read Sabriel every year, it's just that amazing!
0064471837|5.0|I discovered this book in middle school and it is easily the most read volume on my bookshelf. The story follows Sabriel, daughter of the current Abhorsen (sort of a reverse necromancer), who sets out to save her father when she finds out his is missing/trapped in the realm of the dead. Nix creates complex, believable characters in a fantastic and well-developed world with a beautifully structured magic system.<br /><br />This book can stand beautifully on its own without the other two books of the series - however - I highly recommend reading the whole series, as the rest of the series is as enjoyable as the first volume. Don't be put off by the recommended age group. It doesn't feel like a \\"young adult\\" directed book at all.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Jimmy Hendrix's main influence also had influences, and so on and so on... there's nothing wrong with that.<br />74 years young and kickin' ass, just gittin' started from the sound of it
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Everything you need to have fun.  Nice graphics a hint button (essential for me),and clear instructions when needed.  It has a good storyline.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|fun and addictive my husband and I play for hours. level one is easy but level 2 gets tough. makes you think. its a good brain exercise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is better than the first one. It has better traps a better monster more places to go like the mine and the old wood plat form also you can collect diamonds and other easy to collect them over time I have 15. Also you can save your lives with the diamonds to. The temple looks better too. So you should get Temple run 2 Spence it's free :))
B0063M22QO|4.0|I think this is the best bang for your .99cents It freezes up but if you go out and come back in it works fine
B00594XOZU|3.0|On a kindle fire this app rlly needs to upgrade it doesnt have any of the new stuff and its been like this for a while other than that i would suggest it to ppl
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno! This game is so fun and addicting. And they keep giving you coins each  game and new level, so you never run out of coins.
0670026603|4.0|Do not start this book unless you intend to finish it in one day.  I could not put it down.  The romance is a long time unfolding which makes the actual confession of love so much more profound.  This book raise questions of euthanasia, and it does present the moral arguments for and against.  The characters presented are not always admirable but they are totally understandable even if at times we doubt them.  I thought the presentation of the trials of a quadriplegic was well done although I have limited personal knowledge with which to judge.  This book delivers laugh out loud moments as well as tears.  A wonderful book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I hope it isn't too much of a ***SPOILER*** to say I spent some time crying while reading this book.  The characters are well developed. You root or them, laugh and cry with them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever! I think this is the best one i have ever read. I also recommend the next 2 books in the series. I don't think I have any dislikes. I hope everyone reading this also agrees with me!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It crashes more than I would like, but I mostly only have good things to say. Fun to pin and get ideas!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I'll make this short and sweet :- the similarities in plot devices and parallels between Oblivion and Moon (2009) struck me immediately. They are not identical, but their premises are oblique - which is not meant as criticism as much as its meant as comparison. Where one features a presumed man isolated on a mining base on the moon, the other posits a presumed man on earth following an alien invasion. Both have memories of people and situations in the past which they can't quite identify. Both come to confront replicas of their own physical beings. Both discover that they are androids. Both \\"sets\\" of androids die. Etc. Their are other, rather fundamental differences. Oblivion's Hans Zimmer-like score is maddening and distracting in the extreme. As usual, where this kind of thing is concerned, the minimalism in the music should not be the pounding, ostinato-driven repetition - but the MINIMAL use of music so as to ENHANCE its effect when its presence is required. When the score is nothing but another layer of unchanging sound, it ceases to be music and becomes noise -  it destroys, utterly, the purpose and real magic of music. Moon is much more recondite in its use of music. All this said, the best comparison of the two films would be by way of musical simile: where Moon is like chamber music (small in scope - restricted in range), Oblivion is operatic. Both are fine in their own ways - and, my objections to the score for Oblivion notwithstanding, both films work in their own, distinctive ways.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|realistic and fun. great graphics<br />i love the horse types<br />it is very entertaining.<br />thebcost of supplies in the game  are not to exspensive
B004KD5TQI|2.0|I wasn't very happy that it only had 9 songs was really hoping for more, the sings in there are great but had I realized it only had the 9 I wouldn't of paid so much for it
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Long, drawn out and not interesting!  By the end (which took approximately 4 hours) I was disappointed and angry that I had wasted hours of time watching this very long and boring story. I won't waste any more time on saying no more.
006178480X|4.0|Iam, and always will be a Rollins fan but his recent books race the reader through one impossible scene after another.  There is no time for a gentle story to be woven in the excitement.  This is an end of the world scenario with the usual last minute, good guys to the death defying rescue.  There is murder of main characters, a love story that seemed impossible in other books, historical figures and their treasure, a last minute rescue of the world and the usual promise of another book.  Heart pounding read...worth the price of admission but predictable.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|True story.  Holds your interest, but you know how it is going to end so there is no mystery.  Well acted, the natural disaster effects were realistic looking, pretty well done.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|After 2 hours of trying to get the last stupid ball to stick to a scroll, one level before the end, I give up. You win. Making the game impossible to finish qualifies, sure...<br />If you ever fix it,  I'll reassess the game and go from there. Until then, this game pretty much blows.
0064471837|4.0|Without giving to much away this book is set in a world where death is but a small step for those with the power to go there , an evil arises and a hero emerges , and straight from the offset you a drawn into the story , with this book you will find yourself wanting to read more and more and by the time you have read the book you'll already have the others so you can find out what happens next.<br />Overall one of my favourite books and well worth the time anyone takes to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My two yr old loves playing with beauty! He loves petting, feeding and taking care of his horse.  Giggles everytime.  Great app.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I liked how the writer explains his enrollment into the seals and thoroughly explains all the process he went through to become part of the DevGRU. Great job guys.
B008JD7VZM|5.0|My nephew is 11 and very good with the little lego sets. This one took him only about 2 hours to complete. It's not a great challenge for him, but if your kids are younger it will take longer. He loved putting it together and it looked cool.
0307476073|5.0|As a backpacker, I could really appreciate the woes the author describes on her PCT trip, and the joys.  I suspect many of those giving poor ratings have never even put on a backpack, let alone carried one for miles upon miles day after day.  Backpacking can be, for some, myself included, a transformative experience, and the author really expresses that.  Does that mean she is suddenly transformed into a Hallmark special perfect character?  No.  But I enjoyed her story anyway!
B0076DELIG|5.0|A deeper look into the workings of Harry Bosch's mind and how he works a case. A great summer time read. I just love Harry Bosch.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm not sure how I ever got along without Evernote before.  I use it multiple times every day, and to have it constantly and effortlessly synch across all my devices is fantastic.  I infrequently use my Kindle Fire as a portable computer, but on those occasions its usefulness is enhanced immeasurably by giving me easy access to my files.
B002JI94J4|4.0|I like it more the DVD version, and this one seem to be a french version........<br />the quality of the sound is not quite real good.....<br />the image is good.....
030758836X|5.0|I loved Gone Girl.  It's told in alternating points of view, which may make it hard to read for some, but it's worth the extra thinking that it takes to follow the plot.  Nick tells the story of his wife, Amy's, disappearance, while Amy tells her side of the story.  The first half of the book is intriguing, but the second half is rivoting!  Every time you think there's going to be a resolution of some sort, another plot twist happens.  Part of the novel had me on the edge of my seat.  I highly recommend this book.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Just for the real Beatle fan.......<br />Nothing that the other predecessor DVD version doesn't have, but in high resolution.........<br />Good, always good for the collectionist......
0316228532|1.0|I bought The Casual Vacancy hoping it would be just as good as Rowling's Harry Potter series, as I'm sure everyone else did.  However, it was hard to make myself keep reading.  There were too many characters, so they were hard to keep up with.  Also, I felt like there was no real climax.  It was more like several smaller stories put together.  There were too many subplots.  It seems like Rowling tried to put too much into one story.  The writing style was not nearly as clear as the Potter series either.  I didn't enjoy the book at all.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|I like very much the book version of this product.......<br />Very elegant, and the content is excellent......<br />Only for real fans....
0064471837|5.0|I first picked up \\"Sabriel\\" when I was thirteen years old. The cover art intrigued me, and once I finished the prologue I knew it was a book I wanted to read. I checked it out and couldn't put it down! The story was so different from most things I'd read at that point; it was so original, and the characters were so easy to get attached to. I've read it multiple times over the years, and I've since invested in the follow-ups, \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\" (both excellent). It's one of the few books I never get tired of reading, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the fantasy genre.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Words truly are powerful. This book contains powerful language and life altering changes we can make and take by applying these four agreements in our lives. It certainly has changed my way of thinking and feeling in my life. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to choose happiness and end their suffering.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Excellent app.  Works well and accurate forecasts. I like the maps especially the future map, seems to be pretty to be spot on for where I live. The mPoints nonsense gets tiresome after a while.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|How or where this story is placed in the RE series I couldn't tell you but the movie is fun to watch, towards the end is where the movie shines the most, with how crazy things get, a must watch. Buy or rent. More toward rent
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Anyone with an interest in American History, especially the Civil War will adore this book.  People who want to see effective leadership under stress will see a President artfully dealing with people issues during his life.  The volume is at the highest level re academic scholarship and loses none of that in this page turner.  I really enjoyed, a treat of wonderful story telling at the end of my work days.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Very funny and one of the best &#34;feel good&#34; movies I have seen in a long time. Would recommend to everyone
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always enjoy this author, his work seems to always touch my heart.  There was a lot of suspense at the end.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It was so insightful to read the 5 love languages. I'm not married, but I believe that a lot can be gleaned from this book that will have a true impact on my life. I can't wait to read the singles edition and then the children's edition....
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Lots of action from the start. Nice story and action development throughout the whole movie. Best version I've ever seen.
B00CFQMVLS|2.0|The title sums up what happened here. Bruce Willis is John Mcclane in name only.  If you disagree, watch the first movie, then immediately watch this one and see how little the two protagonists have in common.<br /><br />This movie seems like some movie exec was like \\"Ok, here's an absurd action movie but the script isn't really that strong. Let's swap out the main guy for the Die Hard guy! Idiots with no capacity for character depth will get suckered in and love it! (I'm paraphrasing)\\"<br /><br />This is the first Die Hard movie not to make back its budget domestically.<br />Money talks. It says, \\"This stupid movie is an insult to the Die Hard franchise.\\"
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Lots of action from the start. Nice story and action development throughout the whole movie. Best version I've ever seen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive and I love seeing the different levels and how creative it is all it quite addictive ..... also I like collecting the tokens and competing with friend
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mostly dark but really good can't wait for more! The author has a great ability to tell a story and not lose you. Just the right amount of details.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I have read<br />this book before, and loved it. It has been about 3 to 5 years sense then. I have forgotten some of it, so it was almost like reading for the first time. It makes  you think. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Although you can spend money for power-ups, you don't have to, and you can have a lot of fun earning them. The daily challenges keep me coming back every day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun temple run style game. Love the different characters and boards.  Enjoy the upgrades to the power ups as well and the new global themes are lots of fun.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|More of the same. Shia Lebouf n a hot chick. Not Megan Fox though. Guess she got to much attention for Shia to handle. Too long and plot seemed a little strange to me. Ok though.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book to me was inspiring. I searched for Art pieces that reminded me of passages in this book because when I see them everyday at home, it will always remind me of this book.<br />I was sad when it was over, but so happy that I had &#34;experienced&#34; it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm usually into Alex rider and Percy Jackson but this book was great!  It's so sad when they ha d to put their dog down. : (
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Allows fast downloads on the fast, in numerous formats, saving me the trouble of having to wait to get to a PC to get media :)
B000FC1MM8|5.0|If you like mysteries, Michael is the one. Can't beat him on his own ground. Keep them coming.Thank you Mike.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This quick read carefully explains the process for using Microsoft Word to create your published Kindle book. This was an excellent tool. Thank you.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|All of Michael's books are great. Read them over and over.We need more of his books to movies. All great reada.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Bought this for a gaming rig, only 100$ or so at the time, as opposed to the i5 I would otherwise have bought with a different motherboard. I have not owned an Intel core so I cannot say it was necessarily faster or slower, I just know that for my purposes, this CPU did awesome for the price!<br />During the first couple of minutes during startup if will fluctuate to a max of 80% load for some reason, but then will stay under 20% when on the desktop, maybe 25 or 30 when using applications. When gaming (Skyrim for the ex), Peaks to about 35-40%. Never seen it peak to 100 and dont really expect it to unless I decide to randomly have 50 applications running and processing video and such.<br /><br />Awesome
B00634GHJA|2.0|If you want a program that does this and can share literally anything including pictures and video very very easily at the same level of security as your own WiFi network, then try something like WIFI File Explorer.<br /><br />It makes little sense to me that a program would so artificially limit you in such a way that you can only share certain types of files when its just as easy to just share them all so that you can transfer anything you want. I say this when there are other applications that charge less than this one does but share so much more and work so much better with much better interfaces. Now, before someone says that the file type of limitations may be because of privacy reasons, I would have to submit that pictures are probably about as personal as it gets. ;)<br /><br />2 stars because by Amazon's own stars description, \\"I don't like it\\". I just see no point in this application. There is much better stuff out there that's free, even.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was entertaining; however, I feel it was somewhat confusing keeping up with the characters as it stretched across generations and introduced new characters that were not clearly connected.  In fact, there was one chapter (seven) that introduces a  character (Adel)  who had no purpose in the story other than to identify how certain Afghans exploited their own countrymen.  It seemed somewhat of an afterthought added to the book.  This book was not quite up to the standards of this author's first two books.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game, Fun to play. But the heroes cost to much money. It's either tons of coins or you have to buy them with REAL MONEY<br /><br />But is its a real time killer
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is not one of those games that you play for five minutes and then can't play for a day it all depends on how you set it up but you can keep the good times going.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|very hard to determine where you are placing the blocks on the grid. Thought the colors only had to touch not be in a row.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I loved Lemmings in the 90s, It was smart, complicated and a fun challenge. However, it's not the 90s anymore and though this is a great adaptation, it is by necessity a slow and tedious game in a world where everything's fast. I find no fault in this game, it's cute, well designed and seems to be more than ample with content. The only problem is me, spoiled by today's technology.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want everyone in the world to know about minecraft I think they might because minecraft is is so COOL( ;<br />  GET!  it
0064471837|5.0|The Abhorsen Trilogy by Garth Nix is purely and simply a masterpiece.<br /><br />This book, Sabriel, is the first of the series and it grabs the reader's attention from the very beginning.  While the series is technically listed as young adult fiction, this is mis-leading because the writing and themes are timeless and ageless.  I have re-read this book many, many times over the years and it speaks to me at all ages.  I have introduced many other adults to the series and they have all fallen in love.<br /><br />The writing is wonderfully elegant, colorful, witty, gripping, and direct.  Garth Nix is a genius who organically and artfully pulls the reader into a vivid, beautiful world page after page.<br /><br />I will continue to re-read and recommend this series for many years to come!  I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|This app is wonderful! I just love it! I can get all of my favorite music and once I set my preferences, it knows what I like.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is really a great movie.  Just watched it 3 times on Direct TV.  I will be purchasing this film on Blu-Ray for sure. The characters are developed, the story and script are well written and intelligent, and the music and cinematography are amazing and rich.  Tom Cruise does a fantastic job in this role and brings an emotional and endearing human side to this sci-fi film, a film that has many insights into what could actually become a reality for the human race and this earth.  My husband wanted to see this film because sci-fi is his favorite film genre and he was curious about the film, I wasn't so sure I would be watching it with him, but since Tom Cruise is in it, I decided to watch it too, and I totally enjoyed it.  It's the kind of movie to discuss afterwards and then watch again, it's a very intelligent movie.  If you liked Solaris or Vanilla Sky ( with Tom Cruise) you will like this one.  But this, unlike Solaris, has a lot of action and fighting, so \\"guys\\" will enjoy!
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|This is a fast and positive app that takes the challenge out of downloading.  Music and documentaries are so much more fun now.
088103052X|4.0|it was used,  a bit worn but in good condition (: Very happy with this purchase. Not to mention an amazing book!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is the history of Jesus of Nazareth, not Jesus the Christ.  It is packed with little known information, written well and without bias.  For example, did you know that Jesus was surely not a carpenter?  Did you know that he had 3 brothers and sisters?  Did you know that he considered Gentiles &#34;dogs?&#34;  This book is a real page turner.
0064471837|5.0|I first found this book when I was in 7th grade, and have been enamored with it ever since. A beautiful coming of age story, for anyone out there who knows the call of destiny.
B007DU6ASQ|5.0|My grandson, as my son was, is a Lego nut.  Anything Lego...he has planes hanging off ceiling, shelves<br />all over his room with finished products.  Loves them.....this was a welcome addition.  Legos are great
0470638842|4.0|This book was okay. It was a required read for my class, so it is not something that I would have picked on my own.
080701429X|5.0|GOT THE BOOK ON AUG 2....READ IT TILL AUG 4 AND ITS AMAZING FANTASTIC READ...YOU WILL ENJOY THIS...GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
B000FC1AGG|5.0|So funny, I loved it! It surprised me but kept me laughing, sometime laughing out loud. Only one complaint was the \\"f\\" word used, it didn't need that!
B003ODL004|5.0|Really enjoy this soundtrack. I really enjoy a lot of Zimmer's work. Got a great deal on this. Well done soundtrack.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. I have as much fun as my son does! Just give it a try!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a fun, pretty addictive game that is a good mix like Temple Run-meets Iron Man-meets Fruit Ninja.<br />The graphics and sound are great and it mixes the levels well.<br />The cool looking &amp; upgradeable armor suits will have you collecting in no time.<br />Only bad side: Addictive &amp; kinda battery-draining.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was a little cautious starting this series because of the bad reviews on the first book. I was pleasantly surprised and the books moved at a pace where it wasn't so fast you had no idea what just happened and it didn't move so slow that you got bored. I got to the point of crying in this book not to say it's too terribly difficult as I'm an emotional person but still.<br />Knowing this book is almost solely based around romance I honestly thought I would either get bored or tired of reading basically the same thing over and over.<br />I did especially love the fact that you got to meet the families of both America and Maxson. The previous book left Maxson's parents there an  not really  a character at all.<br />I didn't particularly like her wallowing between which man she wanted and that was a little annoying as she changed every chapter it seemed.<br />But overall it was a great book and mainly a girl book as it centers around romance as I already mentioned.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Over all I thought this was a good movie, but it could have been better. It is worth the price to rent. The acting was top notch. The problem was in the scripting. Some of the lines just didn't have any pizzazz. Likely as not though I may, in the future, rent it again.
0061906220|5.0|Children will love singing along again and again just received the book when the book has some glue to stick the ~ book a little paint chips
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I am a Bruce Willis fan and think he is a great actor and he didn't disappoint. The word play between Bruce's character and Jai Courtney's was interesting albeit uninspired. For me the Die Hard franchise is well worn by now, still it was a must rent and may be added to my list of future purchases.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Good movie just wish it didn't boot us out to main menu 2 times during our movie. Hope everyone else has better luck.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So I was taking a trip to Virginia, and me and my family were coming back home. We stayed at a hotel at Pittsburgh, VA. Then the worst thing happened! We were going to the pool, and a freaking thunderstorm happened! My mom's phone would not work, and we needed to see the weather. This app saved my Vacation!!!!! I saw the radar, and there was a huge tornado watch! Thank goodness we were watching. This app works great!!!!!!!!! GET IT!!!
0307990850|4.0|I guess I read a different \\" A Wanted Man\\" because I enjoyed the book enough to read it in 3 sittings.  Did it seem a little slow and flat and less exciting then past stories?  YES absolutely, but..... it was refreshing in that it had less action and more narration and I had no idea what the ending was going to be...none at all.  I had to read and try to understand the roles of all the characters and I was surprised how many of their lives became part of a more intricate plot, except for the heart attack which was a little sad and didn't add much to the whole story......but Child's is the author not me.  Would I want Reacher to be more hero?  Of course!!  This story might be less energetic than some others but it still leaves me wanting to read the next one!
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|You won't sleepwalk with this on your tv that's for sure. just seen it in theater.its prob. the best horror film I've seen in several long h/borrer movie excused years!  James Wan is a Good director.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|Maybe Bruce should hang up his gun belt now. it was average and predictable. We thought this but die hard fans might disagree
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This was always my favorite puzzle in the old school puzzle books.  I love the fact that I can play these puzzles anywhere.  Since its so easy to pick up where you leave off,  it's a great way to pass even a few minutes.
B005MHI0QM|3.0|I thought the book was helpful. It helps me fortress for school because we  're going to learn about hitler and stuff like that um I was hoping for more of a story line and that JUST journal entries. I was also expecting more about her herself that just in the journal entries. (:
0307730700|5.0|This is, without a doubt in my mind, the best book that I have ever read.  Period!  The character development of Adam Brown is superbly written and detailed.<br /><br />This book is the furthest thing from your typical cliche Navy Seal book.  The first 100+ pages are of Adam's Childhood and Struggles!<br /><br />This book has made me laugh, frown, and even cry.  No other book has done that.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the motivational aspect.  If you feel that you have no purpose, are depressed, hit rock bottom,  just read this and see what Adam Brown went through (beyond rock bottom) and rose to the very best of the military special ops community.<br /><br />BEST BOOK EVER!!!<br /><br />Thank you Adam for your service.  I wish I could live my life 10% of the way you lived yours!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I loved this game for about 5 minutes, then after that it started freezing my kindle and I would have to constantly restart the whole kindle. It seems like a cool game, but it is horrible on the Kindle.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was a fan of 30 Rock but now even a bigger fan after reading this book.  A combination of hard work and talent has taken Tina to the top of her game.  The book was funny, insightful and a real treat for fans of SNL and 30 Rock
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Great movie and the special effects were great. I loved the stories within the story. I am really glad I purchased this movie. It will become one of the great classics.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game from start to finish. The graphics are great, the sound is excellent. The story is just sort of there, but who cares, it is just an excuse to give you stuff to mow down anyway. It was pretty heard from level seven to ten and I can see why people would complain that it is a money pit, but that is only because they, most likely, didn't want to take the time to level up their guy and his weapons. I finished the game and didn't spend another dime on it other than the initial price. I maxed my sword out on all the stats and got his HP to about level 18. This takes time, but for those of us used to old school RPGs it doesn't seem that bad. If you can make it to level 5 on hard mode there is a ballista shooting sequence near the start of the level. If you complete this you net a whopping 3000 coins (1000 in regular mode). Just do this, save at the nearby fountain, restart the level and repeat. Keep doing this and you'll be fine. Even when my guy leveled up, I still had a hard time with the boss fights on level 7 and level 10, but as long as you work on your stats and weapons and bring enough money to buy potions on the fly or to revive yourself, you will get through and never have to buy and IAP.<br /><br />I really like Wild Blood a lot. I am guy who HATES to buy a game and then me made to pay more money to play it, so if this was the case I would tell you, see my review of \\"Call of Mini Zombies.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the camera sometimes didn't cooperate, but it was never really a big issue. There was also a bot of slow-down once in a while, but nothing major. Also, for the time I was playing through the game and working on Lancelot's stats, this app really cut into my reading time, but I can't really blame Gameloft for that I suppose :)
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This was a good movie and I got it at a good price.  This version was well acted and the story was good.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I must be the stupidest person on earth.  Just don't see how so many folks can say this product is so great given that you have to fiddle your way through to use it.  Just another overhype undocumented product.  A honest review would call it out as a pre-beta product looking for a following.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I have seen two different versions of this movie and this version was the best of the two. I truly enjoyed this movie. Double enjoyed the price I paid for this DVD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked this book! Great plot, character development and easy to read. A pleasure book for a light summer read.
159463176X|3.0|I'm a huge devotee of this author!  I gave this 3 stars b/c he is a magnificent writer, but his other two books were far superior to this one, in the sense that I couldn't quite keep up with the storyline/characters as well as I could with the others.  Still, one brilliant, wonderful, fascinating author to be sure!  Looking forward to more!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked this book! Great plot, character development and easy to read. A pleasure book for a light summer read.
0062255657|5.0|Just like Gaiman's other works, this book is nearly impossible to put down.  Gaiman perfectly captures the essence of the little boy who narrates the story -- unfazed by the wonders and magic he witnesses, yet completely uncomprehending the mysteries of adulthood.  It's a relatively quick read that I'd highly recommend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever! SO funny and so entertaining. Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson are two of my favorite actresses and they work together so well in this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|5 Star rating in my book. This game is addictive and fun!! Will keep you entertained for hours. My four year old grandgirl loves it too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! I wanted to read it before I saw the movie and after reading it I fell in love with the characters and their lives.
0770437400|5.0|Just wow. This book is really amazing.<br /><br />The author is way beyond intelligent. I can't imagine a more interesting zombie novel. It's written as a series of interviews in a post zombie holocaust scenario, international in scope. The amount of research that's gone into it is readily apparent. It takes you from China, to South Africa, Japan, the International Space Station, and beyond, slowly building a global view of the events, and their aftermath.<br /><br />In fact, this novel sort of makes me want to see it happen. Yes, millions of people die, maybe more. But it's sort of like Reagan (whom I'm not particularly a fan of) said. The world will unite against a common enemy.<br /><br />Each little piece of the book taken alone is fascinating. But the big picture it paints is even more inspiring. Along the way, there is plenty of geopolitical commentary. It actually paints xenophobia in a positive light, with Israel and Cuba, for example, behaving in surprising ways.<br /><br />The standard zombie fare is in there, as well, with lots of grisly and action-packed moments full of tension. It's also full of heroes, and two enemies: the zombies, and ourselves. A top-notch book, from start to finish. Read it!
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|I'm a fan of Joel Shumacher and Nic Cage. Note, they made the chilling thriller 8MM together as director and actor years ago. 8MM is a real favorite of mine. So teaming up again with this material I got excited. That swiftly ended about 30 minutes into Trespass. It was repetitive screaming and bickering between the characters, a thin storyline as well. I really lost interest after the fourth yelling match between Cage and the villains. I still think Cage is a fine actor and gets to much criticism, he did a great job in Seeking Justice, check that film out instead. The movies faults aren't on the director either. It was a polished movie. I think this was just a case where they looked at the script and said, hey, we can make the whole movie in this one location and save money. They did it, but it was a chore to stay interested in while viewing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I downloaded the free version, enjoyed it so much I had to buy the full version which was excitingly inexpensive!  Definitely worth it - very entertaining :-)
B005HJWWW8|5.0|GREAT LITTLE AMP!!! Have some hard to drive closed cans that just dont have the volume and dynamics on my portable player. fine didnt' have $$$ to get a spendy amp so finally ordered this one. Im using a Samsung YP-02, a better than average digital portable with a veritable plethera of sonic EQ's and effects. As some have I found the instructions tiny and incomplete. So i just winged it. Soon after it was charged-up, I started to play with it.VERY pleasantly surprised at the volume increase with seemingly no noticeable ill effects. So far SO GOOD> after an hour or so I seem to have too many choices of sonic signitures to choose from between the Samsung and the FIIO---but i can easily live with it! Makes my inneficient cans sound louder and a bit more dynamic too! ((note; FIIO loses 1-star for dorky instructions))I normally use the 'violet' setting & sometimes the 1st 'blue' setting.  YES: it IS very very easy to forget the volume control is down.<br />Bought 1st week of Aug.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I haven't played the game for some time now, but being free I thought \\"what the heck\\" and installed it. No problems with it running, or installing on my Kindle Fire HD. You can do quite a bit of game play even in the free version since it is a card game and each deck is shuffled making each game a little different even with the same deck over and over again.<br />The art is very good,(Would not expect anything else from all those great artist. the effects are nice as well and the sound is top notch.<br />I just purchased the full version and I'm looking forward to many hours of game play.<br />The hints and notes are all in the right places, each rule is explained carefully and in plain English. I already understood most of the concepts so I could skip the beginners tutorial, and all of the changes made in the years since I used to play were easy to see and understand.<br />I would recommend this game to any newbies as well as veterans.<br />Have fun!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoyed this series a lot.  My brother lived in New York City for 25 years and I visited there about 80 times.  The characters in this series reminded me of my brother's life while living there.  The city scenes are very accurate and depicted people in a realistic way.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Lana Del Rey has a really unique voice that makes the album something different. She has some good lyrics and melody!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I enjoyed this series, but it began to get weaker in the plots.  The writers must have changed and some of the characters began to be irritating.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far so fun! I don't really understand what the point of this game is and what I am doing but I just follow the directions and seem to be doing it right? I am new to this genre of game... I play Jeopardy, word games,etc. But this one looked fun and I am enjoying it as I stumble my way through!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I highly recommend this product, especially at this price. It took approximately 15 minutes to set it up and connect to two laptops, two tablets, and two phones. The picture quality so far, from what I have seen, is really good and it seems to be responsive on all of our devices. Currently it only works with your laptop chrome browser (Which is pretty cool), Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play apps. However, other apps are rumored to be in the works in the coming months. I was able to stream Pandora through my laptop browser no problem. The original advertising is a bit misleading as it does require that you plug the Chromecast into a USB power source (It comes with an adapter). You will need to have a TV that has an HDMI and USB or at least a wall outlet nearby. Overall, at $35 it is well worth it, even if it is not perfect.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This app is not the best, u can't do their hair very well. I would suggest this app seven years and under.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have laughed and teared up at a few books, that I have read in my life but I have never laughed, teared up, cried, felt awed, felt unbelievable pride, patriotic beyond words to the point of tears as I did with the relating of this specific, proud telling of Mr. Luttrell's 'experience'. As a mother, my heart ached, cried and broke. My mothers heart felt boastful pride for Holly Luttrell. I've never been more proud and humbled to be an American. This accounting of courage beyond words but courage through example is this single best book I've ever read. You simply can not read this book and take for granted your freedoms granted to you by God any longer. This book put into perspective, for me, what it means to be not just American, but a true patriot. I wish I could be this worthy of the title of American as those who stand up to fight, to the death if necessary, for my right to say so. Thank you doesn't come one ten-thousandth close to what I feel.

0062280228|2.0|I got the audio book. The author read it. His voice was wonderful and his words lovely. But the story was not even interesting. Who calls this a fairy tale? It's a combination fairy tale, horror, deviance, and normalcy. I hated it. I would have given it 1 star but gave it 2 stars because of the reading and the beautiful writing. I think the man can use words to his advantage - just wish he had a good story to tell. Some reviewers say they love his other works but not this one. However, I don't think I will try any of his other books. This one stunk!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Well you know how the title is Youtube Downloader. Well you can download it but it takes forever.Also you HAVE to have wifi even if its already downloaded!! It also takes forever to get on it. So frustrating sometimes.
0979019710|5.0|I had never read an entire book before getting my hands on this one. Hal did an amazing job putting everything you need to know about being successful into a short easy read. I've personally thanked him for writing this. Thanks Hal!

B007L6VR12|2.0|I feel as if 28 may be too old to enjoy this movie.  Or perhaps it's my familiarity with Anderson's style.  Either/or, Moonrise Kingdom is more of the same.  Go record Rushmore on TCM and call it a night.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Damian Stevenson's \\"Scarface: the Ultimate Guide\\" is exactly what the title promises - a thoroughly researched, informative and entertaining guide to an iconic film.  If you're a fan of the film (or just a film fan in general) this book is absolutely for you.<br /><br />The author digs into the history behind the film, putting it in context both for Hollywood history, and also then-current politics and events.  He takes us through the production, with anecdotes  and quotes from the cast and crew.  And then he takes us through the film in great detail, scene by scene.  Stevenson points out themes and hidden details, as well allusions to other films, literature, history and politics.  Even fans who've seen the film dozens of times will learn something new and find their viewing experience enriched after reading this Ultimate Guide.<br /><br />I would highly, highly recommend this book, and I'm looking forward to the other Ultimate Guides that the author promises will be coming soon, for a long list of great films ranging from the 1930's to today.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the writing style of Gillian, this is the first book I've read of hers. It was definitely a page turner and I would have rated it 5 stars except after a major turning point in the book it was hard to finish it. There was no longer the same urgency I had felt in the beginning to see what would happen to the characters.
B00D9CDTUY|4.0|This is a slick Angela Jolie spy action movie.  She plays the part of a normal housewife, that happens to be a CIA agent, that is accused of being a foreign spy.  Angela is quite good at acting normal and then showing a mysterious side that makes us second guess what she really is going to do next.  A few red herrings keep you guessing everyones motives.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:0780618548 The Long Kiss Goodnight]], [[ASIN:B000Q76K1A The Bourne Identity]], and [[ASIN:B001VM0LAK The Jackal]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B004WMKSH2|5.0|I loved this movie.  I waited years to watch this movie and I am glad I finally did.  Great movie
0060254920|1.0|I love this story and was so excited to buy it for my daughter.  I bought it from amazon, brand new, and received it in TERRIBLE condistion.  The book sleeve looks dirty, there are a few small tears, and it's all rumpled.  It looks so dirty and dingy!  And I bought this new!?!?!<br /><br />Very disappointed, Amazon.  I paid for a NEW book and received something that is not even in &#34;good&#34; condition.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It never loads and when it does it is a very laggy video. It would be much better to use something else.
0061733199|5.0|LOVE it! Written in an Englishman's vocabulary but easy enough for a Yank to understand. I haven't read through the whole book yet but the man that wrote it, is right on point. I know a survialist or two and they agree, this is a great book even for begginers.<br /><br />I bought this book as a guide &#34;just in case&#34; while camping or hiking. I must say I didn't realize how many PRACTICAL things I didn't know, from the basic survival kit to the gear that is a must have to how to find water. It's all there. Just do like LOFTY says and remember your brain it's the most important thing to have in an emergency survival situation.<br /><br />God bless America and her fighting men.<br />God Bless the SAS and God save the Queen, Thanks guys.

140006922X|5.0|It's not often I find a book which ends with a sentence so powerful I had to put the book down.  It's not often I read a book, indie or not, that leaves me so compelled to leave a review, that I spend two full days trying to compose exactly what I want to say in my head.<br /><br />The book is a controversial one, I'll give you that.  It presents and idea that Western theology rails against so often.  What was the historical Jesus really like?<br /><br />I'll preface this review by letting you know, I am a studying theologian.  I currently possess a BA in theology (Medieval Theology with an emphasis in the compilation of the Canon), so I picked this book up with bias.<br /><br />I was first introduced to Reza Aslan in a Fox News interview in which he spent the entire time defending himself against a woman who could not move past the fact that he was a Muslim writing a book about Jesus.  I will just say I sincerely hope she watches that interview and drowns herself in shame.  Reza Aslan has the education I crave, and that alone intrigued me about his writing.<br /><br />I was a little nervous, picking up the book.  It wasn't expensive for the hard cover, which I was really excited to see on amazon.  Didn't hurt the wallet, which is always a huge plus for a mother of three school-aged children.<br /><br />I'm not sure if many of the readers in this blog spend a lot of time reading theology books, or non-fiction theory books, so in case you are unfamiliar with the general lay-out of these types of reads-- they can be very dry.  Dry to the point of wanting to throw the book across the room and never pick it up again.  While I was at University so many of the books I was forced to read made me want to cry tears of blood.<br /><br />Luckily Azlan has a real talent for story telling.  I was captivated from page one.  From his short introduction which introduced the reader to himself, his education, and more importantly, his religious background.  He was a convert to evangelical Christianity until (like a lot of theology students I know) he began to study religion.  Like me, the knowledge he amassed removed the mysticism and fear from the religion and the ability to believe went with it.<br /><br />That doesn't meant there isn't a story there, or there isn't a very important history.  I'll quote from one of the last passages in the book, \\"...Jesus the man--is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ.  He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"<br /><br />The truth is, and most theologians-- whether they are religious or secular-- will tell you the Bible is not a historical document.  The New Testament's first scriptures ever written (the epistles) were in a time when there was a conflict between the Greek-educated Jews, and those left behind to spread the word of Jesus.  The first Gospels written (Mark, Matthew, then Luke followed by John) in a time after Jerusalem had been razed, burnt to the ground, and the Jews forced out.  The Gospels are a political tract, in short, to draw attention to why the Christians were okay, because they were so, very different from the Religion they had spawned from.<br /><br />But therein lies the problem-- there is little to no history about Jesus the man, a poor wood worker, raised in a providence that was steeped in revolution and oppression.<br /><br />Aslan takes information about the area where Jesus grew up, about the people history has recorded, and the politics at the time, and begins to craft a well-told story about what Jesus of Nazareth may have truly been like.<br /><br />The book is theory, there's no denying that.  There is no written evidence left aside from a few written words by Josephus, that mentions Jesus in a historical context.  The Q document is only theory, and even that was dated after the death of the Preacher.<br /><br />I'll say it again, it's not often I am this captivated by a theology book.  Theology is my favorite thing to read, but very rarely do I feel a sense of loss, a craving for more, when the book has ended.<br /><br />This is a must read for those of you even remotely curious about the history regarding one of the most charismatic and flourishing religions in known history.  Many times I've asked myself, \\"But how?  How did the words of Paul become so popular, and those of the men who walked with Jesus come to be almost completely forgotten in the religious dogma?\\"<br /><br />This book answers that question, and it's such a simple answer, I couldn't believe I hadn't thought about it before.  In all my studies, in all of my delving into how the canon was complied into the Bible we know today, how did I not, for a moment, put it all together.<br /><br />I won't give you the answer, but the moment you see it, you'll understand it, too.<br /><br />This is a completely unorthodox book review, but I don't care.  This book deserves the notoriety it's gained, and I'm happy to give it five stars.ery rarely do I feel a sense of loss, a craving for more, when the book has ended.<br /><br />This is a must read for those of you even remotely curious about the history regarding one of the most charismatic and flourishing religions in known history.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Have got to say, this is a very fun and even funny game. Although the game lags a little, this game is still something great to play.
B004I744AS|5.0|So handy when playing Words With Friends or crossword puzzles or at anytime there is a question of definition or spelling. I use it often.
1457514508|3.0|The book started out slow, but by fifty pages, it became much more interesting. The plot twists and turns quite nicely; however, I would suggest this author consider a good content editor to keep the plot more plausible and to remove repeating information. With all its flaws, i did enjoy reading it and could forgive the lack of editing. It's a fun summer read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was one of the first books I read in middle school. Now that there is a movie coming out I wanted to re-read it. I  love the storyline. The characters are amazing. Great world is opened up.

B004ADH1RI|5.0|I recently revisited this classic with my 7 year old who loved it just as much as I did and still do!
B00D7JGL36|3.0|I was SO looking forward to this album.  Vnce Gill has ALWAYS done a bang up job with the classics, and Paul Franklin is a second to none steel player.  Please do not misunderstand, this is NOT a bad album.  I just was expecting a super duper honky tonk steel guitar driven album.  I feel it is a little above average at best.  Rodney Crowell's remake of Above and Beyond is the absolute best re-make of a country classic ever.  Same with Ricky Van Shelton's remakes.  This just is not up there with those.
0671004107|5.0|I first saw the Robert Zemeckis film starring Jodie Foster years ago though it wasn't until my fifth or tenth re-watching that I realized how special it was to me. Visually the cinematography is quite striking, but more importantly there's this sense of divine wonder, this agnostic spiritualism, that permeates even though the film is implicitly not religious. Nowadays I cite Contact as one of my all-time favorite movies. And now that I've read Contact, the novel, I can say it's one of my all-time favorites too.<br /><br />Carl Sagan is a Pulitzer-prize winning author from a scientific standpoint, and with Contact he's writing more as a scientist than a novelist. You can see where he opts for the technical explanation over sentence economy. This strains the prose a bit, but Sagan isn't trying to win you over with dramatic flair. He wants to persuade you of his ideas, of his vision for the future.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Sagan's miniseries Cosmos, then you're aware of the breathtaking awe he brings to the study of cosmology. And it's not just about what's out there in space, but that we're a part of it too. He advocates for a positive view of mankind where our desire to build a better world is a future reality and not merely a glimmer of hope.

0143038419|5.0|I've read some of these reviews with great interest in the deep divide between those who loved this book and those who despised it.<br /><br />For those who despised it because they think the author is narcissistic, self-absorbed, and too focused on her own inner process than the magical places she visited - you've missed the whole point. This book is a spiritual memoir. It is *supposed* to be self-centered. While she travels to some exotic locales, the real journey is an internal one. The entire and stated point of her travels is self-exploration and self-healing. Of *course* she is going to talk about herself.<br /><br />For those who can't stand that the author is \\"privileged\\"... I just don't get it. Do you think wealth solves all problems? Do you think Gilbert's life is going to be sunshine and roses just because she can afford to travel? I don't even know how to respond to reviewers who think that simply the state of having money is enough to heal a deeply broken heart, and that being \\"privileged\\" somehow makes a woman's spiritual journey irrelevant.<br /><br />I really enjoy reading about people's spiritual lives and am grateful to those who have the courage to share them. Some of these experiences are very difficult to put into words, and I found Gilbert's descriptions to be poetic and compelling. Sharing this kind of deep personal change is a gift to those of us who identify as spiritual seekers.

0064471837|5.0|I first discovered this book on the dusty shelves of the public library when I was 13 years old. I was drawn to the cover - at the time, I would read anything that had a powerful leading female, whether it was good or not. Thankfully, Sabriel blew away any expectations I had. Garth Nix isn't just an excellent writer, he's a talented worldbuilder as well. The story is deep with layers and layers of profound characters and exciting adventure. The whole Abhorsen series is now an annual read for me - it's my default read when I find myself without an unread book in my hands. I never get tired of strong-willed Sabriel and her misfit band of heroes. Every teen girl should read this book and feel empowered.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|I liked the app. It is super fantastic.  I play all the time.  You should get this. Magic is cool.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Though this app is very handy I have found two major issues. 1, it NEVER notifies when I have new mail, I have to periodically check back. 2, it doesn't even contain all that is in my inbox. I can check my email on the app and even refresh it and have nothing, then go to the website and check it there and there are emails there that the app never pickled up. This is nearly enough to make me totally remove it. If you are looking for an app to notify you and present you with ALL of your messages I do not recommend this one, especially if you often receive very important messages that need speedy responses.

It was a pleasure to do so.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app I go on it all the time. I recorded songs I learn from music class. Seriously you have to get this app. I like no other piano app.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD (7-inch) to play MP4 files because the native app doesn't support subtitles and I'm hard of hearing. I love that this app supports both hard and softcoded subs. Problem is, it crashes quite often and then when it restarts, it uses Software mode which results in drastically lowered volume and an odd framerate for the video. Trying to switch back to Hard mode usually results in the app crashing, no matter how many times you reopen it, it continues to crash. The only fix I've found is a hard reset, not something one really wants to do all the time. I don't know if the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch doesn't have good enough specs to handle the player and video files or what, but it is quite unstable. When it works, it works well but the frequent crashing is an annoyance.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Kik is a good way to message friends. But, when I tried to change the settings so only my first name would appear, there was no settings option! I'm not sure if this is normal or not. My friends have kik on their phones, and they have many options I do not have on my kindle fire HD. I also don't recommend this app unless you are only using it to talk to people you know. There are many creeps on this app. Just a warning. Thanks.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I loved this game when I was a child, and love playing it now! When my kids saw me playing they fan to download it on their kindle.  They call it the matching game.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors had three great albums in my opinion. LA Woman, Strange Days and this one, their debut.  Anyone who knows anything about rock music has heard most of the songs on this album already. There's probably not much more to say other than if you want an original Doors album and not a compilation, choose this one, Strange Days or LA Woman.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is one of the most touching and heroic filled books I have ever read. I will read this many more times in the future.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, and the following books are wonderfully written and beautifully crafted. The world building is deep, rich and well thought out. There's never really an information dump, the information readers need in order to understand what's going on and how the universe works is subtly crafted into the novel in ways that let the reader discover, rather than be told, how the magic system functions.<br /><br />It's also fabulous in that the main character is female, and she is AWESOME. Sabriel does most of the risk taking, rescuing and saving-the-day. The romance is subtle and lovely, without feeling like it's another romance in another fantasy book. The strong female lead makes this a fantastic read for early teen girls. The fighting, magic, risk and adventure make this a fantastic read for boys (and girls who love that thing, because I know I do!). Basically, it's a great book for anyone.<br /><br />My only caveat is that it is VERY dark. There's a lot of discussion about death and dying. Be prepared for that kind of environment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it soooo much<br />If they make a temple run 3 I'll scream<br />High score is 49,000,000<br />Best game ever
B006LSZECO|2.0|I feel as if I were played.  I almost stopped reading this book many times. I think it would have been better as a short story.  It felt like she tried to tease something like &#34;The Most Dangerous Game&#34; into a 300+ page novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! It's an interesting period peice without the nudity and violence that plague other shows. Watch it!
B007THA4FI|5.0|In a wide departure from her previous work she has written a complex commentary on English society in a small village and the innermost thoughts of the people living there. It's a social commentary on class structure, a deep analysis of the inner secrets and public faces that the individuals possess, and an intricate plot.  It has stayed with me for days after finishing it. I think it has all the elements of a classic.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Super addicting and lots of fun! Wish it was unlimited play or more than what you get. Otherwise an awesome game!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is slightly edited from the original print version, but just as good. Ender's struggles with right and wrong point to the human need for everything to be put into neat little boxes.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|EXTREMELY fun and addicting game but the coins to play a round need to  regenerate faster than what they do...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the game sooooooo much!!! But it takes forever to load. I waited ten minutes and it stayed at 0%!!! Buy the app but don't buy it. I don't know. Love it but it is spool annoying.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Although the band is limited, to Ian Gillan's limited vocal range these days, the Keyboard and guitar are outstanding, with some fine songs also.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the trilogy over week long vacation at Christmas. My husband got me a gift card and this is what I spent it on. I wouldn't change the purchase. You definitely have to like this \\"type\\" of book but it was easy to get into. I think anyone who has ever been in a relationship that was not with the Mr/Mrs Perfect but with Mr/Mrs Perfect for you will understand more than just the sex. It is heart-breaking at parts because you feel for the characters. I will read it again.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|A fine album although Ozzy is having problems with his voice (or lack of one) on the tour this is a solid album. And NO, THE GOD OF THE BIBLE THE ONE TRUE GOD IS NOT DEAD!!! Although Ozzy is by far the worse vocalist that Sabbath ever had, he is a personality that can not be replaced.
B007PF7MGS|3.0|The book was bought as a gift for a friend who was doing the change in eating habits with her sister.  As far as I know she liked the info.
159463176X|1.0|I have read this author's other books and enjoyed them thoroughly, so looked forward to this one.  However, the story jumped around in time and person so much that I couldn't follow it.  I finally decided to call it quits about two-thirds of the way through.  I gave it  every chance to  interest me, but finally gave up. A big disappointment.
0312430000|5.0|This is a great book. Gawande is a great writer and takes you through a series of events and examples of the checklist theory explaining a widely accepted practice in not only medicine but also in fields such construction and aviation. In addition, he shows how the checklist concept is truly universial and can be applied to make any task more efficient. As I like to put it, it's all about \\"finding the simplicity in intricacy\\". He guides the reader with an friendly yet professional tone and takes you through the field-specific jargon without missing a beat. My one quam with this book was that it was heavily focused on the medicine field. Gawande being a doctor, I should have expected this. Also because the checklist theory appears in almost all hospitals nowadays. That being said, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in medicine, human psychology, and anthropology. Whether it be a medical student, psycharitrist, or philosophy professor, this is definitely a book you want to find the time to read.
B005LAII80|5.0|This was a great film, certainly one of the best \\"Hollywood\\" films of 2012.  Although this was filmed on a relatively small budget, its an amazing looking film with great cinematography, sets, costumes, and slow motion sequences.  The acting from the main characters is great and the action sequences are very well done (and numerous).  Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Im reading the series for a second time, and its even better than the first time. Cant wait for the movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little sharpener. It's very well made, the construction is solid as a rock. I use the smith to sharpen all my pocket knives.
0316044695|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I didn't expect to like it as much as I actually do like it now. They story is so powerful and emotional and heartbreaking, yet Marcus never gives up. His comedic voice at the end of paragraphs often made me smile while reading. I can't wait to see the upcoming movie, and I hope the film captures the dramatic spirit of the book from his training to the mission he eventually goes on. This book means a lot to me now. I can't stop talking about it and want those around me to read it -- just so we can talk about what happened to Marcus. There are aspects of this story that are an inspiration to me, and it's a story I'm never going to forget. So check it out and read it for yourself.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This brings out acting skills from the actors and actresses that exceed anything we have yet seen. I can't imagine how this could have been done better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read, and believe me, it would take weeks to pronounce the names of all the books I have read.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very powerful book about a special person. I used to think of myself as an Apple fan, but did not realize how superficial my judgements have been on Steve Jobs. He is a remarkable person, with Intensity I admire. Kept on getting back to myself, what I would have done in front of his criticisms if I were to work with him(Embarassed, I would have chickened out), and kept on agreeing with him on the value of humanities.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I started playing thinking It would be dumb, turned out to b a game I can't put down at all. I love it!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|i reckon after having these K 702's for over a year, I'm ready to rate these sterling headphones.  Day 1. I was ready to send them right back from whence they came.Then I remembered many reviews called for extensive burn in time. After about 100 hours they sounded better and after appox. 1000 hours of playing music through them they started to sparkle.  you would think from reading these reviews, that AKG is made by some magical elves in the Black forest. Not so. The fake decorative chrome piece on the earpiece keeps coming off.      Addendum I put my collection of five star rated headphones for a while. I decided to go with these AKG Pro Audio K702 headphones. I've been using them                                       Addendum; Incredible! simply Incredible,,the fury from such songs such as 1964's Rolling Stones version of &#34;Bobby Womack's &#34;It's all over now&#34; .I forgot how good these headphones are clean, clear sound. Uncolored sound. Music the way it's meant to sound. Natural base, no enhanced or coloring of instruments. I took these off the headphone stand and have been using them ever since. I love the sound. All this time a set of powerhouse headphones have been in my collection, And I have not exploited them to the fullest of their capabilities. Now that I have rediscovered them. They have been promoted to regular rotation with all the other premium stuff,                ;l It is now the middle fall here on the great plains. I have eschewed all my other 4 and five star rated headphones in see iff The sound emanating from these headphones is clear, clean precise  with no coloring of the sound.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I truly love Pinterest on my computer because of the wonderful, nice and wide visuals, with all those lovely pictures, but this app is great because it pretty much has all the features of the online version only smaller (unlike Facebook, whose phone app leaves out a lot of great features the online version has).  It's fantastic!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I thought at first it was stupid but o my God it is the best game in the world me and my friends are going to level a whole world and build a mansion when they come over but if u are reading reviews definitely get this game u won't know time passes by
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|You will just FALL in LOVE with this man!!!!!!!! Men included!! ;D Ahhh I could just watch this over and over!! Literealy when I bought it I barely did anything else but watch it!!!!
0064471837|5.0|I immediately was captivated by the heroine and her world captured here.  I only wish there was MORE to enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I updated my Kindle for Android and it hasn't worked since.  No matter what I do, no books show up on the device.  Unable to locate anyone or any website that can give me any idea why or what to do about it.<br />GIVE ME BACK THE OLD VERSION!!!
B0042MEQVG|4.0|Twilight fans or open-minded people only here please.<br />Although I enjoyed 'Eclipse', I did not enjoy it as much as 'New Moon' or 'Breaking Dawn'. It was probably my least-favorite out of all of the Twilight movie series (I read all of the books as well).
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using LastPass for over 5 years now and just recently put the app on my iPhone.  I have been as pleased with it as I have been with the pc edition.  Everything is right there for you to access, and access can be made from any device as long as you remember the one main pass key that you assign.  It takes care of everything else.  Log into your favorite sites and it is right there to take care of signing you in.  All in all an excellent product that I highly recommend.
B000002O4X|5.0|I love this CD and probably all John Barry's collections.  These pieces always lift me to a great mood.  Highly recommend to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|more levels would make this even better. maybe consider the first movie too? waiting to see what else the creators add:)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|theme is captivating, husband innocent one hundren percent believable by 7th episode.  First of season also captures your interest and keeps you watching.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is so realistic and it is plain awesome you need to get it. No bugs or flats are in this game. And very easy to learn. Buy it!!!!
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Objectively speaking this is a bad film - subjectively speaking I had megatons of fun watching it! Below, all the reasons for which I think everybody should give \\"Pacific Rim\\" a try. WARNING - limited SPOILERS below.<br /><br />1. Cool giant robots. The four Jaegers (Gypsy Danger, Striker Eureka, Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon) are well done.<br /><br />2. Cool giant monsters. The kaijus we see in the film are very impressive and they also have cool names (although not all the names figure in the film itself): Trespasser (the first one), Scissure, Reckoner, Onibaba, Spinejackal, Bonesquid, Kojiyama, Hardship, Reckoner, Ceramander, Tentalus, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern (the last to appear), etc. etc.<br /><br />3. A magnificent absence of scenario. This is a very liberating experience, watching a film, which consists ENTIRELY in special effects and fights between giant monsters and giant robots.<br /><br />4. A splendid irrelevance of most actors. Again, this is sheer fun to watch a film in which almost all actors are completely redundant, as the scenario doesn't give them anything important to say or to do. You could safely replace Idris Elba with Britney Spears, Charlie Hunnam by a card-board, Max Martini by a bottle of XXXX, Robert Kazinsky by a brick and Clifton Collins by a cocker-spaniel - and nobody would notice! And that really is a great thing allowing us to focus on:<br /><br />- cool fights<br />- popcorn and soda<br />- making out with wife/girlfriend.<br /><br />5. A hot Oriental chick. Rinko Kikuchi is cute like a button and she is also very important for this film, because if it was not for her the suits worn by Jaeger pilots would not be so cool (it was important to show her shapes).<br /><br />6. The two utterly ridiculous and annoying scientists, Geiszler and Gottlieb, who act like a bickering old couple (I would not be surprised if they were one...) and provide most of the humour in the film.<br /><br />7. Ron Perlman's shoes. Now, Ron Perlman is not really allowed to play in this film, but his shoes - now, that, is a whole different enchilada! It is a most cruel and thanks God not so frequent occurrence that an actor is outstaged by his apparel - but when it happens, it is definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />8. The post-credits joke scene. Really good one - so wait a little before leaving the cinema or turning off the DVD player.<br /><br />9. The possibility to better understand the upcoming \\"Honest trailer\\" by Screen Junkies and especially the \\"Everything wrong with Pacific Rim\\" by Cinema Sins - in both cases I expect they will have the field day working on this film ... )))<br /><br />10. The possibility to invent new Jaegers. Here just a couple of possible candidates quickly gathered, mostly from the IMDB site: Panzer Angela (Germany) -best armoured, it would sing Wagner; Tropical Triad (Malaysia, Thailand, Singapour) - most agile, it would massage; Taekwon Victory (South Korea) - the jumpiest, it would kick @ss; Matador Fury (Mexico) - the most macho, it would wear a sombrero; Eager Beaver (Canada) - the most polished, it would give hugs...; Neutralium Interno (Switzerland) - the best armed, but it would not fight...; Holy Molly (Vatican City) - it would wear a tiara and offer last rites. As the possibilities are infinite, I expect this game to go on for some time on the web...)))<br /><br />11. The possibility to see alien invaders even more stupid than those in \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Battleship\\" - and that was a tall order to fill...)))<br /><br />12. Preparation for a possible sequel. Well, even if this film rather underperformed, the sequel, with possible appearance of Category 6 and 7 kaijus, could still be made. So let's get ready.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Objectively, not a good film, but great fun to watch nevertheless. And honestly, the box office and reviews (including mine) be darned - it gave me good time and when patiently waiting for the next \\"Godzilla\\" I will buy \\"Pacific Rim\\" on DVD as soon as available, to cheer me up during some long, cold winter evenings and encourage me to consume more Jaeger... I mean lager! Enjoy!ext \\"Godzilla\\" I will buy \\"Pacific Rim\\" on DVD as soon as available, to cheer me up during some long, cold winter evenings and encourage me to consume more Jaeger...

B001AQMBNC|5.0|Love the move , in perfect condition plays great<br />star Man is a Great movie, a continuation of the Voyager Satellite NASA sent our of our Solar system with a Gold record in many languages inviting intelligent life to visit Earth
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is unique and reminiscent of Safecracker. It's a puzzle game with no hidden object mini games. Please create more games like this one.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Fascinating subject matter but not an easy read. It is a very depressing book overall but gives us an unprecedented look into a country that is a real mystery for most of us.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game should be the new Angry Birds! It's a great and fun game for on the go, or at home. I'm glad I finally got some money to buy it. I'm &quot;Bagging It&quot; All day!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so cool I can play it all day...how bout you???!!!??.....ITS SOOOO COOOL!!!!....I just love it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book got me interested right away. Didn't take too long to hook me. Typical of these kinds of stories, characters are a bit shallow, but lovable and interesting. This story is even a little believable which makes it all the better.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|The movie was just ok. Not amazing but not terrible. Some entertaining parts. Had high hopes for James Franco as Oz buy don't feel like he nailed it
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it, but what i like must about it is that for the kindle fire you can see the weather at the status bar without having to open the app
0064471837|5.0|I read Sabriel for the first time in middle school and fell in love with it. More than a decade later, it remains my favorite book. Garth Nix has a magical ability to create new worlds, so different from our own but so beautiful, tangible, and exciting, that they feel like a home you can't wait to get back to. Sabriel is a powerful female character and one that I think all women, and men, can appreciate. Not a princess that steals a horse and runs off into the wilderness, not an orphan that grew up like a wild-child, but a real girl with real quirks, fears, and loneliness, who fights terrifying battles that nobody knows about, hears about, or thinks about. This book is about the importance of family, integrity, doing what it's right, and persevearance - four of my favorite things. Not only is it wonderful to read again and again... But the sequels are too. I highly recommend the entire series.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Funny game, maybe a bit short. Should at least have a bonus game for completing it. Very surprised to see the federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's face on one of the characters! Lol!
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Easy to listen to when you feel in the mood for good 'ol country music. Scotty's voice is great on this CD. Simple.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun horse care and competition game, but there is a lot of waiting to be able to have enough energy to do much of anything.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept my turning the pages non-stop! Ending through me off a little but I still think it is a great read!
145210655X|5.0|I thought this might be a story to read to kids. It is more of a coffee table reader. I do find it very amusing. It has good pictures and funny lines to go this Darth Vader trying to be a good father. I don't have any complaints about the product.
1781162646|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Joyland. \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\" really rings true for this book. I was expecting more of a mystery when I picked this one. While the murder mystery does play a part in the story, the focus is on the main character, Devin, and his development during his time at Joyland. It turned out to be a really good coming of age story.  My favorite King story is \\"The Body\\" aka \\"Stand By Me\\", so it's probably no surprise that I liked this book, too. It was a quick, easy read--really perfect for the beach.
B0000VCZKW|2.0|The movie was great. Loved it. This is called a special edition release? Why? For a DVD released in mid 2005, why is this movie in full screen format and not widescreen? That doesn't sound very special to me. If anything, they should have included both formats on the disc at this time. This DVD should be released in widescreen format. I do have the movie, but am not very happy with it
0307279189|5.0|Being a Adams State grad from the Joe Vigil years I enjoyed reading this book, Nice the way everything came together.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story starts out slow. I always finish a book I start I'm glad I did. Once you think you have it figured out it takes a turn. The book took me for a few loops when I thought I had it figured out. It's a page turning book you won't want to put down once it gets going.  You start to hate the character Nick and then your not so sure. I have never read a book quite like this. I read it for six hours straight today and finished it after a slow few weeks. I'm looking forward to the movie which I didn't know about until last week. I love reading books that become movies. Sounds cheesy I know.
B006PTL1QM|2.0|Great acting by Fassbender and Mortensen. As usual flat acting by Kiera Knightly.<br />Not impressed by the movie. Knightley is just her skinny self.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|Good gift for kids between age 3 to 6. You can mix and match the color you like for your kids. Worth the money.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Must have for all Tolkien/Lord of the Rings fans and collectors everywhere.<br />As good as the movie. And the movie is great
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|What a horrible movie. I don't know if the storyline or the writing was as bad as the acting because the acting was so bad put me to sleep before I could get an idea of the storyline. Hollywood has a ton of money to waste if they can afford to churn out nonsense like this.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I haven't got through the extras yet,  I bought it because the price was right and it has the THX setup tool. I'm anxious to watch again using the secret code which can found by reading some of the other reviews.
0307730700|5.0|Fearless is the true story of Navy Seal Adam Brown. When this book arrived at my house via the Blogging for Books program graciously sponsored by Multnomah Books, I had no idea of the trauma that was ahead.<br /><br />Outside of my typical reading choices, reluctantly I plowed in. Almost from the beginning, Eric Blehm had me. Fast paced, brutally honest, and rippling with tension, the author does a marvelous job. In fact, Blehm does such a great job; I encountered emotions not recently touched. At one point, I threw the book down on my desk and sobbed. This crying continued for several days as I refused to pick the book back up. Not my typical response to reading a book on theology or some Christian living principle, which is my normal staple.<br /><br />From the onset, I knew that Adam died, but I simply did not want to get to that point in the story. As the story unfolds, a bonding takes place between the reader and Adam. Perhaps that is too limited. The relationship is between the reader and the entire group of players in the book would be more accurate.<br /><br />One cannot read this book and not fall in love with Adam's wife, his children, his peers and this hero. Adam is presented with all of his warts exposed, yet you end up cheering for him as he overcomes obstacles that would derail most humans. Adam simply did not know the word quit. Neither did his wife Kelley.<br /><br />I knew the date that Adam died. As the book sped along towards that event, I grew in my apprehension. It was coming, and I couldn't do anything about it. All the troubles, heartaches, struggles, failures and victories would end soon and my anger grew. My mind raced to seeing Kelley and the children collapsing when receiving the news. The funeral. The words shared by Adam's peers. All made it very difficult to finish this book. It simply is hard to read when you can't see due to crying.<br /><br />I would challenge any man to read this book and not be moved. Eric Blehm does an outstanding job of honoring those that truly deserve it. While I don't necessarily like to encounter such emotional stress, once I picked up the thrown book and finished it, in some strange way, I felt fearless.<br /><br />Dr. Jeff Klickg job of honoring those that truly deserve it. While I don't necessarily like to encounter such emotional stress, once I picked up the thrown book and finished it, in some strange way, I felt fearless.<br /><br />Dr. Jeff Klick
0375703764|4.0|After completing House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski, I know that I will one day read it again. I have not read much ergodic literature and its use is interesting and infuriating in equal parts. It's the type of novel where pages are read, and then reviewed again, with care and attention to detail. Whether it's the changing typeface, alignment, or the hundreds of footnotes, House of Leaves is not a book one simply reads in a few sittings.<br /><br />Out of a desire to not spoil the book for others, I will summarize gently. This is a multilayered novel that uses a collection of documents, interviews, and theories to weave together a postmodern tapestry. To some, the novel is a love story, to others it's horrific, and for those not yet classified, it's castes a jocular eye upon literary criticism.<br /><br />On certain pages I wanted to rate the novel five stars, on other pages I wanted to sweep it into my trash bin. However, after completing it, I rate it four stars. It is definitely worth reading, and I will one day pick it up again. On its own, the book is an accomplishment that is worthy of review by people who appreciate literature and different ways we can be absorbed by a good story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It is the perfect blend of comic book nods, over the top action, and funny character moments. This box comes with a few more bonuses than your average blu-ray pack. It is a great deal.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book is really, really, good. It has confusing times in it. And everything wraps up together end. I recommend this book too any age group. If you do read this I suggest you pay attention to EVERY DETAIL. A smaller detail can be big in the end

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I started reading  this book  not knowing what to expect. I did the first experiment and got so excited when things started to happen.I couldn't wait for the next one.I have told anyone who would listen to what I was experiencing , and all were amazed.I recommended this book to everyone I talked to.Thank you Pam for reminding us of what we are really capable of achieving with our positive thoughts.Much love.<br />Alice Cunningham

B0087X728K|5.0|My laptop started to get loud so I decided to replace the thermal paste. Runs at least 5 degrees cooler during basic use and almost 10 degrees when using extensive programs. Fan doesn't turn on as much anymore as well. Great product.
