B000LXH0AE|5.0|I think this movie is brilliant. There are endearing characters and the \\"in the Head\\"  commentary is perfect for a fiction lover. I saw it at the theater and loved it so much I watch it on DVD as often as I can.

0060833459|5.0|Fantastic overview of the skills on which an executive should focus and how to acquire those skills.  I've been looking for something like this for quite a while.  Ranks with Good to Great and Tipping Point as one of my favorite books in the lst 5 years.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great little flash unit, particularly for the low price and small size. <br /> <br />I expected it to be a little underpowered, but I haven't noticed any lack. I use the unit mostly for bounce flash off ceilings and walls, and occasionally with a forward facing bounce card. The exposure is perfect every time with my Nikon D40, and it's so small I just leave it on the camera all the time. <br /> <br />The extra battery power also means I can crank off several shots in a row without having to wait for the capacitor to recharge. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, unless you need some of the higher-end features. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />Inexpensive <br />Light <br />Small <br />Great exposures <br />Uses AA batteries <br /> <br />Cons: <br />Head doesn't swivel left and right <br />Lacks remote-triggering <br />
B00030DEQE|5.0|I needed a network card for my Dell Dimension 4500 that works with Vista.  The INTEL PRO 1000 GT PCI filled the requirement.

I also still use Windows XP with the same fine results.  I would recommend this card to anyone needing a newer card for Vista.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It is unbelievable to me how many BAD reviews this album is getting. Anyone who has described this album as 3 or 4 \\"REAL\\" songs with a bunch of filler missed the boat! <br /> <br />The problem with music fans these days is that they want everything handed to them. They want their music delivered instantly, on-demand. So, they rush to iTunes and buy the songs they know from the radio. They miss all the artwork, and rarely hear the music in the correct context in which the artist intended. Now, if you are getting the latest regurgitated Nickelback single (yuck), there may be nothing wrong with this practice. <br /> <br />However, 10,000 days IS NOT an album you pick up, put in, and get instantly. There are no easy answers or explanations here. Tool are masters of their craft and don't rush themselves. Sure, Wings For Marie could have been condensed into a nice 5 minute radio friendly package, but that's not what music should be about.  <br /> <br />People who call themselves MUSIC FANS these days refuse to be patient with new music. If it doesn't catch them right away, it is garbage and not worthy. I will be the first to admit, when I heard 10,000 days the first time, I was really confused. There didn't seem to be a lot going on, but god was I wrong! I only realized this after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc... listens. Every time I play this record, I hear something different that makes it seem new and fresh. <br /> <br />BEFORE you trash this, or any other, record, GIVE IT A CHANCE. Take 79 minutes out of your busy life, put a pair of headphones on, and actually take the music in. Not all music reveals itself while you are rushing between work and the mall on a Friday night in your car. Sometimes you have to give it a chance and actually (god forbid) THINK for a little while before it grows on you.  <br /> <br />I would not recommend that 10,000 days be anyone's 1st Tool album, but anyone who calls themselves a music fan should experience this album. Before one more person posts a negative review of this album, I would ask of you to refrain until you have really given it a fair shake. It took the band 5 years to create it, it may take you more than 79 minutes to appreciate it.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Difficult to follow timeline, makes the plot seem erractic. The twist was a little weird. Lack of dialog was a disappointment, and didn't make use of the cast of good actors.
6303114946|3.0|I am longtime chess player who also grew up playing chess in the New York chess scene of the 70\\"s (as a youth).  I grew up playing in the streets of the \\"Time Square\\" area.  A black chess hustler by the name of Bobby Dee originated setting up chess tables on the streets.  Players would man the tables and challenge bystanders to a game.  He set-up outside of Nathan's on 42nd street.  He started this because he had been kicked out of the 42nd street Chess House.  This was the 1st time I met \\"Vinny\\" (played by a miscasted Laurence Fishburne in the film).  His name was Vincent Livermore and he was a preppie type.  They all called him Livermore.  He didn't have a bald head (in fact his hair was always neatly cut), and he always gave me the impression that he had just come from class.  Asa Hoffman (a white chess hustle miscasted in the film} was a highly respected master who was not the neurotic type portrayed in the film, but an accomplished master full of confidence.  He always stayed upstairs in the chess house because he had regular customers coming by.  Charley (who was Bobby Dee's brother-in-law)  worked in the area; and after work he also set up a single board in front of the building where he work (where the New Years Day ball comes down).  When Bobby Dee died of aids,(being very popular with hookers from 8th ave.), another Bobby (called sweetpea) started setting up.  The police never bothered Bobby Dee (as he was a well-known exboxer, and they knew him at the precinct).  After awhile Nathan's complained and Sweetpea mover around the corner to the outside of Bryant Park.  Those that set up (now) inside the park came much later and charged much more money to play.  Sweetpea continued to charged what Bobbie Dee had charged for the house (fifty cent for each 5 -15 min. game, and a dollar  for slow games).  What ever money you played for was between you and the play.  The flee market started setting up outside of Bryant Park also.  The chess playeers started getting harassed by the cops. Two of the one's playing for Sweetpea (a white fellow name Doug and another fellow) decided to set up in the Wall Street area. It was the other fellow's idea (a black guy whose name I've forgotten).  Sweetpea gave it up after awhle and started playing in Washington Square Park where \\"Vinny\\", and other chess hustlers made their headquarters.  \\"Vinny\\" was very popular, and white kids from the area got to be good friends with him.  He was a preppie with character (who could also be intimidating when playing masters or grandmasters).  It was well-known that he was gay.  He wasn't flamboyant (and no one ever brought it up), but he never hid the fact either.  He was openly gay in an environment where the issue only came up during his absence.  That's some of the histoy of the otherside of chess.  As for the movie; it's very good otherwise.  I've given you a view from the inside out.  \\"Vinny\\" later died of aids, but Sweetpea was still there, the last time I looked.  You see him in some of the park scenes (they use the park guys in the film).  The Russian master in the park who talks to himself (who Josh's mother pays a sum of money to play her son a game) was at some point taken to a care facility by some of the neightbors of the park.  In those days it was only beginning to look depressing (that's why I stop going there to play).  You can sight Sweetpea in the following park scene.  Josh is playing \\"Vinny\\" on one board while Sweetpea (in a blue sweater with light blue shirt collar) plays a white guy (in black leather coat).  Vinny is talking loud while playing Josh.  He saids \\"That's what I'm talking about...Make him run.  What can I do...?  By the way the guy who saids \\"A young fischer.\\" is none other than Josh's real life chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini making this comment to Ben Kingsley (who is portraying him in the film).  Enjoy. <br />
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural stormed onto the WB last season and was a rip roarin' thrill ride with amazing writing, mythology, and acting. With this second season, the series moved to it's new home on the CW, and the series continued to evolve and become even better and deeper. Season 2 of the series finds the Winchester Brothers continue to drive into a horrific tale every week, as well as trying to work out their own story arc, and to find that blasted yellow eyed demon. This year, we delve deeper into the characters of Sam and Dean, wonderfully played Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. There are deeper layers to both, and the series' work on character development this year is phenomenal. Both brothers go thru the ringer emotionally, mentally, and physically this year, and the show doesn't cheat or let them or anyone else off the hook. The year starts off with \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", a pick up where we left off with last season's cliffhanger. Are the boys okay?. The car?. Dad?. A more subtle, less showy premiere. \\"Everybody Loves A Clown\\" gets back into season 1 territory with a creepy clown going after parents. Real creepy stuff. Some of the best episodes have to do with the show's mythology. \\"Hunted\\" is one of the strongest eps of the show ever. \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" antes up the pot dealing with Sam and what the yellow eyes demon has in store for him. \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" is one of the most emotional shows with Dean getting a look at what life would be like if they weren't hunters. The two part finale, \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\", is rightfully titled. Amazing stuff. SN delivers two hysterical comedic episodes with \\"Tall Tales\\" and \\"Hollywood Babylon\\", the latter being stuffed with jokes, in-jokes, and Dean's nasty food habit. Other notable eps include \\"Croatoan\\", \\"Heart\\", and the great \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\". Linda Blair guest stars in \\"The Usual Suspects\\", a strong episode that brings to light what we've all probably wondered. How can they get away with these things and not get caught?. Creator/Producer Eric Kripke knows how to work the audience and to keep things real in an unrealistic word the Winchesters live in. Dean and Sam are who they are and their continuing development in this wonderful season progress naturaly. Both actors do some incredible work here, putting most other CW casts to shame. Any duds?. \\"Road Kill\\" was pretty standard, and I didn't care much for \\"Simon Said\\". Extras include JP's screen test, deleted scenes, gag reel, a featurette on the myths they use and a featurette on bringing an episode to life. With it's classic rock soundtrack, the impossible to ignore Dean Winchester, top notch horror writing and mythology, Supernatural continues to be the new supernatural/horror show to beat.
0385340559|3.0|This book has a good plot line going, and the action was pretty readable.  But isn't Reacher getting a little pretentious and boring, not to say patronizing?  Every time someone says one=third is 33 percent, Reacher has to interject \\"33.333333%.\\"  Who the hell cares?  And wouldn't he be fun to be around?  And how the four experts could have gone three days followed by a guy in a blue car without ever noticing him is beyond belief.  No, the earlier Reacher books were so much more believable than this, and Reacher was almost likable.  Not now.  Sorry.
015603283X|4.0|This is one book I would never have ordinarily picked up myself because I'm not really a fan of fictional writing. Even so, I liked the Ninth Gate movie so much I just had to read the book it was based on. I'm quite fortunate I saw the movie first, though. Otherwise, it would probably have been even more difficult to appreciate. Firstly, let me say that the movie follows the book quite closely but does a fine job of leaving out many unnecessary details and references to literature and history that permeate the novel. However, the movie also sacrifices some rather good conversation that takes place between certain characters. The book is definitely more descriptive than the movie and I would imagine doing it justice would take 4 hours of film.  <br /> <br />Still, there are times when the narrative gets too lengthy and confusing, as if the author is writing for his own enjoyment at the expense of his readers'. He also seems to have a thing for \\"impossibly young\\" tomboyish girls with green eyes. That description of one of the main characters was perhaps mentioned too often. Unfortunately, the book never quite explains who she really is anyway. <br /> <br />Corso's character is rather well adapted and in the movie, Johnny Depp plays him well. If you've seen the movie, you'll have no trouble picturing his character in the book. Some of the other characters look different and have meatier roles than portrayed in the movie. This is sometimes a good thing and sometimes not. There is enough humour in the book to keep the story interesting but the ending to me was somewhat anticlimactic. I always wondered what really happened at the end of the film and the book does not answer that question. In fact, I think the movie does it better.  <br /> <br />There is some sex in the book but nothing very steamy. Arturo spends a lot of time describing the fabulous bodies of some of the female characters to make up for that, though. A little too much, perhaps. I did not see the necessity. It's kind of like when an old man makes jokes about 'young people' and talks dirty in a seemingly harmless way. It's easy to dismiss it as harmless banter but it still sounds fishy. Anyway, the book does hold one big surprise that is not in the movie but I won't spoil it for you. Suffice to say the  movie deals with that 'problem' accordingly. <br /> <br />In summary, I would not vehemently recommend this book to anyone but might suggest those who really liked the movie to read it. On the other hand, those who have an above-average inclination to history and fictional literature (plenty of such references in the book) might get more out of it than I did. Having watched the movie and read the book, I'd like to think of myself as having reached the \\"tenth gate\\". There's nowhere left to go with this story.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Extroadinary Visual Presentation\\" of the world and all its glory. Beautiful views and unforgetable close ups of wild life without the make-up. The BBC Series took five years to put together and the dedication of the individual teams of film makers is what makes this presentation so breathtaking. You appreciate the patience and difficulties each team of film makers undertook when you view the \\"behind the scenes footage\\" at the end of each disc. Richard Attenborough's narrative is splendid. The clarity of his spoken word and tone completes the series. A Masterpiece.

B000EHRVP6|3.0|It's certainly interesting how some movies are advertised and presented.  When I bought this DVD on the front cover of it was written \\"the scariest American movie in a decade\\", on the back cover there was an introduction to the plot, in which it was claimed that 3 young men are lured into a trap in \\"Slovakia\\" by beautiful women.  Being an avid thriller fan I quickely opted for this movie.  <br /> <br />This one was written and directed by Eli Roth, who also, as I found out did \\"Cabin Fever\\" (a horror flick), this then only being his 2nd movie.   <br /> <br />As far as I was concerned, the first half of the movie was good, typical and promising.  Here you have perhaps a more serious version of something like \\"Euro Trip\\", meaning 3 horny Americans are traveling through Europe, searching for cheap sex, and drugs.  Actually, its 2 Americans that on their way through Europe meet Oli, who happens to be from Iceland (if I remember it correctly).  Knowning that there is absolutely nothing going on in a place like Iceland, Oli gladly joins our American Duo of horny boys, who plan to get laid as often as possible.  <br />While they continue their nihilistic journey of debauchery, they meet a rather strange middle aged man, with a german accent, on one of their train rides, while talking to them he tells them that there is this Hostel in Slovakia, where they have absolutely beautiful girls that are just crayz and willing to do anything for foreigners, especially if they are American.  Well, needless to say, the horney gang dosen't need any further encouragments, and the next thing you see is them heading for the town where the hostel is.  It is only here that the movie starts to change its mood, it becoming dark and there is a sense of impending danger which is conveyed briefly to the viewers.  It is also here, where the movie started to lose some of its appeal.  The torture scenes were really gory and heavy, at least for someone like me, who dosen't preferr the horror genre.Sure, someone who is totally into it, can claim that they were mild, ect.  But, for me, they were quite disturbing, yet far more disturbing is the fact that according to the makers of the film, they were supposed to be based on real life events.  Maybe its just me, but I for one, have my doubts about them, if only because I refuse to believe that people could be so cruel and inhuman to others.   <br /> <br />Well, in the end, this was alright, if you want to see a horror movie, that starts off during the first half, more like an adventure type of a film, that has a bit of road movie characteristics to it.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|When I bought this item, I though that it was going to be a DVD, however, when I played it, it was only a CD.  I do love the music but, it was not what I was looking for.  Is there a DVD available on \\"RUSH IN RIO\\"?  If so, I would really be interested.  Thank you!

B000F4LPJ6|2.0|Before you type out a retaliatory positive review- read on!<br /><br />I want to start off by saying I absolutely LOVE Battle Royale- It is most certainly on my list of favorite movies.  HOWEVER- this 'Director's Cut' is total garbage.<br /><br />Sadly, as with the case for many 'Special Edition' DVDs, Battle Royale: Director's Cut adds unnecessary footage that does nothing to enhance the film.  The end is extending by 8 minutes or so - and delves into a sort of epilogue and series of dream sequences.<br /><br />The Battle Royale wiki explains the changes here: (...)<br /><br />No attempt was made to clean up the subtitles: I can ignore misspellings and incorrect conjugations - however at one point the subtitles ran off the screen.  The subtitles in the added scenes were far worse than that of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I am not bashing Battle Royale; I want people to buy the regular version and forget that this Director's Cut is even an option.
0618680004|2.0|This book starts off great and it first appears that the reader is going to get an unbiased look at religion and belief in God and what results is a hateful, close-minded rant on people of faith filled with myriad contradictions.  Here goes...<br /><br />Contradictions and conspicuous ignorance by Dawkins in this book:<br /><br />- Dawkins says that aside from Kant, there is no moral absolutism outside of religion, but philosophy itself is motivated by the search for THE absolute (or ultimate cause)<br /><br />- Dawkins equates religious morality with people under martial law, but religious people don't see God as possibly being removed from the equation, so their view of morality is as constant as Dawkins'<br /><br />- Dawkins constantly uses modern morality to contrast Biblical morality, but fails to acknowledge the likelihood that modern morality isn't necessarily adequate for a stable society<br /><br />- Dawkins pins most conflict on religion, but without religion or God, people would still fight and kill (see Rwanda and Kosovo in the '90s, Darfur and Iraq now)<br /><br />- Claims there's an American Christian equivalent to the Taliban, yet I don't see him taking tea with the Afghan version<br /><br />- Dawkins' defense of Hitler and Stalin as atheist badguys can be applied to religious people who do bad things- bad people use religion to do bad things, but that doesn't make religion bad<br /><br />- Dawkins says there are no boundaries in evolution but that would mean there is nothing consequentially different between a cow and a human, but I assure you Dawkins wouldn't want to eat the latter<br /><br />- Dawkins makes a good point on faith, but fails to realize his own faith in science and doctors.  If he ever took a drug that he didn't work on himself, he had faith that the doctors' experience with the drug was valid and the doctors were telling him the truth (like religious faith)<br /><br />- Dawkins says children are too young to know what to think so we must protect their minds, but completely disregards the pro-life argument that works to protect even younger human life (if children are too young to decide for themselves, their nervous system hasn't been fully developed, thus putting them on the same scale as fetuses)<br /><br />- Dawkins says that happiness should be the goal in life, but doesn't realize that religion provides happiness to a lot of people<br /><br />And the mama jamma of them all:<br /><br />- Dawkins says there is no God, but to know that, he must know everything, thus making him the omniscient being that he denies and causing a paradox*.<br /><br />*He does note that he can't know everything and agrees that he's not an atheist, but an agnostic, which is what everyone is, anyway because we don't know everything, especially everything about the ultimate cause.tely disregards the pro-life argument that works to protect even younger human life (if children are too young to decide for themselves, their nervous system hasn't been fully developed, thus putting them on the same scale as fetuses) <br />- Dawkins says that happiness should be the goal in life, but doesn't realize that religion provides happiness to a lot of people <br /> <br />And the mama jamma of them all: <br /> <br />- Dawkins says there is no God, but to know that, he must know everything, thus making him the omniscient being that he denies and causing a paradox*.   <br /> <br />*He does note that he can't know everything and agrees that he's not an atheist, but an agnostic, which is what everyone is, anyway because we don't know everything, especially everything about the ultimate cause.

B000NVIGC0|4.0|You definitely need to listen to this CD 3 times for the greatness to sink in. It's stupid to dislike this because it's not Summer Teeth or whatever is your favorite Wilco. I have tons of Dylan, Neil Young & Beatles CD's for different moods, not just the 3 or 4 that everyone agrees are the best. The good news (for me) is this doesn't sound like The Eagles. Tweedy's voice has lowered in pitch and grown raspier, reminding me of the Jayhawk's drummer's singing. If you have Rainy Day Music, you know what I mean. There is a definite John Lennon solo influence, (and since Lennon was one of the greatest rock singers of all time, that is a good thing) and hints of the Grateful Dead at their tightest and most in tune. The new guitarist does some great stuff, especially when he holds back and sounds like a sports car in a traffic jam. This is music to listen to lying on your couch. Let it grow on you. You Are My Face, Impossible Germany, Side with the Seeds & Hate it Here are stand-out tracks and just plain good songwriting.

There are really no weak songs here.The Dark Eternal Night,Repentence and Prophets of War are just AMAZING!!!!!! Prophets of War is dazzling and my fave on the album...If you are new to Dream Theater,this should be a great one to start off with. You will be infected and only want more and more.Just an AMAZING bunch of musicians. Buy it now or regret it forever!!!!!!!!
1594489505|5.0|Many authors only have one story to tell.  The test of a truly great writer is his or her second work.  Hosseini has proved himself to be a great writer. After being enthralled by the KITE RUNNER which seemed to have some autobiographical aspects  I was concerned as to whether or not Hosseini could top his first work.  In my opinion he topped it and more.<br /><br />A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is a story of abuse and love.  It has universal themes about female abuse.<br /><br />It is a book that should not be missed.
B000002IST|4.0|Genesis's 1991 album We Can't Dance is one of the most memorable records released over the past 20 years. It was the first time Phil Collins collaborated with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford in nearly 6 years, and the last time he would ever record with them, that is up until their most recent reunion.  <br /> <br />We Can't Dance combines plenty of humor, as the title infers, great music, serious issues, and instant classics. The album features some of Genesis's best songs to date: No Son Of Mine, a song about family problems, the funny Jesus He Knows Me, a song about decieving evangelists, and I Can't Dance (both songs spawned equally funny and entertaining music videos), the warm ballads Hold On My Heart and Never A Time, the progressive Driving The Last Spike and Dreaming While You Sleep (both songs paying homage to Genesis's early back catalogue when Peter Gabriel was at the helm), and Tell Me Why, a typical Phil Collins song about world poverty. <br /> <br />Dance might not be as great as previous albums, but it is an outstanding collection of Genesis songs that any fan can't go without!  <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B+

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Creator and director Joss Whedon said in an interview that his first few books were historical accounts of the American West, and these reminded him of the Millenium Falcon, \\"Because, well, everything does!\\".  The TV series Firefly successfully melds the grity, homespun adventure of Louis Lamour with the high tech futuristic world of Star Wars. <br />The special effects are excellent, absolutley outstanding.  One of the reasons for the realism of the ships' set is that they actually built the whole ship as just two sets, one for each level.  This way they never lost track of where this bit should fit or where that passage leads. <br />While the actors chosen are relatively unknown, except for Ron Glass, they all deliver wonderfully real performances episode after episode.  Their characters reach out and grab you, making you care about them... even the ones you don't especially like. <br />The dialogue flows naturally, never seems forced or corny.  And I love the humor.  It's not a comedy, but there are times, usually when you least expect it, that you will burst out laughing. <br />This is one of the few TV series that I will be watching over and over and over again.  It is such a shame that FOX saw fit to cancel it after just one season. <br />Also be sure to look into the follow-up movie, Serenity; they make a great set.

Never have so many people <br />through out the world been so ignorant of the evil activities of a nations leader for so long a period of time.  Mao, the man, makes Hitler and Stalin look like sunday school teachers by comparison.  Mao trained Pol Pot with the same ideas for the destruction of modern civilization that he forced on China.

The characters are real, not cardboard, the action is fast the special effects are seamless and the story continues the amazing work of Josh Wheaton in the FireFly series (He also created Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel).<br /><br />While the movie stands on it's own, I reccommend viewing the series first.  Serenity makes a fine cap to the series.  It doesn't close all the doors, but it doesn't leave you dangling in the wind either.  Very well done.

B00005JPAO|5.0|There are several themes to this excellent and most original and interesting film; but what it is about more than anything else is how political regimes and whole dynasties can be undone on account of a single error of judgment. It is only near the end that Her Majesty warns her prime minister that this will happen to him, and happen suddenly and without warning. It had nearly happened to her, he had been the saving of her on this occasion, and her dire prediction for him probably holds an uneasy message for herself too.<br /><br />At the start the Queen is full of regal self-assurance, neatly putting her boyish and slightly nervous novice of a prime minister in his place by telling him he is sitting where Churchill once sat. In next to no time the positions are reversed, as Blair's acute political antennae tell him that HM is in imminent danger of losing her subjects' allegiance, something that would have been unimaginable only days previously, through trusting her own judgment and listening to the advice of her husband and her mother in respect of how to react to the death of Princess Diana. Throughout the crisis Blair is adroit and sure-footed, the monarch is made to realise bitterly from the newspapers how he has it right and she has been hopelessly at sea, but unlike her family counsellors she has the wit to swallow her pride and retrieve the situation before it slides beyond retrieval. This one incident could have undone a lifetime of unswerving dedication, universally acknowledged, to her country, and put the skids under the House of Windsor itself. Her warning to Blair is really made from a new sense of respect and a shocked realisation of how quickly and brutally the tables can turn. And how right she has been. This film does not make the matter explicit, but any viewer can sense the irony of Blair's own political fate. For years he seemed unable to put a foot wrong as far as the public were concerned, his luck was near-incredible (and his political nous was enormously greater than Churchill's); and then he blew it all with one foolish and ill-considered assertion in the Commons about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Just one mistake, when one is not sensing danger, is enough.<br /><br />The depiction of the main players is brilliant, and I found it fascinating to guess just how accurate it may be. Leaks, rumours, gossip and memoirs certainly descend on the public these days like leaves in Vallombrosa, giving us some shaky basis for forming a judgment. In the nature of the case a prime minister has to make himself (or herself) familiar to a rightly suspicious electorate, but a monarch should always retain some mystique, and the other dramatis personae, even the heir to the throne, are only intermittently in the limelight. Inevitably and rightly the film's characterisation is creative, but it is coherent and convincing provided one does not mistake it for portraiture from life. The acting has been widely praised and I concur entirely. The atmosphere is beautifully touched in too, from the family life of the Blairs (and the Windsors) to the blokeish informality of the New Labour apparatchiks in Downing Street and above all the hushed flunkeyish reverence accorded to the Queen, cocooning her in the chrysalis that nearly devoured her.<br /><br />I hope there is no possibility of a sequel, as a masterpiece like this should be left unique. Within days now Her Britannic Majesty will be welcoming a new prime minister whom she probably suspects of being a closet republican, as I suspect he is too. I shall be watching out all the same for one thing that this film says clearly through the lips of Cherie Blair, something to the effect that all Labour prime ministers finish up devoted to the Queen. Maybe it will be the same story with Brown, but I wonder how matters will stand once the monarch is no longer Elizabeth II. When that becomes the case the story of Princess Diana is likely to open a new chapter.ously greater than Churchill's); and then he blew it all with one foolish and ill-considered assertion in the Commons about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

I will always buy,a few may disappoint over the years,not RUSH, To come out with a great piece of work like Snakes & Arrows 30 years into their career is so awesome.The best 3 piece rock unit in history is intact and tight and Neil Pearts lyrics will have you discovering a new idea or thought with each listen...yes this grows on you with songs of social injustice wars and a real classic aimed at people who judge those who dont hold the majoritys religious beliefs (Faithless).I Love this!!

1594489505|5.0|I have seldom been so moved by a book. This book is political, it is personal, it is historical, it is present-day. <br />Women are the protagonists in this book. Women are the victims in this book. Women are the heroines in this book. <br />Afghanistan and its history are clearly depicted. Because of the role of the United States in Afghanistan, it is imperative that Americans be aware of what has gone on in that country. News headlines recently told of the murder of a woman radio host and schoolmistress, Zakiyah Zaki, who took eight bullets in front of her 8-year-old son. There are active forces there who want to silence the voices of strong women. <br />This book, by the author of \\"The Kite Runner\\", is a powerful book.
1582701709|1.0|the ideas presented in this book were disappointing....it's just common sense that people have known for centuries....where do you think we get all the sayings like seeing the glass half full etc.  It's always been known that it's better to be positive about things, but this book has made millions of dollars by trying to label this concept with a catchy name.  Yes they \\"scientifically\\" backed it going on and on about wavelengths and thoughts, but i don't buy it.  They are ridiculous. <br /> <br />the thing that is most annoying though is how everyone goes on and on about how amazing and life changing the book is.  I agree that maybe this book has simply presented classic information in a better way than it has been in the past, but it doesn't deserve all the publicity and \\"this book is life changing\\" stuff.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|Zodiac is Fincher's most mature work to date. Whilst I enjoyed Se7en and Fight Club, they were a little showy--daring, but striving to be different. Zodiac is a more classical type of work; it's simply told, and Fincher lets the case draw the reader in rather than relying on effects. He draws two excellent performances from Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal. I can see why some critics think Downey is the best actor of his generation; his performance here is so real it's unnerving. Presumably drawing on his own addictions, Downey makes his character raw, and watching the performance is a moving experience. Gyllenhaal takes on the kind of role that Michael J. Fox did in Casualties of War--a kind of observer role (at least for a lot of the film). It's easy to overlook this kind of performance--it's super subtle and finely tuned. Fincher has never made a film this good, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.
B00005JPQP|4.0|Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the cool bunch are at it again. This time, in OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, it's even more personal as one of their own is unceremoniously victimized which results in his suffering a near fatal stroke. One of Ocean's elder partners in crime, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), against the advice of his friends, decides to go into a business venture with Willie Bank (Al Pacino, in very good form) as they build a new hotel in Las Vegas, called the Midas. Willie Bank has the rep for being two-faced and for pulling the rug out of his partners, but Reuben discounts it. This is a humongous mistake as Reuben is abruptly forced out of the partnership, and, to add insult to injury, the name of the hotel is changed from the Midas to the Bank. Soon, Ocean and the gang congregate in the hospital around Reuben's comatose figure and decide to get payback for the man. Six months later, the con to break the Bank begins.<br /><br />Watching this film series is like thumbing thru an issue of People Magazine or the Hollywood Reporter, there's so many stars to gawk at. Given, the love interests, Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, are regrettably absent because, as Ocean puts it, \\"It's not their fight.\\" So, not much chance for a proper romance in this one, although Linus gets a half-hearted crack at it. But everyone else is back. The cast chemistry is still very much intact, especially between Clooney and Pitt, who've kind of become soul mates or something. Andy Garcia also returns as the reptilian Terry Benedict, who apparently has a beef against Willie Bank, and the actor makes the most of what is effectively an extended cameo. Matt Damon's Linus, still seeking the approval of basically everyone around him, gets a larger part in the con this time. The great Don Cheadle, again with the Cockney accent, and Ellen Barkin, she of the unconventional sexy looks, are both not used enough. And the bad guy? Well, everyone knows that a movie greatly benefits from a credible and worthy antagonist, and when this antagonist dares to put down Frank Sinatra, the deity of Las Vegas, well, then, you just know it's merely a matter of time before this guy enters a dimension of unmitigated misery and comeuppance. Accordingly, Al Pacino comes in full ruthless businessman regalia and delivers yet another strong and hissable performance. Meanwhie, character actor David Paymer is endlessly amusing as the pranked-upon hotel V.U.P. (Very Unimportant Person). Poor dude.<br /><br />Let's hearken back a bit. I absolutely loved the OCEAN'S ELEVEN remake, which I thought vastly improved on Sinatra and his rat pack's original. I even enjoyed OCEAN'S TWELVE, despite its rambling narrative and self-congratulatory reek. OCEAN'S THIRTEEN isn't as good as ELEVEN but is better and more focused than TWELVE. This isn't a bonafide thriller, of course, there's no real sense of jeopardy here. You know there'll be close scrapes but, no worries, everything'll come up roses for the good guys and go snake eyes for the villains. Director Steven Soderbergh again keeps the tone playful and breezy, the film propelled by hip, ritzy music and a plot that's constantly on the move. Yes, the movie ventures down a predictable and well traveled avenue, but enough plot complications are woven in that it remains interesting. As usual, the meticulously planned out scheme doesn't perfectly play out (it never does), and Ocean, Rusty, et al. must resolve upcropping obstacles on the fly: A Mexican factory which manufactures casino dice goes on strike (fomented, ironically, by one of the 13); the crew runs short of finances and must resort to enlisting the loathed Terry Benedict, who then demands that an impregnably guarded cache of diamonds be pilfered; and there's even a callback to a character in the first sequel. However, the most problematic dilemma may well be the artificial intelligence which is housed in Willie Bank's security system.<br /><br />I don't think we'll ever see the likes of Jack Black or Jon Heder as members of this sexy and glamourous crew. Clooney, Pitt, and Damon all belong to Hollywood's sleek and beautiful in-crowd, and OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, like the prior two films, exudes a pervading sense of \\"Hey, look at all of us looking pretty and being cool here.\\" Affecting nonchalant poses, delivering lines with off-the-cuff verve, and engaging in celebrity inside jokes - there's a lot of that going around in the film. The sense of elbow nudging fun is very much alive as we see Matt Damon sporting a proboscis and attempting to down a drink, Clooney derisively rolling his eyes at Garcia (we've all seen the trailer), and Clooney and Pitt viewing an Oprah episode with moist eyes. I also liked Ocean's eventual revenge on/pay off to Terry Benedict. This series, when boiled to its essence, is just a bunch of boys (and girls) hanging out, goofing around, and enjoying each other's company. But, unlike TWELVE, I'm glad to note that the actors seem more invested into the story here, perhaps because, this time, there actually is a story. So, despite that feeling of having seen all this before, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN is eminently watchable and rates 2 snake eyes from me.>I don't think we'll ever see the likes of Jack Black or Jon Heder as members of this sexy and glamourous crew.

B00000DOZ7|4.0|This is the album that I start my collection with, as it's basicly the first to feature the Yes sound that made them famous and a hit.  They were floundering at the time that their previous album, Time And A Word came out, having little comercial success.  Atlantic was ready to pull the plug if they didn't chart on their next try.  Out goes guitarist Peter Banks, and in comes Steve Howe.  Just one of a seemingly infinit number of personnel changes during the group's 36+ years.  His insertion brought the entire band together as a unit, getting each player to step up and bring their best to the effort.  Even Anderson's vocals are more dynamic here, as well as Squire's bass, bringing everything up into another register.  Bruford's drumming actually changes also, his snare reaching the same hights as Squire's bass and consistently reaching higher.<br /><br />This is where you want to start if you're new to Yes, as their earlier product is not up to par.  I would only go into their first two tries after listening to many of their other albums, and only so you can say you had.
B00005JPKE|3.0|the second part of clint eastwoods paean to the legendary ww2 battle came out to intense praise from critics last year, and while its a perfectly good war movie, im at a loss to understand where its supposed to be great.  is it that this tells the tale from the \\"enemy\\" point of view?  well, i can go back as far as \\"all quiet on the western front\\" at least for a similar concept.  yes, war is horrid and the enemy is not so very different from us: i have seen it before.  good battle sequences, good acting, good movie -- but a masterpiece?  no. <br />
B00006AVRK|5.0|The Jeeves and Bertie stories are the funniest things written in the English language.  Impossible to do them full justice on television, but this adaptation is as good as possible.  <br />  <br />EXCEPT they cry out to be Closed Captioned.

B000BB1MI2|3.0|yet another collaboration twixt tim burton and johnny depp produces what will forever be deemed a remake of the gene wilder \\"willie wonka\\" of a generation earlier.  this time around the movie is darker, and i will leave it for the individual viewer to decide which take you prefer.  me?  i tend to think both movies are a bit overdone, tho i find both entertaining on their own levels.  and the added attraction here is the presence of freddie highmore, a talented and pulchritudinous young actor who makes anything worth seeing. <br />

B000O174CM|3.0|this was supposed to be the movie that made people go see movie musicals again.  guess what?  it didnt.  its not a bad movie.  its even sorta a good movie.  but its flat.  it never made me want to get up & applaud, and i felt manipulated when i did enjoy myself.  yes, jennifer hudson IS wonderful, but \\"i am telling you i am not going\\" has become as much a cliche as any rodgers & hammerstein song, without being half as good; beyonce demonstrates the acting range of diana ross, and i am telling you that is not a compliment; and the unjustly hyped eddie murphy gives a performance to rival tony bennett as hymie kelly in \\"the oscar\\".  \\"dreamgirls\\" on stage was the triumph of director michael beennett, and not its writing team; while this is not the insult to bennetts memory that \\"a chorus line\\" is, it sure doesnt make THIS lover of both broadway & hollywood musicals want to tap his troubles away.

0061122416|2.0|I'm sure I'll catch a lot of flack for this, but I don't think \\"The Alchemist\\" lives up to all the hype surrounding it. The story revolves around Santiago, a young shepherd boy who decides to leave his flock behind and journey to the Pyramids, where he hopes to find his \\"treasure.\\" Along the way, Santiago encounters a variety of colorful characters, including gypsies, kings, warriors, and an alchemist who warns Santiago not to give up on his dream.<br /><br />This book is a parable, which is why it was kind of lost on me. (I'm not a big fan of parables...they generate unpleasant flashbacks of my Sunday School days.) The moral of the story is a good one: never give up on your dreams, your life is what you make of it, blah blah blah. I can appreciate the writer's simple yet effective prose, and while some people may be inspired by Santiago's tale, I really didn't think it was all that insightful. The whole \\"follow your dreams\\" concept has been around for a long time, and \\"The Alchemist\\" doesn't take that idea to a new or remarkable level.<br /><br />Yes, I'm being incredibly cynical, but so be it. If you're a cynic like me, don't waste your time with this book. However, if you're into all that touchy-feely, Oprah-esque stuff, I'm sure you'll enjoy \\"The Alchemist.\\"
B000E1MTZE|5.0|All I can say is that this movie was made for HD. Once you take a look at the Matrix in HD...you'll see what I mean. The picture and sound is incredible! movies like this is what HD is all about. I have no doubt that HD will win over Blu Ray because of quality titles like this. Once the price of HD movies come down(and they will...the average price on amazon is around 19.00...not too bad)it will be only a matter of time before standard DVD's will be a thing of the past...especially since HDTV's are now taking over the market.

He is one of few celebrities I would actually like to hang out with.  He is a charming man who is both worldly and wise from experience and honest by conviction.  His descriptions of food are tempting and colorful.  I've never even been slightly curious about what a fish head tastes like until I read about his meal at an out of the way kitchen during his visit to Japan.<br />  I don't understand why this man works at one of the least thought about, most difficult, and most underpaid professions in this country unless it is truly his gift.

0374105235|3.0|This was a good book but I would have preferred if it had been produced as fiction rather than nonfiction, or maybe I just wish it had been written better. It was a pretty dry read in many places. The story is intense and the boy sweet. I could definately empathize with the boy for doing what he needed to to survive. I especially liked how he described how his feelings manifested physically. The writing was obviously influenced by an editor, which took away from the story for me. The book definately serves its purpose, to enlighten us about the plight of child soldiers, but it could have been written better.
1400032717|3.0|this book is: exceedingly clever. easy and fun.  <br /> <br />this book is not: compelling. i like the character enough to remain interested, but not enough to care about the pervasive sadness in his life.  <br /> <br />i would suggest this book to people who are interested in seeing how haddon alludes to autism in every facet of the book, but otherwise, it's probably an individual hit or miss.  <br />
0671027387|4.0|ISBN 0671027387 - Living up to The DaVinci Code might be the hardest thing Dan Brown has to do.  Although he comes close with Deception Point, he just misses the mark.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton works for the NRO and, indirectly, for the president of the United States.  Her father is running for the presidency, putting her in a somewhat awkward position - and it's about to get far more awkward.  President Herney needs her help in announcing the find of a lifetime.  NASA has discovered a meteorite in ice in the Arctic.  The amazing part is that the meteorite contains fossils of creatures never before seen on Earth which, NASA and civilian scientists conclude, must be evidence of life in space.  The timing couldn't be better, because Senator Sexton has been attacking US spending on NASA.<br /><br />Over the course of one very long day, Rachel and her new friends, scientist Corky Marlinson and TV personality Mike Tolland, discover an astonishing cover-up that could reach all the way to the White House.  Getting that information out to the President and the world turns into a tremendous task as they run for their lives, not knowing for certain who is chasing them.  One thing is for sure - someone wants them dead before they spill the beans.<br /><br />A good number of characters are not at all who they seem to be, a nice plot device authors use to obscure the identity of the real \\"bad guys\\".  Unfortunately, Brown overuses it in this book, to the point that you just begin to assume that everyone is the exact opposite of who they seem to be, and you wouldn't be far off.  If you're willing to accept all the science in the book as real, you'll still have a hard time accepting that Rachel, Mike and Corky take on the elite trained killers of the Delta Force, more than once, and live to tell the tale.  Either they're really poorly trained elite killers or it's just a bit ridiculous.  Still, Deception Point is a nice, easy read that'll entertain without straining your brain.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This is a great film, but I'm not going to go into the writing, acting, or directing, here - I like to rate the quality of the video, audio and extras when it comes to Blu-ray, because I think that's what people want to know - they can get all that other info off of a movie rating site.<br /><br />So how is the quality - in a word: FANTASTIC! The video quality is awesome, as only Blu-ray can provide, and the sound is captivating. I've heard people complaining about the transfer of this film and I disagree. The \\"washed out\\" or \\"grainy\\" look people are complaining about has nothing to do with the transfer - it's just how the movie is supposed to look. The washed out affect is there to reflect the mind of the killer, and how he sees things.<br /><br />Another great bd to add to your collection. I highly recommend it.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|This movie is a classic, and I can confidently say that when I watched it on blu-ray for the first time, it was like really seeing the movie for the first time - like all the other times their had been a blur filter between me and the movie and now, viewing it on blu-ray, that blur filter had been removed.<br /><br />This should definately be a part of your collection, if for nothing else, just the quality of the video transfer demands it. Not to mention that it's an awesome movie!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine was an excellent film, and I recommend it. The story is about a family of misfits who band together to take a quixotic journey in a yellow VW bus with no clutch, and a horn that is stuck in the honk position. On this journey they learn the importance of love, and family. That would be such a clich&eacute;, were it not so artfully executed. One of the scenes revolves around color blindness, and that seems an apt metaphor for the blind spots otherwise intelligent people can have when it comes to seeing their own needs to love and be loved.<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Frank Ginsberg, who is the nation's foremost Proust scholar. He has just attempted suicide because his rival, Larry Sugarman, the #2 Proust scholar, has stolen the young male graduate student he was in love with, he was fired from his teaching position, and Sugarman has just published a bestseller on Proust, and their ad campaign is calling Sugarman THE foremost Proust scholar. At the time this was made, Carell was not a hot commodity. Robin Williams or Bill Murray were considered for the part, but they couldn't afford them. The producers complained that Carell did not have enough star power to energize the film--but in the short year since, he starred in a hit movie, The 40-Year Old Virgin, as well as starring in a hit comedy series, The Office, for which he received an Emmy. He also appeared in Will Ferrell's Anchorman, but the character he played--a mentally challenged weatherman--gave no indication of the range he would display in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />The perfect storm of success changed their minds, and Carell was called upon to promote the film. In fact, I just watched a little promotional clip on Amazon where he is actually interviewing himself, and both Carells do an excellent, though tongues firmly in cheeks, job of it. He is very adept at playing a gay intellectual, and shines particularly in his interactions with Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear), Grampa Hoover (Alan Arkin), Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), and Dwayne (Paul Dano).<br /><br />Greg Kinnear plays a wannabe Tony Robbins, with a 9-Step program. He is cast well here. His boyish good looks serve him well, as they did in As Good As It Gets, but as they worked against him in Auto Focus, where he failed to play a convincing Bob Crane due to acute cuteness. Kinnear looks to be as shallow as Pat Sajak, but then when things don't go his way, he proves to be a veritable Alex Trebek, as he conveys a much more complex individual. He spouts clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, about the difference between winners and losers, and how he won't give up, but inside, he is crumbling. He is easily the least sympathetic character, just by his annoying perkiness, and that is quite an achievement when you are running against an angst ridden teenage nihilist who has taken a vow of silence, a pretentious homosexual suicidally depressed Proust scholar, and a foul mouthed dirty old man, who was kicked out of the retirement home for snorting heroin. However, by the end of the movie, even Richard is a candidate for redemption. His best line might have been spoken as they drove on with an incessantly honking horn and a corpse in the trunk, still desperately trying to get young Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant: \\"Oh my God, I'm getting pulled over. Everyone, just... pretend to be normal.\\"<br /><br />Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor, and though he only appears in the first half, his presence is felt throughout, and he thoroughly deserves his Oscar for this performance. He is foul mouthed, lascivious, and in our first encounter, he is shown snorting heroin (actually it was crushed up vitamin B12 tablets). He would seem to be an unlikely target of sympathy, but beneath that rough exterior beats a heart of gold.<br /><br />The earliest movie review I remember reading was for a film called Popi which starred Arkin. In it he plays Abraham, a Puerto Rican single father in Brooklyn who wants a better life for his two boys, so he contrives to pass them off as Cuban refugees. This was in 1969, long before the Elian Gonzales incident. \\"Better to drown in the ocean than in the sewer\\" was the tagline. What I remember from the film review was that they accused the director of \\"doing the kids dirt\\" by trying to manipulate the audience with their cuteness. I knew exactly what he meant, because there were these long montage scenes set to music of the kids cavorting and frolicking through a graveyard, acting so cute you wanted to puke.<br /><br />The directors of Little Miss Sunshine do not fall into this trap. Abigail Breslin plays a young beauty contestant hopeful. She is the Little Miss Sunshine of the title, but though you might think it is meant to be ironic and sarcastic, she is a hopeful ray of sunshine, without ever going too far into the excessive cuteness mode. For being in such a dysfunctional family, she is remarkably well adjusted, and though naïve about many things, she seems to have an emotional wisdom beyond her years.<br /><br />Abigail wore a fat suit, and is in marked contrast to the actual child beauty pageant contestants tapped to play themselves, essentially, in the film. They used their actual costumes and routines, exactly as they would in competition. She wears glasses, and good use some dental work. But you keep hoping that her routine will hit a grand slam, but that possibility is remote considering her act was choregraphed by her recently deceased Grampa (Alan Arkin, in an Oscar winning supporting role). When you hear the music he chose, Rick James' Super Freak, you know her chances of an upset victory are nil.<br /><br />Also adept at avoiding the too-cute trap was Paul Dano as Dwayne, the teenager from a previous marriage who follows the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche, has taken a vow of silence, dreams of being a jet pilot, and hates everyone, as he writes in a notepad. When Frank asks if his hatred includes his family, he underlines Everyone, for emphasis. He reluctantly agrees to go on the journey, when Sheryl, his mother, says if he does, she will pay for his flight school. He writes, OK, but I. won't. have. any. fun. This whole shtick of writing in the pad could get annoying, but actually is handled very well, as a great running gag. Key moments of his character's transformation or turns of plot are conveyed very skillfully with this device. His acting is none too shabby, either. At first he wears a t-shirt with the face of Big Brother, from George Orwell's 1984. Later his t-shirt bears the slogan: Jesus Was Wrong. Somewhere along the journey he goes through a subtle metamorphosis, and emerges as empathetic and sympathetic, while still avoiding the too-cute trap.<br /><br />Toni Collette plays Sheryl, the wife of Richard, daughter-in-law of Grampa, the sister of Frank, the mother of Olive, and the mother from a previous marriage to Dwayne. It was a very strong ensemble cast, and she was the glue that held the dysfunctional family together.<br /><br />The movie was a hit at Sundance, where it was picked up for about ten million dollars. It took a long time to make, about 5 years, due to difficulties getting financing. It was the proverbial \\"Little Movie That Could.\\" The struggle to get this movie made would seem to parallel the struggle that Richard goes through to get his self help 9-step program book published. But in the movie's case, there was a much better outcome.<br /><br />Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris made The Smashing Pumpkins video for the song, 1979.

B000HEZF0O|5.0|This was the first thing I bought to play on my Blu-ray player. Over 20 movies later, and it still holds up. You haven't seen these movies until you see them on Blu-ray - it's as simple as that.
0374105235|4.0|This book is very eye opening. It humanizes the in-human boy solders. Prior to this book I had a preconceived idea of what a child soldier was and it was easy to detest them. Now that I have read this book I have a changed my view on the whole child soldier epidemic. I now see them as victims in a heinous situation instead of a further cause in the heinous situation. <br /> <br />This book takes you through a journey that covers not only different geographic locations but also a full range of emotional changes of the author. This book is very easy to read and follow. I am only a social reader and this book only took me a week to finish from cover to cover.  <br />
B000MQC9H4|4.0|A uniquely original comedy about people needing to step out and transform their lives.  Great Date movie however lacks genuine emotion which limits the overall realness of the movie.  I recommend for an easy watch film with a decent feel good ending.  It also has great background music throughout, just something else to listen for when watching
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Picture quality is very good. Sound is very good. Camera angles are \\"ok\\" as there is no camera on stage or right in front. Camera is mostly doing long shots of Ritchie. Rtiche seems a bit tired in terms of his playing. He was jailed for a few nights and only got out minutes before this show. The show was delayed till 11:30 at night as a result. Cozy is awesome, Dio is amazing! David Stone is the worst Rainbow keyboardist ever. His solo is a HUGE YAWN! You wanna know who and what is REALLY boring? How about the Colin Hart interview!! Just about anyone would be more articulate and interesting. Missed opportunity with that interview! Having said all that it's still 5 stars...Be glad this is available and in comparison to some of the other releases by ROCKPALAST is great.! Buy this DVD..dont even think about it, unless you are confused like this other reviewer from Jersey!
630514415X|4.0|I actually caught this on television when I was flipping channels one day. I didn't even plan on sticking around but this movie kept me watching. The reason why I didn't give it a chance in the theater was because I was growing weary of Spike Lee's style of film making. I thought I'd give it a break and I didn't know anyone else who actually saw this to endorse it. Watching it on tv meant that it was censored so I rented the original version and liked it even more. Denzel is awesome as usual, but the story itself and the trials of the main characters were thought-provoking and interesting. I know a lot of fathers like the one in this film who pushed their child hard. The son ended up living up to his potential so I guess it felt justified. I would've liked this film even if was a sport I didn't like. This is definitely worth a look.

B000J4QWMC|5.0|This was a well told story here, taken from numerous episodes of my favorite TV show of all time, the original MIAMI VICE. Most people do not know that Hollywood had no plans to do VICE. Lobbying by EDWARD JAMES OLMOS is what brought the project to fruition. It was indeed a good movie, but I really do miss DON JOHNSON, PHILLIP MICHAEL THOMAS, EDWARD JAMES OLMOS,MICHAEL TALBOT,JOHN DIEHL,OLIVIA BROWN and SANDRA SANTIAGO. Why did not the director, MICHAEL MANN include Olmos in the flick? I don't know. What I do know is that I enjoyed the TV series immensely and the movie was good and well told.

Channeling the human subconsciousness of our evolving destruction of planet earth and the onward calling for humanity to peer into the darkness and see a vision beyond American Idol TV. Fully powerful, Imaginative, and soulful this album is a masterpiece for those seeking resonance to their silent heartfelt cries on humanity, government, and Orwellian agenda unfolding right beneath our feet. Listen closely because this is a soundtrack to our very lives.....

0440241030|4.0|Like most of the \\"kick butt and take names\\" heroes of books and movies, Jack Reacher, protagonist in The Hard Way, is representative of the typical masculine fantasy (think Mark Wahlberg in Shooter.....or maybe Bruce Willis on steroids). That is not to say that Reacher would not be a welcome visitor to some women's fantasies, because I'm sure he would.<br /><br />An ex-military MP, with powers of observation few mortals possess, Reacher is a \\"will-o-the-wisp\\" with no particular place he calls home.  In this episode, his temporary \\"home\\" is New York City, and Lee Child does an outstanding job of capturing the atmosphere of the city as well as the character of the man.<br /><br />Reacher is a man who seems to \\"fall\\" into situations by chance rather than by design.  This particular fall has him embroiled in the search and rescue of two kidnapping victims.  Watching his thought processes as he come to wrong conclusions, retraces his steps and adjusts his conclusions is fascinating.  Some of his solutions are downright brutal, but then again justice must be served and he is ready to do whatever it takes to get the job done....even if it means doing it \\"The Hard Way\\".
0786869143|3.0|If you want to read a book that would increase your luck in casinos or lotteries, please give this one a pass. However, if you want some reinforcements for your positive thinking and doing, it's readable. Personally I agree with the power of positive thinking and doing. My reservation about this book, as you can sense it, primarily comes from the illogical and unscientific research methodology the author adopted to prove the luck principles he himself brought forward, not to mention that the principles in themselves are quite broken and ill defined. In short, acceptable for leisure reading on psychology, but definitely not to be treated as a work of serious science.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Despite what debunkers may say about this film, you cannot deny that it was very well done.  As someone who has seen first-hand the side effects that global pollution can do and is doing to humanity, I have no problem whatsoever in believing the evidence that Al Gore laid out in this film.  I have always been very environmentally savvy, even as a small child, and of course I have done much research on my own, and looked at much of the evidence, even that collected by Gore's biggest opponents.<br /><br />Another wonderful thing I loved about this DVD was the packaging.  Gore definitely put his money where his mouth was in that regard as well.  Ultra thin, with minimum packaging, makes cleanup from the unwrapping that much easier.  Gore has even added a little something extra to encourage recycling, by encouraging you to \\"pass on\\" the DVD, so as to minimize the amount of pollution the extra waste (though minimal) would cause!  I thought this was a very nice, personal, not to mention perfect, touch to an already amazing film.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how Mr. Gore put everything in terms that an average layman could understand, using his well-honed southern charm and sardonic wit...as a private citizen, he has been able to do much more public service with this film alone, than he had ever been able to do, or could ever do, as a politician.<br /><br />This is a perfect addition to any dvd library, along with \\"Who Killed the Electric Car\\".

B000Q6GUTI|2.0|I thought that the action on this movie was fair but the story line was boring, slow developing and predictable.
0060832819|3.0|At the beginning it seems you are up to another great Coelho's novel, but then cohesion is lost, and so are we. The story begins to hop from one theme to another,..... the structure is lost. Still, you will find the usual capsules of inspiration, but isolated.<br /><br />This makes me wonder why so many people around the world loves his novels. As Coelho acknowlegdes within the novel, he manages to write some little provocative ideas, that somehow have a different meaning for each reader, but inspirational, based on our own life experiences and troubles, and voil&agrave;...!, the recipe for success lies on the readers interpratation and inspiration they get from these little capsules of philosophy you find scattered in Coelho's novels. The Zahir at least let me understood why poor novels such as The Alchemist achieved such a success among adults (even though I think is great for pre-teens).<br /><br />You will be better off reading Eleven Minutes, definitively a real novel.
0385335997|5.0|I stumbled upon Outlander several years ago and loved that lengthy novel. Jamie and Claire stayed in my mind and I often found myself, apropos of nothing, wondering whatever became of them. The love and friendship they felt for one another went far beyond that of the typical bodice ripper, and Gabaldon's details and (mostly) accurate portrayal of the 18th century were excellent.<br /><br />When I found Dragonfly in Amber I immediately began to devour it and have never been so moved by a sequel. Since it was several years after I read Outlander, the beginning scenes set in 1968 and the shifting narration felt a little disjointed and confusing. It began to flow, though, and once again I found myself captured by the tragedy and love in the two characters' lives. Throughout the book, I had a sense of foreboding and felt distraught at the thought that something might happen to separate these two. I had to skip to the last page (which I never do with books!) just to reassure myself. Even knowing the end, I found myself crying over the farewell scene (which I also never do with books!). I had to know immediately what happened so I bought Voyager and stayed up most of the night reading it.<br /><br />Voyager picks up almost exactly where DIA ended, with Claire learning that Jamie did not, in fact, die at Culloden. She continues her search for more information about what happened to him afterward, and this 20th century story is interwoven with the events occurring immediately after Claire went back through the stones. Reading a \\"Jamie-centric\\" perspective is a welcome change from the normal first person, as we follow him over the next years--from his living in a cave, to his imprisonment, to his fathering an illegitimate child. Overall, though, is the sense of loss and longing between the two and the love that has never ended. When Claire decides to go back to try to find him, it seems both irresponsible (leaving her daughter behind) and the only possible thing she can do. Gabaldon is wise enough to make these characters have new, unknown complexities upon their reunion, rather than sticking the same twenty-somethings into older bodies and expecting us to believe their feelings are exactly the same. Both are changed and wiser, and we experience the challenges of rediscovering each other alongside Jamie and Claire.<br /><br />Somewhere past the halfway mark, though, I began to grow restless. Yes, the life of an 18th century Jacobite traitor/smuggler/warrior is bound to be complex and difficult. But do we need to see them thrown into every possible adventure of the era? Do we need to watch them sail across the Atlantic to encounter the same set of people from their past? Do we really believe that Jamie is literally impossible to kill? In addition, many things are vague and left unexplained, such as why Jamie is suddenly the captain of French soldiers, and whether it's Jamie or another Highlander who is the cause of Miss Campbell's madness.<br /><br />In all, this was both a heartbreaking and an uplifting story and made Jamie and Claire come \\"full circle.\\" To me, this is a logical place to stop the series, and I am content to let them live on in my mind without further forays into improbable adventures.do.

B0001WTVUW|5.0|Hello.  I remember all the \\"buzz\\" about this show when it first appeared on television in 1983.  At the time, I was prolly at work and also didn't have a VCR then.  Now that I have seen it in its entirety, it is an absolutely frightening experience.  Now, the dangers of nuclear war are more relevant:  India and Pakistan have it... North Korea has it...Iran it trying to get it... Israel has it... the list goes on... The acting in \\"The Day After\\" is awesome.  Jason Robards is amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised by Steven Guttenberg.  He's known mainly for those \\"Police Academy\\" movies, but he gave an fantastic performance.  That sequence where you first see several closeup shots of the Kansas City skyline is ominous, because you kind of have an idea of what will happen next.  I can see \\"The Day After\\" being remade, to take advantage of our modern technological advances.  All in all, the film serves as a reminder that there will never be any winners in a nuclear conflict.
0786711647|5.0|This book was one of the most intreguing and memorable books I ever read.

He is the Swiss watchmaker of the suspense novel; he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.'

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I enjoyed this compilation immensely.  Unlike those critics who deemed it anathema to alter \\"the canon\\", I actually would have preferred to hear other takes on well-known songs.  As it is, the most startling are Strawberry Fields Forever and While My Guitar Gently Weeps (in which, admittedly, I think George Martin's new strings at the end are garish and tacky).  I detect a slightly harder downbeat in Here Comes The Sun -- the song seems to rock more than the original, but it's a subtle difference.  I wish more of the short dubs had been extended, and that some of the medleys had been allowed to play out -- as it is we are tantalized by the possibilities, but never given the full expression.   <br /> <br />Still, this album is terrific fun for anyone who knows the entire Beatles catalogue.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|read some good reviews and some not so good...but I really love linkin park so had to hear for myself...I can see what some diehards might be missing, but I still think this is an impressive group of songs...that grow on me more and more with ever listen. great vocals, interesting songs, miss some of the rapping but whats there is real good....think these guys are trying to evolve...but hold on to their sound...just explore new places...and while i love their loud stuff...and i love when they take you on a roller coaster ride from rough to smooth on the same track...but i must say, they can deliver a strong, stirring ballad...with just enough edge and reality to keep it from being a sappy result

B00006CXXU|5.0|there are alot of songs on this cd...thank god...because the are all, except for one, amazingly wonderful. Great lyrics...that mean alot. I cry, i laugh, i smile, I dance depending on the tune. Christina knows what shes doing and she works it well. She is strong and smart and her voice is incredible. As much as i love to dance to her songs, the ballads are even more amazing as she stirs your emotions with the combination of insightful lyrics and perfect vocal delivery. I don't think I have ever played a cd so many times in such a short amount of time. I am addicted

B000LC4TJ0|2.0|This is one of several recently released DVD's from the 2006 Salzburg Festival at which all of Mozart's operas were performed. They've been dubbed the Salzburg M22's. Regrettably, I've yet to see one that I can recommend.<br /><br />This production has so many fine performers in it. Unfortunately, you have to buy a bunch of other DVD's to hear those performers at their best: Anna Netrebko as Violetta in \\"La Traviata\\" and as Adina in \\"L'Elisir D'Amore\\"; Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Leporello in two different productions of \\"Don Giovanni\\"; Dorothea Roschmann as Fiordiligi in \\"Cosi Fan Tutte\\" and as Pamina in \\"The Magic Flute\\"; Christine Schafer as Gilda in \\"Rigoletto.\\" I've gone to the trouble to list these other operas because these four performers deserve the recognition. They are as good in those productions as they are disappointing in this one.<br /><br />Much of the fault lies with the tempo set by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. The extremely slow pace he insists on results in the comedic feel being sucked right out of the opera. Many of the scenes that make me laugh-out-loud in  \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" drag on interminably here. The slow tempo affects all of the comic performances.<br /><br />For example, I know that Anna Netrebko can be playful onstage and even use her dark-toned voice to comic effect because I've see it in her portrayal of Adina in \\"L'Elisir D'Amore.\\" But here, as Susanna, she's grim most of the time; there's no sparkle to her performance. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is a rich and expressive baritone (he's my favorite Leporello), but here, he's too heavy-handed as Figaro.<br /><br />Christine Schafer seems miscast as Cherubino. The role sounds better when performed by a mezzo-soprano because otherwise there's no contrast in sound with the other two sopranos. Dorothea Roschmann, one of my favorite sopranos, is also disappointing as Rosina. She brings no decorum or nobility to the role (this may reflect the director's instructions to her). She's so \\"common\\" in demeanor that it's hard to believe she's a Countess. As a result, the opera's satire based on the different social classes of the Count/Countess and Figaro/Susanna is sorely lacking, even though it's an essential theme of Da Ponte's libretto.<br /><br />Mozart's music is brilliant even when poorly executed (thus, two stars) but I like to watch \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" when my spirits need lifting or I just feel like having fun; next time, it won't be this production I reach for. For a great time at the opera with \\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" try these DVD's: Theatre du Chatelet 1993 (Gardiner conducting); Glyndebourne 1994 (Haitink conducting); Opera National de Lyon 1994 (Olmi conducting).ve she's a Countess.

Warning, though: as with the films of the Lars Von Trier, DON'T READ THE REVIEWS -- they give away too much of what takes place, elminating the intended surprises. Just watch and be absorbed by what takes place -- as we do in life.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I heard the song \\"What I've Done\\" on the radio & I was thinking this album was going to be awesome. (Assuming the other songs would be along the same lines). I think \\"Bleed It Out\\" is a good song and there are some others, but the songs aren't nearly as good as the ones on the albums above. I hope Linkin Park's next album sounds more like their old ways instead of their new ways. I was wondering why the change & the only thing that made any sense was so they could take a break in between their hardcore songs with these slow songs. It's like getting some rest but the music is still playing.
0385491026|2.0|This is a well written book, a page-turner; I like the details of Elaine's past and am interested in what viewpoints formed her as a person.  However, I also think it is quite depressing.  I read it a couple of times, years ago.  When I saw a positive review on it I read it again, and each reading makes it more depressing.  Her outlook is bleak, and I really don't see anything positive or uplifting about it.

Well, we can all breath a sigh of relief because the wonderful people over at Lionsgate have finally put out a version that includes lots and lots of extras including deleted scenes, alternate scenes, extended scenes, outtakes plus more that haven't been included in any edition before. My only complaint is that they left out Dirty Dancing Live in Concert...which means I'll probably hang onto my Ultimate version but nonetheless I'm thrilled with the new extras. If you loved this movie 20 years ago, be sure to pick it up for the next 20.

His voice is enough to captivate even the hardest of audiences, and his songs are interesting enough to keep that interest going.  <br /> <br />His newest album is no different in that, even if it is different in style.

0743289684|5.0|The beauty and universality of this fine piece of work is that we can recognize Ayaan Ali's journey as our own. No matter where we are, or, where we are from, in one way or another, we too have taken this same life journey. It is the un-tethered solitary trek across space and time in search of our own place in this world. Always it is first a journey against the built-in tyrannies of society, and its ultimate evil: societal ignorance disguised as certain and benevolent knowledge.<br /><br />Ayaan has reached the last leg of the journey, which invariably is learning to overcome the disabilities of discarded ignorance and becoming content and comfortable in ones own skin and with what we have constructed; that is learning to be happy within our new selves.<br /><br />We know the disguises and the games all too well for they pollute all societies in equal measures whether primitive or modern, developed or developing: They are always the games played by the indecipherable higher authorities ostensibly looking out for our own (always lower) better (usually moral) interests. But as we have learned from the Wizard of Oz and other fairy tales -- all the way up through the brutal experiences of everyday adult life -- these emperors of authority never have any clothes. They rule by fiat, hidden behind the clock always with their suspect legitimacy and questionable self-defined, heavily guarded and unchallengeable truths.<br /><br />The subtext of their hidden game is never too well hidden: it is maximizing their own power at our expense. They do it by colonizing weaker minds through the manipulation of basic fears, especially the fear of the unknown, and the fear of being socially isolated. They are all cowards and bullies and we know this, but we nevertheless allow them to intimidate and manipulate us.<br /><br />We are the life-projects of these demons of tyranny, for they can only make the world safe for themselves and their own selfish interests by controlling our minds and our behavior.  Each society serves as the crucible for preparing and perfecting its own peculiar witches brew. The portions may vary but the ingredients used to colonize the mind seem to always reduce to the same ones: religion, class, sex, tribe and race.<br /><br />In Somalia, as is true of many developing societies, heavy doses of \\"tribal\\" and \\"religious\\" ignorance is sufficient to do the job. In more sophisticated developed societies, like the U.S. the tyranny of colonization has become a much more sophisticated (or as we like to say these days a more nuanced subtler and compassionate) game. Yet the rules and the objectives remain the same: use ignorance, fears, and social insecurities as a bludgeon to pound the weaker minds into shape - that is into an internalized and colonized state of mind - so that they mutilate themselves, on autopilot. The stronger minds will always follow.<br /><br />Yes, it is true that the Enlightenment period in the West did help to beat back a lot of organized ignorance, at least for a time. But the most formidable of them, religious ignorance, at least in the U.S., is making a determined comeback.<br /><br />Ms. Ali can be forgiven temporarily for being \\"blown away\\" and blinded by the dramatic contrast between the West and the rest. There is indeed a lot to be said for one society being a little less ignorant than another, but not a lot. As for the West's seeming openness, orderliness and kindness, there will be plenty of time after her honeymoon is over (and she has been used up and discarded) for her to be jolted back to her normal good senses and sensibilities.<br /><br />I don't suppose she failed to notice that in the year of Our Lord 2007, we have four (count them) four candidates for U.S. President who do not believe in Evolution.  How is that for underscoring Western enlightenment?<br /><br />Five Stars.
0385522401|5.0|On the surface of things, Ian McEwan's ON CHESIL BEACH is a simple story. Edward and Florence, a young couple in their early 20s, have just gotten married on a summer day in 1962. On their wedding night, they eat dinner in their honeymoon suite, try and fail to consummate their marriage, and erupt into a hurtful war of words on the stony beach outside their Dorset honeymoon inn.  <br /> <br />But that's just the surface. Leave it to Booker Prize-winning author McEwan, however, to delve far below that seemingly shallow storyline in just over 200 pages. For one thing, there is the book's setting in the 1960s, but during those early years that bore far more resemblance to the straitlaced, sexually repressive 1950s than to the swinging, sexually open years that followed. The novel's opening sentence sums up the whole problem perfectly: \\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\" Plainly impossible, yes, and also devastatingly so.  <br /> <br />Through the use of flashback (and flash-forward) and an impeccably crafted omniscient narrator, McEwan gives readers a surprising level of insight into his main characters, who serve not only as representations of their time but also as well-developed individuals. Edward is a virgin, yes, but he's been looking forward to his marriage as much for the chance to lose that label as for the opportunity to spend his life with the woman he loves. His proposal to Florence happened, after all, during the physical contact that was the closest the couple ever had come to sex. Impulsive, with a chip on his shoulder and a tendency to fight, Edward has overcome his pride in order to accept a position with Florence's father's company.  <br /> <br />Florence, on the other hand, approaches the physical aspect of her wedding night with a \\"visceral dread.\\" Repulsed by the descriptions of sex (\\"penetration,\\" \\"mucuous\\") in hermarriage manual, Florence recoils from Edward's touch, wishing that their relationship could be more like the nurturing and affectionate but non-physical relationships she enjoyed in college. A successful musician who finds her assertive self only in the context of the string quartet she leads, Florence is paralyzed not only by her fear of sex but also by the utter lack of language with which she can discuss these matters: \\"As she understood it, there were no words to name what had happened, there existed no shared language in which two sane adults could describe such events to each other.\\" Her reticence, and many of her other characteristics, seem almost Victorian to modern readers, who may be startled to discover just how far relationships between men and women have progressed in just 45 years.  <br /> <br />And that, in the end, is one of the brilliant aspects of McEwan's novel. ON CHESIL BEACH could have developed into a farce. Embarrassment, humiliation and shame are all the stuff of slapstick comedy, and although the author explores these emotions adeptly, he never mocks these characters. Instead, he develops what could have been a simple period comedy of manners into a tragedy of sorts, an examination of how whole lives can be shaped, and changed, by single moments of impatience, recklessness and misunderstanding.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />
0596007124|5.0|I had never read a Head First book but everybody talks about them! <br />Having read the SCJP book by Katty Sierra and Bert Bates, I decided to try the Design Pattern book (authored by the Freeman couple, with help from Katty & Bert). <br /> <br />My impression... wow! <br />VERY clearly explained, lot of examples, lot of graphics! After 8 hours of work I find myself arriving at home and just reading chapter or two to relax! What amazes me is that for each chapter they present a requirement and create a first solution that is VERY similar to what we, in our fast spaced, timeline based IT world are used to do: something that will be done quickly and will solve the business needs... for now. <br />But then they show what can happen when CHANGES are requested to our initial solution (software developers KNOW what we are talking about here!) so that the reader truly apreciates how the initial quick-solution is totally un-scalable and lot of code rewriting must be dedicated over again to implement the changes. <br />A pattern is then introduced, showing how, by dedicating just a little bit of effort in the early stages of development, can save hours and hours of work in the future.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I rarely form such a bad opinion of a movie. But this is an awful rendition of P & P. Costumes, casting, sets, almost all bad. They set the Bennets in squalor. The casting is terrible. Knightly, while a good actress, is really not suited for the part. Better as Jo from Little Women I would say. Mr. Darcy is not at all a romantic lead and does not pull off the arrogance he is supposed to have had. Mr. Bingley is beyond ridiculous. Even Judi Dench who I always look forward to seeing did not make a very good Lady Catherine. She appeared almost nice! The performance made Elizabeth's wit not justified but impudent.   Above all they were not faithful to the story: adding, omitting, and totally garbling scenes and lines. An example being Mr. Darcy's first proposal: one of my favorite scenes from the book was totally changed, in location, weather, words, etc.   Everyone I've talked about the movie with disliked it. All in all it may be a good movie in it's own right but has no claim to being Pride and Prejudice.  The BBC/A&E series is much to be preferred. Even the black and white movie is better!
0596527055|5.0|Have you ever been to a party and met someone with a great job and a great sense of humor and ended up spending the entire party drinking beer and swapping interesting stories? That's what Scott Berkun's new book, \\"The Myths of Innovation\\", felt like to me. There are lots of books on my shelf that I know I ought to read, and many of them I struggle through and afterwards feel like it was a valuable investment of my time, however painful. This wasn't one of them - this is one of those rare books that feels like reading for pleasure, and yet you learn something along the way. <br /> <br />And I might add that the colophon alone is worth the price of the book (a sentence that perhaps has never been written). <br /> <br />I wonder how much time and research Berkun did on this book before he came up with the idea of orienting the book around myths? Was that the idea all along? Or did it emerge over time? Because it turns out to be a perfect way of presenting the material. First, everyone loves to feel like they know something that other people don't - the truth behind the myths. This \\"peeking behind the curtain\\" approach is a great way to keep the material interesting. Second, innovation is such a complex area that it would be very difficult to write a book about what innovation is -- it's a lot easier to talk about what it isn't. But by providing the boundaries via the myths, it inevitably provides great insight into how innovation really happens. And third, myth debunking seems to fit Berkun's auctorial voice. His casual, conversational tone is not only funny and engaging, but it naturally allows the type of speculation and interpretation that is necessary for the topic. In other words, a textbook-style examination of innovation would be a very poor choice. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the entire book, I particularly enjoyed in the section on the myth of \\"the best idea wins\\". In it, Berkun describes the many factors that are involved in whether an innovation succeeds,and how being the \\"best\\" is only one of many factors. When it comes to design innovation in established software, the impact of \\"dominant design\\" is always a challenge - what is the cost of moving to something better when you have a large customer base who already knows how to use the product? One example in the book is the QWERTY keyboard that we all know and loathe. But to lesser degree this is always the case - I can't convince my wife to move from Paint to Photoshop for editing pictures because she knows how to use Paint. Whenever I try to tell her about how many great features there are in Photoshop, all she hears is \\"blah... blah... blah... [it will take lots of time to learn]... blah... blah... blah.\\" <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who has a job where innovation matters... which is just about everyone.

The best way to describe this album is that there is tremendous energy that feels like its being restrained and ready to explode... but it never does.  At first it feels like being cheated out of that energy release.  Yet, the restraint itself draws you back to it.  Subtle in a way, but it definitely has an awesome sound.

B000GDH9J6|5.0|I'm interested in Tibet, if a movie dvd box has Tibet on the front i'll at least pick it up and read the back. I was uncertain if i would like the movie from reading the blurb on the back, but i was willing to give it a chance. It exceeded expectations and is an excellent movie despite the poor description on the dvd box. The best thing to increase sales and rentals of this movie is to first-rewrite that box.<br /><br />It can be best described as a terminally sad movie, sad for the people of Tibet, for the antelope on the high dry cold plains, for the world for standing by as Tibet's inheritance is machine gunned down, stripped and shipped off to make some rich person's collar or gloves leaving the people even more impoverished, cold, hungry and dying.<br /><br />The only heroes die; painful, often solitary, always cruel and ultimately useless and meaningless deaths. Mirroring the frozen ground's burden of was-pregnant(there could have been hope) but now just red rib cages and dangling legs(stark, mindnumbingly counted and finally burned), the people seem as cruel, as uncaring, as empty as the Tibetan plain swept by winds, seared by the cold, hiding death everywhere.<br /><br />Even those that fight the death dealing poachers are sadly at best just standing their ground, unpaid, begging for food and gas from those even worse off then they are. Most are like the Tibetans hired to butcher the antelope and skin them, just trying to live in a harsh, unforgiving, bleak world that seems unaware of their efforts and their very existence.<br /><br />The movie is about making the destruction of the Tibetan people, their culture, and the land that supports them, real and palatable to those far away, but yet often intimately involved (where do the furs ultimately end up?, the Tibetan's don't wear expensive furs). I didn't see any hope in the movie, it was more like a run away tank that no one can stop but the best are trying to slow it down with their bodies under the tracks, but it doesn't really deflect let alone stop the juggernaut, it just speeds along destroying. It's a broken system, full of broken people who are just trying to survive, in the midst of an uncaring world that is being impoverished even more by their efforts. It is a moving movie, anyone unmoved by tears is simply dead inside, but one asking serious questions without really trying to answer any of them.<br /><br />It is worth watching, but don't expect to leave with much implanted or imparted positive energy to rise up and tackle tough problems, or maybe i just took the quicksand death too seriously ignoring the facts at the end that the army is now fighting the poachers and the herds have greatly increased in the last few years, your call.dies under the tracks, but it doesn't really deflect let alone stop the juggernaut, it just speeds along destroying.

0060564423|1.0|Nimitz Class is so bad it's funny. It's like a fairy tale or cartoon, with the Red State conservative supermen-- always handsome, brilliant, with piercing blue eyes, and much given to remarks about the \\"goddamn towel heads\\"-- strutting around the stage being manly and admirable. You get hilarious combinations like dashing naval officers who are also MIT Ph.D.'s in physics, who are also cowboys, who are also 'American royalty' who love opera and know their wines, whose mother lives on a cattle ranch but went to Wellesley...and on and on. It get pretty silly.<br /><br />But the real howlers come from comparing the book with the reality of the Bush Presidency and the disaster he has fashioned post 9/11. The President is depicted as a man from the Southwest, who was a brilliant success at Harvard Law. Well-- LOL!-- mediocrity at Yale, undistinguished at Harvard Business School, but anyway you can tell it's supposed to be Bush.The best line is where someone says that the best thing about a Republican White House is that it's so crowded with competent, erudite people. LOL!!!!<br /><br />All I can say is, Brownie you're doing a heck of a job. I mean Robinson.<br /><br />My dad was a WWII submariner in the Pacific and spent thirty years in Naval Intel.

B00005JPKE|4.0|This film has been very popular in Japan where I teach. <br />My Japanese friend said that on the whole she thought the film was fairly accurate, but she did make the following critiques. <br /> <br />1). The gushy emotional letters the soldiers wrote home to their wives and children would have been unusual for Japanese men of that era. <br /> <br />2). She thought the frank talk by the common soldiers and some of the complaining they did was something more reflective of the American soldier than the Japanese. A Japanese soldier of that era wouldn't have dared to complain about his superiors even out of their earshot. <br /> <br />3). Likewise Watanabe Ken's character (the general) was too much like an American manager, who was concerned about the moral of his men and felt the need to explain his orders to his subordinates. A Japanese general, especially in that era, would have simply barked out his orders and assumed blind obedience. Perhaps the intended explanation for this was that Watanabe Ken's character had spent in America, but it still didn't smell right to She. <br /> <br />4). Lastly She claimed the dialogue in the movie was hard for her to catch at times, and theorized that since this movie was made for American's who would be reading the subtitles, speaking Japanese clearly wasn't a priority for the filmmakers. As for me, I can't tell one way or the other (from my perspective, any movie with Japanese dialogue is hard to catch). Since I haven't heard this criticism from anyone else, and since all the actors in this movie are professionals, and should in theory be able to speak clearly for the camera, I'm reporting this last one with a grain of salt. <br /> <br />I do not claim to have seen every Japanese movie under the sun, but there is an obvious difference in tone between this movie and a Japanese war movie like \\"The Men of Yamato\\". Both films may be arguable anti-war in their own ways (although I retain my reservations about \\"The Men of Yamato\\"), butthe disillusionment of the Japanese soldier and the criticism of the Japanese government were completely absent from \\"The Men of Yamato\\". In short, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is probably a movie about that Japanese perspective of the war that could only be made in America. <br /> <br />Which doesn't completely invalidate it. The film still has a strong message even if it wouldn't be exactly the same way the Japanese would tell their own story. And as a movie made by Americans for other Americans, it does an excellent job of humanizing the enemy and trying to imagine the war from their perspective. And although this is not necessarily new (I'm told \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" showed the war from the Japanese perspective as well. And even \\"Pearl Harbor\\" shoehorned in a couple of scenes giving the Japanese perspective) it does represent a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />From a cinematic viewpoint I thought this film was a bit long to sit through. It could probably have done with some more time in the editing room. But still worth seeing. <br />

(Though the only piece of music I know that was included in the Runaway Bride was the track \\"Love Don't Roam\\" as I think it had a different suite) <br /> <br />The soundtrack's cover has a picture of David Tennant (The Tenth Doctor) and Billie Piper (Rose Tyler) and I'm really thankful that they did a complete (or at the very least nearly complete) soundtrack for the first two seasons rather than waiting several more seasons and having to do an abridged soundtrack.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack contains all original tracks, for the most part by Murray Gold, and the only two predominantly vocal tracks are \\"Song for Ten\\" and \\"Love Don't Roam\\" but the soundtrack more than makes up for your lack of being able to sing along with it.  <br /> <br />Personally, I love to listen to it when writing fanfiction as well as just any time I may feel like it. It really does retain the mood of the show even without images to accompany it.  <br /> <br />For the information of anyone who is interested the other songs that I know of that have been included in Doctor Who but are not on the soundtrack are (these are not guaranteed accurate but I believe they are): <br /> <br />\\"Tainted Love\\" by Soft Cell (episode The End of the World, Series One)  <br /> <br />\\"Toxic\\" by Britney Spears (episode The End of the World, Series One)  <br /> <br />\\"Moonlight Serenade\\" by Glenn Miller (episode The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Series One*)  <br /> <br />\\"In the Mood\\" by Glenn Miller (*) <br /> <br />*There is a Christmas song in the beginning of the Christmas Invasion that mentions a \\"red-nosed reindeer\\" but I'm not entirely sure that it is the actual song and if it is it's a very different version. This song is used more than once in reference to Christmas, however. It is playing in the garage in which Mickey is working in The Christmas Invasion.  <br /> <br />\\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" - Traditional  <br /> <br />\\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" by Ian Dury and the Blockheads (episode Tooth and Claw, Series Two)  <br /> <br />Some classical music I can't recall the name of but that is mentioned by the computer's voice is used during a shift transition sometime during The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" by The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) (episode Love and Monsters, Series Two)  <br /> <br />Hope I've helped maybe!  <br /> <br />

0887308589|3.0|Scott Adams worked for a utility monopoly when he began his satirical comic strip that mocked decadent management. Does anyone believe his comic situations would apply to an owner-operated small business? Only a large monopoly could afford and profit from the examples in Dilbert-land. Their profits are based on costs, so their higher costs from mismanagement allow higher charges on their captive customers. Once you understand this you'll know why things work that way. But nothing lasts forever, many places will be closed, their employees outsourced offshore. The bad effects could be reduced by a program of internal competition and rotation of managers. (That pointy-haired manager has to have a relationship with somebody in upper management.) This book lacks an index and a bibliography, like a novel. <br /> <br />Note polarity when changing a battery (p.3). Statistics is the art of arranging facts so they produce the desired conclusion (p.5). Sometimes they can be factual. Adams' story about \\"bluffing\\" (p.6) tells me he is not a carpenter, painter, plumber, electrician, mason, farmer, or assembly line worker who produce something from real work. I doubt if any of them will ever read this book for humor. You might just as well explain television to a cave person. Adams doesn't understand the printing press; it reduced the cost to mass-produce literature for those who could read. <br /> <br />The `Introduction' seems truly idiotic. If his co-workers don't know much that tells you about their knowledge gained from weekly news-magazines, corporate broadcasts, weekly tabloids, etc. Does he have a cure? [I recommend reading a daily newspaper, news radio, and avoid broadcast media that features gossip and opinion, and magazines. Listening to advertising is a form of Pavlovian conditioning.] \\"The Dilbert Principle\\" (Chapter 1) originally appeared in the `Wall Street Journal' along with other curiosities of that day. [Browse a copy once a week, they have news that is often missing from most newspapers.] Adams wonders why certain people are promoted to management? It's the class system, managers do this to prevent being threatened by more talented people. Talented people will either leave for another company, or accept their fate (p.17). The ineffective manager is used as an expendable who can be sacrificed if the need arises (after blaming the workers who have only followed orders). You can read about this in the newspapers if you haven't seen this for yourself. Read C. Northcote Parkinson's book. <br /> <br />Giving Chapter 5 the title \\"Machiavellian Methods\\" tells me Scott Adams never read \\"The Prince\\". \\"Campaign Promises\\" may be a better title. \\"ISO 9000\\" is the way to document processes and job descriptions so the corporation can send this work offshore, fire employees, and save millions on salaries to give bonuses to upper management. There's no secret here (Chapter 20). This is followed by \\"Downsizing\\" (Chapter 21). Chapter 23 discusses \\"Reengineering\\". Did those two authors ever practice what they preached? If not, then what does it say about the mismanagers who believed their story? There is a hidden agenda here, a formula for mass layoffs. <br />
1591841666|5.0|Once again Seth hammers home his contrarian wisdom.  In past books on marketing he's told us why traditional marketing doesn't work.  In The Dip he defies one of America's revered adages - \\"Quitters never win and Winners never quit.\\"  As he points out the foolishness of living this out in everyday situations, the truth becomes obvious - sometimes the best decision is to quit - get off the Cul-de-Sac and redirect in a position direction.<br /><br />As a career coach I see this played out time and time again.  People think there is merit and ultimate good in persisting in a job or business that is obviously going nowhere.  I'm recommending The Dip to everyone I know.  Every once in a while we need to have our clich&eacute;s challenged to see if they really make sense or have just become culturally accepted.<br /><br />Next he'll be telling us bumblebees really can fly --
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I am a fan of Rush. I loved this CD. But I almost love anything this guys do. So, don't listen to me.
B00008438V|2.0|Weird Science has a funny high-concept premise and an endearing cast, but even when I was a teen and the movie was brand new, I thought the humor was messy and heavy-handed.  I never understood how so many of my contemporaries consider this a \\"classic\\", especially when stacked up against Revenge of the Nerds, Real Genius, Better Off Dead, or even Hughes' masterful 16 Candles or Ferris Bueller.  Still, the movie is not without a certain odd charm and there are some great moments (mainly involving Bill Paxton); I find myself wishing Amazon would let me give it an extra half star!
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Great voice and sang with a passion that makes you feel the lyrics.  Highly recommended.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I managed to purchase this item on the idea that I loved the video for \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". But after listening to all the songs, I found that there's lots of little gems throughout. Especially \\"Map of the Problematique\\" as well as \\"Exo-Politics\\". As for my throwback reference, when I first listened to this, some of the sounds reminded me of Queen as well as some of the electronic sounds from various bits of 80's music. Which is definitely a good thing. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!!! <br /> <br />Heathtown
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this cd! I am a limo driver for a big corporation. When I pick up clients and VIP's I pop this cd in, most of them have been on overseas flights, which are very long or they have been in meetings all day and need some nice relaxing music, not elevator music,  it is easy to listen to, and has all great songs. They enjoy it alot. Thanks

B00068ULLY|1.0|﻿IFC is showing both KB movies on TV. Boy, I wish I could get back the time I wasted. Fortunately I've got a good remote. &lt;click> and the pain is less. Wooden acting, rotten dialogue boring action sequences. Painfully bad. I rate this somewhere below Crippled Masters. I'm going to watch Dirty Ho and Princess Iron Fan and clean this  from my mind.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I was 12 years old when this was originally released on vinyl (which i still have in excellent condition), and loved the record as much today as i did then. when it was first issued on cd quite a few years ago i was waiting for the store to open to get a copy! now, years later the film is finally released on dvd! what joy it is to see what i've listened to for so many years.(i never saw the film in the theater). a great set from a cast of spectacular legends from the music industry. George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and a host of others in a spectacular performance for charity, an event that actually started concerts for charity. DVD quality is decent considering this show was shot in 1971, sound is very good. there are 2 low points for me in this set, but neither to drop my 5 star rating. the first being nearly 17 minutes of Ravi's performance. (did they really have to play that long?) while the music was intresting, its hard to listen to for that long for me personally, and two, the ommision of Bob Dylan's Mr.Tamborine Man!  this track was included on the cd and original vinyl versions. On the upside, a couple performances from the afternoon show and rehersals have been added, \\"If Not For You,\\" \\"Come On In My Kitchen,\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" on disc 2 of the set.  Overall it is wonderful to finally be able to own a piece of history!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I came across Loreena McKennitt when I bought \\"Celtic Chillout\\" which featured \\"The Mummer's Dance\\". It took me to \\"The Book Of Secrets\\", which drove me to her other albums - both studio and live. As I continue to discover her development from her more folk-orientated music to what would now be described as World Music (if we must use categories!), my love of her music grows, to the point where I have had a real longing for the release of this album. <br /> <br />I was not immediately certain about the music I heard until I had listened to it four or five times but, now, I can't get enough of it. Such is her ability to enchant, captivate or charm me that, amongst all the large amounts of music I listen to, I keep coming back to Loreena. <br /> <br />The thing about her is that it is not just an album but a magical mystery lesson in history, set to music. You buy the whole package including her immersion in the research which goes into the making of the album and the story of the journeys she makes. <br /> <br />Once the research is done, it seems that the knowledge her fantastic mind has gained is used to piece together a travelogue which sends the listener on a similar journey to which the artist has been on. This is, I guess, what she sets out to do - and she succeeds wonderfully. <br /> <br />For this album, she has brought together a brilliant set of musicians - Brian Hughes, Hugh Marsh, Caroline Lavelle, Rick Lazar and Donald Quan - to name five and who have featured on previous albums. <br /> <br />So what we have is such a fantastic album that I can't stop playing it. Loreena's singing is sensational and with such clarity that she you can hear every word. Add the aforementioned musicians and nine gorgeous tracks - my personal favourites are \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky\\" and \\"Penelope's Song\\", but all are brilliant - and you have a fantastic album which will be among my all-time favourites for a long time. <br /> <br />Incidentally, she has recently finished toursof Europe and Canada + the US. Her only English concert was in London's Barbican Theatre and she and her fellow musicians were simply fantastic. Fans should look out for a 2xCD/1xDVD box set of the concert she performed in September 2006 at the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, which was on sale at her concert venues - it is brilliant. <br /> <br />So, this relatively new fan has fallen in love with Loreena McKennitt's music and I strongly recommend that if you have a vague interest in her music, but the album and you will not be disappointed - it is a hauntingly, beautiful collection of music from a brilliantly talented artist.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I apologize to first-time listeners of Dream Theater; this is really a review for that eclectic, divided, passionate, and partially psychotic group of people (of which I am a proud member of) known as \\"long-time Dream Theater fans.\\" Forgive me. Also, like many DT songs, this review is long.    I read on one of these reviews that those who use Constant Motion and Dark Eternal Night (samples off of the Roadrunner site) as a reference for what the rest of this album will sound like will be surprised. That couldn't be more true.    This album is NOT another Train of Thought. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It is way more diverse. I think it has some of the heaviest moments in Dream Theater history, but collectively as an album, it is not the heaviest one. I think that title is still reserved for Train of Thought.    For those wondering how this compares to Octavarium, it is more heavy, but is more progressive throughout. Aside from the title track of that album, Octavarium was Dream Theater's conscious attempt (from what I have read) at shorter, more focused songs. So unlike Octavarium, this CD is more...as I said...progressive throughout (with the possible exception of Forsaken, which is more of a straight-forward rock song).    For those wondering how this compares to the Images and Words era, I'd like to make an observation. Like a legion of DT fans, I feel Images and Words was one of their most brilliant albums. But if you listen to it today, it's obvious that it was still filled with many early 90's cliches in tone and musical styling (take Pull Me Under, Another Day, Surrounded, and Wait for Sleep, for example). This album DOES take from a lot from artists today and in the past. I will admit that. The Tool and Metallica influences are obvious. There is even a bit of Evanescence (I think) in Forsaken. But I view this in the same way I view Images and Words: inclusive of the stylings of the time period, but still original in its overall construction. Of course,there's tons of room for debate. I have this feeling that Images and Words was more eclectic; they had less idea what they were doing. So the result was something that was more original, but also much harder to understand. Systematic Chaos, on the other hand, is more \\"accessible\\"...and I don't think that's a bad word.    The point of that last paragraph was this: I hear a lot of \\"Images and Words\\" type moments in this album (mostly in the instrumental sections). Really, I do...and when they come, they are SO WELCOME! But don't expect the entire album to be like that. They do reserve the right to grow as a band (in fact, I wouldn't respect them if they DIDN'T). Expect some Liquid Tension-esque moments, and some influence from Petrucci's solo stuff. All good things in my book. BUT, also expect some heavy distored singing, some thrash-inspired moments, and some overall \\"messy\\" sounding stuff. If that stuff turns you off, you should be happy to know that 90% of the album is not like that. However, if you feel that a Dream Theater album has to be totally perfect, or its not worth buying, you might get annoyed by this album here and there.    That being said, I am actually a bit irritated with the parts of Constant Motion that sound almost exactly like Metallica (even more than \\"As I Am: does in Train of Thought). But that song is still good, aside from those parts. I feel like they could have easily filled those moments with something else. And I don't know why the didn't. But I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I assume they had some reason in mind.    Let's talk more about the album itself. This album has more of a fantasy-based theme to it. Watching the included DVD, you can tell Petrucci returned to writing his fantasy-based lyrics for this album. The result is something I haven't heard in Dream Theater before. The whole album is kind of a tasty homage to some of the fantasy-based albums of the 70's and 80's, without being ANYWHERE near as cheesy. And that is pretty cool to me. Rudess' keyboard effects sound ever cooler too.    To quickly address Labrie's singing, since this seems to be a hot topic, either you like what he does with the new stuff or you don't. Simple. It's about a 50-50 mix of clean singing and grungier singing. I personally don't like to nitpick to that extent.    Overall, this album is probably closest to Awake, with moments from Images, Scenes, and Train of Thought. Feel free to disagree.    To conclude, I got into Dream Theater because the albums I first heard seemed, well, perfect. I never felt I wanted to change much, if anything, in them. I respected that, and in my mind, it elevated them to God-like status. That bubble burst a long time ago, only because they have become so versatile, that no one can really be a huge fan of every single one of their influences. Although that may have made their albums less \\"perfect\\" in my mind, it's oddly made me respect them even more. I don't buy DT albums because I'm looking for something perfect anymore. I buy them because I am always anxious to know what a great band that isn't afraid to explore will do next. And if you feel similarly, then you should definitely buy this album. And if you DON'T feel like that, you should listen to the first track or any of the last four (completely through), and then make your decision (not that the other ones aren't good also). After all, I'm not here to brainwash you into becoming a believer in all of their works.    And, the extra DVD is great. I like to see them goofing off in the studio. I haven't heard the mix in 5.1, but I'm sure it sounds good.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).   This CD is the reason why the Beatles are the best band in the world. No other song writing team has written 27 number 1 singles like Lennon/McCartney. This CD has them all. $27 worth of music for $13. It's a no brainer.   If you haven't heard any of the songs on this CD, then you must not have had access to a radio, TV or your parent's music collection. You were deprived. It's not too late to make up for lost time.   Hope this helps.  Darium  June 2007
B000EWBNMS|5.0|You've never experienced these kinds of dreams! <br />So many twists and turns in every episode. It's never predictable and always leaves you wanting more. <br />I highly recommend this series for anyone who loves a great mystery or crime drama.
B000002UAU|5.0|I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).  I love the Beatles. I own every record. But based solely on $1 per song value (Amazon is currently charging $10 for the entire CD), it's worth $8. Why? The songs: Sgt Pepper, With a Little Help, Lucy in the Sky, She's Leaving Home, Sixty-Four, Lovely Rita, Sgt Pepper (reprise), and A Day in the Life. These are the songs I'm sure you've heard on the radio and they are great. Is it worth it to pay the extra $2 to get the entire CD? Sure, because it's the most influental album of all time (according to the 'experts') and because no Beatles songs are available on Apple or Rhapsody at this time. As well, the intent of the Beatles on the Sgt. Pepper album was for the listener to hear the music, from beginning to end, in one sitting.   Hope this helps.  Darium  June 2007

B000OPOAMA|3.0|Sure this movie was not as grand as Silence of the Lambs, but I thought it was an interesting turn of events in how it all panned out. There is an alternate ending on this DVD 2-Disc Collector's Edition, but I much perfer the original just the same.    Now, I may have a defected copy of this Steelbook Edition, but if not, be warned that the subtitles and Spanish and French audio tracks may not work. I sometimes like to read the English subtitles as I'm listening and watching the movie at the same time. However, I was not able to do so with this DVD packaged set. Not with either my Samsung, JVC, or Panasonic DVD players. The Steelbook Edition is a re-print of what has already been released, so I assume these features were lost in the re-printing process. However, all other bonus features and footages worked just fine.
B000P2A256|4.0|I don't like this CD as well as their previous release, but it still has some fun songs.
0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors. Every time I start one of her books, I know I need to have a lot of time on my hands to finish it because I won't be able to put it down. Nineteen Minutes is no exception. The writing and story plot take you to that place where you loose track of time because you are lost in the story. I did find a couple of discrepancies in the book, but they did not make the story any less dramatic. <br /> <br />This timely book tells the story of a school shooting from various points of view. You see how the tragedy affects the parents, community and the shooter himself. Picoult effectively uses jumps in time to tell the story of the shooter's life leading up to the incident and to the aftermath. Too often books on the subject are a bit preachy about the effects of bullying on students, but Picoult manages to strongly get the message across without making the reader feel as if he being lectured to. <br /> <br />In typical Picoult style, she saves a surprise twist at the end. The end had no where near the shock value of My Sister's Keeper, but I had not completely figured it out. I would definitely recommend this book to others to read and to high school libraries.
B000RJO578|5.0|There are a few things you have to appreciate coming into this film.  First of all you have to like British humor.  If you don't forget it.  It also makes some of the jokes better as there are cameos from British TV and film actors scattered about.  If you liked Spaced and Shaun of the Dead this will be up there for fans of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright.  It isn't as non-stop as Shaun of the Dead and there aren't quite as many pop culture references as Spaced- most of them just apply to the police buddy genre.  This, in my humble opinion, is one of the best and funniest movies in 2007- a good plot(which you have to follow and watch closely), good action, and great humor.  You'll have to watch it more than once to get everything. These are three of the funniest, most clever guys out there.  Check it out and you won't be disappointed.
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|good music but my only slight discomfort is that the cuts are somewhat disjointed with some instrumentals thrown in with vocals that don't seem to meld and flow for good background music for dinner parties. i am buying some other smooth jazz for background music that is more homogenous like boney smith and jeff golub.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Why anyone bothers to make a movie this bad is a mystery. \\"The Thirteenth Warrior\\" remains the best Beowulf movie to date, in my opinion. This one stinks. Save your money and time.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Very compelling and well acted film showing all the corruption and suffering that go into producing the world's diamond supply.  Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as a corrupt adventurer who seeks out diamonds for some shady London businessmen.  He comes across a man in prison who claims to have found a huge diamond.  DiCaprio strikes a deal with him to help him locate his family if he will lead DiCaprio to the diamond. <br /> <br />Loaded with action and some \\"disturbing\\" violence.  The only negative for me was DiCaprio's fake sounding South African accent which seemed to grate on ones nerves if you listened long enough.
B00004STPT|3.0|Although the music is good, there is a lot that is not what I hade expected. I was watching the movie when I purchased the CD and I wanted to have the same music on the CD that I was listening to at the time. Not all of the songs that you'd like are on it. Thats my complaint.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Of the 3 new episodes, this is by far the best one.  It has a captivating storyline and never ceases to amaze with the fantastic CGI special effects at every angle.  Many die-hard SW fans do not approve of all the CGI, but I believe that feeling goes hand in hand with the fact that they were around when the first SW came out, and that film was \\"theirs\\" so to speak and can never be duplicated.  Something so magnificent as SW in 1977 must've captivated the mind and created such a frenzy that many opinions will be biased some 30 years later.  I was not born yet when the first ones came out, but I'm a fan of all 6 and didn't really understand the SW buzz until I was able to watch the first 3 (newer ones) in succession followed by Episodes IV, V, and VI.  Many fans have seen it the other way around, but I find the SW saga to still be enjoyable if you watch them in numerical order.<br /><br />Of course, as a young buck myself, I will gladly say that Episodes I-III are great.  A true treat to eye and a gem in fantasy/sci-fi land if you're in to that type of genre.  Lucas could've not created anything better in my eyes.  As I stated earlier, many old-school fans don't appreciate the new ones and that's completely understandable.  For me and my generation, my Star Wars films were The Lord of the Rings trilogies.  For me, I will go to my grave saying that LOTR was and is the best film of the genre.  Hopefully they will make more as Tolkien wrote a lot, but I will not appreciate them as much as LOTR.  That's just the way it is I guess.

0805080120|5.0|Charles Lyell's \\"Principles of Geology,\\" published in 1830, established the doctrine of uniformitarianism, an assumption that the forces active in the past are the same as the forces active today. With this assumption, Lyell was able to show how all of the geological structures of the earth could have arisen from just two forces, uplift and erosion. Charles Darwin carried the first volume of \\"Principles\\" with him on the Beagle, and that work greatly influenced his own thinking. In his \\"Origin of Species,\\" published in 1859, Darwin showed how complex organisms could have evolved from less complex ancestors through a simple process of natural selection. Guy Deutscher, in his new book \\"The Unfolding of Language,\\" has accomplished a similar feat for linguistics, showing how all the complexity of modern languages could have evolved from a simple proto-language by means of linguistic processes that still operate on languages today. <br /> <br />Deutscher claims that only three processes are needed to explain how syntactic and morphological complexity evolved from a \\"Me Tarzan, you Jane\\" pre-language. The first process is economy; in general, people will try to reduce effort whenever possible. For example, we see economy at work in contractions and newspaper headlines. The second process is expressiveness; that is, speakers have a need to create new utterances as new circumstances arise, and they need to add emphasis and emotional content to what they say. Exaggerated expressions like \\"not in a million years\\" provide an example of expressiveness. The third process is analogy; humans are very good at detecting patterns (even where they do not really exist), and they have a need for order. The recent shift in the past tense of \\"dive\\" from \\"dived\\" to \\"dove\\" for many American speakers is built on an analogy with \\"drive/drove.\\" <br /> <br />Economy in languages is like the process of erosion in geology; both are gradual destructive forces. Speakers take shortcuts, dropping parts of words, running words together and omitting words altogether, all in an effort to save effort. Over the course of generations, these shortcuts become the standard forms in the language. A good example of this is the Latin case system, which was worn away over the centuries in the regional dialects that became the Romance languages. The more frequently an expression is used, the more it gets worn down, just as mountains are gradually reduced by the flow of wind and water. <br /> <br />Expressiveness, then, is like the process of uplift in geology. Various geological forces act to lift terrain, creating new mountains and ridges. Likewise, inventive speakers need to express new ideas and add emphasis, so they put words together in new combinations and extend the meanings of words by metaphor. These novel usages become standardized over time, and new structures in the language are created. <br /> <br />Expressiveness and economy are complementary processes in languages, just as uplift and erosion are in geology. The first process in each pair builds new structures, and the other wears them down. Together, they create a repeating cycle of build-up and decay. <br /> <br />The third process needed for full-fledged language to evolve from proto-language is analogy. Humans are excellent pattern recognizers, and they like to extend patterns as much as possible. Children learn their native language through pattern-recognition processes, picking up on the statistical regularities of the language. For example, they learn the pattern of adding \\"ed\\" to form the past tense and then produce forms like \\"goed.\\" Sometimes these pattern extensions make it into the next generation of speakers and become standard forms in the language. Archaic English plurals like \\"eyn\\" for \\"eyes\\" and \\"kine\\" for \\"cows\\" are examples of this. <br /> <br />Next, Deutscher demonstrates how these three processes can build up a complex language, bringin in evidence from a vast number of languages. Bombardedby example after example, the reader is left wondering how language could have evolved any other way. Additionally, the reader is left wondering why no one had figured this out before, given that the data Deutscher presents is not new.  <br /> <br />In Deutscher's model, there is no need for a language instinct. Instead, these three processes build up language upon a cognitive foundation that had already evolved millions of years ago in our primate ancestors. Furthermore, he shows how a number of language universals are also based general cognitive principles. Although Deutscher states that he prefers to avoid the nature-nurture issue, the evidence he brings forth leaves little support for the \\"language is special\\" view.  <br /> <br />It is important to keep in mind that Deutscher is after the big picture. First, he does not even attempt to explain how every linguistic structure evolved, even though his examples are copious. Second, he gives the reader fair warning whenever he shifts from the attested to the speculative. His purpose is to show how complex linguistic structures could have evolved--in principle--by simple processes. In this regard he is like Darwin, who demonstrated how natural selection could work in principle; a century and a half later, biologists are still working out the details. <br /> <br />There is something else that languages and organisms have in common--both appear to have been designed. In the case of organisms, it was generally assumed, until Darwin, that they were designed by a divine creator. In the case of languages, however, five thousand years of writing has provided incontrovertible evidence that languages do evolve. The beauty of both Darwin's and Deutscher's ideas is that they provide compelling evolutionary explanations for apparent design. <br /> <br />Some time in the distant past the first word was uttered, and our ancestors began to speak. Haltingly at first, but a word or two at a time, and then over the eons they gradually built up a complex linguistic framework. No one invented language; rather, it emerged slowly from the social interactions of hominids over many thousands of generations, in much the same way that gradually more complex organisms arose. At the end of \\"The Origin,\\" Darwin ponders: \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\" And so it is with languages, that most beautiful and wonderful of human endeavors.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|*Stay* is one of those movies that you gotta pay attention from the beginnign to the end to make sense of it.  However, it's not one of those films where you gotta figure out what the heck is going on before the movie concludes and you're still trying to figure it out.  No, just sit back and enjoy the popcorn.  The story will unfold itself...just for you.  But, you still gotta pay attention.<br /><br />Sam Foster (McGregor) is a psychiatrist who substitutes for another.  In comes Henry Letham (Gosling), a survivor of car crash.  He tells Foster that he will commit suicide 3 days later.  Of course, Foster is alarmed and is determined to stop the suicide.  However, Foster is also stressed out about the whole thing.  His fiance is concerned about him and wants him to open up.  However, Foster doesn't want to reveal anything to her because she is a survivor of a suicide attempt.  He fears that it'll bring up her desire to do another one.  Instead, he cites confidentiality and moves on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Foster tries to find more info about Henry.  But his investigation turns out to be more enigmatic than the previous info he has retrieved.  However, these enigmatic puzzle will piece itself together and reveal the bigger picture.  It's the completed picture that will make you go \\"aha!\\"<br /><br />Overall, the movie was good even though it started off slow.  I kept catching something that was bothering me throughout the movie.  Sam wears pants that are too short for him.  You have to look at IBDM for the director's reason behind that.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I think this soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and the composer should have won the Oscar in 2006 (at least it was nominated).
B00023B1LC|5.0|Great fast-paced action, lots of special racing scenes. Great, but simple plot which is vastly improved by Matt Damon's acting. I would recommend this movie to anyone's DVD library.
B000002TWN|5.0|D'Angelo's (A.K.A. Michaela Eugene Archer) debut album was \\"Brown Sugar\\" (1995). D'Angelo is a multi-talented musician- singer, song writer pianist, guitarist and record producer. This short ten track release is an impressive groundbreaking album full of excellent music. The album's opener is the smooth title track \\"Brown Sugar\\", a feel good love track with a great vibe to it. The laid back \\"Alright\\" follows, D'Angelo laces the track with some soulful vocals. \\"Jonz In My Bonz\\" was composed by D'Angelo and his former girlfriend Angie Stone, who is also the mother of his son. One of my early favourites is \\"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\\", D'Angelo croons away. D'Angelo sings about the scenario of finding his best friend with his wife on \\"Sh*t, D***, Motherf**ker\\". \\"Smooth\\" is just that, while \\"Cruisin\\" has D'Angelo doing a cover on a Smokey Robinson classic - delivering another highlight track. Soulful ballads follow in \\"When We Get By\\" & Lady\\". My personal favourite track on this album is the closer \\"Higher\\", D'Angelo does take his audience higher with this exceptional song. It would take D'Angelo, five years to deliver another album, with Voodoo (2000) a solid album worth checking out. D'Angelo has dealt with some battles in recent year's whether it be with drugs and rehabilitation or nearly dying in a car crash, heard hes working on a new album wish him all the best with that. \\"Brown Sugar\\" is definitely the D'Angelo album to have, full of soulful feel good music, D'Angelo took his audience on a journey to remember.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|I bought PULSE on VHS when it first came out a few years ago. I was so excited when I heard it was coming to DVD.....and a little disappointed after my first viewing. <br /> <br />DON'T GET ME WRONG! This is an EXCELLENT performance from one of the most artistic, prolific and enduring rock bands of our time! <br /> <br />The only problem is, the video is not of DVD quality. The original footage was shot on video tape and a DVD tranfer is only as good as the master it was taken from. You can only do so much with a sub-par master tape (remember, this concert was recorded before the age of DVD and video tape was more or less the industry standard at the time). <br /> <br />The redeeming factor of this release is that it's the only way you can get the entire Dark Side of the Moon album performed LIVE! Gilmour, Mason and Wright have proved that they still have what it takes when it comes to musicianship. The only thing that would have made this DVD even better was if Roger Waters could have put aside his differences and been a part of this concert. <br /> <br />The bonus features of this DVD are simply amazing. This is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan or a music fan in general. <br /> <br />David Gilmour (my personal guitar hero) is amazing to watch. It makes me mad when I have to work hard at playing guitar and he makes it seem so effortless! <br /> <br />Mason and Wright are also given chances to shine (especially the keyboard solo in \\"Any Colour You Like\\"!!!!). <br /> <br />When you buy this DVD and get ready to watch it, turn down the lights, turn off the phone, relax, and get ready to be blown away! <br />
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I'm a big Dream Theater fan, so pretty much anything they put out will gain my respect. These guys are truly on a plain by themselves when it come to sheer musicianship. They write great grooves that translate into fantastic tunes even though they can tend to overdue it from time to time. In the end however, they still manage to pull it off and that's what makes them so great!<br /><br />My only gripe about this cd is the vocals. I'm not sure what they were trying to do in tracks 3 and 4? To me it really takes away from the entire cd. Other than that, it rocks!!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This record is a turd...don't waste your $.  I'm almost embarrassed to be a fan.  Good thing I can still spin Hybrid or Meteora if I want a good kick in the balls.  If you like your Linkin Park sissified, this is for you.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|If you want see a great American band at its peak, this is a package worth picking up.  The music is deceptive -- serene and simple at first, but, keep listening.  \\"sky blue sky\\", \\"either way\\" and \\"please be patient with me\\" are each poignant. Influences are everywhere and weave in to make a wonderful tapestry. (Close your eyes when u hear \\"What Light\\" and tell me you don't hear Bob D...) More personal then any previous record, Jeff Tweedy seems to be seeking resolve with his loved ones and himself.   <br /> <br />But, this package is greatly enhanced by the DVD.  Rehearsals for a late winter tour, the band bring to life several of the songs from \\"sky blue sky\\".  In the accompaning interviews, Tweedy seems to tremble with honesty.  Worth the time and your hard earned dollar -- give it a chance.
B000F7BPLG|5.0|Fifth book of the Honor Harrington Series. If you like stories that last longer than one book, you will like this series. In book five, Honor has retired to her new holding on planet Grayson where her presence is challenged by certain upholders of the male status quo. How she establishes herself there in the face of adversity is the theme of this book. It is the other half of the life she is making. The first half is, of course, her identity as  an officer in the Manticore Navy. These two themes interweave throughout the series and produce a drama of war and peace, social change, politics,  and personal challenge that is absorbing and interesting. Weber's characters are out of this world, too. Put all that together and you have one terrific story and many pleasant hours of reading.
0790729628|2.0|First off, let me say that this movie is one of my all-time favorites. I was only 11 when I first saw it in theaters and I didn't quite \\"get it\\" at the time.<br /><br />In my late teens, I revisited the movie again when it ran on cable and I was able to copy it onto video tape. With my slightly better educated teenage mind, I finally \\"got it\\". I had come to the conclusion that Blade Runner was a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />The film was perfectly cast (many of the actors were relatively unkown at the time), the special effects were amazing (even rivaling some of today's effects standards), the costumes, sets, and lighting were extraordinary, the music (by Vangelis) was gorgeous and the cinematography was breathtaking.<br /><br />So, why only 2 stars?<br /><br />First off, the DVD transfer is horrible. It's not much better than the VHS copy I have. I know that the film was digitally remastered and re-released in late 2006, but I simply refused to buy it again because of my second point:<br /><br />This is the director's cut. Call me crazy, but I much prefer the original theatrical version. I LIKED Ford's voice-over narraration. It reminded me of the classic detective serials. Crossing that over to the sci-fi genre was a brilliant move in my opinion.<br /><br />The director's cut actually took scenes OUT (with the exception of Deckard's dream which gave a totally new interpretation of whether or not he was a replicant). Usually, a director's cut is LONGER and includes MORE scenes. Why go to all of the trouble to re-release a film if you're going to make it shorter and take scenes out? This was especially hard for me to take when Deckard's dream sequence replaced the scene where he is half-drunk and plinking away on the piano and we hear an alternate version of the beautiful \\"love theme\\". To me, that was an amazing scene and for some reason, Ridley Scott felt that he had to change or eliminate it.<br /><br />Thirdly, the DVD contains no extras to speak of.<br /><br />Rumors have been floating around for years that a definitive \\"final cut\\" of Blade Runner was to be released on DVD with a lot of extras and bonus features, including the original theatrical version, the director's cut and the final cut of the film. Due to legal problems and disputes, this never materialized.<br /><br />Luckily, I found this movie for $2.50 in the bargain bin at a local store. Otherwise, I would not have paid any real money to own this movie, which is a real shame.<br /><br />This film is a classic and deserves MUCH better treatment. Hopefully, 2007 (Blade Runner's 25th birthday) will prove to be the year that this definitve edition comes to fruition. If and when it does, I will gladly shell out my hard-earned money to own it.<br /><br />Only time will tell.....\\"final cut\\" of Blade Runner was to be released on DVD with a lot of extras and bonus features, including the original theatrical version, the director's cut and the final cut of the film.

B000244EMO|5.0|After achieving great critical and commercial success with the 1979 film \\"Alien\\" and its follow-up \\"Aliens\\" 7 years later, 20th Century Fox was no doubt searching for another monster franchise that they could cash in on.  Well, the search proved not to be in vain as director John McTiernan provided the perfect solution with his 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger action/monster film \\"Predator\\". <br /> <br />\\"Predator\\" tells the story of a squad of commandos led by a man named Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who are sent into a Central American jungle to rescue South American officials who have been kidnapped by guerillas.  As their search goes on, the commandos discover that the guerillas may not be their greatest concern in this jungle, as they find themselves being hunted by an apparently invisible being.  As the team of commandos gets picked off one by one, Dutch eventually finds himself face-to-face with the very being responsible, a grotesque alien hunter, heavily armed with advanced war-fighting technology that is beyond anything this world has ever seen before. <br /> <br />With the great success of \\"Predator\\", director John McTiernan proved himself the right man to bring Fox's newest monster franchise to life.  It is somewhat surprising that 20th Century Fox entrusted their hopes of a new franchise with McTiernan, since he had yet to truly prove himself in Hollywood (it was 1 year later when McTiernan was propelled into superstardom with his Bruce Willis actioner \\"Die Hard\\"), but even without having much experience under his belt he succeeded with flying colors. <br /> <br />The story for the film is essentially summed up by the film's title \\"Predator\\", with that one word, and the fact that Arnold was the main star, most people knew that there's bound to be plenty of action to go around.  Even with all of the action in this movie, there is still plenty of story, some critics felt the plot was rather thin and that all the action covered that problem; personally I didn'tfeel the plot of the story was weak in any way.  I thought that the story, though not difficult to follow or extremely complicated by any means, was still entertaining and provided enough character development and substance to keep the movie from feeling like it was simply one fight after another with no real purpose.  Obviously the film's story must have had enough substance to form a groundwork mythology for these alien creatures that was spawned off into a sequel, and also into numerous books and comic books that have further expanded upon these Predators. <br /> <br />The acting was good for an action film, not Oscar worthy, but these types of movies never are.  Arnold's mastery of the English language had improved from his performance in 1984's \\"The Terminator\\", at least you can understand him better, but it's by no means perfect.  The cast does well with their respective characters, some of the performances were a little over the top in places, most were clichéd, but so were their characters, and what else would you expect in an action film. <br /> <br />One of the biggest praises that can be given to this movie is for the special effects work; which still hold up well to this day.  The use of infrared for the Predator's vision was a neat touch and somewhat surprising for the audience to actually be given the monster's view of the world.  Even the invisibility effect, though primitive by today's standards, was very well done when you consider that it was an effect that hadn't really been done in that way before in cinema.  The costume department did what was possibly the best job in special effects for the movie with their work on the Predator costume.  The costume was so realistic, it was clear that the creative team on this movie had payed close attention to \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" in terms of bringing monsters to life.  Had the creative teams behind this movie not rose to the challenge set by the aforementioned movies, I don't believe the film would have been as successful with audiences. <br /> <br />With all that being said, \\"Predator\\" is definitely a classic among action movies and monster movies for that matter (though this film is more action oriented), and is a film that fans of the `Alien' franchise should definitely watch. <br /> <br />\\"Predator\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is by far the editon to get if you loved the lord of the rings soundtrack.  It has every song on it from the extended edition.  and the DVD-A version is very nice.

0375703764|1.0|In short, I wish I could give this 0 stars.  I picked it up because of the raves - \\"scariest book I've ever read\\", etc - and can only conclude these ravers haven't read very many books at all.  After reading it, I come back and look at the 5 star reviews here and note that even they caveat that they don't really understand the book and are giving the stars based on things like \\"ambition\\" (ie \\"A for effort\\"?) <br /> <br />A footnote on p149 pretty much sums up what I think of the book: \\"Other times I am sure it's just one big f***ing train wreck.\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Never thought I'd be the theatre type.  This was my first Broadway show to see and I loved it.  I liked the voices that are on broadway right now better than I liked the orginal cast thats on the soundtrack.  But all and all it's good.

Some of the reviews are odd and point out a darker meaning behind this lovely story. Read this book many years and never made the connections these people make. I guess Snow White had questionable a relationship with the seven dwarfs?? How about Pinocchio?? What did that old man really want with a little boy? Hate to go there, however, some people can turn a sweet story into a seedy one!
B000OMD4BG|5.0|Not much to say aside from - Wonderful!  I thought we had heard the last from Elliott with the excellent \\"Basement on the Hill.\\"  Happily, he left us a little more.  If this is to be the end, then it is a worthy one.

0684833395|5.0|To immerse yourself in the WWII-era nightmare at the heart of Joseph Heller's masterful novel is to lose yourself in a world where bureaucracy has run amuck, logic and sanity have become rare commodities, and the threat of imminent death permeates the very air.  And yet, the only person who can see all of this is Yossarian, a bombardier who has the misfortune to be stuck in a war while being, as the dust-jacket points out, \\"dangerously sane.\\"  He is terrified by the dangers that surround him, disgusted by the wanton behavior of his compatriots, and angered by the selfishness of his superiors.  He just wants to go home and leave all this behind him, but that seems to be an impossible dream.  The closer he gets to the end of his tour, the further he gets from going home as power-hungry, image conscious superiors concoct new ways to extend the number of missions their pilots must fly.  This is a war where the accuracy of a bombing run is seen as irrelevant so long as it photographs well (a pretty explosion is all part of the CO's PR campaign), a mess hall officer can run an international business that makes him the most powerful man in the unit, and a dead body can be allowed to lie around without getting removed if that officer's paperwork never arrived (making him never officially exist to the bureaucrats), and more.  The logic that they and all characters except Yossarian use is utterly absurd, lending \\"Catch-22\\" a farcical air, but the genius of Heller's work is that their outrageous logic is actually an only mildly exaggerated version of the logic that we are forced to abide by in everyday life.  You can read in his inspired satire the problems that plague any bureaucracy, whether it be as mundane as the office or as vital as the government.<br /><br />\\"Catch-22\\" is outrageous, yes, and that may turn some readers off, but it is a novel that has a devilish heart and a wicked wit at its core - not to mention the fact that it is sheer genius, and it isn't as far-fetched or outlandish as it may initially appear.  Heller's tone is pitch-perfect and never wavers, and his vision has made \\"Catch-22\\" a timeless classic that is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first published.  An absolute must-read.<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />P.S. If you like this check out Kurt Vonnegut, another spectacular absurdist author.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I received my CD of \\"LOVE\\" and after one listen I can tell you this:  this is my favorite album of all time.  Period.  This is my desert island CD.  I always thought I couldn't pick just one album to be marooned with on a desert island, but no.  I'll be okay if I can have this album with me.    There is only one thing about \\"Love\\" that I would change.  Granted, no WAY could they fit all the relevant psychedelic Beatles songs into the show/onto the album, but I really feel that \\"Dear Prudence\\" should have been included.  It is listed but it is just a tiny nuance/hint in a transition melange.  Just my opinion, but they could have left out \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"Help\\" and/or \\"Yesterday\\" and put in \\"Dear Prudence\\", as it cries out to me to be part of \\"Love\\", since it is psychedelic, loving and beautiful, speaking to and, in many ways, epitomizing all the themes of \\"Love\\" (our connectedness/oneness with nature and each other, etc.).  But that is the ONLY thing I'd change, making sure to fit \\"Dear Prudence\\" in somehow, instead of just giving it a barely noticeable nod in a transition.  Otherwise, the album is perfection.    George Martin has outdone himself.  There simply aren't enough superlatives for the wonderful, loving, delightful, psychedelic, nostalgic, transporting, brilliant, profound, intricately woven tapestry of a trip he and the Beatles send the listener on with this album, which really must be listened to as just that:  the whole album, start to finish.  It is a whole, a lovingly, carefully, meticulously, AMAZINGLY mixed whole.  Like the lyrics command you:    \\"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream.\\"    I cannot believe what Martin & son have done here.  I shouldn't even write this yet, after just one listen, but I HAVE TO.  omg.    First of all, Because.  He's done this cosmic version.  I mean, the song is already cosmic but then he made it a capella and put these pauses in and, it is just ...I mean...how to describe it...I can't!  It just takesyou immediately into your own kundalini and from there the rest of the album is a journey \\"within you and without you\\".    I am normally NOT a proponent of melanges or medleys.  But Martin has such a respect for the Beatles songs and a feel for them, and he \\"melanges\\" at just the right places but then he also lets one single song flow at just the right places, too.  Any and all tinkering with the songs is WONDERFUL, too!  Again, normally I would absolutely be against changing one note, one nuance of a Beatles song, but this is George Martin.  He has a golden pass, far as I'm concerned.  He IS the fifth Beatle, that is so evident in the loving and marvelous job he did on this album.    This just takes you through the entire Beatles experience in a way that I personally have never journeyed it before.  It is just totally transporting from beginning to end.   Transporting to where, you might ask?  To your deepest core, to the outer reaches of the universe, to the Beatle years, to a psychedelic trip into your soul, and then outward into the cosmos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And that is just in the first few moments *lol*, it goes on from there!    I just am totally amazed by this album.  It's love at first listen.  Especially for Beatles fans, but I think anyone who listens will be one (a Beatles fan) by the end.  If not, you aren't someone I'd want to know!  You are someone scary without a heart or soul or imagination!  Anyone with one or more of those three things will be totally moved by this album.    Where to start as far as the songs themselves?  We've already covered the stunning first song, a remixed Because.  Then you wouldn't think \\"Get Back\\" would seamlessly transition in after that, but it DOES!  And you feel like you are at Abbey Road hearing them perform it impromptu.  A captivating \\"Glass Onion\\" follows and then an absolutely heartbreaking and poignant Eleanor Rigby.  The little transition byte of \\"Julia\\" found me emotional and just took that further.  But no tears...yet.  We'll get there.  \\"I am the Walrus\\" blew my socks off and \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" added some more Beatlemania to the mix.  Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing has some amazing mixing wherein Martin somehow blends two separate and distinct melodies into one piece and makes it seem like they were always meant to harmonize like that!  WHAT?!!!  How'd he do that?!  Get the feather out and knock me over with it.    If I went on and on reviewing each piece, we'd be here all day.  \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is amazing and somehow--if this can be believed, but it is true, I swear--is even TRIPPIER than the original!  \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is BETTER than the original mix.  Masterpiece ALERT.  By the time we got to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", I suddenly started to!  As in, I started bawling like a baby!  I have no idea why.  I think that this album is so aptly titled \\"love\\" because all the songs just evoke such beautiful emotions of love and connectedness to the universe and, I dunno, by the time I heard a few notes of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", I was GONE, goodbye!  I don't know if I was happy or sad or what, but I know the music deeply touched me.    Then for three songs after that I was feeling happy and uplifted:  \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"Hey Jude\\" (my fave Beatles song of all time), and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\".  But then darned if \\"All You Need is Love\\" didn't get me going again, bawling like a baby.  By then I'm pretty sure it was tears of joy, though.  Joy that such music as this exists in the world.    Get this album.  In fact, if everyone on earth would listen to this CD, I'm convinced that harmonic convergence would occur and there would be peace and love throughout the land.  Just make sure, before the first time you listen to it, to clear your schedule, turn off the phone, and tune in exclusively to the music, because you are about to go on a trip.  A wonderful, psychedelic trip.

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I was transported back in time by the movie and sound track.  The soundtrack itself contains the best of the movie music with vocals done by the actors themselves.  Especially fun is the \\"Demo\\" version of \\"A Way Back In To Love\\", which sounds like a clip from the movie with Drew and Hugh (hey! that rhymes!) taking pot-shots at each other during a musical interlude.  This sound track also contains a couple of fresh pieces by the female singer in the film whose name escapes me.  She sang a portion of each of them in the movie.  Great soundtrack!
1559210400|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as Ms. Buck was able to take the reader inside a family caught in a changing world during the Chinese revolution and show how the characters each acted and reacted according to the information they had and what they believed or wanted to believe about that information. Madam Liang, who is coming to terms with disillusionment about the revolution and her past part in it, and her daughters, who had been sent to America for education and protection and their return to China with patriotic and idealistic expectations, are classic generational viewpoint studies. The shocking ending to the story was unexpected and expected all at once. The basic story is still relevant today.

0618477942|2.0|I began to read this book under the pressure of glowing reviews and constant buzz. I couldn't get away from the fact that people said it was just amazing. So, naturally, I gave it a try <br /> <br />Not to be anticlimactic or anything, but I stopped reading the book around page 100. <br /> <br />Maybe it's because I'm not a lesbian, maybe it's because I grew up in a fairly well-adjusted home with supportive parents, but absolutely nothing in this book spoke to me. I understand that this work must have been incredibly cathartic for Ms. Bechdel, and I'm glad that she got it off of her chest, but I don't really see what's in it for me. <br /> <br />The book prides itself in being able to rattle off literary reference after literary reference, but to me the book comes of as being supported solely by these allusions with nothing underneath to keep the reader interested. How many times do I need to hear about what Proust thinks of the situation she's in? What about her opinions? To me, the book comes of as elietist and smugly over-intellectual. I just feel like she's showing off, how she can tie images of her father up with the myth of the Minotaur, how she can draw all these paralells between his life and the life of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Allusions are a great thing and can add some beautiful depth to the story, but when each following page contains yet another \\"witty\\" allusion, it just gets tiresome. <br /> <br />Again, this is my opinion. I understand that this book means a lot to a lot of people, but I just wasn't feeling it
B00000DCHI|4.0|These days Billy Joel is often lumped in with Elton John as being remembered only for his top 40 radio hits and mushy ballads from the past several decades.  Many people forget that like Elton, Joel put out some really strong albums in his early and mid-career.  The guy was a songwriter's songwriter and not only could play a hell of a piano, but could be a very clever lyricist as well.  Like Elton, Joel's output could be very inconsistent.  For every \\"Goodnight Saigon\\" or \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" he wrote more throwaway stuff like \\"Uptown Girl\\" or \\"Tell Her About It\\".  This two disc compilation captures all of his singles and some of his album tracks up to 1985.  For the most part the material here is good, as you hear him move from an album oriented artist to a more commercial singles oriented one over the course of a little over a decade.  The first disc is the best and starts out with some of the best cuts from his pre-superstar days.  \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Captain Jack\\", \\"The Entertainer\\", and \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" are all great tracks and show a much different side of Joel than much of his later output.  \\"The Stranger\\" is also included here.  Although I was never crazy about the music or the chorus to this one, the lyrics are some of Joel's all time best.  The rest of disc one starts dipping into Joel's big hit territory with the mush ballads \\"Just The Way You Are\\", and \\"She's Always A Woman\\" (written for his 1st wife who he would divorce not too many years later).  The big hits \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" and \\"Moving Out\\" are also included.  Disc two is not quite as strong.  Three strong songs open the disc \\"My Life\\", \\"Big Shot\\" and \\"You May Be Right\\" all decent songs that got played to death on radio.  Then it is back to mediocrity land with \\"It's Still Rock n Roll To Me\\" (I always think of the Weird Al Yankovic parody \\"It's Still Billy Joel To Me\\"), \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\", and \\"She's Got A Way\\".  The best part of this disc is the three tracks fromwhat is in my opinion Joel's strongest album \\"The Nylon Curtain\\".  For this one Joel took a serious turn and came up with some really great songs.  The 3 singles from the album are all represented here and they are all good ones.  \\"Allentown\\" is a portrait of the Pennsylvania steel town after the industry pretty much pulled out.  \\"Pressure\\" is another good one about the pressure of modern day life.  \\"Goodnight Saigon\\" may be Joel's best all time work, and is a striking portrait of the Vietnam War.  The last half of the CD covers Joel's Do Wop period with \\"Uptown Girl\\", \\"The Longest Time\\", and \\"Tell Her About It\\" (songs about his second wife whom he would eventually divorce).  I am not much of a Do Wop fan so these don't do a lot for me.  Two new (at the time) songs close the disc out and are pretty much both throw aways in my opinion.  In the end this is a nice compilation of early Joel material.  If you are looking for an overview this would be a good pick up.

0553383663|3.0|It is an insightful description of rise and rise of two extra-ordinary individuals Sergey and Page. Born-intellect's these two young men thought of a crazy idea of downloading the entire internet on their computers, while studying at Stanford. Google was born with this crazy idea. Google's rise as a successful business model was rather unplanned but was driven by an urge to create an extra-ordinarily good search engine. \\"The Google Economy\\" as it is referred to was created as the company started realizing the potential of ad-revenues that can generated every time somebody ran a search. Google's ad-based model is different in the sense that ads are strategically displayed on a clear, neat white webpage alongside search results--Google ensures that only the most relevant ads are placed. Google sacrifices its revenues to keep its web-page clean, it accepts only text ads, no jazzy, colourful ads and no graphics. Over the years, Google scaled to become a technology giant, introducing various new product offering though maintaining its lead in Search.

B000NA2776|5.0|When I first heard \\"Grace Kelly,\\" my first thought was that whoever it was sounded so much like Freddie Mercury. I listened to a few of Mika's songs on his website and just had to get his CD. After listening to all of his songs, I've come to the conclusion that his voice is similar, but not exactly the same. It still has Freddie's theatrics and range, but there's also something that's just uniquely 'Mika' about it!  <br /> <br />The songs on the CD are all so varied. They range from pop-ish to disco and everything in between. His subjects are also just as varied. Once I start listening to this CD, I can't stop!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I picked up Minutes to Midnight on release day after anxiously waiting for fours years for a follow up to Meteora.    I thought I missed something after listening to it straight through for the first time so I listened for a second time and still wished I could've returned it.      I figured maybe I wasn't ready for it or maybe just not in the right frame of mind so I let the CD sit for a month.    I just got done listening all the way through again and still hate it!    The whole CD sounds like filler material normally reserved for placement between the hot tracks.    Gone are the hard hitting highly energized and intermingled rythms and vocals. Replace by track after relentlessly whiney or meloncholy track.    You keep waiting for that one sizzler to take you out of your seat but it never materalizes :-(    I was amazed by Hybrid Theory and transformed instantly into a huge fan of LP.  Hybrid Theory litterally was a permanent fixture in my trucks CD player for two years until Reanimation was released.    Reanimation kept the intrigue and energy alive even though it was Hybrid-redux.  And Meteora sunk the hook even deeper and made me hope LP's next release was months not years away.    Minutes to Midnight leaves me asking the questions: What happened? Who died?    I think the answer is Linkin Park.      I'll be sticking to the past releases, putting MtM on the shelf and I'll definately be listening to someone elses copy of their next release before I drop $15-$25 into the LP coffer again :(    UPDATE (11/4/2007): I originally rated this two stars out of my respect for Mike and Chaz but wish could re-rate this a ONE star!    After my last post I all but forgot I had the CD until my wife came across it a few days ago :-(    After playing it two more times through it officially went in the garbage (literally)!
009917961X|5.0|Rudy Baylor hasn't even passed the bar yet. but he's about to get the case of a lifetime.  Insurance company Great Benefit has committed a possible malpractice in repeatedly denying the claims of Donny Ray Black, a 21-year old suffering from severe leukemia who doesn't have very long at all to live.  Not only will they not recognize their claims, but they won't pay out any insurance money for Donny Ray to get treatment.  Somehow, this case falls into Rudy's lap, and he's determined to get these people the settlement they deserve. But since he's been fired from two different law firms in the span of about a month, he's a bit strapped for luck- not to mention cash.  Soon, not only does he have to deal with the rigors of a trial that has caught national attention, but he also has to haggle with an aging landlord who views Rudy as her own personal lawn workhorse, a boss with less than scrupulous business practices, and a young beautiful woman who has fallen hopelessly in love with him- and has a brutally abusive husband to boot.  If Rudy ever feels in over his head, it's probably because he is!!<br /><br />The Rainmaker is to me Grisham's best novel yet.  It's the only novel from Grisham that I've ever been able to laugh out loud at (which I did in multiple parts) and even cry at (although I do admit I was ecstatic when Rudy killed Cliff, Kelly's abusive husband; he's the only character in the novel I wanted to see murdered, at least similar to the way he treated Kelly.  So yes, I was happy when he got offed).  If only Grisham's other novels were this good, I'd be reviewing them like this one:  only five hours after I finished the last page.
0767817664|5.0|Fright Night is a horror movie in its most simplistic form.  A teenage boy named Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale, \\"Herman's Head\\") believes that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon, \\"The Princess Bride\\") is a vampire.  Of course no one believes him, especially his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse, \\"Married with Children\\") and his buddy \\"Evil\\" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys, \\"Heaven Help Us\\").  Oh by the way, Evil Ed's classic line in this movie is, \\"Oh you're so cool Brewster.\\"<br /><br />Amy and Ed are concerned about Charlie's well being and figure humor his claims that his neighbor is a vampire.  So Amy and Ed go to speak to Peter \\"The Great Vampire Killer\\" Vincent (Roddy McDowall, \\"Planet of the Apes\\"), a burnt out horror movie star turned late night T.V. show host for campy horror films (mainly his own).  Charlie is a huge fan of Peter Vincent's work and conceders him a hero.  This is why Charlie's friends seek Peter out.  On the flip side, Amy and Ed are thinking Charlie's imagination is running amuck about Jerry because of all of his Peter Vincent viewing.  Anyway I digress; Amy and Ed talk to Peter about their friend Charlie and the obsession that Jerry is a vampire.  Now how two teenage kids are able to convince a movie star (burnt out or not) to speak with their \\"potential\\" insane friend, still befuddles me.  Anyway, after some pretty definitive proof, it is discovered that Jerry REALLY IS A VAMPIRE!  Charlie's confirmation is now fact and the other characters are quite shocked at this finding.<br /><br />I will not give away any details or spoil this flick for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Fright Night is really a fun movie and yes it does have some creepy and scary parts to it.  I will also add that the movie has some pretty good special effects, they really aren't that cheesy.  This movie was also made in 1985, which is the zenith of the 1980s, however this movie really doesn't seem dated.  As a matter of fact, it is quite possible this movie is as relative today as it was back in 1985.  The one part of the movie that could be abased for having a 1980s flare is the night club scene.  There is the peachy music, \\"colorful\\" outfits and the hair sprayed hair.  Then again, 1980s fashion is somewhat neo in these contemporary times, so it might not seem so dastardly.  Ultimately, this movie isn't overshadowed by the fact that it was made in the 1980s.<br /><br />Now when I say that this is the best vampire movie ever made, that is exactly what I mean.  This movie has nothing to do with Dracula it is a basic vampire movie, so any comparisons with a Dracula is dubious.  Hence Fright Night it is a marvelous vampire movie, not a marvelous Dracula Movie.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is also really good; Chris Sarandon is smooth and suave as a vampire.  He makes being a creature of the undead look like a lot of fun.  Roddy McDowall is awesome as Peter Vincent (I love the throwback to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price in the character's name); he is dichotomy in his grapples with believing in vampires and faith.  I think this was a bold performance by McDowall.  William Ragsdale did a good job as Charlie.  He looked a bit older than a 17 year old teenager, but then again this type of realism isn't why I am watching Fright Night.  If that was the logic, then Elizabeth Shue was way too hot to be a hooker in Leaving Las Vegas.  Consequently, these are the little persnickety thoughts I place into the box labeled \\"it is only a movie\\".  Amanda Bearse was also fine as Amy, being both reserved and sexy.  Stephen Geoffreys was also quite vexing in a jovial sort of way in his performance as Evil Ed.  I also like how Jerry's \\"roommate\\" looks like a Xerox of Bill Paxton.  Did anyone else notice that or was it just me?<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it is presented in letterbox/widescreen.  There are several subtitles that can be utilized, so it is foreign speaking friendly.  The original preview/trailer is included, which is somewhat a disappointment.  It seems rather a mundane promotion for such a great movie.  Nevertheless, it is cool that the trailer itself is included on the DVD.<br /><br />Fright Night is great horror movie period.  It also spawned a pretty good sequel in Fright Night 2.  However, Fright Night stands fine by itself and I wish future vampire movies would use this movie as a paradigm.  Mainly by having a basic story, good characters/acting performance and special effects that don't totally rely on computer graphics. Overall, a timeless piece of horror cinema which I am sure will still be enjoyed for many years to come.included, which is somewhat a disappointment.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|the show is average at best.<br /><br />Little bit too overloaded with \\"characters\\" shifting the music towards background. The CD is really good and approaches long time fans as well as new friends. \\"Strawberry fields forever\\" and \\"Octopus Gardens\\" are exceptional, \\"All you need is love\\" to much for the show than for listening.<br /><br />Actually my review title is a little misleading as this is not a remix but using some instrumental lines from other songs underlying the titles. Again reference to the above mentioned Strawberry and Octopus.<br /><br />Overall good but don't expect anything real new but nice quality Beatles music.
1591841666|1.0|The book presents an interesting concept: that some poeple stick with activites (job, relationships etc) longer than they should.  Also, some people quit the same things instead of plugging away at them.  This seems simple, but sometimes it is worth stepping back and looking at the simple things.  But the book can not possibly deliver on its title.  There is no way a book can tell you when to quit and when not to quit.  The \\"dip\\", as defined, is highly subjective and varies based on the person and on the activity.  I am not sure how usefull this book is; I found myself looking back on  aspects of my life and thinking \\"should I have quit? or stuck it out?\\" which is a remarkably unhealthy excercise.  If you are going to get some life guidance from a book, it is probably best to get something a little more comprehensive.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|This is hands down one of the best movies from the 80's.  It is the BEST Sylvester Stallone movie every made.  It has a little something for everyone... Need a little action?

Seriously what more is there?  I do not understand how you people could give this movie anything under 4 stars.  I think all the low reviews are just Stallone haters.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|The songlist looked amazing, but the effect of this reminds me of \\"Stars on 45\\" - ie. a medley - rather than the songs I'd liked.  Yes, the Beatles tracks have been enhanced but I guess I'm a traditionalist and didn't quite enjoy this treatment, which detracts and distracts for me.  Would I enjoy it with the Cirque show?  Probably.  But I prefer my Beatles unadorned.

0385340559|4.0|If there can be a fictional character that epitomizes living in the moment, that character has to be Jack Reacher.  Since leaving the MPs, he's drifted along.  But when something gets his attention, he's a spring-loaded weapon.<br /><br />In Bad Luck and Trouble, Lee Child, shows us other dimensions of Reacher . . . when the immediate solutions aren't obvious, while working with part of a former MP team, and connecting with a woman he's been interested in for a long time.  That doesn't turn Reacher into Robert Parker's Jesse Stone, but it does round out his character in ways that are promising for future books.<br /><br />In the previous books, Reacher's drifter status was symbolized by traveling with only a travel toothbrush and the clothes he is wearing.  Reacher finds that he has to modernize himself a bit by also carrying his passport and an ATM card.  It's harder to get to his money otherwise.<br /><br />As the book opens, Reacher finds an unexpected amount in his bank account.  He quickly checks to see if it's an error . . . since he's down to his last few bucks.  The bank confirms that there's no error and he persuades the bank manager to help him find out who made the deposits.  Bingo, it's a former MP colleague, Frances Neagley, and the amount transmits extra meaning to Reacher.  He calls Frances and is told by her assistant to find her in LA.  Reacher uses his ATM card to buy a ticket and heads to where he would go if he were staying in LA.<br /><br />What's the fuss?  One of the old team, Calvin Franz, has been murdered. Frances has been trying to reach the remaining members of the team with no success.  Immediately, Reacher and Frances wonder if someone is targeting the team.<br /><br />From there, the story develops along the lines of trying to solve the murder of Franz, locating the rest of the old team, and dealing with the mystery they uncover that appears to have caused Franz's death.<br /><br />Although the story certainly has action sequences, there's much more investigating than action in the book.  A lot of the book's appeal depends on Reacher finding himself in luxurious surroundings (which makes him acutely uncomfortable) and in seeing him take on a formal leadership role instead of acting as a lone ranger.  It's also fun to see how his former colleagues respond to him.<br /><br />To me, the book had two major weaknesses.  First, there are a number of apparent errors in technical matters (here are a few examples:  The corporate headquarters of a defense contractor has little security; Lake Arrowhead is not on the fast route between Victorville and LA; and the final two ATM deposits he receives seem too small).  Those errors destroy your sense of being in the story because you start puzzling over the inconsistencies rather than thinking about the story.  Second, Reacher is compulsively translating every number into several different measurements and dimensions.  It gets old pretty quickly.  If Reacher were really that fascinated with numbers, wouldn't he spend some time every day with activities that intrigue number lovers?  It undermines the character portrait to have him ignore that element.<br /><br />The ultimate mystery itself is a minor weakness in the book.  Reacher repeatedly fails to follow up on clues that would have resolved the mystery much sooner.  Why would a crack investigator be so sloppy, especially when he had lots of people to help him?in the book.

B000RJO578|5.0|We are very nearly through the first half of 2007 and I'm happy to report that HOT FUZZ is easily the funniest movie that I have seen so far this year.  I loved Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous film, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, and am delighted to report that this is every bit as funny at that one, if not funnier.<br /><br />The film concerns a highly decorated London police officer who is so good at his job that he is shunted off to an assignment in the country because he is so good he makes the rest of the force look bad.  Sanford would seem to be an impossibly idyllic place, winner several times of the top village in England award.  But it is a town that houses mysteries, which our hero Nick Angel gradually uncovers.  Most of the film should be predictable, but it is a credit to Wright and Pegg that it isn't.  Even the big ending, the week point in most such movies, is a delight.  Despite a lot of action and special effects and explosions it is never taken over by them.  It remains fresh and surprising to the very end.  Although the plot is surprisingly interesting for a comic romp, this would be a fun film without it.  The gags are consistently brilliant throughout and every one is executed marvelously.  This is a much slicker film than SHAUN OF THE DEAD was, though that wasn't in any way unpolished.<br /><br />The cast is a large one and they manage to bring the village of Sandford to life in convincing fashion.  Pegg is paired with Nick Frost, his costar in SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  The cast is littered with well-known actors such as Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Billie Whitelaw, Bill Nighy, Stephen Merchant, and Martin Freeman as well as a rich and varied cast of lesser-known performers.  The great thing about this is that the actors really enhance the film.  What I mean is that the success of SHAUN OF THE DEAD meant that they could hire a cast of better-known performers. Sometimes this can lead to a decline in the quality of projects (watch Robert Rodriguez's EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO back to back and you'll see how a no name cast can free up a director while a big name cast can inhibit one), but that absolutely didn't happen here.<br /><br />The film is littered with in jokes and cultural references.  There are also a number of references to SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but it isn't important to get any of these to enjoy the movie.  There are also, according to Edgar Wright, a couple of nice cameos, though we have to take his word for it since neither is recognizable.  The crazed Santa that stabs Angel near the beginning of the film is, says Wright, Peter Jackson, while his ex-girlfriend Jeanine is Cate Blanchett.  Again, we have to take his word for it because her entire scene is played with a surgical mask over her face so that all we see are a pair of eyes that do indeed look like they could belong to Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />As anyone can tell, I loved this movie.  I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone.bert Rodriguez's EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO back to back and you'll see how a no name cast can free up a director while a big name cast can inhibit one), but that absolutely didn't happen here.   <br /> <br />The film is littered with in jokes and cultural references.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|If you've watched Tim Burton's wonderful 1989 interpretation of \\"Batman\\", then you probably know that almost none of the other films in the franchise lived up to that film, especially Joel Schumacher's turkey \\"Batman & Robin\\", a film that was more like a commercial for Happy Meals than an actual movie. \\"Batman Begins\\" is something completely different. No, really it is; It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the four other films, and it is the first live-action Batman movie to actually explain his origin. While the Burton/Schumacher films focused more on the insane villains rather than on the hero, \\"Begins's\\" focus is on Batman's story. Speaking of villains, there are about three: There's Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist who, under the guise of \\"The Scarecrow\\", poisons people with psychotropic drugs in order to make them have terrifying visons. Irish actor Cillian Murphy plays the character with unnerving calm, menace, and sardonic wit (At one point, he lights Batman on fire, telling him to \\"lighten up\\"). Tom Wilkinson plays Carmine Falcone, a ruthless crime boss who has the city of Gotham \\"bought and paid for\\". And then there's another mysterious figure who poses an even bigger threat to the city, someone who Bruce Wayne himself once had as a mentor. I will not give the indentity of this character away, as it will spoil one of the biggest plot points of the movie. A huge theme of the movie is how screwed up the criminal justice system is. At one point, we see a judge who apparently is associated with Carmine Falcone, even eating in the same restaurant with him. Overall, this is a story about the life of a man dissillusioned with the way justice is handled in the city and decides to take it into his own hands, and it is not about cartoonish special effects or over-the-top villains.
0465092756|3.0|Here is the message of this book: <br /> <br />1. Science has always consisted of ideas/hypotheses/theories that were either substantiated or refuted by analysis or experiment. <br /> <br />2. String theory is an idea that has been pursued for around 20 years with no analytical or experimental substantiation (or refutation), and none in the foreseeable future. <br /> <br />3. Meanwhile, because of all the hoopla surrounding string theory, it has attracted almost all of the funding for advanced physics research, to the detriment of other possible lines of investigation. <br /> <br />Woit writes 19 excruciating chapters to convey this simple message.

Now it is available upon DVD which means it has a very good quality picture reproduction from the celluloid original upon which it was originally recorded and the audio is as good as it was in the theatre. I just need to acquire the audio components upon which to listen to this movie so I can visually and aurally go back in time, also I can watch it over & over and not have to worry about tape degradation. Amazon.com made acquiring this movie a very good and most cost effective endeavor for me; I will be a customer for the rest of my life and encourage friends of mine to shop @ Amazon.com.
B00004TH83|5.0|I first heard Lara Fabian's \\"Givin' Up On You\\" when I was doing a summer study in Montreal in 2001.  I called the local radio station and explained I was an American visiting and wanted to know who \\"That singer with the awesome voice was.\\"  The programming manager was very polite, and told me I'd better buy Fabian's CD while I was in Montreal because I likely couldn't find it in the States. <br /> <br />Well, 6 years later (7 after this CD debuted) and I see this is one of the best-reviewed CD's to date, and for good reason: this is what music should be.  Passionate, soulful, emotional.  Every song tells a story, and the music and words match so perfectly that every song is a story in which you can immerse yourself.  No sitting there thinking \\"This is a weak track\\" - there are always some songs you'll like better than others, but the high level of artistic value is present in every song on this CD. <br /> <br />In my collection of about a thousand CD's, I have less than 10 that I would consider a \\"Must buy.\\"  This is one of those CD's.
0618680004|5.0|This is one fine book. I liked it so much I had to read it a second time. I have read Mr Dawkins before however I feel that this time he has hit the nail on the head(so to speak). I am not surprised that it is a best seller. This should be required reading for anyone who has any doubts about god and religion.This book should go a very long way in making unbelievers out of believers.

0060530839|4.0|Four siblings--Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are staying clear of the war in England by staying in a huge old house in the country with an old professor.  As they are left alone most of the time, the children are free to wander and explore the huge house.  One day while exploring, Lucy steps into a wardrobe, and walks into another world, the world of Narnia.  There she finds that she is not in the wardrobe anymore but is instead in a forest of trees, covered in snow.  She meets a faun and spends the afternoon having tea with him.  The faun confides that a wicked queen rules the land, making it always wintertime and never Christmas, and that he has sworn to bring any humans he finds directly to her.  There is a prophesy that someday four humans will come to sit in the thrones of the castle and that the queen will be defeated.  Lucy convinces the faun to let her go, though. <br /> <br />When Lucy returns to her sister and brothers, none of them believes that she has really been anywhere, and she is very upset.  Soon afterward, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and is shocked to discover that his sister was telling the truth.  Unable to find her in Narnia, though, he meets the wicked queen who charms him and makes him promise to bring her his brother and sisters. <br /> <br />Soon afterward, all four children find themselves caught in Narnia.  Peter and Susan and Lucy are eager to meet Aslan, the great lion who is said to be coming near to end the eternal winter.  But Edmund sneaks off to announce the presence of his siblings to the queen.  Peter, Susan and Lucy are now in trouble.  Will they be able to avoid being taken by the queen?  Will they help their brother come over to the side of good? <br /> <br />I liked the descriptions of Narnia and the way things worked there.  It's a great mythology.  I also liked Aslan's character and the ways he handled problems that came up.  I thought that Edmund's turnaround seemed too easy, though.  He semed to slip from one side to the other with no effort.  I also didn't like that the story of the children growing up happened too quickly, without incident.  The end of the book went by much too quickly.
0151013047|3.0|****************ATTENTION ~ SPOILER********************* <br /> <br />Mr. Hamid certainly caught my attention with his opening in a Lahore marketplace. The love he emits when speaking about Lahore was totally contagious and made me long for the particular setting, in the particular bazaar, with the exact atmosphere he described.  <br /> <br />The book started off in a great way. He really made me want to keep reading. I loved how Changez tells his guest of his true inner feelings about the 9-11 attacks. It was a very bold move as a character and as a writer of a book. This one category truly makes the book stand out. However, I was very disappointed at the amateur and disappointing events that followed up to the ending. <br /> <br />Throughout the novel I was looking for a fundamentalist who perhaps finds his true self after overcoming his insecurities and obstacles. Instead I found Changez to be a bad excuse for a Muslim who did better off with himself in the beginning of the novel and just went straight downhill from when 9-11 occurred. One would assume his downfall was due to the aftermath of 9-11 with difficulties at work, his circle of friends, community or fight with his inner self at wanting to become a better Muslim. Rather, he let himself go due to a failed relationship with his girlfriend who was still in love with her previous (dead) boyfriend. He ended up getting fired due to his carelessness at work, lost his H-1 visa and had to go back to Pakistan.  <br /> <br />As a girl I love reading chick literature and sappy novels. I expected this book to be of a bit different nature. By reading the title and excerpt I didn't expect this book's ending to be so cowardly. I expected a bit more of a heroic tale. I wouldn't call it a twist even...it was more of a disaster.  <br />
B000MQC9H4|5.0|\\"The Holiday\\" put a smile on my face.  It is a heartwarming romantic film that winds up being a blast of good cheer for the holidays.  Director Nancy Meyers has one Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for [[ASIN:6304696558 Private Benjamin (Full Screen Edition)]] and did [[ASIN:B0001AVZA8 Something's Gotta Give]] with Diane Keaton & Jack Nicholson and [[ASIN:B00003CXQS What Women Want]] with Helen Hunt & Mel Gibson.  She hits the right chords in this romantic genre again.<br /><br />Kate Winslet who was once nominated for a picture titled \\"Iris\\" plays the character Iris.  Winslet is an interesting actress who has been nominated for 27 various film awards including 5 Oscars and has only won two smaller awards as Best Supporting Actress for \\"Iris\\" by the L.A. Film Critics and for \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" by the Screen Actors Guild.  While I think my favorite film performance of hers was in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" I found it interesting in the DVD extras her comments on how pleased she was to try comedy.  The scene with the split phone call where she has Diaz and Law on the other ends & keeps connecting with the wrong one is hilarious.  She does a charming job throughout the film.<br /><br />Jack Black plays \\"Miles.\\"  I think I will always think of him as the guy who Bruce Willis blows his arm off in [[ASIN:0783226888 The Jackal - Collector's Edition]].  Seeing him as an offbeat romantic lead was not as great a thrill as seeing him spurt blood and run mindlessly around a meadow.  But hopefully even guys who don't look like Jude Law will be inspired to one day find their true love.  As a film music composer, Black was most interesting in Blockbuster where he knew the scores to random movies.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz has a smile that is as wide as the state of North Carolina.  From her films like \\"There's Something About Mary,\\" \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Vanilla Sky\\" & \\"Gangs of New York,\\" she's shown her ability to fit in a wide number of film genres.  She captures our attention as Amanda who heads off to England after breaking up with Ed Burns' character.<br /><br />Jude Law is impressive as an actor.  He fits into the romantic comedy genre effortlessly as Graham who is a young widowed father with two small children.  The girls who play his kids Sophie and Olivia are darling.  I'm not sure if he clicks as deeply as he did as Inman with Nicole Kidman in \\"Cold Mountain,\\" but we feel a connection and hope the lovers get together.  (One recent high school graduate who watched the film with me commented that Jude Law & Johnny Depp are God's gift to women.  ...I smiled...)<br /><br />Eli Wallach who was over 90 years old when this was filmed plays Arthur, a screenwriter who Iris connects with while on holiday.  Rufus Sewell from [[ASIN:B00005JMH8 Helen of Troy]] plays Jasper who breaks Iris' heart & tries to keep her on a string.<br /><br />I found it interesting that all of these characters worked for the media from a film trailer editor to a music score composer to a screenwriter to a book editor to a newspaper writer.  While we might have had a variety of occupations like a plumber, a piano tuner or a construction contractor, the similarity of occupation was not a major distraction.<br /><br />I found the interplay between Los Angeles & England to be a delight.  A good love story may not differ that much in its essentials from story to story, but this one is done with great style & lifted my spirits.  I hope it does your too.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|My girlfriend really likes him and I must agree with her.  He has a great voice and records great songs.  I recommend all his albums.  See him live, the shows are even better.
1400063515|5.0|I finished the book last night and, having read \\"Fooled\\" previously (as well as \\"Dynamic\\") I liked it a lot.  The topics the author explores will be heavily debated by scholars, practitioners, proto-philosophers, philosophers, and others (including Zegna-tie wearing, dark suited men of commerce). <br /> <br />I found that this book explored more of the human side of Taleb than \\"Fooled\\".  The reader gets some insights to his life, his past (good and bad), and his passions.  His story-telling (to make a particular point) is fantastic and very relevant (even if you disagree with the outcome) but that is precisely what makes this book very relevant. <br /> <br />I disagree with some of the readers' comments posted here - and quite frankly they are starting to sound more \\"bloggish\\" than informative - this is not a book for newbies, the material is elegantly written but only to those equally elegantly open-minded.  In my view it offers a glimpse into a different way of thinking (of living, of trading, etc.) than the standard fare. <br /> <br />I liked it, it's been a very long while since I've seen or read anything original or thought provoking and this fit the bill.  I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />
0345477618|5.0|Excellent book!  Not only for Star Wars fans such as myself, but I could see how young aspiring movie-makers would love this story.

B000001EGE|4.0|The first three Elton John albums found many pegging him as a singer/songwriter, and the more straightforward songs among \\"[[ASIN:B000001EG6 Elton John]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000001EG4 Tumbleweed Connection]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000001EGC Madman Across the Water]]\\" were certainly easy to construe as such. But then came \\"Honky Chateau,\\" where Elton's tentative steps into more rock territory found traction. Many of the trademarks of those early albums are still here (the naked emotionalism, the fascination with America's rural south), but he was also discovering the edge - like Jon Luc Ponty's violin solo on \\"Amy\\" -that concert goers had been buzzed with.<br /><br />The first single, \\"Honky Cat,\\" was the harbinger. Set more to a New Orleans piano roll than any previous song, it was poppier than any of his other singles. \\"Rocket Man\\" immediately raised the bar. Riding the same trail David Bowie and Major Tom did, \\"Rocket Man\\" followed a space oddity of an astronaut with job satisfaction issues; \\"It's just my job, five days a week.\\" These two hits pushed Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin off and away from their past labels and moved then onto a fast lane towards rock stardom. Throughout the other songs on the album, Elton's strength for melodies was in full bloom and his confidence was growing, while Bernie's words were as oblique as ever (which was one of his strongest suites).<br /><br />That motion was also significantly aided by the codification of Elton's band. Stalwarts Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray and Davey Johnston sounded terrific here, recording as Elton's backing for the first time. They matched Elton's flair, making songs like \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" and \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" spark. Gus Dudgeon obviously understood what Elton was aiming for and kept his production to a more minimal level than on the other albums. The result was the first Elton John album to reflect the personality that would come to dominate the public image of his showmanship. It also became the first of Elton's seven consecutive #1 albums.seven consecutive #1 albums.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|The SB-400 Speedlight offered by Nikon turns out to be an excellent accessory for \\"snapshot\\" photography on many of Nikons digital cameras. I use a D200 with an SB600 flash normally but finding the 400 series is far lighter and has enough power for relaxed shooting such as gatherings. <br /> <br />While its not the most powerful flash nor has the SB600 and SB800's arsenol of features its a nice blend of minimal features and includes a built in bounce. - I use this quite often with pleasing results. <br /> <br />The SB 400 does what the built in flash of my D200 should have done and failed. The built in flash not only is weak but does not clear my most used lenses (thus throws a shadow on the image where the lens blocked the flash POV). The SB 400 clears my most used lenses (ultra wide zoom and wide to tele zoom). <br /> <br />A nice accessory to the flash would be a 1-2 inch spacer between the camera and the flash itself for even better shooting and minimalizing red eye when not shooting in red eye mode. <br /> <br />All in all, very pleased with this purchase other than being a bit over priced.

B0000067L2|5.0|Disraeli Gears is Creams second studio recording after Fresh Cream. The name came from a Driver commenting on racing bikes when Ginger and Clapton were disscussing bikes in the car. They thought it was funny so they named the album after the joke. Ginger Baker was once a racing cyclist which helped develop the strong leg muscles for the drums.  <br /> <br />Strange Brew is the first track on the album. This combines pop with the blues. The guitar riff is from a Little Walter song \\"Everythings Gonna Be Alright.\\" This song was the first one to be recorded for the album, but it was gonna be a cover of a Junior Wells tune \\"Hey Lawdy Mama.\\" But their manager wanted to be on the London radio show Top of the Pops so Felix Papaladi (producer) wrote the lyrics for a pop song. Clapton let this go cause he was able to play a blues solo.  <br /> <br />Sunshine of Your Love is probably the most recognizable riff in all classic rock music. Written after an all night session, Pete Brown saw the sun come up... \\"It's getting near dawn...\\" Jack Bruce took his double bass and came up with that jazzy riff that just pulls your ears in like magnets. During the recording sessions, the engineer Tom Dowd suggested Ginger Baker to play an Indian like drum pattern like in the old western movies. The sound just pulls everything together and Ginger is still able to show off and break up the beat to make it his own.  <br /> <br />Tales of Brave Ulysses is a combination of music composed by Clapton and lyrics by an artist named Martian Sharp who designed the cover. It's also the introduction to the Wah Wah pedal which sounds so clean and fitting to the song. SWLABR stands for she walks like a bearded rainbow. This songs about a man defacing a picture of his x girlfriend because of the break up.  <br /> <br />We're Going Wrong is about an argument Jack had with his wife. The sounds build steadily like their trying to reach somewhere but not quite reaching the peak. Jacks voice is at its best.  <br/> <br />Outside Woman Blues is a great cover of a Blind Joe Reynolds song which is great for an electric guitar. Clapton was great at giving old blues tunes new life. <br /> <br />Take It Back is an anti Vietnam song about a draftee ripping up the draft card. Overall this is Creams best record, combining great inventive sounds.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|One of my biggest challenges in managing my desk is finding a way to maximize available space so that I can use my Tablet PC for sketching *and* a larger screen for coding. Unfortunately my desk it quite small so a 19\\" or 20\\" LCD was just too big for a corner style area...but I bought one anyway. I ended up having to choose between one or the other until I purchased this arm that not only holds my screen but also allows for easy manipulation to swing it out from the desk while I sketch.  <br /> <br />I plan on purchasing another one of these soon and the Ergotron Tablet adapter so I can manipulate the screen toward an angle better for drawing. Regardless, the arm is sturdy and well built - I highly recommend it over leaving screens on their stand.
B000ASATWQ|4.0|I love the title track, Welcome to Jamrock.  It's an awesome song.  The rest of the cd was pretty good.
0743454537|4.0|A wonderful book with a fascinating and beautifully written look at an unusual topic. Please don't read the rest of this review if you haven't read the book.  At the end of the book there is an accident and one of the drivers is epileptic with frequent seizures.  I used to know someone who had epileptic seizures who was not allowed to drive by the state unless she could prove she hadn't had any seizures within a fairly long period of time.  After I finished the book I checked the internet to see if any state allows people with active seizures to drive.  I could not find one state that would allow this under any circumstances.  I wonder how a prolific writer with a team of researchers could make such a glaring error.  I don't understand why it had to be that person driving and because of this I subtracted one star and thought about taking more.  I know others were disappointed with the ending, but I think it was a very interesting twist despite the epileptic driver.

Because of Michael Scott's carefully constructed multidimensional characters and his remarkable and captivating take on history and mythology, The Alchemyst is a definite MUST READ for all adults and children.  This is a perfect gift for every kid as well as an amazing read for any book club.  Only Flamel could make Potter passe.  This is truly a page turner!!
B000O179EA|3.0|This is a great movie, and the previous comment gives youthe storyline.

B00003CXWV|2.0|I bought this the other day on a whim at a garage sale. <br /> <br />First off, a technical matter:  where the hell is the closed captioning on this DVD?  I have a hard time understanding what's being said unless I can also read someone's lips.  On a 14\\" TV, that's not always possible.  Thus, I appreciate closed captioning. I am sure deaf people do too.  This is the first DVD I've seen in a long time that does not include it in the standard features, or if it does, I sure as hell couldn't find it. <br /> <br />Second, the movie itself:  at a certain point I lost all sympathy for George Jung.  You can root for a small-time pot dealer who is in cahoots with a stewardess to smuggle marijuana cross-country.  Even as his greed gets the best of him, nobody's getting killed, nobody's dying of overdoses.  But it's hard to have much sympathy for a character who works for a drug lord who shot a man in cold blood at the \\"job interview.\\"   <br /> <br />Jung knew firsthand the damage cocaine was doing to his friends' and wife's health.  He saw with his own eyes the damage it was doing to innocent people in Columbia.  He wasn't just an addict without the willpower to stop himself from doing another line.  He was running the largest drug-smuggling ring in the country.   <br /> <br />Boo hoo.  He lost his daughter's trust when he didn't show up to take her to California.  That trip wasn't meant to make Kristina Jung happy, it was to prove to himself that he was at heart a good dad.   <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that irritates me precisely because it could have been excellent.  I don't mean that it should have become an anti-drug screed (few things are more tiresome than those), but it could have been vastly improved by the director and screenwriter having more emotional distance from Jung.  The problem is not that Jung believes the things he tells himself about himself, it is that Ted Demme does too. <br /> <br />Also, I have yet to see a movie with Penelope Cruz in itin which she does not completely annoy me.

630542845X|4.0|Ok, here's the deal with Powder....  Apparently the guy who wrote and directed it was convicted as a child molester!!!!  Oh my gawd!  Yeah.  True story.  My wife won't even entertain the thought of watching this movie lest she become tainted by some underlining pedophile message transcoded in the subtext of the movie.  Hmmmm.  I remember way back when this movie came out and I saw the preview at the theater.  I kinda wanted to see it.  But then the whole child-molester thing came to surface and years went by.  Well, I finally bout it of Amazon for like five bucks and I gave it a try.  Know whart?  It was pretty damn good.  Sure the whole freaky-looking outcast with super powers thing has been done, but this was a decent flick.  Jeff Goldblum and Steenburgen co-star.  Sean Michael Flannery is fantastic as Powder in all his shy, wounded frailty.  Overall, I liked it.  So... push the whole sex-offender thing asidE and give Powder a try.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Dig it!

B000M341QO|4.0|I think Martin Scorsese has waited a long time to be honored for his work, and winning the Oscar for the Departed was a fittting tribute. This crime drama pits the good guys and the bad guys in each others' camps and keeps you wondering right up to the end. It's good to see Matt Damon stretching his acting chops to be the bad guy.  His baby-face looks usually lend him to be the good guy, which he does quite well. But playing the smarmy weasel in The Departed works well, too, since he is the last to be suspected. A resounding \\"Well done\\" to all of the cast and to Mr. Scorsese.
0385493622|4.0|Though some parts of it were way over my head (suffice it to say that math has never been my strong suit), it was still an interesting history of math and the seemingly unsolvable theorem that plagued it for hundreds of years.  It was really fascinating to see how passionate some people are about math, how they have the sort of strong emotions for their subject that I traditionally ascribe to artists.  This book did a really nice job of showing the astounding potential of the human mind and it offered some pretty astonishing history of the study of mathematics.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was very awed and humbled by this amazing series.  I have never before seen anything like it.  The camera work is incredible, I have no idea how many of the shots were filmed!  It's release comes at such an important time.  We so sorely need to be reminded that our environment is suffering at our hands, and that we need to realize our responsibility in protecting ecosystems and animals that now find themselves threatened and struggling to survive in the wake of human development.  Allowing the world a glimpse of some of the most threatened species helps to promote awareness and appreciation of the planet we live on.  May it help us to remember, extinction is forever.
1594489505|5.0|Mr. Hosseini says he writes stories because he has sad tales to tell.  I am not quoting him exactly but about a week ago, while I was reading this novel, he was on C-span giving a reading and answering questions from a select audience.<br /><br />He said that we all want the same things, people are universal:  we want to feed our children, have a roof over our heads, good health, etc.  The two main characters in this book, the two women, do want these things: they want love, tenderness and to cherish and feel the love from children. That being said, there is a sharp contrast to the cruelty and inhuman treatment of the Taliban to women and other sects.  This story depicts the cruelest husbands and other men locked into a society based on religion.  Vengeance is acceptable in the name of religion or master power, sound familiar? Whether it's an Aphgan, Iraqi or Nazi, these people find no problem killing and beating each other.<br /><br />In Mr. Hosseini's story, there are two women from different backgrounds.  We are initially introduced to a girl, born out of wedlock, as she waits in squalor for her natural father to visit her.  Her mother tells her she will have a terrible life and she is right.  The other woman has a wonderful, educated father and is introduced to love at a young age.  Both dissimilar women end up married to the same tyrant and the reader is caught up in his manipulation and dead serious cruelty to women, including little girls.  There is some ray of hope but not until we vicariously experience the awful sufferings of these two women.  I loved the book, but it's hard for me to believe that most people want the life of security and love Mr. Hosseini pontificates.  Two Taliban could kill a 100 women in the blink of an eye.
B00006LFGD|5.0|AWESOME DUETS WITH BARBRA AND EVEN FRANK SINATRA!!  NOT SURE IF HIS VOICE WAS ENTERED ELECTRONICALLY SINCE HE HAS BEEN GONE A WHILE.  BUT GREAT ALBUM FOR ANY FAN.
B00022LRXA|5.0|With this album, Brian Eno left behind pop songwriting to embark upon his \\"ambient music\\" period.  B&AS makes a wonderful farewell to pop music and stands as his most complete pop album.  Although the structure of the original album has been lost with the move to CD format, it is worth remembering that the first 5 songs appeared on side 1 of the album and the remainder on side 2.  Viewed from this perspective, it is tempting to relate the title to the album structure: side 1 is wild and manic, while side 2 is calm and melodic.  There are parallels in the number of songs and the number of instrumentals.  Although Eno never considered hiself a musician, his underrated singing is put to great use on this album, and his songwriting skill is clearly in evidence.  Others have given detailed descriptions of the songs, so I will restrict myself to the highlights: the typical lyrical silliness of \\"Backwater,\\" hearing Kurt Schwitters's infamous \\"Ur Sonata\\" -- and more silly lyrics -- on \\"Kurt's Rejoinder\\" (presaging Eno's found music experiments of \\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\\") and the placid beauty of \\"Spider and I.\\"<br /><br />Fans of Eno's ambient music will find much to like here and fans who come by way of Roxy Music and/or \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" will find a quieter, more thoughful and complex album in \\"Before and After Science.\\"  This is music that rewards repeated listening and which, nearly 30 years after its debut, still seems timely and interesting.
0385333846|5.0|Well, I'm hooked on a new author.  Vonnegut's writing style is addictive and quick witted.  A dry, ironic humor is laced into almost every page of this book.  The cold realism of war is always hidden just behind the smoked glass of this humor, but never feels like he's pounding you with it.   <br /> <br />Very simply, it's a non-linear story about a man who's mind cracks, and who bares witness to an event which is an all but non-existant footnote of WWII to my generation (80's baby).  So it goes.

0375831002|5.0|I picked this up at a bookstore just looking for a long read.  I had no idea I would be sitting with this book at 3 in the morning crying my eyes out a few weeks later.  This novel about a german girl and a jew's lives interconnecting is one of the most creative spins on WWII I have ever read.  This book enthrals you with its one of a kind characters, Zusak's beautiful words make you feel like you are there, experiancing life with them.  You really have to read this book to understand how amazing it is, all I know is that I will always remember how touching this book was, and how many emotions I felt while reading it.
B00011F5DK|5.0|It's difficult to buy a game that both my five and seven year old boys can play together.  Not only does my five-year-old understand how to play, he really enjoys it.  This is one of the few games that we all can play without someone being bored playing a kids' game.  My guys are pretty good at math/abstract thinking, and that might be some of the appeal.  I'm not normally a fan of games with lots of pieces, but I went to the company's website, and they'll send you any missing/lost pieces if you send a SASE.  We have LOTS of games, and this by far is our favorite.
0375830995|5.0|I read this after The Book Thief, my friend and I swapped books by Zusak.  I picked it up, and read it in a day.  After reading both books, I have found it is the characters who get to you.  I am the Messenger delivers people from every walk of life, and one man who loves them all.  Each one found a place into my heart, and I realized I know people just like them.  The ending was beautiful, one of those that makes you want to go out and make a difference in the world.  Zusak has secured himself in my favorite author list for sure!
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I erased my initial 3-star review because it wasn't totally fair. I watched this a second and third time, and I tell you, I'm almost ready to give this 5 stars, but I won't. The first time, I couldn't fully appreciate the crass humor, but I realize that it is a classic. But it's still a classic I'm unwilling to give 5 stars.     Along with the Wayans' brand of comedy, comes an unshakeable annoyance at some of their jokes because of their juvenility. Unlike White Chicks, the Wayans show no restraint with their toilet and sexual humor in Scary Movie. Why does every joke have to revolve around sex? Are the Wayans Brothers that sexually obsessed? All in all, it's a funny picture if you can abandon your decent sensibilities for a little while and just have fun. That's what I did, and I'll not hesitate to watch it again and again. Scary Movie is also the funniest in the 4 part series.
1591841666|5.0|This is a must-read book for anybody involved in making strategic business decisions and for a lot of people thinking about careers and personal decisions, too. It's about making hard decisions, in a way, and it gives a framework for evaluating hard decisions.<br /><br />Godin has a way of presenting ideas so that as you read them it seems like you've read something you always knew, and is obvious, and will be very easy to remember. Interestingly enough though, and very much to his credit, often it was the way he redigested and resythesized things that made it seem so obvious. This is a great talent.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I've not watched all 11 episodes yet but what I have begun doing is when we have company over and they want to see \\"HD\\" I pop in the episode they like the sound of most and start counting the number of times they say Wow! <br /> <br />They average about 6 wow's an episode.  Some have more, some less, but that's what it works out too, and even after watching a couple several times over I still sit wide-eyed as it is some of the most amazing footage ever shot. <br /> <br />The people involved in getting those shots deserve every accolade they get. <br /> <br />If you have a HD-setup then this collection is exactly what you got it for.  Beautiful, breathtaking imagery you've never seen before. <br />
0316018953|4.0|Harry Bosch is now firmly back into the loving arms of the Los Angeles Police Department following his spotted history.  He has been recruited into the Homicide Special Squad, an organization which seems to be the one where politically explosive investigations are assigned.  This is, of course perfect for Harry since he has spent his whole life stomping on the toes of the power elite.<br /><br />I would rather avoid the specifics of the plot if I can so as to avoid giving away anything.  The action, however starts with a execution-style murder at the overlook on Mulholland Drive.  Naturally, the crime is not a simple little Los Angeles murder, but one in which the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the new, politically powerful LAPD Homeland Security elite team become involved.  As is usual, every organization is pursuing its own self-interest to the consternation of Harry who is attempting to solve a murder.  I will go no further with the plot here, but I do have one personal comment to make.  I will make it in a very ambiguous manner so that I will not ruin the mystery for potential readers, but I may fumble this.  If you want to know nothing more, read no further here, but you might want to come back to read this note after you complete the book and see if you agree with me.<br /><br />NOTE: Early in this book, Harry comes across some evidence at the scene of the crime which seems to interest him a lot.  We get a complete description of this evidence and I, as a reader become interested in where this could lead.  I was disappointed when that evidence was only peripherally mentioned later in the book but never really pursued.  Harry is later, guided to his final solution of the case by another, unrelated curiosity (not truly evidence) which he does pursue.<br /><br />It was only after I completed the book and set it aside that I recalled the original, interesting evidence and thought that if Harry had followed through with that, he would probably have come to the same conclusion, but in a less complicated manner.  Why was it discarded in this book?  It is my feeling that the author is playing a game with his readers.  I think that if I am correct, then Bravo for Michael Connelly.  The nature of the mystery book today is far more complex than in the days of the old authors such as Doyle and Christie, but if I am right about the author playing with my mind, I would guess that Dame Agatha would probably echo my \\"Bravo\\".me to the same conclusion, but in a less complicated manner.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is a show that just keeps getting better and better with each passing season.  And this is only their 2nd season!!  If this show was put in a race between \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Charmed\\" (2 shows I liked), \\"Supernatural\\" would win by a mile!  The chemistry between Jensen and Jared is probably the best I have ever seen since \\"Angel\\" was on tv.  I mean for this show to essentially have a 2 person cast, it actually works and works very well.  Next to Bones and Booth on the Fox show \\"Bones\\", Sam and Dean have a fantastic 2-person combination that works very well.  They both have a great on screen presence together and actually act like brothers, and not some forced upon relatonship that most tv shows are doing nowadays.  I have to admit, before seeing season 1 I was a huge doubter of the show, because I just thought that it was about 2 pretty boys hunting in a Buffy rip off.  But after I saw the first few episodes and then the whole season, I became a quick fan of the show.  Why this show was on the bubble, I have no idea.  I mean this show is sooo much better than that \\"Top Model\\" crap!  That's the show that should have been on the bubble, not \\"Supernatural\\".  And if The CW gave this show the axe, I seriously would have written to the Sci-Fi channel to consider picking this show up, since \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" is coming to an end, which is strange considering that show's huge fanbase.  But that's another story.  To sum up, \\"Supernatural\\" is a great show and I would highly reccommend any sci-fi fan or even \\"Buffy\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"Charmed\\" fans to pick this box set up and add it to their collection.

B000Q6GUT8|5.0|This was a great movie.  I didn't see it in the theater, never even knew it was out there.  I saw it on a flight from Hawaii to LA and I wasn't really interested at first, but it draws you in quick, and before I knew it i was hooked and baited!  This film was awesome, i loved every minute of it and Mark Wahlberg is very sexy in his role as the ex-assasin turned mountain man.  I was really surprised it was as good as it was.  Never heard of the film before i was forced to watch it on a plane, but moved enough to write my first film review on Amazon.  I will buy this movie!
0743289412|1.0|The title of the novel \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a misnomer.  This is a tortured rendering of King's own nightmarish fantasies (not his first). The novel primarily is the recollection of the horrible childhood of Lisey's husband, the rest is padding. Lisey is just the sounding board.  Mr. King once again is trying to scare the reader.  At one point, the author uses an actual news story of \\"Ralph -- a lost dog's amazing return home\\", to justify the fiction writer's prerogative to invent just about anything.  So, Mr. King mixes fantasy and reality, but not very successfully.  The novel is much too long and repetitious.  It was a chore to get through it.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park were in a league of their own with their previous releases.  Their uncanny ability to blend rap and hard rock, hip-hop and metal enabled them to succeed where many others tried and failed.  Alas, that moment of brilliance was short-lived.  With Minutes to Midnight, Linkin Park have degenerated into a bunch of copycats sounding like many a corporate-manufactured rock band before them.   <br /> <br />Almost every track sounds like it could have come from any other dime-a-dozen rock band.  Some tracks sound like they could have been written by Jon Bon Jovi, for crying out loud! There wasn't a single track that had this listener saying \\"Yeah, that's the sound that only Linkin Park could pull off\\". So much for the band wanting to push their boundaries with this album. All they seem to have succeeded in pushing are the fans who've been with them since their first album - pushing them away, that is.  Maybe they should have done a jazz album instead - now THAT would have been pushing boundaries. <br /> <br />If spending 14 months (instead of the usual 3 to 6 months) on an album produces as mediocre a work as this, these chaps are better off spending just a couple of months and giving their fans the sounds that attracted them to band in the first place.  But that's making a very big assumption that they even care about what their fans want.  Maybe, just maybe, they could be trying to win over fans of Bon Jovi, Evanescence, Limp Bizkit and whoever else they seem to be trying to sound like.  Maybe they figured they'd sell more albums that way - rather than cater to their fans who crave a specific sound, let's have a bit of everything and hope more people buy the album that way. <br /> <br />Until these guys stop behaving like the confused teenagers they've seem to have turned into, this reviewer is placing his bets on Fort Minor.  While Fort Minor's debut album may not have been up there with Hybrid Theory or Meteora, at least it's way better than the sorry excusefor an album called \\"Minutes to Midnight\\".
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I'm a big fan of punk music as I'm a punk. As I've stated before, I'm not afraid to order my food at the drive thru in german and breakdance on the hood of my car. You won't do that, but that's why you are on Celine Dion's mailing list. That being said, I would put this album at #2 as far as the greatest punk albums ever right behind the Sex Pistols and just ahead of UB40. This album has something and that something is attitude. I can't believe how awesome the song \\"girlfriend\\" is. It's totally original and Avril at her cattiest. There are other great punk anthems on this things as well like \\"Hot\\" and \\"I don't have to try\\". You may want her to try, but she is simply telling you she doesn't have to. That is punk. If she were a soccer player, the coach would say, \\"Hey, Avril, come over here and do drills with the rest of the team.\\" You know what she would say? \\"I don't have to try.\\" and there is nothing the coach can do at that point because you're dealing with a punk. I listen to this CD when I'm cruising downtown and I want to stick the middle finger up at the man. I love Jojo and Olivia Newton John, but they just don't pack the tude that Avril does. This album is really edgy with it's guitars and drums and stuff. If I were to sum 41 it up (how bout that play on words?), I would say this album is Sex Pistols meets Oingo Boingo meets Pat Benatar. Yup, it has that kind of power. You need to buy this album or enjoy the next three weeks playing stratego with Jeff while listening to Buffalo Tom. I sold my shares of average a long time ago.
B00003XAQ5|4.0|This album never sounded this good before with one exception.  Davis's trumpet is in the center channel and ONLY in the center channel.  No bleed whatever right and left.  Likewise the drums are only right and the piano only left.  That is not the way I hear in a live setting.  This is obviously a direct conversion from the original three-track master with out-of-phase info added for the surrounds, but the recording obviously acoustically isolated each player.  Still, it's minor and shouldn't prevent you from buying.  SACD, if you have a good system, is the next step up in CD reproduction, but play this one in stereo, not surround.
B00005214X|4.0|The recording is excellent; the quality is very good and the material is vintage Harrison stuff... well done.  But why the bulky packaging?  This two-CD set should be in a standard-size double-disc jewel case so it could fit on our shelves or in portable CD carriers.  It's an important album for Harrison fans, but needs a better package!

B0002XL35G|4.0|Before you rush out and buy the \\"Paris, Texas\\" (1984) DVD based on the many glowing reviews and comments, you may want a bit of a reality check. The film is 145 minutes long, that's almost two and a half hours. And not much happens during this time. The pacing is about on the level of \\"The Straight Story\\" (1999), which was only 112 minutes; so if that film had you climbing the walls you should probably steer clear of this one.     On the other hand \\"Paris, Texas\\" is a technical masterpiece with great photography, excellent directing, and solid performances from the entire cast (although that cast is small). And it's a lyrically told story about loss, loneliness, and eccentricity; a look America and American values from an outside perspective (in this case European). I'm not sure that the film's message(s) is gotten across (unless you listen to the commentary feature on the DVD and maybe not even then) but it is certainly more coherent than when Michelangelo Antonioni tried to do the same thing in the early 1970's.    The film opens with a wanderer walking alone in the desert. You eventually learn that this is not Howard Hughes but Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), that he has been missing the past four years, has semi-amnesia (a lot is made of this but the condition is never adequately explained), has a seven year-old son name Hunter (Hunter Carson), and a wife named Jane (Nastassia Kinski). Kinski fans will be somewhat disappointed as she does not even appear until the last third of the film (except briefly in some grainy home movies).    The film could actually be classified as a \\"buddy picture-road movie\\" or two buddy picture- road movies. The first third features Travis and his brother's (Dean Stockwell) journey from Texas to LA, the final third Travis and his son's journey back to Texas. The weakest part is the middle third which serves little purpose other than providing some background details and linking the two journey segments.    Because \\"Paris, Texas\\" is not your standard pre-sold commercial product, most of its suspense comes from the viewers themselves, who have little idea just where the film is headed. So if you watch a lot of films and are jaded because everything is so predictable, this movie viewing experience should be a nice change of pace.     Because you haven't met these characters in other films, it takes a lot of storytelling to flesh them out, which is probably the biggest reason for the film's extended running length. Sam Shepard's script is not so much elliptical as it is evasive, somehow the characters tell us their most basic beliefs and deepest fears without really revealing anything about themselves (insert \\"Two Lane Blacktop\\" here).     German New Wave director Wenders gets an astonishingly unaffected performance from young Hunter Carson, as convincing as any you are likely to find. Carson never did much after this amazing debut.     The most intriguing sequences take place between Stanton and Kinski. The actors are never face-to-face as their characters speak to each other from opposite sides of one-way mirror. Travis has found Jane working in a seedy shop where lonely men pay to talk to women on the telephone.?    The DP fills the screen with images of people dwarfed by vast, distant, and impersonal land/ cityscapes. The most effective and original is a sequence of Travis walking along a bridge over a LA interstate with the audio supplied by an unseen (until the end) and rambling derelict addressing the bumper to bumper traffic rushing by below.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
0375836675|5.0|I picked up this book from my local bookstore expecting a thought-provoking, humorous, but potentially empty read.  A mystery/thriller without much emotion-after all, what more can you expect from a novel you choose from a section that includes superficial books ranging from \\"the it girl\\" and \\"confessions of a boyfriend stealer...?\\" <br /> <br />Now, I'll admit the beginning didn't go against these expectations.  There was humorous dialogue, much-too-human-to-be-believable characters, and, what else?  A bank robbery that ended in the protagonist stopping the criminal. <br /> <br />But as the spine of the plot formed, the first card was delivered, I saw the story in new light.  The man who raped his wife, the girl who ran barefoot-Zusak succeeds in taking numerous spiritually uplifting mini-stories and weaving them into his character's difficult path without losing the reader's interest amongst the cloud of uncertainty or his characters developing a not-so-human mind. <br /> <br />I admit I was disappointed at the ending-but it was just the sort of disappointment i brooded over after devouring Darren Shan's Sons of Destiny...an unexplained sadness at the fact that the life I indulged myself in for what was in this case less then two days was arranged to be so, and didn't fall so in fate as I thought it would.  The truth is, we as readers take pleasure in believing these things could in fact happen to us, that fate could take us as it did our hero, our heroine. <br /> <br />But I don't blame Zusak for the ending, in fact, i applaud him for it.  Throughout the chapters (which reminded me of prose, I feel the need to add) I half-expected this conclusion; Ed coming to a piece of sunlight and waiting in it blissfully for what life would bring him next.   <br /> <br />Why are the other readers so upset that we are left without a proper conclusion?  After all, now we can conjure up the rest of the story ourselves, i suppose.

B0000A118M|5.0|This is one of the top 5 albums of all time. Coltrane is on fire, McCoy is on fire, Jimmy Garrison is on fire, and Elvin is murderous. Out of all of tunes, my fav is Pursuance. It's passionate, has a hard bopish-avantgarde feel and yet it still swings. Out of the park!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|What do you do when the political system of a nation has failed you time and again in your quest to keep the world a safer, healthier place? If you're Al Gore and lost the Presidency to a sock puppet for some of the most unscrupulous interests ever to walk the Earth, you do what you can do... take the message to the people.  <br /> <br />Gore shares with us the \\"slideshow,\\" he's been giving, which is really quite a nifty multimedia stage presentation. The film is also interspersed with parts of his life and how things have affected him, explaining how he's reached a point of true concern about global warming and America's heartless negligence towards the issue.  <br /> <br />What this movie does best is address the frauds and quacks who have arguments that global warming is fake. These people tend to be nutcases, or worse industry lobbyists with a literal agenda of spreading lies about global warming. Gore covers their misinformation theories and shows why they are junk, very effectively. He shows that they take things that have a small grain of truth and might look true with just a tiny bit of research, but when you know more about it and can see the bigger picture you will see for yourself how deceptive they are being. <br /> <br />The US government IS failing all of humankind by putting unbridled greed first right now. This movie is a wake up call to the citizens, write your elected officials, use your vote, and do what you can to stop global warming.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I love the series, it shows a lot of interesting species in remote regions of the world and others which are rarely seen. Many of the situations they show you play out like a drama, if you have seen Blue Planet you know what I mean. Great store telling. <br /> <br />BUT, my one gripe with the HD versions is that I was quite disappointed in the quality on my tv. I was hoping for better than the broadcast quality from my Comcast connection but it was actually worse! Quite grainy in some scenes where there was no graininess  in the broadcast. I know because I recorded the broadcast on my HD DVR and compared the 2. Currently I have a PS3 with Samsung 1080p DLP setup and I used the same tv to compare the Blu Ray and recorded show, there is definitely I difference.
B00000J2PH|5.0|........for a reason. This is generally considered to be one of the very greatest albums ever. It is. Carole King wrote and sang the songs of my generation. She and Carly Simon made the music that pretty much defines the baby-boomer years. There is little point in discussing individual songs...we've all felt the earth move, followed her lead, and been glad that she sings of being our friend. If ever a girl was a natural woman...she is, indeed, a beautiful tapestry.<br /><br />  The sound and the songs remain fresh and new, and the pure joy as great as ever. There are very few albums that everybody really ought to have....this one heads the list.

0765340798|1.0|The first 2 books of the series were decent reads and could have still built up to a killer climax.  The first half is actually about on par with the first two, but after reading a good 3/4 of the way in you start wondering just when the authors are going to start tying things up.  Finally after reading almost the entire novel (well over 90% of the entire series), the authors decide to start tying together a thousand loose ends within just a few pages.  Monumental series of events are continually glossed over in just a few sentences, useless characters are introduced and go nowhere.  Existing characters behave consistently out of character.  Character behavior even becomes utterly unbelievable at parts.  Meanwhile, pointless side stories go on and on.  I would expect it to be almost impossible to screw up such an easy subject.  The entire book could have been just about the \\"Battle of Corrin\\" and still be exciting.  The second half was so bad I honestly think I could have done a better job myself.  This book was an utter disappointment.  If you read the first two, just leave it at that.  3 stars for the first half, but 1 star overall because the second half is inexcusably awful.
B000PGTPE6|1.0|I'm sorry, I've been a lifelong fan of Springsteen. I'm all ready to hear different interpretations of his music, but some songs just aren't meant for the banjo treatment. Bruce! Get a clue, they're not shouting \\"Bruuuuuccce\\" any more.... Just something that sounds like it. Don't get me wrong, the material he covered from Seeger influenced music is fine, not my favourite, but he covers it ok. Turning \\"If I should Fall behind\\" into a three-quarter time waltz... A song full of angst such as \\"Growing up\\" becomes a square dance with good old boys as the chorus... My ears are bleeding....
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I picked the special edition of this CD the day it came out. I listened to it and my initial reaction can be described by \\"WTF\\". I listened to it again and I still had a \\"WTF\\" reaction.  <br /> <br />I have listened to this album every day now for 5 days and can say without a doubt my favorite DT disk to date. That is a pretty tall order for me as I thought there would never be an album of theirs that would top Scenes from a Memory. But this is like no other album of DT's that I can think of. It is unlike any of their other disks where I had an immediate reaction. I had to listen to it and listen to it and listen to it some more. I think in the day of online critics, both professional and fans such as ourselves, the chase to be the first to post a review seems to take more precedence over actually listening to and absorbing music.  <br /> <br />This is an album that must be absorbed over and over and it gets better with every listen. I think my initial \\"WTF\\" reaction stemmed from how much of the Pink Floyd influence this album has. I am not a Pink Floyd fan, so that would explain why I had a hard time wrapping my brain around this album. But once I did, I can't stop listening to it! Nothing like cranking it up on the home theater system and turning it up to full blast (BTW, is what I having playing right now as I type this review up). Great job guys.  <br /> <br />A personal rant; I was reading over some of the pre-release discussion segments and folks, enough with the \\"I miss Kevin Moore and Myung is lost in the mix\\" complaining. Every single album since Images & Words there is a segment of people that cry the same tears about those two things with every album. Moore is gone people, he has been for over a decade and all DT has done since then is become even bigger AND better. If you miss him, just listen to his solo stuff and/or O.S.I and stop picking up the latest DT disk wishing it sounded like he was still in the band! As for Myung being lost in the mix, whatever. I am by no means a music scholar, but when you REALLY listen to the disk and watch the behind the scenes DVD and watch Myung lay down his tracks, not only is he contributing in a major way, he is having fun with the band! Get on with your lives people, DT is just fine WITHOUT Moore and stop worrying about Myung, he is just fine too :)

B00000J2L8|5.0|This movie offers the best tongue and cheek commentary on the absurdities of  war. I am sure this movie has been heavily \\"borrowed\\" from by Hollywood. The \\"Survival Kit Content Check\\" scene reminded me alot about the more recent \\"duct tape your windows\\" survival tactics. If you believe that the end of the world will come in a flash of light, this movie will validate you.  <br /> <br />
0446310786|5.0|Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful tale that exposes the harsh realities of African-Americans in a pre Civil Rights Era, and brings into question the effectiveness of the jury system even today.  Through the eyes of an innocent 8-year-old girl, we can vividly see the lives of all people living in the south.  Lee makes sure that this novel does not strictly focus on segregation de facto; in other words, Lee shifts the novel away from typical stories of segregation in public areas and private vicinities.  What I particularly loved about this novel is the way Lee moves towards society's psychological response to plights facing African Americans at the time period. <br /> <br /> The plot's narrator, Scout, informs the reader of the south's complexity in many forms.  From a hypocritical northern teacher, to the racism that destroyed an innocent man, Scout asks the reader to release all shallow misinterpretations of the south and judge it from a more complex viewpoint.  The novel's hero is by far Atticus Finch, who even today has come to represent all that is just and right in our nation's justice system.  Lee also utilizes his strength to portray what Scout sees as true strength in society.  Finch is the archetypal man who, despite all the negative influences surrounding him, he manages to come up on top on a moral ground against the small town.   <br /> <br /> Yet of course, the novel's true theme revolves around society's negative judgment on social outcasts and how these judgments reflect the nature of society itself.  Scout illustrates two victims of society: Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.  Boo Radley is a recluse who is the subject of town legends that depict him as a typical monster.  This envokes fear within the children, who must eventually learn how to accept and understand people from all backgrounds despite what others spread.  This idea is tested in a more major form, as Tom Robinson, a black man, is put on trial for raping a young white woman.  Reoccuring themes of acceptance and understanding truly take form when Atticus Finch represents Robinson, despite hostile behavior of the town. <br /> <br /> Lee's writing is beautiful as it is simple, yet at the same time it is simply powerful as it brilliantly portrays the way humanity struggles to release prejudice.  I urge everyone whose schools that were too misguide to assign this book to read it in their spare time for they too will be inspired.  <br />
B000GFLAI0|1.0|Time Out of Mind and Love an Theft were excellent, this CD just sounded like he took all the bad outtakes from those sessions and put them on a single disk.  The only \\"ok\\" song is Workingman's Blues #2.
B000O179A4|5.0|I enjoyed Dreamgirls.  Dreamgirls featuring Beyonce' Knowles is great.  The singing and acting are very entertaining.  The story of fame, fortune and friendship is believable.  I have not seen the play Dreamgirls when it was released over a decade ago but I am told that this movie version Dreamgirls is done well.  Dreamgirls (full screen edition) also has a bonus music video.  I reccommend the movie Dreamgirls!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime's original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C. Hall (who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part).<br /><br />If you can handle the macabre, allow yourself to enter Dexter's world. You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I heard family and friends say it was boring, that it was horrible, that it wasn't worth watching.  I bought it anyway.  Great move! <br /> <br />I actually found myself rewinding seconds I missed by turning my head or by being interrupted by one of my furry felines.  Every action and every word held my fascinated attention.  Completely enthralling!  High drama in its very best sense! <br /> <br />Drama, I say again.  Yes, this is a story of how one rifle affects the lives of many very different people in many very different ways.  The plot veers off into interesting directions and unexpected twists.  It's a definite keeper and one I'll enjoy watching again and again. <br /> <br />Not recommended for the young, I think ... no real \\"action.\\"  I'm full-grown and into involving, dramatic storylines.  Though I do have to regress momentarily to say I think Brad Pitt looks awesome with some gray streaking his hair! ;-) <br />
0679805273|5.0|I was searching for a book to give as a graduation present for my daughter---a motivational type of book.  After searching the large list of very serious books, full of opinions that I did not feel that they were what I was looking for, I stumbled onto this classic.  I remember the story well and found it to be just what I was looking for.  Serious enough for my purposes with a Dr. Seuss flair of humor.  My daughter's major is psychology with a journalism minor and this was PERFECT!  I had intimate family members give a personal statement or bit of advise to the graduate, but did not give it to her upon graduation from high school.  Instead, (and this is the best part) I am giving it to her when I leave her at college.  I will look in the rear view mirror and see her standing there with the Dr. Seuss classic in her hands.  I firmly believe she will refer to it many times her first term away from home.  Full of loving thoughts of past and future possibilities.  Get this one, you'll not go wrong!!!
B00005JLWN|4.0|So I missed out on exactly what was going on with the little boy even though I watched the movie twice.  I forgive myself for not getting it and I'll watch it again until I *do* get it. &lt;g> <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie for its thought-provoking creation of a maybe-future.  To feel or not to feel?  To shoot the puppy or save the little fella cuz it wags its tail and licks your face?  To turn on your neighbor cuz he's not like you or ask what drummer he follows? <br /> <br />Me, I enjoyed the drama of the government control, its keep-the-status-quo army of trained killers, and the \\"what works best for the good of all\\" plotline in general.  Plenty of action held my attention throughout. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for sci-fi/action fans. <br />
B0000787FH|5.0|When I first discovered this album I was in high school in '82. I bought the LP and started to feel ill, so I went home, grabbed my headphones, put the needle on the record and laid down on the couch. As the first side progressed, my temperature rose as I settled into what later became mono. I quickly became delirious and began to hover in a hallucinatory state as the music filled me. Who knows if I was still awake when the first side ended, but apparently I got up and flipped the record at some point. The perspectives in the music were distorted and mixed up. Drums were obviously being played loudly, but were buried in the mix as if they were screaming in vain to be heard. Voices whispered, crooned, howled, laughed and threatened. Hammond organs melted into harpsichords. The bass player sounded like he was either tuning up throughout the whole album or he was just kidding around. Acoustic guitars sounded impossibly swollen, as if they were trying to make the needle jump out of the groove. The lyrics were evocative of everything and nothing but in my fevered mind made perfect sense. Afraid that words would fail him, the writer used them all up as quickly as he could. I listened to this album over and over when I was in bed for weeks, trying in vain to grasp it's scope. Staring at the lyric sheet didn't help as the lyrics were all smashed together with no gaps in a single block of typewritten text as if were some sort of ransom note. The whole album sounded like the inside of someone's head with thoughts spilling every which way, some resolved, most unresolved. When I was well, I revisited the album, sure that I had imagined the whole thing. I hadn't. It remains one of my favorite E.C. albums and one of my all time favorites. Always compelling and a true one of a kind. Elvis and the Attractions all sound like they're at their wits' end, racing against madness that is hot on their trails, expressing the race in a musical language all their own. Masterpiece, for sure.(I personally prefer the Ryco version with bonus tracks on one disc, as the bonus tracks provide relief in the form of a somewhat light-hearted postscript to the intensities preceding.)
B00004T9AO|4.0|sure not his best album, but when I relistened this I have to disagree with the other review. I actually love the last part of crisis when Simon Phillips explodes on the drums. Together with the synth sequencer and Phillips talking back to it on the drums this is one of better MO pieces. Great stuff! Don't miss it.
0895260131|4.0|A very good book. A good review of history and a definite eye opener as to the thoughts and beliefs of Islamists. A must read for those who care about the future.
0060574216|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book.  I really was interested in what this famous tome could offer to my already-solid relationship, and found it to be so frustrating and so typically male-dominated when I was through.  It really isn't all that helpful learning how to never ever make a man feel like you disapprove of something they are doing, never ever ask them to do anything using the word \\"could\\" (always make sure they have an out if they don't want to get up off the couch by asking him with a \\"would\\" so he doesn't feel obligated) and never ever make him feel unloved or rejected or even show one single second of slight disappointment (you are instructed to go to another room and \\"center yourself\\" so you can come back with love and acceptance in your eyes) no matter how many times he rejects you or doesn't support you or doesn't give back, only takes.  Barf!  Even the sections that address women's \\"needs\\" are really back to more ways they need to treat their man --  \\"Men don't say they are sorry because then it would appear they were wrong??\\"  Give me a break.  If you're wrong or someone is hurt by what you do and THINKS you're wrong, be a big enough person to apologize for what you did that upset the other person, make it right and move on, no matter what gender you are.  How is that a partnership with one person doing all the relationship repair and giving unconditional love no matter what she gets in return because a man doesn't want to appear \\"wrong\\"?  How is one half's pride the most important, driving force in a twosome?    I sure wouldn't want a life like that.  I think I will stick with what's working in my already-solid relationship instead of wanting what this author thinks is \\"perfection\\".  Sure it is = for him! <br /> <br />

B000K4WPCC|5.0|WOW!! Let me start off by saying that they had me hooked when the soundtrack opening credits started by blaring ROB ZOMBIE'S MORE HUMAN, I mean how can you go wrong with a movie that starts out with Rob Zombie!! THE COVENANT is great!! It opens up with the fab four sons of Ipswich taking a header off a cliff, their unique way of making an entrance to a bonfire rave. Right away, witchcraft is afoot, but it's such a goof, just some homeboys out having a good time. The four sons can trace their bloodline back to the Salem witch hunts, which obviously their line survived. The eldest male in each family gets a taste of their power when they are thirteen, but fully reach their power when they \\"ascend\\" at the age of eighteen. Caleb, the oldest of the four, is set to ascend in a couple of days on his birthday and he dreads this. His father abused the power when he was younger and as a result, prematurely aged as the power drained his body, giving him the appearance of a horribly ancient being. Because of this, Caleb vows to never abuse this power. <br /> <br />But with the appearance of a transfer student, Chase, things quickly go bad.  There is the death of a student, the appearance of darklings, sudden illnesses and tragic accidents. Chase isn't who he appears to be. He is the lost fifth son of Ipswich and he wants Caleb's power and intends to get it any way he can.  <br /> <br />To say anymore would spoil the fun, and this was a blast!!! The special effects are great!! The soundtrack is awesome, the atmosphere rocks!! I hate spiders, they're creepy and they're a big part of this plotline!! This film felt like the LOST BOYS for the 2000's with a touch of THE CRAFT. I loved this movie!!! <br /> <br />THE COVENANT ROCKS!!! WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
0385340559|4.0|First Sentence:  The man was called Calvin Franz and the helicopter was a Bell 222.<br /><br />Former military police investigator, Jack Reacher is in Seattle when he receives a 10-30 call from one of his former team of military investigators.  A 10-30 is an urgent request for assistance.  He arrives in Los Angeles to learn the police have found the body of one of the team of eight.  He had been dropped 3,000 feet from a helicopter.  As he meets up with Francis Neagley, one of this team, they realize other members of the eight are also missing and it somehow links to a company called New Age Defense Systems.  One thing is certain, someone is about to learn that you \\"do not mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />The books in this series are always a good read.  Jack is the definition of macho, but it was nice to see him question, a bit, what he's done with his life in comparison to the other members of his unit.  The plot is a little over the top, but so involving, I didn't care.  Whenever I'm mired in a series of \\"okay\\" reads, I know I can pick up a Lee Child book and be entertained.  These are the perfect lazy Sunday or airplane book.

B0000DJZAH|5.0|The Album is a masterpiece of all time rock n roll, even if this is \\"the less Who album\\" of the Who... but nevermind! <br />The Sound in both Stereo (from the original master tape discovered in the vault of UMG) and 5.1 (mixed by Pete Townshend himself) is great... <br />As you put the disc in your player you'll hear the great differences from the 1996 reissue even if you have only a \\"simple\\" CD player.. <br />If You're a great Who fan and you a have SACD player buy ABSOLUTELY this album and enjoy it 'til the laser of your player won't work anymore... <br />The second disc is clearly for fans only but the quality of some track even if are demos or outtakes is very very good!!
B00006EXDM|4.0|For any Stones fan, I think this was the culmination or consensus of the greatest hits album for any band. I have owned this title on vinyl, cd and now SACD. First of all, any compilation album is subject to the producer's vision, and I understand that. That is each song may have been produced differently.  On the first disc, it is obvious that the early days of stereo engineering  meant separating everything into left and right, but the clarity of SACD really shines through.***Note** Just because it's SACD doesn't mean it's 5.1 surround. I was especially impressed with Ruby Tuesday. I finally can hear that the distortion in the left speaker is actually an over-mike'd cello and not (as I thought for years) some funky bass line.   The second CD really stood out with some great tunes, especially Honky Tonk Women and Midnight Rambler. I tend to prefer when songs are mixed as if I where listening to the band live. That is, I like the lead singer in the middle and drums behind the lead singer. Guitars, bass and backing vocals should be on either side. I was really disappointed with Gimme Shelter because this mix seemed to cram everything towards the center. I don't know if this was the original production or just this cd. The rest of the cd is great. Now if they can just re-engineer the Who's Who's Better, Who's Best on SACD, I'll be in Heaven. ***Another note*** This review may be nullified  by the fact that, as my children have pointed out, I'm old, and as such, I can afford a lot better speakers than I could when I was young.
B000002KAT|2.0|FREE FORM VOCAL STYLINGS    This album rates very highly on many critics list of the all time best.  It routinely comes up in the top ten.  About 10 years ago, Rolling Stone magazine voted it the second best album of all time, behind the Beatle's Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.    Released in 1968, this is Van Morrison's second solo album.  It is 46 minutes long and the sound quality is good, although the music is mixed a little thin.    The Way The Young Lovers Do is the only thing on this album that is anything close to pop song along the lines of Brown Eyed Girl.  I am not a big pop music fan, but I like this song.  The rest of the album is something completely different.    The rest of the album is some nice music with some interesting playing, mixed really low. It is a mixture of jazz and folk with a little blues thrwon in.  There are some interesting bits on flute, vibes and keyboards.  But, the music remains just a back drop and is mixed in at a very low volume. The CD comes with a fold out cover that tries to give a historical perspective of the album.  Intrestingly, it is pretty subdued and does not rave about the album like the critics do.    Morrison's wild and unstructured vocals are mixed loudly on top of the music.  He seems to be always riffing and jamming.  He'll be singing along and then he'll jump into a repeated riff, such as \\"you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out\\".     I know people are going to get mad at me, insult me and call me names, but I have to admit that I just don't get it.  I don't think this is a personal, emotional album, and I don't think it has interesting stories.  It comes off to me as an experimental album that didn't quite work.    Music is a very personal thing.  People can get really mad when you don't agree with them on music that they really love.  They take a low review on thier favorite album as a personal attack.  They say nasty things about the reviewer.     To get even, people will mark a review as \\"hot helpful\\", like that evens things up.  But, a review like this is helpful to buying public that might not know much about this ablum and are thinkging about buying it because of all the rave reviews (that is why I bought it).      Just because certain people love it doesn't mean everyone will.  In fact, many people did not like this album.  It is the only Van Morrison album not to chart.  And you might wonder why Morrison did not do anything like this again.  He certainly still had the artistic freedom to do what he wanted, because he had a pretty lose contract from Warner Brothers.  What he came up with next, is Moondance, which was completely different.  In later albums, Morrison did incorporate some of the Astral Weeks vocal stylings on some songs, but it was much more controlled.    Van Morrison started out in a group called Them.  Them had a minor hit with Baby Please Don't Go, and bigger hit with Gloria, written by Morrison.  Them was going through changes, so Morrison retired from music for a few years, before coming up with Brown Eyed Girl, and his first ablum, Blowin' Your Mind.  He did not approve of the album and withdrew.  His manager died, freeing him from his contract, so he was able to sign with Warner Brothers, have much more artistic freedom and came up with this.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|I thought the last album, Unbreakable, was there best work in years.  It looks like this new album will be even better.  I am so proud to be a Scorpions fan for over 25 years now!  Klaus, Rudolph, and Mathias are truly brilliant, deep feeling musicians that anyone with depth and an ear for great rock music will enjoy Humanity Hour 1.
0767802470|4.0|I only wish some of these long-winded reviewers would stop trying to be Roger Ebert. <br /> <br />Film is terrific. Must see. Fine writing/direction. Walfgang Petersen is another A-list director, no doubt about it. <br />The only quibble is this: film is on the looong side. Saw the original version in a theatre way back when it came out--and it was just about right. This version, though, just might leave your poor backside aching after a while. <br /> <br />Definitely worth getting. Might be the BEST submarine film ever made. <br /> <br />
B000MM0L2S|5.0|Not sure what there is not to love about this disc.  The interpretations are unique, sometimes quirky and always interesting; the recording is gorgeous; and Morricone's segues, which he composed and recorded, are very cool and show that much thought and creativity went into the overall production.  (Only complaint is the absence of translations for the foreign-language tracks.)  After reading some of these reviews, I had doubts about making the purchase.  Now I'm so grateful that I did!  Highly recommended!
B00005JPKE|4.0|A good film covering the battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese side.  A necessary companion piece to \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"  My only regret is that the english subtitiles to the Japanese sound track don't stay on screen long enough to fully grasp the context.
B000P46QIG|5.0|This is by far Planet X's best effort to date.  Worth the wait since the last release, Derek Sherinian, Virgil Donati and guests do an unbelievable job.  Alan Holdsworth, Rufus Philpot and Brett Garsed do outstanding work on guitar, while keyboardist Sherinian and drummer Donati give their usual great performances.   This is one of the year's best in progressive rock so far.
B000M4RG42|5.0|A well-thought-out essay into the mindset of America late in WWII.  Its atmosphere of negativity and raw courage is actually a good companion piece to \\"The Time of Our Lives\\" as well as to \\"Letters From Iwo Jima.\\"
B000O174CM|5.0|We went to see the movie first in the theater. Now with this DVD set, we can watch it over and over. What a wonderful movie!
0767819659|4.0|My 4 year old daughter and I watched this movie. Overall, it is wonderful.A point in the movie I disagree with, in the book, Madeline is  NOT orphaned. In one book she is at boarding school where her Papa has sent Christmas presents.So..we know she is not a orphan. Also, since the boarding school is near the Eiffel Tower, one would have to assume that Miss Clavel should have an accent, as do most of the actors/actresses in the movie. However, she does not have an accent in the movie. I'm so used to improvising an accent when I read the books to my daughter, Miss Clavel's key line is always sitting up in bed and uttering, \\"Something is not right\\" and I like to believe she would say it like this, \\"Somesing iz not' rright.\\" However, the actress in the movie sounds completely American. She does a nice job, I just wish she would have improv'd an accent. One last thing, when one of the boarding school girls is running around looking for Genevieve, she tells someone that Genevieve is a golden retriever, however the dog actor in the movie is clearly played by a yellow lab. Weird little oddities, but nonetheless noteworthy. Besides picking at this so badly, this movie is completely fun, touching and warm.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|GHOST RIDER is another comic adaptation from Marvel comics. It is in the same vein as CONSTANTINE and HELLBOY that deals with supernatural fantasy. The movie incarnation of Ghost Rider, however, feels like a hybrid of the Johnny Blaze(who uses Hellfire as his primary weapon) in the 70's and Dan Ketch(magical chain/penance stare)in the  90's.<br /><br />John Blaze is a stunt motorcycle rider, who decades ago sold his soul to Mephisto(incarnation of Satan), to save his dad from cancer. As with anyone who deals with evil, the deal has a hidden catch, his dad dies in an accident anyway and Blaze finds out that he is unable to die until Mephisto decides it is his time. It makes Blaze a phenomenal stunt rider but it also makes him empty.<br />Soon enough, Blackheart wants to de-throne Mephisto by seeking an ancient scroll with the names of the damned to grow an army. Mephisto enlists Blaze's aid by transforming him(against his will) into the \\"Spirit of Vengeance\\", Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart.<br />Sam Elliot(steals the show) as the \\"caretaker\\" is a character from Ketch's 90's  incarnation, Eva Mendes as Roxanne, who plays Blaze's love interest.<br />About the extended edition:<br />Don't go for the slightly longer un-rated cut for hope of more violence. Pretty much everything that has been restored in this version of the movie is characterization bits, which is not a minus because it does flesh out the central players a little more, but it's doubtful that any of this material was cut at the request of the MPAA, rather, it was likely deleted for pacing reasons.<br /><br />The film's EFX is well-executed and follows a darker tone like DAREDEVIL and Underworld. Although I have to say this film mostly follows the 1970 incarnation with its cartoonish sly humor. The 1980-1990's version of GR had a more serious and darker mood.<br />PICTURE: 2.40 ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. The PQ is phenomenal, colors extremely vibrant. Some scenes are sharper than others, but I didn't see any video artifacts at all. Great transfer<br />AUDIO: The DTS track has a stronger bass but not that much different from the 5.1 DD track. Sound is very powerful.<br />Extras:<br />DISC 1:  Commentary by director M.S. Johnson w/ visual effects Steven Mack, another commentary by the producer is also here. Trailers are also here.<br />DISC 2:<br /> Documentary called Spirit Of Vengeance: The Making Of Ghost Rider which clocks in at just under 82 minutes. The first two parts cover the origin of the film and its production while the third part details post production work.<br /> Up next is Sin And Salvation which is a really interesting look at the comic book history of the title character, one section a piece dedicated to 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000's by way of some interesting interviews with the various artists and writers who have worked on the different incarnations of the Marvel Comics that the film was based on.<br /> To close it out, Sony added some cool animatics and more supplements.<br /><br />GHOST RIDER is not as bad as people think. It is a fun ride, a decent (if brainless) action movie geared towards fans of the comic genre. It didn't achieve its potential, but this unrated release w/ its extras are well worth a look. 3 ½ stars!<br />RECOMMENDED!!r  AUDIO: The DTS track has a stronger bass but not that much different from the 5.1 DD track.

The first two parts cover the origin of the film and its production while the third part details post production work.    Up next is Sin And Salvation which is a really interesting look at the comic book history of the title character, one section a piece dedicated to 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000's by way of some interesting interviews with the various artists and writers who have worked on the different incarnations of the Marvel Comics that the film was based on.   To close it out, Sony added some cool animatics and more supplements.    GHOST RIDER is not as bad as people think. It is a fun ride, a decent (if brainless) action movie geared towards fans of the comic genre. It didn't achieve its potential, but this unrated release w/ its extras are well worth a look. 3 ½ stars!  RECOMMENDED!!

B000PTYPAC|4.0|Note: I give this 3.5 stars.  <br /> <br />The boys want to marry her, & the girls want to be her. Hayley Williams, and the darlings from Franklin, Tennessee are back with one of the most anticipated releases of the year, \\"Riot!\\".  <br /> <br />These guys popped out of nowhere in 2005 to give the world a top notched produced record with \\"All We Know Is Falling\\", it sparked an ongoing debate if this band was a product of a major corporation as band. Though the band has denied the claims, it was unoften you see such a young band to come out of no where to release a near perfect release was far too perfect. I don't think anyone in the band was legal; their drummer was 14! Ever since then, they have kept growing. I loved their first record, and really was looking forward to this record, but i still havent gotten a final verdict on this record.  <br /> <br />The growth of the band is present. The record starts off with the heart pounding \\"For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\\". The guitars are at the best the band has ever been. Vocally, Hayley is stunning on the amazing, \\"Hallelujah\\", and \\"Let The Flames Begin\\". Her vocals remain solid all the way through. Lyrically, one of the most \\"heart on sleeve\\" record's i've ever heard. Hayley obviously has been doing a lot of searching and questioning in her life, and it comes through in the songs. It's common knowledge that the band are Christians, and she sings it on her sleeve. But unlike other bands that do so, they appoarch it in a manner i think the only word to decribe is it, real. She doesn't candy coat it, and talks about a lot of emotions and situations many people go through; Christian or not.  <br /> <br />I do like the record, but i honestly feel they played it somewhat safely. The album started off very strong, but it got a weak as the album went on; almost a generic, formulae type. I was looking for a little more rawness, and the guys to have more vocal parts.  <br /> <br />The record is catchy; too catchy to notlike and i have a feeling it will eventually grow

1596912855|3.0|<br />I'm not sure if this book is a romance or a comedy, maybe it was intended to be both. There were many attempts to bring humor into this story, but on the level of a young adult reader. Which is fine for a young reader and since I have two in their early teens I'm always on the look out for a great read for them and maybe they might enjoy this book. However, I'm not happy with some of the scenes, so I'm afraid he'll have to wait before he will be able to read it. <br /> <br />On the whole I was a bit disappointed in the novel. First it could have used another 60 or 90 pages to flush out the characters and improve the dialog and scenes. The story seemed to me to be very slow and sometimes annoying. <br />But overall if you are a Jane Austen fan you might enjoy taking a trip to Austenland. <br /> <br />In my opinion I don't think that it is a terrible book, but a good book. Enjoy. <br />
0596527055|5.0|Berkun's book is small, concise, and a very good read on what innovation really is -- not the myths and stories we've come to associate with major breakthroughs.    Newton's discoveries about gravity, legends to the contrary, didn't come from inspration after he got hit on the head by an apple; instead his breakthroughs came about after years and years of work in the field.  All of Newton's prior experiences combined to give him the ability to meld everything together and come up with some unique ideas.    Berkun repeats this idea throughout this short, highly enjoyable book: Innovation is very, very rarely some epiphany moment where an idea is spawned completely out of the blue.  Instead, innovation, inspiration, and epiphanies are the product of having laid the groundwork in many different ways.      Berkun talks about this groundwork in several different fashions.  He talks about how good managers set up an environment which fosters creativity and innovation (think old Microsoft, current Google, SemTech in Brazil), how innovators are able to build off their prior experiences, and a number of other critical factors.    The book's well-written, and it's a physical pleasure to read.  The book's small size, pleasant paper, and great photographs all combine for an \\"innovative\\" experience.

B00001OH80|5.0|I'm not sure why so many people dislike this record, but I hold it high among the most enjoyable things Bowie has ever done. I can listen to it repeatedly from beginning to end and get a very warm feeling from it. This album is kind of like the sonic equivalent of a good pair of comfy shoes...they feel great everytime you put 'em on!

B0007ZEO4G|4.0|Not being a huge Coverdale fan, I was unsure what I would think after my first listen to \\"Burn\\". I can tell you I was very shocked at how much I like this CD. The remastering sounds great, however they could do without the remixes, they add very little. There is a nice size booklet with the telling of how they found Hughes and Coverdale, the leaving of Gillian and Glover and the making of the Album.
0679721037|5.0|Published in 1946, this remarkable article or book was based on interviews with survivors of the first city to be destroyed by a single weapon. John Hersey was a war correspondent during World War II. His \\"Hiroshima\\" has been rated as number one in The Top Ten Works of Journalism in the United States in the 20th Century, as determined by The New York University journalism faculty and a panel of critics that included David Brinkley and Morley Safer. \\"Hiroshima\\" took over the entire August 30, 1946 issue of \\"The New Yorker\\" and the issue sold out within hours. After reading this rather slim book, I can understand why. It relates the stories of six survivors in a very interesting and readable way. Hersey makes us feel the impact of the bomb and its horrors in a very personal way, yet he doesn't go overboard on the gore. There is a follow-up study almost 40 years later, and we visit these same characters again. Surprisingly, none of the six hated the U.S.; they understood that drastic measures were neeeded to end a war that the Japanese obsessively fought; throwing reason out the window. The book can be read in an evening, but you will want to reread it, as well.
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|With so many guest artists on this disc, the release reminds one of those big-budgeted 80's albums produced by Quincy Jones and featuring all of his friends and neighbors. Benson and Jarreau are so individually gifted that the special appearances were not necessary but such additions stay with the current trend of star cameos.<br /><br />As far as the songs go, the covers are well done, adding intriguing changes in the two songs (\\"Breezin\\" and \\"'Mornin'\\") made famous by Benson and Jarreau, respectively. Besides those two, there are other \\"re-workings\\" that are soulfully jazzy, especially \\"Summer Breeze\\" and John Legend's \\"Ordinary People.\\" The final selection, \\"Bring It on Home to Me\\" features an impressive Paul McCartney on lead vocals.<br /><br />Though \\"God Bless the Child,\\" with Jill Scott adding her distinctive style on vocals, won last year's Grammy for best traditional R & B performance, it is \\"Let it Rain,\\" with Patti Austin that should've taken home the coveted prize. The singer provides the perfect compliment to Jarreau's singing and Benson's guitar licks.<br /><br />This song is truly what R & B is all about!
B000P1KTW8|3.0|If this was really filmed in HD as label states I must need new glasses.  Just to watch this \\"1080 Disc'  that's unclear, quite grainy and undefinded.<br />The Music get's 5 stars but the film and or transfer is not of the usual grade for HD.<br /><br />Sorry but to keep it real the standard DVD upscaled on a PS-3 would look this good without the Blu-Ray package.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|As I said on my review of the standard release. No chinks in the DT armour yet.. After listening to the stereo versions for a few days and watching the DVD.. I must say I am a little disappointed in what seems to be becoming the Portnoy/Petrucci Band... I have been a fan since day one and they are still my favorite band of the last 2 decades, but the proof is in the mix. There is no dought you can hear the drums and guitars. They are in your face, but when its time for JR to do a keyboard solo he is lacking a few db's and the guitar drowns out his solo.. It would be a shame to loose the best keyboard player since Rick Wakeman cause you cant share the spot light.. Its supposed to be a band..     Now after watching the DVD I think Mr Portnoy need to step back and take a reality check.. He is a bit full of himself. I am a little troubled by the fact that throughout the DVD he is critiquing everybody elses efforts but no where in the DVD does he show anyone critiquing him..  I think Mikey needs a little deflation.. They are all incredible players and I want to hear them all..

B00005JLR2|5.0|I don't know what it is that pulled me into this movie. I think it's the futuristic setting along with Jim. I really like his character and I like Silver's too. Everyone keeps saying that it's more of a \\"teenager movie\\" instead of a kid movie. The thing is, kids are going to grow up and I think that this would be a great movie for them to watch to help them to follow their dreams. Anyway, that's just my outlook on it. Overall, I just really love this movie.
B000PKG6TE|1.0|I can't believe I used to think this band was one of the only bright spots on the musical horizon back in the day.  Boy, was I wrong.  After the amazingly recorded and produced (not to mention catchy as hell) \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" the band (was there ever even a \\"band\\"???) pretty much fell off the map with their last POS \\"Dull...uh...BYE!\\" album.  Where was the great old 70's recording style?  Where was the catchiness?  Where was the feeling?  Where was the groove?  Where was the integrity?  It was gone.      I swore after that last craptacular waste of plastic I wouldn't purchase another QOTSA album.  And, I'm glad I didn't actually pay for this new Eagles of Death Metal (but not nearly as good...this stuff appears to actually be SERIOUS) wanna-be album.    This guy has managed to go from a respected and what seemed to be on the surface a talented unique musician to a completely annoying untalented unoriginal waste of flesh.  There are only so many fake voices you can do, and the three musical ideas this guy writes on his own can only be stretched so far (a bazillion albums too many)...there are only so many terrible musicians you can hook up with whom can't hold a candle to anyone on \\"Songs For The Deaf.\\"  A band is not one member on his own...chemistry and interactability are what GRABS an audience and KEEPS them.  Contrary to what this \\"band's\\" (LMAO) egomaniac leader may believe, the actual BAND matters in music.  It's not just about HIM.  But, don't try to tell him that.  He'll just continue to spew out bland, contrite, dull, boring, predictable, rote, by-the-book excrement all the while thinking he's cutting edge and original while concurrently adding another worthless, has-been, cheezy, and 5-year-too-late gimmick (i.e., electronic ProTools effects).  Clueless.    Again, this guy will forever be the \\"Craig Kilborn\\" of rock.  Both now equally discredited, disregarded, and disrespected.      Owned.
0316113077|5.0|I am a foodie and baker, so I was looking for a cookbook that would show doable techniques to create standout cakes.   <br /> <br />I've always been a bit intimidated by decorating with fondant and gum paste; chef/author Elisa Strauss gives perfect tips and guidance on how to work with fondant to create the perfect design. <br /> <br />For those who aren't everyday bakers, the cookbook starts with basic techniques and rules.  It includes multiple foundational recipes for cakes and cookies.  From there, the cookbook leads to several creative designs ranging from a cake that looks like a handbag (very cool!) to a cake that looks like classic baby blocks to a wedding cake that looks like it is embroidered with chocolate. (It's the wedding cake in Sex in the City when Charlotte marries Harry).   <br /> <br />The real art is in the design and execution of these varied cakes. The designs are both elegant and whimsical. All of the designs are incredibly creative. This is a terrific cookbook and a must have for any baker.  <br /> <br />The rubber duckie cupcakes are next on my list to try out!  <br />
0743289412|5.0|I can't believe I let all the negative reviews of Lisey's Story keep me from reading this one for so long! <br /> <br />I'm not going to summarized the book, Amazon does a pretty good job of that, but looking for a summer read, I turned to this one, and I loved it!  IT IS scary, in a \\"get in your mind\\" sorta way AND in the typical Stephen King way... What isn't scary about a young boy kept in the basement?  About a stalking pyscho?  About an alternate world with laughers and longboys??? I didn't find the secret language overwhelmingly used and I really don't get the reviews that say it started slow and folks couldn't get past a certain number of pages! <br /> <br />I couldn't put it down!  Thank you King!
B000O76TAE|4.0|6 years after the masterpiece that was Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite to bring another masterpiece to the big screen.<br /><br />Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx deliverer who after a plane crash, fines himself both lost and alone on a tropical island. With either no or very little hope of getting home, Chunk must learn how to survive on his own, including doing his own dental work yuck and somewhat having someone to talk to in the form of Wilson, a vollyball.<br /><br />The film is 143 minutes long and about 80 minutes of it are just spent with Hanks on the island. Helen Hunt was good as Hanks's girlfriend it's just too bad she wasn't on screen long enough but she gave a good performance none the less. But this film belongs to Hanks, who earned his fifth Oscar nomination with his very superb performance and I can't wait for what Hanks and Zemeckis come up with next.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|Just got my box set today and popped in part 1 on my A-2. It was glorious to see the matrix in HD.

I thought pirates on Blu was great, this just takes the cake.
B000000OPW|3.0|I remember loving this album way back when, and yeh, you read right: \\"album.\\" I bought this originally in vinyl; I was a youth with angst and all that stuff; and the soundtrack to the early to mid 80's was colored with various textures including this package.  Sadly, I don't think it stands the test of time, and a lot of the sounds are quite dated.  Don't get me wrong. I love Siouxie's voice, and \\"Cities in Dust\\" IS a true timeless classic, but I don't think the same can be said about most of the rest of the tracks.  But hey, if you want to discover or re-discover some of the more unique, underplayed-unerhyped sounds of that era, this is a good one to tour.

B00005ATQD|5.0|As most people know, this was the great Stanley Kubrick's final movie.  I believe he died before the filming was complete.  It was also, ironically, filmed just before Tom & Nicole broke up (a bit of irony there?)  These facts alone would be enough to make this film a collector's item.  However, it also has some other things going for it as well.<br /><br />The story is about a Dr. (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the notion that his wife (Nicole Kidman) has cheated on him.  Or, even if she didn't ACTUALLY cheat on him, she surely wanted to.  This leads him on an escapade of sexual deviance.  He considers hooking up with a girl who has a crush on him as well as soliciting the services of a prostitute.  He justifies his actions as a form of \\"getting even\\" with his spouse.<br /><br />The biggest gamble, however, is sneaking into a ritzy orgy scene where everyone is wearing masks.  The scene is bizarre and at the same time beautiful.  The ritual with the prostitutes is downright surreal.  This sets the stage for everything else that happens in the movie.<br /><br />If you're into erotic thrillers, this one belongs in your DVD collection.  Makes me wonder how much of this kind of thing really does go on in High Society places.  Also, Nicole Kidman takes her clothes off for the first time in quite awhile, and I do believe there are more nude shots of her in this film than any other movie I've ever seen her in.  That alone is worthy of the price of this DVD!

B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone is known to stir up controversial subjects.  His most recent film, World Trade Center, came at a time when the memory of the 9/11 attacks were still painfully fresh in our nation's memory (they still are).  Unlike Stone's previous films, however, WTC did not point fingers at anyone (aka \\"Loose Change\\") and instead just focused on the human impact of the attacks and chronicled a few people's experiences throughout the event.<br /><br />Stone's 1991 film \\"JFK,\\" definately points fingers.  Stone's active name calling and muckraking will polarize audiences with differing views on the events of November 22, 1963.  People who really believe that the assassination was carried out solely by Mr. Oswald will be incensed at the film's implication of our nation's own government, and those who discount the Magic Bullet theory will be pleased that Stone dares to consider the alternative.<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the same writer of the autobiography from which the film is based (the film also bases itself from the book Crossfire by Jim Marrs).  Garrison is a lawyer who sets out to disprove the then-accepted Magic Bullet theory and other commonly accepted theories revolving around his assassination.  The Magic Bullet theory was an explanation issued from the Waren Commission explaining how Oswald miraculously fired 3 rounds in a matter of 5.6 seconds with two of the three shots accurately hitting their marks.  On top of that, these bullets waltzed around the cabin of the vehicle ripping  multiple entry wounds into Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally.  In addition to speculating the Magic Bullet Theory, Stone focuses on the other mysterious figures who stood to gain from Kennedy's death, and there were a lot of them.<br /><br />There are a number of factors that contribute to the greatness of this film.  Aside from the political intrigue that may rouse negative emotions from its audience, the film expertly develops its characters into real, breathing, multi-dimensional characters.  On top of that, Stone's inherent storytelling ability shines through in this one.  The story may sound bland to someone who cares little of the subject, but Stone tells it in a way that will capture anyone's interest.  His fierce and emotional style does well to win the audience over.  Stone is a hit-or-miss director.  This one is definitely a hit.<br /><br />JFK was unfortunately too radical for the hardline right wingers of his time.  He was a visionary leader who set the needed leadership examples for the presidents to come, and this thrilling account of his final moments with immortalize his memory for ages to come.al, breathing, multi-dimensional characters.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Although Sufjan Stevens has been around for several albums, his musical influence has not been felt as deeply as it should have been. He breathes fresh air into music and makes albums that defy classification. <br /> <br />Many of the tracks on 'Illinoise' have a way of reaching inside and staying with you in a manner that is difficult to find in music. Many evoke emotions that are difficult, if not impossible, to commit to paper. 'John Wayne Gacy Jr.' is a particular haunting track. It is testament to Sufjan Stevens' talent that he manages to make a song about a serial killer sound moving and seemingly sympathetic. <br /> <br />With lyrics that occasionally meander through U.S. history and beats to match, 'Illinoise' can sometimes feel like a throwback to the music of bygone decades. Perhaps the track 'The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts' is most typical of Stevens' eclecticism. Here he switches back and forth between his own harmonious sound and that of a church choir as well as a drum backing that sounds like something from a White Stripes album. <br /> <br />It remains to be seen whether Stevens will follow through on his promise to make an album in each of the 50 states of the U.S. However if he does it will be to the massive benefit of the listening public.

B0000VCZKM|4.0|Having been lucky enough to see the original on Broadway I was looking forward to the transition to the silver screen.  Unfortunately most of the magic of the musical was left in New York and never made it to Hollywood.  The songs are, of course, very good, though they did drop one of my favorites, \\"NYC\\", from the score and added the, in my opinion, inferior \\"Let's Go To The Movies\\".  Aileen Quinn does a very credible job in the title role.  Albert Finney, as Daddy Warbucks, and Carol Burnett, as  Miss Hannigan, also do a good job.  Ann Reinking, as Daddy Warbucks' secretary, proves to be one of the best dancers around.  Many of the things that are done in the movie, such as the rescue of Annie on the railroad bridge, could not have done on the stage.  For all its shortcomings, \\"Annie\\" is still well worth the watch.

B000059GEI|4.0|While &#34;There's No Business Like Show Business&#34; is not one of Hollywood's top musicals it's still worth watching.  The story is simple and entertaining.  Ethel Merman, Donald O'Connor, Dan Dailey and Mitzi Gaynor are, as usual, entertaining and fun.  Though Johnnie Ray tries very hard he shows that he is a singer rather than an actor.  Marilyn Monroe is, at best, adequate.  While she has never been one of my favorite performers she usually does a better job than she does in this movie.

Brooks' \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is packed full of useful survival skills, ingenious tactics, and common-sense ideas to thwarting those risen from the grave.  Read, comprehend, and remember everything written; it's important and could save your life!<br /><br />What's great about \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is that Brooks doesn't take the easy route, making generic references to movie scenes, cracking jokes about the moans and slow movements of zombies.  Instead, he explains how zombies are created, what rules their bodies, and how to defeat them.  Although listed as humorous book - which quite often is very true - Brookes always attacks the subject as if his life depended on it.<br /><br />Brooks starts with zombie physiology, covering the virus Solanum and what it does to the human body.  It's brilliant because he explains the minutiae of horror movies that will constantly remind the reader of countless scenes from zombie movies, filling in the gaps that always existed.  Shortly after the physiology, Brooks delves into the weapons required to fight the zombie masses, tediously going over the advantages and disadvantages of each weapon, from weight to sound to effectiveness.  From there the book only gets better as tactics, terrain, strategy, levels of outbreak, and historical accounts of zombie outbreaks.<br /><br />The zombie outbreaks are perhaps the best part of the book.  Each one, while meticulously annotated, can never be truly cross-referenced by a researcher.  There is always a mysterious absence of a body, or an unknown savior, or a government/military conspiracy to cover-up the zombie threat.<br /><br />Throughout the book Brooks manages to balance his tongue-in-cheek efforts at satire, never breaking \\"character\\", in many ways like a great actor who gets deep into a role.  All the while the contents are sure to enthrall, amuse, and provide a true sense of realism to a borderline ridiculous subject.  I highly recommend this book to any fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, and to anyone who simply wants to read something different.<br /><br />I'm amazed that someone has put this much thought into such a banal subject, and in turn, how much I've imagined the various scenarios laid out in the book, wondering what I would do in each situation if survival depended upon my decisions.  Therein lies the greatness of this book; it challenges the reader's imagination and is sure to fascinate every reader with unique hypotheticals.who gets deep into a role.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've never been a James Bond junkie, though I've certainly gone to the various movies for amusement purposes, but WOW!  Daniel Craig as James Bond has officially turned me into a fan.  His performance was amazing and what a great script! <br />The chase scene at the beginning of the movie was one of the best I've seen-and it didn't even involve a car. <br />For the first time ever, I'm anxiously awaiting the next Bond movie.
0060090383|4.0|This book gave me a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />No, really.  Despite the fact that I have never taken drugs in my life, and average maybe one alcoholic drink per year, this tale of a woman's struggles with addiction--and more importantly, the psycholigical reasons for that addiction--turned me into a quivering mass of goo.<br /><br />This book actually caused me to quit my job.  No.  Really.  I did.  After seeing Rachel's struggles with dependency and unhealthy relationships, it became very clear to me that my job WAS my dependency, and the most unhealthy of any of my relationships.<br /><br />Part of me wants to give the book 5 stars for being such a huge influence on my life and my mental health.  Another part of me wants to give it 1 star, for exactly the same reason.  I know I'll never read it again.  It sits on my bookshelf, and every time I see it, I get a shiver from the memory of all the pain and self-reflection it induced.<br /><br />I can't say everyone is going to have such a life-altering reaction to the book, but if you know someone with an addiction, someone in an unhealthy relationship, someone who simply needs help, try slipping her this book.  It looks like a lighthearted read.  But it packs a big whallop.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|This is a lovely, simple romance story about the author behind the famous kids' books. While Mrs. Potter sometimes seems a bit 'tetched' at times when she's talking to her animal illustrations as they come to life in her imagination, overall it's a delightful story. (And Ewan McGregor is always welcome in any film!)<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B00005JPAO|4.0|A beautifully produced reconstruction of events during the week following Diana Spencer's unexpected death: the public mourning, the Royal Family's cluelessness, and Tony Blair's attempts to curry favor with all involved. Helen Mirren deservedly won the 2006 Oscar for best performance by an actress, and the rest of the cast turns in creditable performances as well. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were allowed.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Scent of a Woman collides with Silence of the Lambs in this bizarre, beautiful and bittersweet story of a compulsive killer.<br /><br />A savant of smell, Parisian-born orphan Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) grows up in the 18th-century school of hard knocks, yet is determined to become the greatest perfumer the world has ever known. As he stalks the evanescent aroma of a beautiful young redhead (Karoline Herfurth), his obsession turns to tragedy, setting him of a life-path of death and destruction.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A visual feast that almost magically conjures the scents onscreen<br />A serial killer story steeped in a historically-heightened fairytale feel<br /><br />Cons:<br />A little too much foreshadowing makes the movie drag here and there<br /><br />Perfume is brilliantly cast, with great -- and sometimes delightfully over-the-top -- performances from silver screen stars like Dustin Hoffman (master perfumer), John Hurt (narrator), and Alan Rickman (the protective father of a would-be Grenouille victim). Ben Whishaw portrays a truly reprehensible, murderous character with no redeeming qualities, yet he imbues  Grenouille with a pitiable, sympathetic air reminiscent of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.<br /><br />It's very well-directed (if somewhat a tad too leisurely) by Run Lola Run's Tom Tykwer, and wonderfully wrought by everyone else from the set-designer, to the composer, to the flower-finder.<br /><br />This is a difficult film to describe without spilling too many surprises, so all I can say is: take the time to stop smell the cinematic rose that is Perfume.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
630522577X|5.0|I had not watched this marvelous movie for many years when I took the opportunity to watch it again.  The movie is a little stiff in places, but that stiffness seemed, to me, to enhance the formality of English high society.  Audrey Hepburn belies that stiffness with her free-spirited characterization of Eliza Doolittle.  Eliza contrasts nicely with Henry Higgin's mother, played by veteran actor Gladys Cooper (\\"The Happiest Millionaire,\\" \\"The Song of Bernadette,\\" and \\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\").  Mrs. Higgins is quite proper and perfect in every situation.  Henry, played by the incomparable Sir Rex Harrison, is disdainful and aloof.  Henry believes he is the remote scientific observer who can categorize and stereotype everyone, and is not affected by his surroundings.<br /><br />A problem arises when Henry Higgins bets Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White, \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (1965) and \\"In Search of the Castaways\\") that he could take anyone, such as Eliza Doolittle, and turn them into something like a lady's maid or a shop girl.  Colonel Pickering takes Henry up on his bet, volunteering to finance the experiment.<br /><br />Looking at the next part of this movie with five decades of life, I quickly saw the problem that Henry was getting into.  Henry was taking a human life adjusted to a certain set of surroundings, modifying that life so that it no longer fit in, and was then prepared to cast that life adrift once he proved his point.  Henry failed to see that he did anything wrong, and therein lies the irony and pathos of this movie.  The question a first-time watcher asks is whether Henry will be able to grow up at last and realize that people require compassion and empathy and are more than science experiments.<br /><br />In addition to a marvelous story, this movie boasts wonderful music and excellent sets.  Though some of Audrey Hepburn's singing survived, Marni Nixon sang most of the music attributed to Hepburn.  Nixon's singing was phenomenal and her singing voice is close enough to Hepburn's that it sounds as though Hepburn could be singing.<br /><br />Other singing numbers contained extensive choreography on expansive sets.  Two complexly choreographed songs that come to mind are \\"Get Me to the Church on Time\\" and the \\"Ascot Gavotte.\\"<br /><br />This movie featured an array of sets depicting street scenes and interior scenes.  Though the street scenes were excellent, my favorite set in the movie has always been Henry Higgin's incredible library.  I would love to have his library in my house, though duplicating that library would be incredibly expensive.<br /><br />This movie won 20 awards, which includes eight Oscars.  Rex Harrison won the Best Actor Oscar and the movie won the Best Picture Oscar, both highly coveted awards.  Harrison won many other awards for this film, and \\"My Fair Lady\\" became the most awarded movie of 1965.<br /><br />Of course, awards do not necessarily mean a film is either good or great.  However, Rex Harrison, Audrey Hepburn and Wilfrid Hyde-White have such incredible acting skills and such screen presence that they make this film a joy to watch.  I was spell-bound as I watched Audrey Hepburn become Eliza Doolittle and capture the hearts of everyone in the movie.  Rex Harrison was incredible as Henry Higgins.  This movie was either Harrison's best, or one of his best.<br /><br />The story is also captivating.  Henry Higgins experiments with the life of a human being.  What Henry Higgins failed to realize is that once he became involved with his subject, he lost his objectivity and learned compassion.  Love can come from compassion.  The only thing that surprised me in this viewing of the movie is that I previously had not realized how early in the movie that Eliza Doolittle had come to love Henry Higgins.<br /><br />\\"My Fair Lady\\" is one of the best musicals of all time.  The combination of story, acting, singing and sets is amazing.  Fans of musicals and love stories will enjoy this movie, even on multiple viewings.<br /><br />Enjoy!will enjoy this movie, even on multiple viewings. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />
B000OVLBEO|2.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\", which came out theatrically in February of this year, stars Nicolas Cage in the title role and is based on a comic-book series, so I wasn't expecting \\"Citizen Kane\\" on a chopper, and I did have some intermittent fun with the flashy film. However, overall it's kind of a mess. The action sequences, though ultimately empty exercises, are often exciting, and when the movie keeps it light and airy, there's an enjoyable exuberance to the proceedings (but all too often, it dips into dour drama and schmaltzy romance). Definitely one for the DVD player, not the big screen. (Originally posted at SciFi.com)<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B000RJO58M|5.0|Nicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford. Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman. The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life \\"bad boy,\\" and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny's puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel's growing frustration. However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny's dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It's time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|Great movie and great Blu-Ray disc.The Road Warrior looks very good in High Def and it looks alot better then the DVD version.The Road Warrior has always been one of my favorite movies and the car stunts in the movie are amazing.I also thought Mel did a great job as Max and it's no surprise that he went on to become a huge star.Yeah I know Mel has lost some fans due to his drunken antics,but that's not going to stop me from watching Mel Gibson movies,hes starred in some great movies and also directed some great movies such as Braveheart,Passion of The Christ,and Apocalypto.Well anyway if you are a fan of The Mad Max movies and you where disapointed with the DVD version of The Road Warrior and you have a PS3 or a stand alone Blu-Ray player then get The Road Warrior on Blu-Ray it blows the DVD version away.Also it's been released on HD DVD too.I do hope George Miller will someday get the 4th film Mad Max:Fury Road made?
B0001I55SS|3.0|This movie is super dumb and cheesy, but I love it. It must be that 11-year-old effect, as that's the age I was when this came out. I had ALL the illustrated storybooks and models and fold-out posters... everything that was released before the movie came out. Ooh, I even had the LP that told the story of the movie with sound effects and dialogue! It was all in anticipation, however, because once I saw it I realized, even as a small [actually somewhat portly] 11-year-old, that this movie was DUMB.<br /><br />Then I reevaluated as an adult. I tell you, a great deal of fun [and some small agony] can be had by going back to those Disney movies that defined your youth. For me it was the live-action period that yielded gems such as Escape to Witch Mountain [WHERE is the remake?!?!?!?] and such burnished turds as The Cat From Outer Space. And I saw them all, and for the most part, read the \\"novelizations.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, back to this one. This movie has some GREAT material, and some terrible material. Curiously, it seems that all the legitimately great material was provided by people who were NOT the director. The model of the Cygnus is cool. My favorite part of the movie is the shots of the huge ship silhouetted against the bluish starfields beyond, and the languid sequence in which the smaller Palomino drifts by it with its spotlight running over the latticework of the larger ship. The design of the red evil robot is awesome. The black hole itself is fascinating to look at [day-glo paint in a whirlpool]. Oh, and I love the opening music, and I like the green grid under the credits, though that's a little less defensible. So what it seems like is that you have a bunch of peripheral people, the model makers, the special effects folks, the composer, etc., giving their all and producing great work, which stands in shocking contrast to the rest of the movie!<br /><br />The movie concerns a bunch of folks in the typical \\"about to go home after X years exploring space\\" mission. They find the black hole, then see the big ship near it, and go to investigate in the aforementioned favorite sequence. Then there's a slight action sequence in which they start to tumble into the black hole.<br /><br />THEN you have the most hootworthy sequence of the entire film, in which it is revealed that the woman aboard is PSYCHIC. Not only that, but so is the ROBOT [with the big dumb cartoon eyes]. My favorite part of all this is the convention that the psychic woman, to convey that she's using her abilities, stares dreamily off into space, and the robot, to show that he's receiving the psychic message, suddenly snaps his eyes to face directly into the camera! That is SO precious.<br /><br />Anyway, so their ship is--of course--damaged, and they have to land. They explore the ship, make it to the bridge, where the captain, who may as well be wearing an \\"evil genius\\" badge, greets them, along with his menacing red robot. Blah, blah, blah, it all follows a \\"haunted house in space\\" theme, until it is revealed that the captain made robots [cyborgs, I guess] out of all the crew and now they're--still the crew, just a bit less uppity.<br /><br />It all has that charmingly naïve dippiness of those live-action Disney movies, especially in its utter obliviousness to its own clich&eacute;s. The robots with the cute eyes are obviously there to appeal to the kids [like I was at the time, but even then I could see that it was... obviously there to appeal to the kids]. There's this one sequence in which the robots play a video game... against a robot called S.T.A.R.... oh dear, it hurts. But for all that there are sequences that are kind of cool, like the asteroid shower. WHY asteroids are all glowing from within, and why one is perfectly spherical, and why they all show up JUST at the right time, is left unexplained, but it's still kind of cool in a naïve way. You accept it when you know it's a Disney movie made for 10-year-olds.<br /><br />Anyway, the other reason this movie is notable is for the ending. [I guess I have to put a SPOILER WARNING in here, even though in this case... anyway.] There is a lot of IDIOTIC claptrap about the black hole possibly being a PORTAL TO HELL [oooohhh!], and at the very end, the evil captain is shown INSIDE the evil robot [trapped for eternity inside his own creation! Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha!!], in this representation of a literal HELL, with red background, black jagged rocks, flames, the whole deal. The thing that cracks me up is that they just arrange the model on top of a rock and let it SIT THERE, arms in the air, utterly stationary, for at least a minute. It is kind of... appalling. I guess they REALLY didn't expect anyone over the age of 10 to attend this movie.<br /><br />And WHAT'S with all that hyper-Christian moralizing, anyway? I thought we were watching a dumb space story.<br /><br />Anyway, it's still fun and has a lot of good elements, all of which seem to have taken place without the participation of the director. Someone needs to take this and do a remake that takes the whole thing seriously.the other reason this movie is notable is for the ending.

0783240236|5.0|Hitchcock's last truly great film, The Birds, is an anomaly in his oeuvre by being based on a supernatural force, rather than the motives and machinations of his characters. And as a supernatural film, it opens itself to interpretation of what the real-world phenomenon is that the birds serve as metaphor for. The question everyone has about this film is: WHY are the birds attacking? Hitchcock, in his book of interviews with François Truffaut, says that he doesn't believe there IS a reason for the bird attacks. But even if Hitchcock or screenwriter Evan Hunter did not intend to provide a solid reason for the attacks, their work does present a subtext and pattern of dialogue and events that can be interpreted. I believe that a persuasive case can be made that the birds are the manifestation of the mother's rage at rivals for her son's affection.<br /><br />THE FILM:<br /><br />The main character of the film is Melanie Daniels, played by Tippi Hedren. Melanie is the daughter of a San Francisco newspaper executive and, though it is difficult to see today, is supposed to be a wild international party girl. She is introduced walking across the street to a pet shop. A man's appreciative whistle is heard offscreen, and when Melanie turns hear head to smile, she sees masses of birds swirling in the distance.<br /><br />Melanie enters the bird shop, where she has ordered a pair of Mynah birds. She intends to teach them naughty language in order to mortify her \\"prim and strait-laced\\" Aunt Tess. While the shopkeeper is in the back, Mitch Brenner [Rod Taylor] walks in and pretends to mistake Melanie for a shop assistant. He says he is looking for lovebirds that are \\"not too demonstrative, nor too aloof. Just friendly.\\" Melanie does her best to fake her way through a discussion on the mating and molting habits of birds, releasing a yellow canary [similar to the color of Melanie's golden hair] into the shop in the process. As Mitch catches it, he says \\"Back into your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels,\\" revealing that he knows who Melanie is and of her scandalous past. Taken aback, Melanie decides to play a trick on Mitch in return. She purchases the lovebirds he was looking for and takes them up to his house in Bodega Bay, about an hour North of San Francisco.<br /><br />When Melanie arrives, she receives a great deal of helpful exposition about the layout of the town. A plot contrivance gets her to the home of Annie Hayworth [Suzanne Pleshette], who has been out working in her garden. \\"This tilling of the soil can become compulsive,\\" she says. We will find out later that Annie is a former flame of Mitch's, but their relationship was destroyed by pressures from Mitch's mother Lydia. Tilling of the soil is what Adam was charged to do upon being cast out of Eden, by the way. Annie probes Melanie to find out what she's doing in Bodega Bay, and is rather arch upon realizing that Melanie is the latest pretty young thing to try to win his affection. She notices the birds in the car. Upon being told that they're lovebirds, she says \\"I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.\\" Melanie's confident \\"Thank you,\\" and toss of the head is priceless.<br /><br />Melanie takes a small boat across the bay and deposits the birds in the Brenner's house. Mitch sees the birds, sees her, and drives to the other side of the bay to meet her. As Melanie confidently approaches Mitch in the boat, a seagull dives toward her, cutting her forehead.<br /><br />Mitch takes Melanie into the local diner, where, after some light flirtation, they meet Mitch's mother, Lydia. She is made up as an older version of Melanie, with a similar outfit and hairstyle, emphasizing that she could be somewhat interchangeable with the women who want Mitch. Lydia seems very disconcerted by Melanie's presence, especially upon learning that she has been invited for dinner. Upon learning that Melanie has brought not just any birds, but lovebirds, Lydia's response, \\"Oh, I see,\\" echoing Annie's reaction, further reinforces the similarities between his suitors.<br /><br />Melanie goes to dinner at the Brenner's that night and meets Mitch's sister, Cathy [Veronica Cartwright], who takes an immediate liking to Melanie. Lydia confides her misgivings about Melanie's partying past to Mitch, who calls her \\"dear\\" and \\"darling,\\" while brushing her off. It is clear from the look on Lydia's face that her worries have not been eased. Before Melanie leaves, Cathy invites her to her eleventh birthday party the next day.<br /><br />Melanie returns to Annie's house [where she's staying the night]. They have a conversation in which Anne reveals that she had an affair with Mitch four years before, just after his father died. In response to Melanie's protestation that there's nothing between her and Mitch, Annie responds: \\"Maybe there's nothing between Mitch and any girl.\\" They were seeing each other, until he brought her to meet Lydia, whose \\"attitude nearly drove me crazy... I spent days trying to find out exactly what I'd done to displease her.\\" And what had she done? \\"Nothing. I simply existed. ...Now that I'm no longer a threat we're very good friends.\\" Annie speculates that what Lydia feels isn't simply possessiveness or jealously, but fear of being abandoned. Melanie articulates what I think happens by the end of the movie, which is that Lydia \\"would be gaining a daughter.\\" Annie goes on to tell that even after her relationship with Mitch ended, she moved to Bodega Bay just to be near him. Mitch calls and invites Melanie to the birthday party the next day, while Annie, in a wonderfully framed shot, listens with detached interest. Hanging up the phone, Melanie asks Annie if she should go. Told it's up to her, she responds \\"It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?\\" Annie tells her to \\"never mind Lydia,\\" and Melanie agrees to disregard what Lydia might think about it, and attend the party. At that moment a gull smashes into the front door.<br /><br />The next day, at the party, Melanie and Mitch walk alone away from the group. Melanie tells Mitch of her plan to teach dirty words to the Mynah bird she is giving Aunt Tess, and Mitch responds \\"You need a mother's care, my child.\\" This brings an unpleasant memory to Melanie, who tells of being abandoned by her mother at eleven [the same age Cathy is turning on that day], and she hasn't seen her since. Feeling foolish, she says \\"I ought to go join the other children.\\" Near the house, Annie watches them on their way down from their obviously romantic walk. A few seconds later, Lydia comes out of the house and pauses, also watching the couple returning from their walk. Immediately after, seagulls attack the party.<br /><br />Later that evening, Melanie is planning on returning to Annie's. Mitch suggests that she stay the night. Lydia freezes upon hearing this invitation, and then sparrows stream into the room through the chimney.<br /><br />The local sheriff visits after the attack, but is ineffectual. While this is happening, Melanie watches Lydia neurotically gather pieces of broken teacups and try to piece them together. Melanie offers to put Cathy to bed, and suggests that she stay the night, \\"if it's all right with Mitch.\\" Lydia again reacts.<br /><br />The next morning Lydia drives over a nearby farm, the Fawcett's. Not hearing a response to her call, she goes inside and notes some broken teacups--and we all know what that means. The wordless sequence in which she explores the house, finds the body, and reacts showcases Hitchcock's wonderful ability to tell a story entirely visually. On her way back to her house, there is a shot in which it appears that she will run down Mitch and Melanie with her truck.<br /><br />Later, Melanie brings Lydia tea in her bed. Lydia alternates so suddenly between describing her fear of being abandoned and her worry for Cathy that it becomes apparent that her concern for Cathy is a mask for her fear of abandonment. She says she feels that she lost all of her strength when herhusband died, and that she can't relax or sleep since he's been dead. She says she lacks her dead husband's talent for understanding her children, for entering into their world and \\"becoming part of them.\\" She says that on certain days she wakes up \\"and there's a very good reason for getting out of bed\\" --until she remembers that her husband is dead.<br /><br />When Melanie is about to go, Lydia bids her to stay. \\"I feel as if I don't understand you at all and I want so much to understand. Because my son seems to be very fond of you... and I don't know quite how I feel about it. I don't even know if I like you or not.\\" Melanie asks \\"Do you HAVE to like Mitch's girlfriends? Lydia says she wants to like whatever girl Mitch chooses, but Mitch does exactly what he wants. She then becomes emotional and articulates her fear of being left alone. This immediately reverts back into worry for Cathy. Melanie volunteers to go to the school to check on her. As she's leaving, Lydia warmly thanks her for the tea.<br /><br />Melanie arrives at the school, and waits outside in the justly famous sequence of the massing crows. The birds attack the children as they run away from the school. This is followed by the also-famous sequence in the diner, in which various perspectives on the bird's behavior are aired, including one that says birds are dirty, messy animals and should be killed. A mother at the diner protests that the talk of bird attacks is scaring her children. This is followed by the brilliant attack on the diner and gas station. In the Truffaut book, Hitchcock says that in placing Melanie in the phone booth, he wanted to give the effect of her being a bird trapped in a cage. When the attack is over, Mitch and Melanie venture inside. The survivors, huddled inside, are made up entirely of women [save one male child]. The mother of the children addresses Melanie: \\"They said when you got here, the whole thing started.... I think you're the cause of all this. I think you're evil.\\"<br /><br />During the same attack, Annie was killed protecting Cathy. Mitch, Melanie and Cathy return to the Brenner home. At one point, Lydia demands to know what Mitch thinks they should do, and when he can't supply a satisfactory answer, she bursts out: \\"You don't know! You don't know! If only your father were here...\\" She then catches herself and apologizes. After a time, another attack occurs, this time with barely any birds seen at all, just the sound of them all around the house. After the attack has ended, Hitchcock brilliantly indicates that the birds have gotten into a room upstairs by shooting the characters in a hard up angle, emphasizing the space above them.<br /><br />Later, when everyone else is asleep, Melanie ventures upstairs and explores a closed room. She is attacked by the birds. Note that this time the birds do not make any cries, the only sound heard is the flutter of their wings. Melanie is rescued and taken downstairs, but is now nearly catatonic. Mitch says that she requires medical treatment and that they must leave.<br /><br />A radio report states that \\"Bodega Bay seems to be the center [of the attacks].\\" The massed birds outside the house are now calm. Mitch and Lydia help Melanie to the car. In the last bit of dialogue, Cathy asks: \\"Can I bring the lovebirds? They haven't harmed anyone.\\" In the car, Melanie lays her head on Lydia's shoulder, squeezes her arm, and gazes vulnerably up at her. Feeling this, Lydia smiles down on her and affectionately nuzzles her forehead. The car drives unhindered through the masses of birds.<br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br /><br />The first clue is the title. \\"Birds\\" is a British slang term for women, and that seems to be what this movie is all about. The first scene in the bird shop sets up the flirtation between Mitch and Melanie, establishes Melanie's character as a brash, confident modern woman, and draws the connection between the two of them and the birds. It also gives a hint of Melanie's problems with maternal mother figures with her wish to give prim and straitlaced Aunt Tess the trash-talking Mynah birds.<br /><br />The fact that Melanie sees a swirling mass of birds in San Francisco at the very beginning of the film has been argued to discredit the theory that the birds are the manifestation of rage directed specifically at Melanie, as she has not yet met Lydia yet. I think the explanation is a mundane one: Hitchcock, also in the Truffaut book, says that he felt pressure to include the presence of birds early in the film, in order to stave off his audience's growing impatience to get to the bird attacks that they had come to see. Since, at the very end of the film, the radio report says that the attacks are centered in Bodega Bay, we can assume that what she's seeing is just an unrelated bunch of birds.<br /><br />The scene in which Melanie fist meets Lydia in the diner is interesting, as it portrays the three women [Melanie, Lydia, and Annie] as somewhat interchangeable. First, Lydia's appearance almost exactly mirrors Melanie's, except that she is in grey while Melanie is in gold--both of their outfits matching their hair color. Lydia also replicates Annie's reaction to the lovebirds: \\"Oh I see.\\" This emphasizes Lydia's fear that she can be replaced and thus left alone; if all the women are the same, Lydia isn't necessarily needed. What sets Melanie apart is her confidence, specifically that she can manipulate men at her will. Lydia is hard-pressed to compete with that, and Annie won't even try.<br /><br />The first four attacks are explicitly tied to Mitch and Melanie's relationship, and three of them directly follow upon content revolving around going against Lydia's wishes. The first attack, as Melanie is about to meet Mitch on the pier, cementing their flirtation; the second, just after Melanie decides to ignore Lydia's wishes and attend the party; the third, just after Lydia sees Mitch and Melanie returning from their romantic walk; and the fourth being the sparrow attack after Mitch suggests that Melanie spend the night. Since each of these attacks occurs immediately after displeasing Lydia, it is easy to conclude that the attacks are in some way an expression of Lydia's rage brought on by Melanie making progress with Mitch.<br /><br />So, why do the attacks become more generalized after this point? What happens in between is that Melanie brings Lydia tea in bed, and by the time that they're done, Lydia has begun to like Melanie. She listens to Lydia's concerns about Cathy, her feeling of having lost her strength, her wish to like Mitch's girlfriends, and finally, Lydia opens up about her fear of being abandoned... which is fairly remarkable, considering her general antipathy toward Melanie. This is the beginning of the process that completes itself by the end of the movie, which is, as Melanie puts it, \\"she would be gaining a daughter.\\" The two important points of this conversation are that Melanie offers to go check on Cathy, taking Lydia's fears seriously and seeking to ally them, and also that Melanie asks if it's so important for Lydia to like Mitch's girlfriends. We don't know conclusively from the film, but one would guess that the possibility of not liking one of Mitch's girlfriends, while still accepting that Mitch likes her, has never occurred to Lydia.<br /><br />At the same time that Lydia begins to have these conflicted feelings for Melanie, the attacks become more generalized and frenzied. The idea of forces created by psychic energy attacking indiscriminately and even harming the originator of the psychic force isn't so unheard of; it also occurs in Forbidden Planet and Carrie. It is clear, from the abrupt subject transitions in Lydia's talk with Melanie over tea--from her feelings of powerlessness and fear of being abandoned to her worry for Cathy--that these subjects are unconsciously connected in her head. The scene in the diner after the attack on the gas station further elucidates the ideathat the attacks center on Melanie herself as the mother observes that the attacks started when Melanie arrived in town, and that Melanie is the cause of them. If you buy the idea that the attacks are the manifestation of Lydia's rage against her, the woman is right. And it's true--the attacks did start when Melanie arrived.<br /><br />Later that night, back at the Brenner house, it is easy to notice that Melanie has fallen into the mother role with Cathy, holding her close and attending carefully to her, while Lydia herself just sits down helplessly by the piano, watching. The attack that occurs soon after, in which we barely see any birds, could be seen as serving our subtext, in that the characters are cowering in fear from sounds alone--no immediate physical threat. In the Truffaut book, Hitchcock directly states that he shot this scene to emphasize that the characters are cowering from nothing. It may be overinterpretation to believe that this supports the idea that the bird attacks emanate from psychological forces in the character's minds, but it also doesn't disprove it.<br /><br />Melanie's attack in the upstairs bedroom is what mentally breaks her. The confidence she exuded toward the beginning of the film is completely stripped from her, and she becomes like a child that needs to be taken care of. Her squeezing of Lydia's arm, and smiling up toward her, shows Lydia that Melanie is no longer a threat, and in fact now needs Lydia to take care of her. Lydia smiles at this, and nuzzles Melanie's head like an affectionate parent--she has \\"gained a daughter,\\" as Melanie said, and the threat of being abandoned for Melanie is now significantly reduced.<br /><br />We know that there was another bird attack written into the original script as the car drives away, so the attacks are not over, but, based only on the film itself, one could guess that now that Lydia's rage has been allayed, the birds are present, asserting their power, but placid and not attacking.<br /><br />The last line of the film, \\"Can I bring the lovebirds? They haven't harmed anyone\\" reminds us that for all the sparring and manipulation Mitch and Melanie have practiced on each other, in the end they were the innocent and bewildered victims of a phenomenon they unknowingly caused.all this. I think you're evil.\\" <br /> <br />During the same attack, Annie was killed protecting Cathy. Mitch, Melanie and Cathy return to the Brenner home. At one point, Lydia demands to know what Mitch thinks they should do, and when he can't supply a satisfactory answer, she bursts out: \\"You don't know! You don't know! If only your father were here...\\" She then catches herself and apologizes. After a time, another attack occurs, this time with barely any birds seen at all, just the sound of them all around the house. After the attack has ended, Hitchcock brilliantly indicates that the birds have gotten into a room upstairs by shooting the characters in a hard up angle, emphasizing the space above them. <br /> <br />Later, when everyone else is asleep, Melanie ventures upstairs and explores a closed room. She is attacked by the birds. Note that this time the birds do not make any cries, the only sound heard is the flutter of their wings. Melanie is rescued and taken downstairs, but is now nearly catatonic. Mitch says that she requires medical treatment and that they must leave. <br /> <br />A radio report states that \\"Bodega Bay seems to be the center [of the attacks].\\" The massed birds outside the house are now calm. Mitch and Lydia help Melanie to the car. In the last bit of dialogue, Cathy asks: \\"Can I bring the lovebirds? They haven't harmed anyone.\\" In the car, Melanie lays her head on Lydia's shoulder, squeezes her arm, and gazes vulnerably up at her. Feeling this, Lydia smiles down on her and affectionately nuzzles her forehead. The car drives unhindered through the masses of birds. <br /> <br />DISCUSSION: <br /> <br />The first clue is the title. \\"Birds\\" is a British slang term for women, and that seems to be what this movie is all about. The first scene in the bird shop sets up the flirtation between Mitch and Melanie, establishes Melanie's character as a brash, confident modern woman, and draws the connection between the two of them and the birds. It also gives a hint of Melanie's problems with maternal mother figures with her wish to give prim and straitlaced Aunt Tess the trash-talking Mynah birds. <br /> <br />The fact that Melanie sees a swirling mass of birds in San Francisco at the very beginning of the film has been argued to discredit the theory that the birds are the manifestation of rage directed specifically at Melanie, as she has not yet met Lydia yet.

B000PTYP5C|3.0|There are lots of cool parts in this album, but there's also many cheesy parts that are just plain embarrassing that I hope nobody in the car next to me hears.  It's not fun when you have to fast-forward the track to avoid the really lame vocals. <br /> <br />I'd say half the album is sweet, other half is just plain lame - better than Octavarium though (more original at least).  But still not as good as I&W and Awake. <br /> <br />And who else besides me hates keyboard solos???  I mean really - solos should be left to the guitarist.  Maybe if what Jordan was doing wasn't so irritating to listen to, I don't know...

B000PFUAO6|2.0|... this is for you. <br /> <br />I don't play an instrument (except for a mean guitar on Guitar Hero) so I can't comment on their musical ability - I initially got into DT during the Pull Me Under era because they sounded like nothing I had heard before and their lyrics painted a picture and were intelligent, not generic and cliched. <br /> <br />That DT, I fear, is dead. <br /> <br />When I saw they were signed to Roadrunner I thought ... good.  When I saw they were producing their album alone again I thought ... bad.  Unfortunately, there was little good to this release.  If you are a blind adherent I'm sure you'll think this is another stellar release, but I can't get past the cheesy lyrics, Portney's horrific vocal \\"stylings\\", and Ruddess doing nothing for me.  I mean ... how can you not laugh during \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" - with laughable lyrics and an even worse vocal delivery?  Why can't they have an outside producer come in - is it an ego thing? <br /> <br />I agree, at times, that in some cases a CD requires multiple listens to appreciate, but should they really?  Shouldn't it stand out from the crowd from the beginning?  I think so.  I cringed the moment I played the first track and it didn't get much better, until The Ministry of Lost Souls - which was tolerable.  But of course - the track was about 5 minutes too long. <br /> <br />Obviously I am in the minority, but this thing is a clunker.  Loud and uninspired, this is the last time I buy DT on the first day of release - if at all.  Sorry guys, try again.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I originally saw this on VHS ages ago (back before DVD), which was the original uncut version. An absolute riveting masterpiece to me at the time. I was watching it when I myself was sailing on a merchant vessel in the middle of the ocean and had plenty of time to kill, so I could some-what relate to the movie at the time I suppose.  Years and years later, I bought it on DVD for my collection, not realizing it was a different, shortened Director's Cut version. It just wasn't the same movie! <br /> <br />I think the editorial review at Amazon says it best when it compares the Directors cut/Un-cut versions of Das Boot with Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers.  Its the pace that sets the two versions apart, with the un-cut version seemingly unfolding in real time, and making you really feel what its like to be part of the crew. You feel the clausterphobia, and how tired you get of your shipmates faces, and the agonizing feeling of helplessness of getting blindly depth-charged. Really the true telling of a World War II epic of a submarine patrol! And the character development is lacking in the Director's cut version, as well as plot development. And we're not talking just a few outside shots of the submarine being edited out from the Director's cut, we're talking an hour and a half of the director's original vision gone!  Imagine taking an hour and a half out of another long-telling epic war movie, like Lawrence of Arabia, and boiling it down to just the more action-packed sequences. It wouldn't have been anywhere near the Best Picture oscar winner that it was! Its all those little, subtle things that all add up into making it fully what it is. (kinda random example, but hopefully helps to illustrate the point).  The Director's cut version of Das Boot is more of just a shallower action-flick, but admittedly is much more appealing to those with short attention spans. <br /> <br />But anyone who is into war movies, for their ultimate telling of the human condition in times of the most extreme psychological and physical conditions mankind can come up with, will appreciate the complexity of this full length version.  Those brave movie-goers that want to explore the depths and voyage into the misery, the insanity, the desperation, and the shear terror of war, will find the Un-cut version the ONLY version; and the Director's cut a much simpler, dumbing-down-of-america, crowd-pleasing type of movie. <br /> <br />When the original, un-cut version was finally released on DVD several years later, I rushed out and bought it THE VERY DAY it came out, and skipped work to go home and watch it.  Ah ya, baby, that's the good stuff.  Just what I had originally remembered, and what I had been jonesin' for since I was forced to settle with the inferior Director's cut version many years before.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I don't know why idiots keep on referring to this album as Death Metal--when it's not. It's Thrash!!!! Listen to the damn thing!!! This is Thrash Metal!! I guess every album morons hear with roaring vocals is Death Metal. Thats an ignorant categorization...but then again,these are idiots right? Anyway,by far,this is Sepultura's greatest album,hands down. Riffs,lyrics,drumming (my favorite) are excellently played and are in sync for the Thrash genre. \\"Inner Self\\",\\"Mass Hypnosis\\" and \\"Slave of Pain\\" caught my attention. The solos are just so beautiful,it's best to hear them and interpret them as your own. Stunning work. Buy it.

B000PKG6TE|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age smash and roar through some of the best, most influential hard rock out there, even with a lineup that never seems to be the same twice.<br /><br />And while their latest, \\"Era Vulgaris,\\" starts off with a whimper, it quickly works itself up into a bang that can be heard right through the end. Their music here is grimy, rough and raw, but it tries out some new sounds and quirkier edges, without losing the grimy, brooding feeling.<br /><br />It opens rather limply -- \\"Turning on the Screw,\\" a jumbled tangle of clashing cymbals, drums and almost mute basslines, which just sort of meanders around in circles. Josh Homme sings mournfully that \\"You got a question?/Please don't ask it/It puts the lotion in the basket.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately things perk up in the next song -- dark, rapid riffs and twisting melodies are all over \\"Sick Sick Sick,\\" a creepily rapid song that gets more tantalizing as it continues. And it leads in to more good music of various types -- the sinuous desert-rock, \\"Misfit Love's\\" weirdly plaintive lament, creepy industral grinds, tightly-woven rock'n'roll with a catchy edge, fuzzy blasts of muscular metal, and finally the shifting, layered finale \\"Run Pig Run.\\"<br /><br />\\"Era Vulgaris\\" is something of a contradiction -- it's a very polished album, but it also has grime, sweat and rough edges. That is to say, the band is expert at spinning some really tight songs with few weaknesses, but it's got the raw power you usually associate with young bands. Bless their dark little hearts.<br /><br />Homme's rapid, nimble guitar goes overtime with fast, sharp riffs. And that guitar is woven with some dark murky bass, rapid drums, darkly curling keyboard and occasionally some samples (a rattlesnake?), all played with rapid-fire energy. The music twists itself either into a hard-rock rope, or a thunderstorm of brooding, shifting musical layers. And they're not afraid to throw in something quirky and weird, like \\"Misfit Love.\\"<br /><br />Homme's jagged lyrics all center on his life near Hollywood -- selling out (\\"How many times must I sell myself before my pieces are gone?\\"), sex, taking risks and leaving the past behind all come into play. Homme sings them in a rough, enthusiastic voice, although he also gets to roar and groan some spoken lines -- and even gets accompanied by the smooth-voiced Mark Lanegan and mournful Julian Casablancas.<br /><br />Hollywood never seemed so alarming and enticing as in \\"Era Vulgaris,\\" which starts rather weakly, but soon blossoms into a dark, dirty little gem. Vibrant.near Hollywood -- selling out (\\"How many times must I sell myself before my pieces are gone?\\"), sex, taking risks and leaving the past behind all come into play.

B0000264XJ|5.0|The Doors were one of those really great rock bands -- they flared up briefly, shone brightly, and then died away with the untimely death of their frontman, Jim Morrison. And listening to their debut album, it's easy to see why people still listen -- hard-hitting, swirling bluesy-rock songs, with sensual vocals in the middle.<br /><br />It opens with gritty riffs and a rippling organ, forming a catchy, dark melody that seems to be full of urgency. And the song Morrison sings is full of emotion, ranging from affection to a haunted paranoia. \\"I found an island in your arms/Country in your eyes/Arms that chain us/Eyes that lie/Break on through to the other side!\\" he sings smoothly.<br /><br />The songs that follow are in the same musical mold, but they try out different combos -- jazzy rock with mellotron, plaintive raw rockers, a delicately soaring mythic ballad, rough bluesy rock with a twangy edge, and the howling, impassioned \\"Back Door Man.\\"<br /><br />It also contains two of their most famous songs: the legendary \\"Light My Fire,\\" a shimmeringly catchy little single. And it finishes up with the legendary \\"The End,\\" a sort of eerie symbolic journey-song with an Oedipal twist. \\"Ride the snake, ride the snake/To the lake, the ancient lake, baby/The snake is long, seven miles/Ride the snake...hes old, and his skin is cold...\\"<br /><br />This isn't the Doors' most polished work, but it's definitely their most passionate -- you can hear in Morrison's voice, and in the blasting-out instrumentation. These guys were just starting their musical journey, and they were full of enthusiasm and musical inspiration.<br /><br />And that musical inspiration shines in these melodies, whether it's raw grimy stuff influenced by the blues, or some more polished, danceable songs. Robby Krieger twisted some amazing riffs into shape, and John Densmore providedthe drums. And Ray Manzarek deserves special attention for those brilliant rippling keyboards, including the famous organ intro.<br /><br />But what makes it beyond great? That would be Morrison. His cryptic songs are full of mythic allusions, sexual hints, giant snakes, dusty highways, and nameless women. And his smooth voice can change from a croon to a howl to a chant at a moment's notice.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" show off the Doors at the start of their public career, overflowing with musical skills and energy. Definitely a must-listen for classic rock fans.organ intro.  <br /> <br />But what makes it beyond great? That would be Morrison.

B000Q3648S|5.0|Daydream Nation is clearly Sonic Youth's breakthrough album. A two lp set that focused all their previous ideas into one cohesive and brilliant album. The songs are stretched out more (though still song length)giving more of an idea of what they sounded like live. Music at this time was stuck in pop doldrums. Sonic Youth, which had built up a cult following, after the release of this album were then signed by a major label and brought all the indie rock bands into the light eventually including one that was just getting a start in Seattle that would soon eclipse all of them in popularity. However, back to Daydream Nation. The sprawling, though in no way self indulgent quality of the album took Sonic Youth into a new direction. Now, in getting the deluxe reissue treatment,it sheds new light on the album. On the 2nd disc you not only get live versions of all of the songs on the album (and Sonic Youth live takes what they do in the studio to a new level) but rarities as their version of \\"Within You, Without You\\" which was previously only available on a rare tribute album. If Daydream Nation were released for the first time this year, it would be one of the best albums of the year and with this deluxe reissue, in many ways it is.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|At first listen to this album I was a bit disappointed - maybe my anticipation and expectations had overwhelmed me.  I have been a huge Rush fan since \\"All the World's a Stage\\" was released when I was an early teen.  Rush has literally provided me with the soundtrack of my life (thus far)and I hold their early work dear.  I know they are a progressive band and continually grow as artists,  but deep inside me I want to hear new material reminiscent of the \\"old\\" Rush (Fly by Night through Permanent Waves).  Don't get me wrong - I like the releases post Permanent Waves but I do miss that \\"sound\\".  SO... you can see why I may have been initially disappointed with this album.  I listened to it about ten times and put it aside for a week. When I gave it another listen my appreciation for it was completely different.  I don't know why - it's almost as if my brain needed to digest it for a while. I only gave it 3 stars because for a Rush album it is good - not great (like  most of their work).  Who knows - maybe in another couple of weeks I would rate it 4 stars.  Like I said, it needs to grow on you.<br />I was reviewing my old reviews and felt this one needed an update.  I was right, this cd did grow on me.  A few months after I wrote this initial review I found this cd in my player daily. I couldn't get enough of it.  I absolutely love this album; and have updated it to 4 stars!

Needless to say it scared the hell out of me.<br /><br />This album is quite good, and isn't nearly as interested in finding a destination as \\"( )\\" or \\"&Aacute;gætis Byrjun\\".  I especially enjoy \\"D&ouml;gun\\" and the meandering \\"Hafss&oacute;l\\".  Give this one a shot...it has some pleasant surprises.
B0009A40ES|2.0|I love this movie, I have since I rented about 5 years ago.  I dont' really understand it, I guess I should read the book, but I think It's a really well done movie.  Of course Bale is great, i love him as bateman and I also loved the period of the film.  The special features on this edition are a different story.  The version I already had only included one short featurette that was interesting, but short, and left me wanting more.  So, naturally I thought I struck gold with the \\"uncut killers edition\\".  Too bad most of the special features have NOTHING to do with the movie.  A group of about 20 totally random people comment, one at a time, on new york in the eigthies for about an hour. I know that sounds weird, and it is, but its true.  TOTALLY RANDOM  people that had nothing to do with the movie (most of them). Honestly, I havent watched the movie yet, the special features were all I could handle at the time.  There are 5 deleted scenes that add up to about 2 minutes, so this was barely worth it, only because I love this movie so much.

1594489505|5.0|I had my doubts he could produce another book of The Kite Runner's quality, but he certainly has.  The character development is great, and even though you won't like everyone, you will understand what drives them.  This is beautifully written, all the charters come together in a credible, tightly woven conclusion, and this book does not have the nightmare-producing qualities of his first book (you can lend this one to your mother and grandmother, and will want to).You will also finish the book with plenty of reasons to be grateful you are an American woman.  The best book of 2007, so far.
B00005JNS0|2.0|I found the lack of people in this movie made it kind of silly. Who built the buildings, the racetrack, and the cars themselves? I thought it would have been a little bit more watchable if the cars had humans to deal and relate with. The cars could have spoke to one another on the sly so to speak.<br /><br />I know this movie was for kids, but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of thought that went into the making of it. I was truly bored along with my grandson trying to watch it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't think of any tv show I like as much as I love this one, it has made me believe in Joss Whedon's genius..  I didn't get to start watching it until after I saw the movie but I wish I had known about it before, I definitely would have made this a show not to miss.    <br /> <br />This show has got it all. Action, drama, comedy, love, horror (I don't know about anyone else but the reavers scare me). I couldn't have asked for more from this show.. except more episodes.
0307383415|5.0|This is a good insight into Mr. Obama who is a candidate for the presidency.  This is an inside view of him in his words.  I enjoyed reading the autobiography.  He is candid and forthcoming about what has shaped him as a person.  I recommend the book to anyone who would like to get to know the candidate.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Theres a number of opinions going around about this album. The thing is, good or bad, it's not old Megadeth. MD did not \\"lose\\" anything since any post Friedman CD. They experimented and Dave Mustaine grew as an artist. <br /> <br />This is not the new/old sound of Megadeth. <br />This is the sound Dave has been looking for. (not speaking for him) <br />It's a combination of Cryptic Writings thru System Has Failed with a more modern approach to speed metal. You'll only hear Holy Wars live because all bands change. You also must grow with the band. <br /> <br />United Abominations: Best Album ever? or in the last 10 years? Well, that could be left for personal opinion, but no doubt, if you're a true Megadeth or metal fan and not one of those fans who only like the first 3 albums of a band and have been waiting for 10-15 years for it to \\"happen\\" again, you'll dig this album.

B0006GAI6O|4.0|In \\"Shall We Dance?\\",  Richard Gere plays John Clark, a successful Chicago attorney.  He's got  a beautiful, successful wife (played by Susan Sarandon) and two normal, well-adjusted children.  However unknown to those closest to him, Mr. Clark is unhappy.     One day on his way home from work, he sees a beautiful woman (Jennifer Lopez) looking out a window of a dance studio.  She looks exactly the way he feels.  On impulse he leaves his train and enters the dance studio.  Confronted by `Paulina', he can think of nothing else but sign up for lessons.  It is through ballroom dancing he experiences joy and finds new friends.  His lessons are secret but his family notices a change in him.......    This film functions well on all levels.  It's about being yourself.  It's about the need for artistic expression.  Also it is about the sanctity of marriage and the basic human need for intimacy.  The supporting actors are brilliant especially Stanley Tucci as John Clark's law partner who maintains a secret life as a Latin dancer.  He hides his dream as under a ridiculous wig behind false teeth.  The school is run by alcoholic Miss Mitzi played by Anita Gillette in a fine subtle performance.      Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbi a woman that is anything but subtle.  She hides her insecurities and frustrations with life under an obnoxious personality.  Jennifer Lopez's scene explaining the rumba is classic.  Miss Mitzi's comment afterward sums it up perfectly..... :-)    The dance performances are superb.  Except for Jennifer Lopez, none of the principal characters  were trained as dancers.  In the case of Ms. Lopez she had no previous ballroom experience.  You'd never know it to see her dance.  The lack of dance experience in the other actors is beneficial to the film.  We get to see them evolve as they learn to dance and in the process grow as human beings.    This film is a western remake of the excellent Japanese original.  Since it is a remake, I can't give it the highest rating. The creative staff of this remake copied the fine features of the original with western sensibilities.  In the process they ensured the story lost none of the charm that makes a joy to watch.
B000002UAX|5.0|This has long been my favorite Beatles' album second only to 'Revolver.'  Due to its massive length, there are numerous different musical genres represented, enough to please every type of fan.  It also seems to be their album with the least amount of songs played on the average oldies or classic rock station.  Since there were no singles drawn from this album, these aren't songs the casual or new fan is likely to be very familiar with due to their lack of radio representation.  And while some people do feel that it would have been a lot tighter and more manageable had it been just a single album, the problem is that no two people can agree on just what should have been excluded and included.  (Probably my top vote for what should have been left off is the inane rubbishy \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\")<br /><br />The songs range from rough hard rock such as \\"Yer Blues,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" and \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide, Except Me and My Monkey,\\" poppy songs such as \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" (the first song Ringo wrote entirely on his own), country-western-style songs like \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" (though I usually skip this one now), softer songs like \\"Long, Long, Long\\" (one of my favorites), \\"Julia,\\" and \\"Blackbird,\\" and songs that are just plain weird, like \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" \\"Glass Onion,\\" and \\"Revolution 9.\\"  Being very into the avant-garde, I've always loved \\"Revolution 9\\" and have even listened to it on repeat a number of times.  While it's obviously not to everyone's tastes, one has to admit that this is a fascinating musical collage.  (The placement of \\"Good Night,\\" the final track, right after this song has also got to be the biggest juxtaposition on any Beatles' album ever!)  And since a lot of these songs were not recorded with all four bandmembers together in the studio, it often feels like a collection of their solo songs instead of a team effort by a real band.  However, this also serves to demonstrate how they had grown as musicians since the early Sixties, with a unique musical style emerging for each of them.  In particular we can hear how George had grown by leaps and bounds, proving he had come into his own as a great singer and songwriter.  Additionally, the often stripped-down sound can feel kind of refreshing after the overproduced songs of the previous year, whose core essences had been smothered by layer after layer and overdub and overdub, which also gives a lot of them a more dated feel instead of sounding truly classic and timeless.<br /><br />Above all, this is doubtless in the Top 5 of their greatest albums, and with enough musical styles to keep everyone happy, should be highly recommended to anyone interested in branching out and exploring songs that are less pop-oriented and radio-friendly than the songs on their more-widely-played albums.  It's also very special to me since it was almost the last album I ever heard in this lifetime, having played it the night before I was almost killed in a very serious car accident.y Sixties, with a unique musical style emerging for each of them.

And I thought it was nickelback at first but when I saw the name I knew I had to find this album. My favorite tracks is Say Goodbye, Santa Monica and Since you've been gone. This is a CD I recommend to anyone that has the need to jam to some good rock music.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Hey it's Mike,<br />Wow!! What a great movie this is. This is by far my favorite movie due to the presence of Mike and Sulley. There is not a lot of great movies out there, but this one is one of the very best!! Sulley, Mike, Randall, Roz, and Waternoose are all great characters and 3 of them are really funny! Boo and Celia are my two least favorite characters in the film. The best part of this movie is the Flying on Doors part where Randall gets destroyed.<br />The end is the saddest part of the movie when Sulley and Mike take Boo home.<br /><br />Well this movie is the best as I wish that I can give this much more than 5 stars like a million stars. Please buy.
6305428352|4.0|Without becoming breezy or overly sentimental, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' shows us the dilemma of many teachers.  How does one juggle all of the piles of responsibility one is given, and how does one rise above the fray to achieve greatness?  With many hurdles to overcome, Glenn Holland (in an extraordinary performance by Richard Dreyfuss) comes to Portland's Kennedy High School with the aspiration of employment filler with enough free time to compose his own music.  Naive about the demands for extra-curriculars and student tutoring, Glenn, nevertheless, must reinvent the wheel and learn to accomodate his students by taking risks to win their love for music.  Locking heads with the vice principal (played with perfect starchy officiousness by William Macy), he nearly loses his job and composure.  At home his loving, understanding wife will stand by him, but plausibly loses patience when their own beloved son (who was born deaf) gets the shaft on some quality mentor time.  Feeling his pain, we also are absorbed in the lives of key students (in fine early performances by Terrence Howard and [Forrest] Whitaker to name a couple).  He gets reprieves with the football coach (Jay Thomas) who offers friendship and a spirited rivalry.  With a rising starlet at his school and the soundtrack of their lives evolving to John Lennon, the poignancy of a man who has painted himself into a corner comes to roost. <br /> <br />'Mr. Holland's Opus' is as realistic as it is an emotional dead ringer.  Admittedly, I prejudged this movie on the notion that it would be facile, cloying, or overly sentimental.  Nothing could be further from the truth.
1591841666|1.0|I was extremely disappointed as the book floated over issues with a serendipity tone without \\"meat\\". Smug and not informative for someone with more than 2 years of experience. Truly for the beginners in marketing.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Now thirty years after it was released, 'Pumping Iron,' a breakthrough documentary, has changed much in our culture with ripple effects that are still pumping through today.  Seeming an obscure project, the film put bodybuilding on the map and made it respectable.  The format of the film is used in documentaries and \\"reality tv\\" even today.  The focal point is the Mr. Olympia title, the pinnacle achievement for male bodybuilders, but the drama captures Arnold Schwarzenegger just before he plans retirement.  Add to that a rising rival in Lou Ferringo, and you have yourself a contest.  Interviewing the participants and unveiling their motivations and thoughts gives the whole presentation more meat and development. 'Pumping Iron' made bodybuilding into a mainstream and formidable franchise.  <br /> <br />Featuring grueling training sessions, and the indespensible interviews by key players, the whole spectacle has much more meaning.  Knowing that mental aspects are crucial to success in sports, Schwarzenegger proves that it is no less removed from bodybuilding than from any other sport.  Seeing supporting roles by dedicated players like Mike Katz gives the whole enterprise a greater scope and respectability.  (It is doubtful that the repurcussions of health clubs, and, Arnold's reign at the box office and over a state described as the \\"fifth largest world economy\\" would be possible--to name but a few influencial developments.) <br /> <br />'Pumping Iron' is still a motivation powerhouse, especially seeing all the primitive equipment the contestants used; all of which has significantly improved much since then.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Disappointing. The CD feels to me as if they are reaching out to prog metal fans who want dark lyrics and growling vocals. I have always liked DT for their musicianship and, while usually their lyrics aren't great, I like the topics they tackle. They are a band you can listen to without trying to feel adolescent angst or pubescent rage. I can appreciate bands trying to expand their audience and the exploratory nature of progressive music. However, for me, this album just doesn't work.    Near as I can tell, the CD is the story of someone who reluctantly is seduced into selling their soul to the devil, feels regret, worships the devil, and at the last moment reclaims his soul as his own. It is hard to tell as the lyrics are cryptic and the songs seem out of order. This topic is not nearly as interesting to me as the tale of Scenes from a Memory, and the songs aren't nearly as creative or progressive sounding. Instead, the music sort of flip flops from slow and melodical to choppy and heavy, and the songs seem to have harsh unpolished beginnings and drawn out endings.    The CD isn't awful, and if you read the other reviews you'll see that it appeals to some. It has its moments, but in the long run, this album will just go down as one that is necessary to complete your DT collection but it's not one of their best.
0007152590|5.0|its condition is good but it came late than i expected. because delivery time changed.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Another great release from Queens. Not an easy listen at first...but for those who give it a chance there's some really great tunes here - 3's and 7's, Suture Up Your Future, Turning On the Screw, Misfit Love to name a few.     I'd have to say my only disappointment is with I wanna make it wit chu.  Unlike In My Head on Lullabies which was screaming for a remake... the original make it wit chu is already pretty great...and this new version doesn't really improve much on it.      And the 3's and 7's acoustic version really should have been included as a bonus track too... better than the electric version by far...
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I was wondering when Sarah McLachlan was gonna come out with a Christmas album. I was waiting and waiting for it and now here it is and it is everything that all Sarah fans enjoy about her.  <br />Touching and tender and superb in its vocal and sound arrangements. It evokes a Christmas from some other time. Especially haunting is track # 9: Song for a Winter's Night. It's full of pining and it reads like a poem.  <br />Wrapping it all up is a gift fit for Christmas: Diana Krall. Although she doesn't sing, she plays the piano, and you can tell.  <br />Definitely one for those who love XMAS music and for those who love Sarah. You can't go wrong.
1594489505|5.0|Certain books signify not because of their artistic merit or technical brilliance but because the cumulative force of narrative allows readers to achieve an experience unobtainable elsewhere.  This is the great prize of literature.<br /><br />Khalid Hosseini, author of \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" captivates just as he did in \\"Kite Runner\\" with sheer, plaintive story built upon a sincere desire to the tell the untellable.  Nabokov may have declared reading to be an art form, but it is the inspired author who delivers an obdurate veracity from which the reader is unable to remove his or her eyes.<br /><br />Mr. Hosseini clearly obtains this objective in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  He takes on a literary mine-field, depicting the story of two vulnerable women coping with the harshest circumstances; life in Afghanistan for the past thirty years.  With sensitivity, he draws the dense humanity underlying social and moral chaos without attempting to mitigate disaster with sentiment or fantasy.  This is why he has struck such a chord with readers.<br /><br />We need to learn the Afghan story, in its intimate sense.  After thirty years of bloodshed and worse, who would dare to recount the enormity of Afghani suffering with pithy moral and happy endings?  Only an author  burning to tell the story to an audience ardent with desire to comprehend. We somehow know we need to learn the Afghan story.<br /><br />That is what Mr. Hosseini helps his readers accomplish in a marvelous, selfless way . . .with unalloyed, illuminative story amid circumstances that beggar the imagination.
073934353X|4.0|I'm a fanatic of Fried Green Tomatoes, so I had to have the audio book, read by the author herself, Fannie Flagg. And she does not disappoint. Her southern drawl is cute and she knows how to act the lines (she was involved in the theater before jumping into writing).   <br />Although...for all those who know the movie and the book like the palm of their hand, a word of caution: you'll miss the actresses's voices (in the case of the movie) and many of the delicious details of the book that were left behind in this abridged version (like the catfish joke Idgie and Stump played on unsuspecting visitors and when Idgie first met Ruth and when Ruth went away) and I think it's because reading verbatim from the book would've made it too long, but I still resent that they left so much out.  <br />This audio book is really for the hardcore fans. Anyone else will tire of it. But Fannie Flagg is delightful and it gives this CD that extra something when you know the woman who cooked this story up is telling you the story from her own lips.  <br />Buy this if you fell in love with Ruth and Idgie and Ninny and Evelyn. It'll add to the collection you probably already have revolving around Fried Green Tomatoes.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|What I liked about this film is that in some ways, it was like a documentary.  Nicolas Cage often gives monologues in films, probably because he's so good at them.  In watching this film I got the impression that Nicolas Cage's character was real and what he expressed is actually what he felt.  Nicolas Cage is most often cast as a troubled or conflicted character.  In this film he was a little conflicted over being an international illegal arms dealer.  Jared Leto played his drug addict brother who for a short time worked with him in smuggling arms to different countries. <br /> <br />Like most who work in jobs where what they do is at least a little questionable, he aways had a good come back argument to make himself feel better about what he's doing or rationalize it.  \\"all my weapons have safety switches on them\\", \\"cars kill more people than fire arms\\", etc.

B00005M91K|3.0|I saw BARAKA in theaters, back in the early 1990s.  I was immediately drawn to the eye-popping photography.  The filmmaker spent twelve years gathering footage from over twenty countries, to capture life at its best and worst.  The name of the film, \\"Baraka\\" is translated as \\"blessing\\" in several languages.  Was this film a blessing to me?  No, not really.  It felt more like a ponderous, new age journey, set to mind-numbing orchestral accompaniment.  In all honesty, the film repulsed me in many ways.  The director tried to contrast visions of beauty with visions of the grotesque.  Instead, I was left with phantom images of death, torture and sickness, and that superceded any attempts at beauty.  We see the elements exposed (mountains, etc), and I am sure for anyone seeing this film, more recently, these visions of peaks and valleys are poignant, in the age of global warming and environmental trauma.  What's more, visions of people from very diverse cultures almost seemed more exploitative than honorable.  It almost felt as though they were puppets acting in a very strange (and sprawling) incidental play about mortality.  There are shots of skulls, women who have participated in genital mutiliation and glimpses into very tragic events in humankind.  This felt more manipulative than visionary.  Yes, I am aware I am going to receive a lot of flack because I didn't give this film a perfect five star rating, like 95% of the Amazon writers here, but, I must speak my truth.  And, if you asked, \\"Should I buy BARAKA, and find out what everyone is talking about?\\" I would advise you to pass on this one.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|I had heard about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang prior to its release, and fully intended on seeing it in theatres. However, it was put into limited release, and I missed out on it. It is unfortunate that this is the fate of such a fine film. I'm sure it will be one of those \\"DVD hits\\" like Donnie Darko, Boondock Saints and Pitch Black. The movie features under-rated actor Robert Downey Jr. as a petty burglar who happens, by chance, to land a gig as an actor. He's sent to Los Angeles for more screen tests and training with a detective - played by another under-rated actor, Val Kilmer - for his part in the film. Downey finds himself in the middle of the Hollywood party scene where he runs into Michelle Monaghan, whom he had grown up with in a small Iowan town. Together, the three of them are thrust into a plot featuring many dead bodies appearing in places they would rather not have them, and many dark comedic moments. The beauty of this film is how well writer/director Shane Black (adapted from a novel by Brett Halliday) mixes the conspiratorial murder mystery with off-kilter humor and fanciful cinematography. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, suspense, and humor all as independent movies, but brought together into one coherent piece moved it beyond any one part.
B00005K3OT|3.0|First, let me start this review by saying how much I adore chocolate (the food).  I mean, there is a reason that women love this stuff.  Personally, I would even be so bold as to say I prefer my chocolate dark and bittersweet (I can get more antioxidents from this, too--another incentive).  Now, moving on to the movie.  How would I describe CHOCOLAT if I were to compare it to a bar of the dark stuff?  Well, I can't say it tastes authentic.  My favorite type of chocolate isn't even European, or French, for that matter.  It's Ecuadorian, with a cocoa count of [at least] 75%.  CHOCOLAT wants to be this kind of chocolate.  Instead, it ends being more of a blend of Hershey's milk chocolate (to please the American consumers) with the sensibility of a dash of French dark.  In other words, not really smooth or memorable, but it wants to be!<br /><br />I'll add in just a dash of synopsis, here, to get a sense of the recipe.  For starters, director Lasse Hallstrom (or should I say \\"sous chef\\") paints the picture of a conservative little French town that Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) swoops into, with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol).  This ultimately poses a great challenge to the Comte (Alfred Molina) and most everyone else.  Why?  Because Vianne has set up a Chocolaterie (chocolate shop) during Lent--an observance that the devoutly Catholic villagers strongly uphold.  This is a time when they abstain from indulgences (especially foods like chocolate!).  This also co-stars Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Though, CHOCOLAT delivers in terms of visual beauty and spectacle, and the chocolates look divine, the storyline and most of the rest of this film leave a lot to be desired.  Yes, a lot of you will think I am being harsh.  Yet, while I sat there, watching this film (I won't even lie to you--I saw it twice), I couldn't help but feel that CHOCOLAT stole gimmicks from virtually every film genre focusing on mysticism, magical realism or food and claimed them as their own.  The filmmakers desperately wanted to make the story something for everyone.  We have a swashbuckling pirate (Johnny Depp), who is Irish, nonetheless.  We have the mysterious stranger who sails into a town with her daughter, and no one knows her background.  Is she a heretic?  A witch with a cauldron of chocolatey sacreligious goodness--made to saturate and corrupt the palates of the unsuspecting villagers?  We even have a subplot alluding to a battered wife (Lena Olin).  Good lord!  The gimmicks boggle the mind.  Okay, dear readers.  Thank you for sticking with me on this review.  Those of you who were diligent enough to read it, I have a verdict for you.  Skip this film and watch.....I am thinking LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.  Hey, it even has chocolate in the title, and you'll never look at wedding cake quite the same way again.sperately wanted to make the story something for everyone.

B000FGGE7C|1.0|I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. From the writer and director of Equilibrium, Kurt Wimmer creates an alternative future where an ancient virus from Eastern Europe turns ordinary humans into vampires. An Orwellian government, bent of destroying the vampires, creates a weapon that will destroy them all. Milla Jovovich plays the comic-book inspired heroine who was infected with the virus and held for the humans to conduct expirements on her through various tests. The testing nearly kills her, which kills the child in her womb. She is sent by the vampire faction to capture the weapon and destroy it. So this film pretty much failed at everything. The entire story was told in the opening naration, and the rest of it was a series of vivid battles with a variety of uniform enemies with no faces, and no cause for existence. There isn't any story development, and some elements come from nowhere and go nowhere. There are peripheral enemies that are not introduced or explained, and Milla just decimates them, and there is nary mention of them after; there is a love story that lasts all of two lines; there is not a lot more. The acting is terrible, of course they weren't given much dialog to work with either. It seems as if Wimmer took a bunch of different ideas (each of which are interesting) and threw them together into a vomitorium. Even the graphics were sub-par. Some scenes looked amazing, and would make a good Blu-ray Disc reference piece, but the rest of it looked two generations old. The city was a tiled texture, the vehicles were smooth and polygonal, and the fire, smoke and glass (especially in the last scene) didn't even look rendered. I didn't watch this one with expecting much considering its short life in theaters and the really bad review from critics, but I was still disappointed. If you want to watch something on your new high-def TV, this might make for a good view for friends, but otherwise you probably want to avoid it.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I have not stopped listening to the wounderful soundtrack of the Pirates of the Caribbean 3 motion picture. It is completely and totally amazing. A quick summary of the songs:<br /><br />1: Hoist the Colors: A sad reminder of the first few minutes of the movie.<br /><br />2: Singapore: (One of my personal favorites...) This has a great mix of oriental music and the modern \\"pirate\\" music. It has some slow parts, but the mixture of the two is brilliantly joined together.<br /><br />3: At Wit's End: This is a longer song, with a full orchestra! It is completely beautiful.<br /><br />4: Multiple Jacks: This comes from the part where jack sees himself as a whole crew! Only Capt'n Jack! This scene is wonderfully portrayed in this musical number.<br /><br />5: Up is Down: This is my absoute favorite song from the whole soundtrack. The violins are brilliantly used, and almost can sound like a wind instrument. It comes from the scene where the crew is fooled into tipping the ship over.<br /><br />6: I See Dead People in Boats: As those who have seen the movie, this is from the part where Elizabeth sees her father's ghost/soul being transported to go to Davy Jones' Locker.<br /><br />7: The Brethren Court: It has its ups and downs. It can be very loud and strong, but it can then change to be soft but intreguing.<br /><br />8: Parlay: This song uses modern \\"screaming\\" guitars. It is a brilliant mix that only Hans Zimmer could create. It plays the Pirates theme, and is completely awesome.<br /><br />9: Calypso: This is one of the slower songs to start out, but it sure makes a come-back. This is an over all slower song, but it is definately very well put together.<br /><br />10: What Shall We Die For: This is again slow to start out, but it gets much faster towards the middle. It uses a varitey of instruments; mostly violins. It repeats some of the \\"Hoist the Colors.\\" A choir starts to sing it in the background. Not too much choir to destroy the song.<br /><br />11: I Don't Think Now Is the Best Time: Again for those who have seen Pirates 3, this line is what Elizabeth said to Will when he proposed to her. It is a ten minute long song, and you'll have to buy the whole album on to get it on iTunes, but it is completely and totally worth it!<br /><br />12: One Day: Being a strong song, it describes almost the whole movie in a 4 minute long song. It has its slower parts, and its faster parts, but it is completely intreguing.<br /><br />13: Drink Up Me Harties Yo Ho: This is the last line of both the first and last movies.  It pulls the whole sound track together. It is over all a very strong song. I'd buy the this album, just for this song... but get the whole album!!!!!<br /><br />So, over all this *should* prusuade you to spend the money on this CD. I have recomended it to all of my friends.br /> <br />11: I Don't Think Now Is the Best Time: Again for those who have seen Pirates 3, this line is what Elizabeth said to Will when he proposed to her.

B000O5B4C4|3.0|Basic Instinct is a beautifully created film with a compelling story with enough twists and psychological bends to captivate you. Yet the sotry is bogged down with gratuitous sexual encounters that do not propel anywhere. The acting of Michael Douglas in this film was distractingly bad. He was pissed off throughout the film for no apparent reason, even in the love scenes. Sharon Stone player her character very well, a cold, manipulating and very attractive woman. Of course there isn't very many scenes without her exposing herself. The movie seems to rest on her nudity, not her acting. Overall, the movie seems to elevate the gratuitous sex over the actual plot. So while I was being drawn into the story, the movie also pulled me away from it leaving me desiring more form the story.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Hmm, Only six songs on a Bowie album.  Is this a rip-off?  That was my first reaction when it was released. Also when i heard the album for the first time it seemed my fears were justified.  I could not understand the title song and felt it was a ten minute disjointed waste of time.  I was also very shocked at the photos provided for the album.  David Bowie was always thin but these photos showed him deathly thin.  I realize he was at the height of drug addiction during this time and sometimes artists in this state can produce their best work.   After listening to all of Bowie's albums from the Seventies, this is the one album I cherish the most. And I think it is because it is Bowie's most personal album, not the musings of some alter-ego but it is David Bowie speaking from the heart.  It may be another persona in the form of &#34;The Thin White Duke&#34; but it seems more stripped down with no glam, no funk and no throwbacks to an earlier time. There is a unique quality to STS that separates it from nearly all of his other albums in the 70's. No folksy stuff like DORY, no commentary on a space-age or apocalyptic future (Ziggy, Aladdin, Dogs), no covers (Pin-Ups) , no weird soul discoveries (Young Americans) and no infusion of industrial Berlin rock (L.,H.,L.)  This is the only album by David Bowie that describes a man who calls himself David Bowie.  Superbly aided by long time associate Carlos Alomar on Guitar, along with Earl Slick.  Also included was Roy Bittan on Piano (of E Street Band fame),  Dennis Davis on Drums and George Murray on Bass  1. STATION TO STATION (10.08)  Certainly in the 1970s this was Bowie's longest song.  Basically it comprises four differnet sections; TRAIN RIDE, INSTRUMENTAL INTRO, RETURN OF THE THIN WHITE DUKE and IT'S TOO LATE. I could not understand it all at first but now i just sit back and enjoy the wonderful ten minute opus in all its glory. One of my favourite Bowie songs of all time (and this album includes four!).  2. GOLDEN YEARS (4.03) One of DB's most popular songs and deservedly so. Very catchy and done in a great doo-wap style.  Sounds nothing like Jean Genie or Diamond Dogs and it shows another side of Bowie's gift for songwriting. Another favourite.  3. WORD ON A WING (6.00) Getting into a more sentimental, religious mood.  It is a nice change of pace and shows he can be vulnerable and very willing to show that he is not too strong.  Not many superstars did this in those days.  4. TVC15 (5.29)  The one song on the album that could be a throwback to earlier times and I do not mean that in a negative sense.  This is a great Bowie song, hard to make out what he is saying but it is just good old guitar/piano rock song with a very catchy chorus. Love it!  5. STAY (6.08) The opening guitar riff draws you in immediately.  Oblique lyrics but there is a sense of broodng uncertainty throughout the whole song and again it shows the singer's sensitive side.  6. WILD IS THE WIND (5.58)  A cover version of a song written in 1956 by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington.  I have not heard the original or any other version of this song but this is arguably the most satisfying song on the whole album.  It is hard for me to say why as sometimes I listen to this song and  feel Bowie's vocals are a little wobbly.  Other times i listen to it and I feel he nails it completely.  It is a beautiful song and the lyrics are sublime.  I can understand why Bowie wanted to sing it as his vocal is so emotional.  You get the sense that he is so completely in love and laying himself bare that it can make you teary-eyed.  From an artist who was a glam rock superstar, it is a very sobering song coming straight from the heart.  Sorry for the hyperbole but I have to admit personally it is the standout track on the album.  The folowing two tracks are bonuses on the cd and not indcluded on the original LP.  They are live versions of WORD ON A WING (6.10) and STAY (7.24). They are interesting, especially the long guitar solo at the end of STAY but both tracks are not really essential.
B000IOM0WO|5.0|I finally watched all of U2: Rattle and Hum this weekend (on Blu-ray Disc) at home. It is incredible really. I have to buy this now. It follows U2 as they're touring for, and recording, the Rattle and Hum album, which is a tribute to Americana music. It's spectacular. They play Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For with a Harlem church choir, perform with BB King, and record tracks at Sun Studios. There are some songs in the movie that really pulls at your heart, one specifically is Sunday Bloody Sunday they're performing the same day (a Sunday nonetheless) as the Remembrance Day Bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Bono has the ability to convey through voice the emotion in his heart, and it's difficult to listen to him sing without becoming emotionally involved int he song. There is some comment on picture quality not being as expected on HD DVD and BD, but this movie was not shot in HD, so it's to be expected. The shots shot on Hi-8 look quite grainy indeed, and the shots in film look crisp, but still like film. I think the effect is actually quite pleasing and fits the feel of the movie.
B000P0J024|4.0|This year has been really a great time seeing and listening to classic rock groups reunite on tour and in the record stores. With reunions of Sting & The Police, to Phil Collins returning to Genesis after a decade long absence, the classic styles are being reintroducted to a whole new generation that has missed out on great music. One group that has shown that promise in the albums though is The Traveling Wilburys. Although it is unfortunate that the group hasn't made any new music after the passings of legends Roy Orbison who sang You've Got It, and the talented George Harrison from his solo fame and of course with The Beatles. The survivng members have also carried those flames on though too with legends Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne from ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) and Tom Petty seperately, but the music had been missing for so long, until now!!!<br /><br />The Traveling Wilburys combines the groups only 2 records released from 1988 and 1991, and the return of a long lost era after a decade long search for these gems that have been out of print in the record stores. The collection contain 2 great albums, their 1988 selftitled album ans their surprisingly awkward second album titled Volume 3, as well as a DVD which captures this groups longtime era as well as some of their best videos. The albums have also been restored beautifully, and bring a classic instinction that sounds better than ever. The collection includes great forgotten classics like their Top 10 classic Handle With Care, the upbeat and down to Earth End Of The Line, and Wilbury Twist. The collection also includes never before released tracks including the somber Maxine, and classic surf music influenced Runaway.<br /><br />While so many people these days would rather be interested in those who are trying to sing from American Idol, or popular acts like Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce', or for those who just do it because they want to sell themselves out on a sex tape like sleezy Paris Hilton, The Traveling Wilburys is a long-forgotten era that feels just better than it has been before. It is so good to hear these great songs again. I really recommend this great compilation, that will be handled with care.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+forgotten era that feels just better than it has been before.

B000KC86F4|3.0|This is supposedly the last in the X-Men series before they go on to more focused films like Magneto and Wolverine. The Last Stand is appreciably different than the two previous installments due primarily to it featuring a different director, and secondarily because they continue to introduce more characters from the series. This does make it markedly more difficult to maintain focus. The original X-Men comic books took years to move through the same story arc. This was evident while viewing this film. The story seemed fractured because there were so many sub-plots. It was almost like there was a bunch of different movies cut and put together. The forays into the characters we forgot we were supposed to care about are forgettable, and could easily have been cut. However, it was an entertaining film throughout with great acting and spectacular effects. The battle scenes were bigger than the last two films because the mutants moved from the underground to do battle out in the open. I really don't know what else to say. Now that I'm actually writing this down, the movie wasn't all that great. It was a lot of fun to watch, but it could have been much better. The effects tried to compensate for the weaknesses elsewhere, but even the giant finale battle was sort of aloof. We were sort of detached from what was actually going on, and I felt it was more of an atmosphere of battle than actual action. I think as a package of three films - the X-Men trilogy - everything would be really cool. I enjoyed it, I really liked it, but it is far from being the pinnacle of movie making - even at comic book standards.
0765316978|5.0|The Last Colony purports to be the final chapter in the 'Old Man's War' Trilogy (would the Sagan Trilogy be a better name?), and it certainly lives up to the task. As always, I found this Scalzi venture a fun read, as well as action packed. This time, John Perry and Jane Sagan are husband and wife, living with an adopted daughter and her bodyguards on a colony, peacefully living their lives, when they get asked to be the leaders of a new colony. That gets them thrown into a whole new world of trouble (literally!).<br /><br />The characterizations are pretty spot on, and I am sad to see the main characters go. I am not sure we got inside Perry's head as much as we did during OMW, or Jane's during TGB, but nonetheless we get a good sense of who these people are.<br /><br />The book is a quick read at 300 pages, and frankly, it could have been twice as long, or even split into two books. I say that because sometimes it feels rushed. Months pass by in a couple of pages, and I would have liked to see life on the new colony unfold in a little more detailed manner. There's enough action to satisfy the Saganverse fan, but I felt the strength of the book was in the parts that focused on the life on the colony and the interaction between the other colonists besides the Perry household.<br /><br />Brevity besides, The Last Colony is a great read, and has some real plot twists I couldn't figure out, which is rare for most Sci-Fi books I come across. There was one character that reminded me of a certain starship captain (or maybe a close parody of him), and I'm not sure that was intentional or not, it could just be my brain playing into that archetype.<br /><br />All in all, if you've read the first two parts of the trilogy, The Last Colony is well worth it. And if you haven't, the Old Man's War mass market paperback is out now, and so is the one for The Ghost Brigades. Money well spent for any Sci-Fi fan.
B000002J09|5.0|This is the album that got me in to Zepp, and the first one I ever bought.  This ground breaking recording was Zepplin's #1 album, and if this would have been the only album they would released, I think they still would have had just as much of and impact on the world as they do now.      1. Black Dog- Strange name but awesome song, and one of the best riffs ever!!! 5/5      2. Rock And Roll- This song is exactilly what the name is; Rock And Roll. It's Zeppelin at their best, Jimmy Page's solo is simply amazing and fits with the song. Perfect riff, Perferct title, and a perfect solo make this song, well...perfect! 5/5    3. Battle of Evermore- It's always nice to slow it up a bit with some thing accustic, and \\"Battle Of Evermore\\" is that something accustic. This song really shows off Robert Plant's vocal range and fetures matiline. Bring it Back! 5/5    4. Stairway to Heaven- This is a song that needs no introduction, it's such a totamic peace of music, mainly because it is a constant climing song. It has some of the stragest lyrics of all time, and is known for having a backwards massage. Message or not it is still an amazing song, and Jimmy gives one of the best solos ever. 5/5    5. Misty Mountain Hop- This is the first Zeppelin song I ever heard and it still rocks. Greatest riff of all time? Maybe, but one thing that I know that everyone thinks at some point is, \\"What the hell is a Misty Mountain Hop?\\" The world may never know. 5/5     6. Four Sticks- This is a highly underratted song. It has tons of cool elements about it, Electric and accustic guitar parts, cool vocals, and great keyboard. Classic hard rock song. 5/5    7. Going To California- Another accustic song, nice and mellow. 4/5    8. When the Leeve Breaks- Best drum beat ever, provided by the one and only Bonzo. Heavy riff with some harmonica, great way to finish off a great album. 4.5/5     Led Zeppelin made their mark on the world with this one, legend- Chuck
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|O.K., I never really thought I'd like these type of movies/genres but let me tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! I loved it and enjoy watching even more after the first few times. I love Kiera's quirky expressions; I couldn't imagine another actress playing \\"Elizabeth\\" so well. The actors are so believable, I wish I had a father like Mr. Bennett and Mr. Darsy is so handsome! This movie has it all, great characters, setting, plot (only thing missing is special effects which it doesn't even need).<br /><br />This movie has brought out my inner romantic self which is often overlooked in my busy schedule and reality of life these days. Imagine all they ever thought of back then was finding their true love and social status/wealth. Not much has changed since, has it?
B00006RU5B|5.0|It's amazing how two smilar bands breaking up can make such a monumental callaboration of artists. R.A.T.M. and Soundgarden had both broken up year before this release, Chris Cornell's unsucessful solo project and deprature from his grunge roots didn't earn him any cred with manstream rock artists. Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk were basiclly atalis after the split of \\"Rage\\" and it seems like it was fate for these people to collied in there musical endevores. But it still blows my mind that the guys from \\"Rage\\" joined forces with Chris Cornell? Sound pretty crazy if you put youself in the 90's When both bands were together and striving in their sucess. But this album lived up to every little bit of hype it received.      1. Cochise- Classic heavy rocker with one of the most legendary riffs in the past decade. Sounds simillar to a song of the heavy metal band  \\"Pantera\\" but this song surpases any triumphs of  \\"Pantera\\"'s song. Little known fact; Cochise is the name of an Indian cheif.Cool helicopter sound at the begining to. 5/5       2. Show Me How To Live- Another great riff by Tom on this on, and Chris's soul shattering vocals don't hurt either. 5/5    3. Gasoline- Rock on!! I was surprised at how heavy this album was a hard rocker, the riff might not be as good some earlier tracks, but it still keeps it going. 5/5    4. What You Are- Grunge, Grunge, Grunge is what this song is. My second favorite song on here. Personal lyrics and a heavy destortion riff make this a classic. Tom also dose an excellent job on this, providing a cool melodic solo that fits the song well. 5/5    5. Like A Stone- Finally the big hit singal, the first Audioslave song I ever heard, and one of the best. Chris's vocal could peal the paint of walls on this one. 5/5     6. Set it off- Set this f#@%er off!!!! This one of the best songs i've heard in years. Tom plays the riff backwards in the begining, more heavy lyrics and a pounding bass line. 5/5    7. Shadow Of The Sun- Not myfav but it's good. more of a ballad thing goin' on. it gets better near the end. 4.5/5    8. I Am The Highway- My favorite song on the album, and definately the best lyrics. Chris comperes two things that can only work if there together, a he's getting the raw end of the deal. Tom's accustic solo is a nice change of pace. 5/5    9. Exploder- Cool song nice to speed things up after  \\"I Am The Highway\\". Very cold and dark lyrics on this one. 4/5    10. Hypnotized- Little more techno sound. I can't put my finger on it but the bass riff seems oddly familiar. 4.5/5    11. Bring Em Back Alive- Heaviest song on the album, bottom line. With a soul draining solo provided by Soul Power. Awsome!! 5/5    12. Light My Way- It seems like this riff gets a bit repeitive after a while. 4/5    13. Getaway Car- This song is a little repeitive to but the talking accustic guitar is what makes this interesting. 4/5    14. The Last Remaining Light- Not the best way to end the album, it sounds almost exactily like \\"Like A Stone\\" and really goes no where. 3.5/5    If this had of stopped at track 11 it would be perfect. all and all great album- Chuck
B000N3T0DW|4.0|I was set on avoiding this one. I admired Almodovar's past few movies but found them fairly dreary to sit through, and this sounded like more of the same, and the \\"celebration of mothers\\" as I had heard this one was--blech! But a friend of mine wanted to see it on Christmas Day, so whatever, I thought I could sit through it. And surprise, not only did I love it, it went straight to the top of my own personal Best of 2006 list.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the story, because it is so mundane and yet complicated at the same time. Penelope Cruz plays Raimunda, who has two daughters, one of whom is Paula, and a husband. At the beginning, she goes to see one of her aunts, the sister of her deceased mother. The girls don't want to see her, and certainly don't want to be close, and in these first few scenes there is a lot of comedy about the ritual of kissing both sides of the face; how uncomfortable it makes people who don't want to do it, and how ridiculous the whole thing is in the first place.<br /><br />Now I have to decide whether I want to reveal crucial plot points, but you know what, I don't. I think it's a lot better for you to see it and let it unfold on your own.<br /><br />Here are some observations, though. It's very well-written. There is a subplot involving Raimunda's daughter Paula that sets a lot of the action in motion, and later in the movie it is paralleled by a similar scenario that occurred in the past. One of them reflects and builds off the other. And there are a lot of parallels or contrasts like that in the script, and they all reflect and resonate with each other in a way that is very smart and literary.<br /><br />It's also sweet and sentimental without being cloying. One really likes the Raimunda character from the start, even when she is imposing on friends or being a little selfish. In fact, some of the most memorable little scenes involve her asking neighbors to give them the groceries out of their refrigerators, and how willing they are to do exactly that. There's a nice, warm and moving vibe to the whole thing that only grows more affecting and emotional as the film wears on.<br /><br />Cruz is a shot in such a way that is a little ludicrously glamorous [especially when she's working in a laundry or in the kitchen of a restaurant], but you forgive the movie for it because she is SO gorgeous. EVERYONE I know who has seen this movie says \\"Isn't Penelope Cruz gorgeous?\\" She is also complex and charming and delivers a wonderful performance--kind of a relief after seeing her poorly used in such things as Blow and Sahara.<br /><br />There is also a variety of characters and their worries, each of which is portrayed in a sympathetic way that gives you that good, \\"troubles are part of what life is all about\\" feeling. The main action of the movie concerns a meeting that comes close to happening on several occasions, and a lot of the pleasant tension is waiting for that meeting to happen. I also like that when it finally does, and one of the characters freaks out and runs away, she soon realizes what she wants and turns back, instead of making the film waste our time while she goes home and thinks about it and calls her friends and writes in her journal or whatever a more Americanized movie might have her do.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say. This, for me, was one of those movies where I was in love with it by 30 minutes in and it only kept getting better. It encompasses wonderful people and behavior and reprehensible people and behavior, but comes off with a warm and accepting vibe. I don't know, I keep finding myself stopping myself before using hideous professional-movie-critic language such as \\"humanistic vision,\\" or whatnot, but this was something I was expecting to admire but be emotionally indifferent to, and I came out thinking it was one of the best things I had seen all year. If you like a movie that'll make you walk out happy, have a good and patient feeling about life, and show you a gorgeous woman [who sings a magical song, btw] you really should make an effort to get out to this.d show you a gorgeous woman [who sings a magical song, btw] you really should make an effort to get out to this.
1594489505|5.0|This book was just wonderful.  I read the entire book in one weekend.  I think it was even better than Kite Runner.  His storytelling skills just bring you right in to the story and allows you to feel and see every detail.  I can't wait for his next book.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I knew that I could find it here at Amazon. Will buy here again. Quality has been excellent on everything that I bought.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was transfixed from the moment the film began.  Not only is the filmography terrific, but every detail is in place.  Renee Zellweger is fantastic, moving the viewer right into her life.  The animations are so well done they just seem to become a necessary part of the whole film.  I promised myself I would go to the Lake District in the UK after seeing this film.  There are parts where you just hold your breath and gasp a the serene beauty.  This is an interesting film, I'm not sure I would call it a chick flick, yet I'm not too sure many men will apprecaite the fantasy that is involved.  However, the women will recognize the struggle for talented ladies to get recognition, no matter what the era.  Love this movie.  Can't wait to own it.
B000093BDX|5.0|If you're not one that already owns every Beach Boy record, this is one that you'll want to pick up.  With 30 tracks it's a great survey of the Beach Boys from way back then up until some of there more recent stuff.  If you're not familiar with the Beach Boys, you'll probably be amazed at the number of tracks on this CD that you've heard before and are familiar with, but didn't quite make the connection that all that good stuff came from the Beach Boys.
1594489505|3.0|I've been awaiting this book for some time; a friend sent it to me. I found the writing particularly entrancing and the story a total let-down. I love The Kite Runner. Regardless of the hype - and I do admire the author - this book - for me - has nothing to offer. I figure if I read one-third of a book and it doesn't entrance me in some way, there is no point in my continuing.<br /><br />Very disappointed....
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna seems to be steering her career on the success of some of the most catchy songs we've had the past couple years.  \\"Pon de Replay\\" started it all off and was such a great song.  Then \\"SOS\\" came out and proved she had the ability to transend One Hit Wonder status.  <br />  <br />Now, with \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" she's proved she's a force to be reckoned with!  The opening hit \\"Umbrella\\" again proves her team knows how to craft a \\"Can't Get You Oughta My Head\\" tune ... b/c I'll tell ya, I've been singing Umbrella for the past month now!  But it doesn't stop there.  The 1st track leads to another great club banger \\"Push up on me\\" ... which leads into (possibly the best track?) \\"Don't Stop the Music\\", which takes a riff on a Michael Jackson song (can't quite place it?).  <br />  <br />At this point you start to expect the rest of the songs to be \\"filler\\" ... but you'd be wrong.  There's \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" a funky little ditty which sees Rihanna going a little ape sh**!  That track leads right into ANOTHER potential hit \\"Shut up and Drive\\", which samples \\"Blue Monday\\" by Orgy.  Just like Kylie Minogue did on her undeniable hit ... \\"Can't get you Oughta my Head\\" ... coincidence???  <br />  <br />After she gets thru some of the booty shakin', she does take a turn to ballads, which I'll be honest ... aren't the reason I love Rihanna.  Don't get me wrong \\"Hate that I Love you\\", \\"Rehab\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" are all good songs.  But they're not her strong point.  And I think she knows that or she wouldn't have so many other strong upbeat tracks on her album.  After the down tempo songs there's \\"Lemme Get That\\", which sees Rihanna going into gold digger territory.  Just try not bouncing to the marching band backing music!  <br />  <br />Ok, I'm done raining praise on this Bad Girl.  Any more and I'm gonna need my own Umbrella.  Just go by the CD!  I dare you to tell me you don't like it???
B000MV9026|5.0|Sweet story, delightful dancing, inCREDible underwater action & multi-talented cast.  The ONLY drawback, to me, was that the voice cast wasn't introduced or \\"shared\\"....  Must be a selling point for an \\"Anniversary Release\\"....  :>D <br />       I knew Nic & Hugh sang but was VERY impressed with Brittany's songs -  <br /> <br />Two flippers WAAAAAY up!
B000002UCN|4.0|I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).<br />This CD is hard to judge. Amazon is charging $12 for the CD. There are $7 worth of good songs on here, but 4 of them are songs George wrote while with the Beatles. So if you are a Beatles fan, you are buying music you already own (songs: Something, Here Comes the Sun, Taxman and While My Guitar Gently Weeps). The three great solo songs on this CD are My Sweet Lord, Give Me Love and What Is Life. To get his \\"Dark Horse\\" hits 'Got My Mind Set On You', 'When We Was Fab' and 'All Those Years Ago', you have to buy a different CD. Unfortunately, there are no Beatles songs or George Harrison songs available on iTunes to date. If you can, hold off and wait for iTunes to make the solo songs available or wait for a Greatest Hits CD that includes all six solo songs on it. George Harrison - RIP.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Darium<br />June 2007
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I'm not going to do a play by play of the album because reviews in general are just opinions so that would be a waste of your time.  I will say that this album is very cocky, indulgent, dark, and delicious.<br /><br />You can go to their website and hear the whole album.  If you like it, buy it.  Simple as that.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|T. Anderson give the most great and complete review. <br />I wasn't sure that I would like the movie but felt it was worth buying. <br />To tell the truth I have never seen a dog like Jack. <br />The Mystery of the Lake House seems to revolve around love. <br />Alex's fathers love for his wife and the house and his son. <br />I loved the fast flag flip. <br />Kate being at Alex's death to save him later. <br />The Lake House finally brought them together.  Time is no obstacle to love. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ---------- most excellent.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam - Pearl Jam <br /> <br /> <br />This is the best album from Ed and Co. in almost a decade.  Being one of the last bands standing from the so-called \\"Grunge\\" era, they have transcended their original label and have truly become a \\"rock\\" band.  In this self-titled album, Vedder holds nothing back as he takes on subjects that have resonated throughout Pearl Jam's 15+ year career.  While there may be threads between the subjects of the songs, the edge to this record is what makes it a great piece of work.  From taking on the Administration in Washington in the first Single \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" to the self-affirming \\"Life Wasted,\\" the band is top notch in both sound and message.   <br /> <br />Some of the best material on this album pays homage to the bands biggest influences.  Thanking Pete Townsend for a borrowed lyric in the song \\"Gone,\\" Vedder crafts a Springsteen-esque journey of a person who leaves town in an effort to get a fresh start on life.   Songs like \\"Unemployable\\" tap the \\"man of the people\\" feel of both Springsteen and Neil Young.   <br /> <br />One of the best songs was actually penned almost entirely by guitarist Mike McCready.  Brought to the table all but complete, this song travels down the path of self-realization and of healing.  It is very layered musically, and it is simply beautiful.  There is a lot of straight rock on this album too.  \\"Comatose\\" and \\"Severed Hand\\" are both loud and edgy.  \\"Marker in the Sand\\" is moderately paced, but is just another stunning example of the quality found on this record. <br /> <br />There really aren't many weak points on this album.  All of the songs have played well to the audiences during the 2006 tour to support the release of this record.  If you like this, go to their website, you can download any of the shows from this past year's tour.  Grand Rapids Michigan at Van Andel Arena and the shows at the United Center in Chicago are especially good.   <br /> <br />epc <br />
1592402690|4.0|Geoff Emerick was always interested in music from an early age, but the defining moment of his life happens when he finds a huge box of classical lps in his gradmum's basement. The young boy listens to them over and over, making some sort of spiritual connection with every note being played. During his school years he becomes more and more involved in the sonics of music and begins to think of a career in the field. By luck and happenstance and a good deal of patience and determination, he is able to land a job at Abbey Road in 1962 at the age of 15! It's not long after that he witnesses the first recordings by a promising new band called The Beatles. He would work with them on and off in a background role until he became their full-time engineer at the beginning of the Revolver sessions after the previous engineer gets a promotion. Here, There, and Everywhere is an account of all the times he worked with the Beatles with a smattering of his biography thrown in along with his work post-Beatles.     I have to say that I've read almost every Beatles book out there, so when I encounter a new book about them, I'm pretty underexcited, because I don't expect to hear anything new. But I was happily surprised with Emerick's book, mainly because it's style is more of a personal memoir than a dry biography. Emerick gives his opinions on the Beatles and their work instead of trying to turn the book into a catalog of facts. This gives very different perspectives of the individual Beatles than we are used to. For instance, George Harrison is portrayed as a very bad guitarist from the get go that struggled to come up with anything approaching a good guitar solo! It's not until the Abbey Road sessions that Emerick has anything good to say about him. Up until then, George comes across as a very suspicious, sarcastic, and grumpy man. Ringo comes across even worse. In the whole time he worked with Emerick, he hardly even said 3 words to him and had some sort of emotional wall up allthe time. In truth, Emerick potrays him as sort of a lucky schmuck that had to be coached on playing the drums a lot by the other Beatles! While Lennon is accepted as a genius, he comes off as a schizophrenic bipolar personality that was extremely kind and gentle when he was in a good mood, but was cutting, mean, and vicious when he was in a bad one. Paul comes off the best, and there's no doubt why, as Emerick and him became close friends during the Beatles years and worked together many times after the breakup. Even George Martin suffers from a big head in this book, wanting to always have the spotlight on himself, and to be seen as the only reason the Beatles became as popular and important as they were. The less the engineers and other technical staff said, the more Martin liked it.     I thought the bias towards Paul was a little unfair and stemmed from the fact that the other boys didn't want to be friends with Emerick. Especially with everything we know about George and Ringo, you can sense that Emerick resented them because neither of the two thought the guy was important enough to talk to. If they were truly the horrible and socially maladjusted people Emerick made them out to be the two guys would have never had a friend.  The two probably just saw him as an employee and not as a potential social connection. One of the more interesting concepts that Emerick puts forth is that Abbey Road Studios was actually a factor in the breakup of the Beatles. In fact, anytime he brings up Abbey Road, his descriptions are filled with invective and hate. He thinks that its dreary environment contributed to the overall bad vibe that innundated the later Beatles sessions. But to me, the real culprit was that the Beatles just became full of themselves and became so self-important that none of them could ever see themselves as wrong when it came to not just musical decisions, but also to business decisions. Yoko's arrival and Lennon's hard drug taking didn't help things either.     While biased and opinionated, Here, There, and Everywhere is nicely written, engaging, sometimes enlightening, and is a great addition to any Beatles fan's library.
B000063KG6|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />\\"Stonedhenge\\" is one of the rock and roll records that will never have a definitive rating.  Why?  Glad you asked.  The esoteric material and the way the order of the songs were not decided on continuity it sounds as if this was a record of unreleased material and not an actual studio recording.  To the existing fan this actually put a bit of mystique to the music and after a few listenings they saw beauty in the disjointed musical styles.  For those new to the band they didn't have the patience to make this their first purchase and rightly so.<br /><br />It would be hard to fathom the new comer following along as the drums play \\"Three Blind Mice\\" and then get hit with the highly spirited \\"No Title.\\"  If you have played \\"A Space In Time\\" or \\"Sssh\\" until the clicks and pops are part of the musical fabric you can fully appreciate what the group went through to be creative and chancy at the same time.<br /><br />Owners of at least one Ten Years After album in their collection with an hour to digest the many roads you'll travel, don't let this pass you by.<br /><br />\\"Woman Trouble\\", \\"Here Me Calling\\", \\"No Title\\" will satisfy your urge for the Alvin Lee style of blues and \\"Speed Kills\\" has the energy as a rock and roll tune to keep you coming back for more.  With the inclusion of bonus material this will look nice along with \\"Cricklewood Green.\\"<br /><br />4 stars for the TYA fan and 3 if you are coming aboard today!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br /><br />Craig Fenton<br /><br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
B00006RAKP|5.0|I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).  Elton John is good. This CD is even better. I was disappointed to learn that he didn't write a lick of his own lyrics (Bernie Taupin did). Elton John just wrote the music. And I guess we need to hear great music before we'll listen to the lyrics of a song.  Amazon is currently selling the CD for $15. The good news is that there is $20 worth of great music on it. This CD is worth ever dollar and them some. The essential Elton John songs are: Disc 1 - Tracks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15 & 16 (and I guess Candle In The Wind). Disc 2 - Tracks 1,3,4,5 & 6.  Hope this helps.  Darium June 2007

B00005MP58|5.0|If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, this is the authoritative version!  Everyone's in top form here: the dreamy Mr. Darcy, the odious Mr. Collins, the sparkling Elizabeth Bennett, and the irrepressible Mrs. Bennett.  Even though it's five hours long, time will just breeze by when watching this lively and faithful production.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|I was hesitatant to watch this film.  I had read Foer's other novel, \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" and I just didn't really like it.  I guess Foer's style is a little neurotic for me to read.<br /><br />So, when I found out that there was a film adaptation of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\", I thought 'why not'.<br /><br />It was ok.  It started off great and hilarious.  I loved the part where Johnathan (Wood), in Ukraine, had told his interpreter and the driver/grandfather that he was a vegetarian.  The terp and the grandfather were like, 'huh'.<br /><br />Just before his grandmother passed away, he was given a photo that his deceased grandfather wanted to give to him.  It was given to him because Foer is a collector.  Foer collects things in little plastic bags and tacks them on a wall.<br /><br />This particular photo intrigued him because there is a mention of Augustine.  When inquired, the grandmother refused to answer.  So, after her death, Foer goes to Ukraine to search his grandfather's past.<br /><br />Like I said, it started off interesting and funny.  But, about halfway, it kind of dragged on.  It did somewhat redeemed itself when revealing Foer's grandfather's past.<br /><br />I just thought it was ok.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I really love this album. For some inexplicable reason, thus far, I hear all kinds of rad influences, like the Vandals, that I have never heard with QOTSA before. I get the feeling Homme wanted to make a pop album, but I don't write that in a derogatory way, but how Daydream Nation is a pop album. Every song has a pretty quick pace/beat, and there is more in your face/balls out rock than on previous efforts where before Homme played more with syncopating guitar lines. \\"Sick Sick Sick\\" is great. QOTSA is a metal band, like The Blue Oyster Cult is. Anyone who doesn't get that, doesn't get QOTSA, or rock 'n' roll for that matter.
B00000IBDY|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />It is almost 40 years ago (1968) when \\"Tomorrow\\" recorded a terrific psychedelic album.  A track from it \\"My White Bicycle\\" has become a solid representation of the band and can often be heard on 60's rock programs even today.  This band was not a one trick pony.<br /><br />Guitarist Steve Howe would go on to brilliant things with the progressive rock band \\"Yes\\" but in another time and a different universe Howe would offer us a great bit of six string psychedelia.  If you listen intently to his playing you'll find him perfect in this role.  The sound of the guitar, the effects, and the notes he would choose help solidify the tracks they would turn into vinyl.<br /><br />Along with Mr. Howe the band had a strong singer in Keith West (Not to be confused with the American Keith West that performed in the 1970's with the New York bands \\"The Brats\\" and \\"The Secrets\\").  West sings the lyrics with conviction and the guitar and vocal interplay is totally together.<br /><br />\\"Real Life Permanent Dream\\" and \\"Now Your Time Has Come\\" are two additional tracks that your ears will enjoy the first time you give the CD a spin.  The cover of the Beatles \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is one of the finest Fab Four remakes.  \\"Revolution\\" a tune that fans of the band often talk about is not the Beatles track but a fine composition of its own.<br /><br />What has to solidify this as a must own are the bonus tracks.  More delectable sixties sounds from drummer Twink (Played with the Pretty Things) and the bass-player Junior when they were the \\"Aquarian Age\\" and vocalist Keith West on his own.<br /><br />While we always hear about 1967 being the rock and roll year, 1968 was awfully special too!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br /><br />Craig Fenton<br /><br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"      <br /> <br />

1596060832|5.0|I've loved The Last Unicorn for years, and love so much of Peter S. Beagle's writing. So it was really facinating to read the first version of his novel. <br /> <br />A few pieces are very much the same as the book I've come to know and love, but the vast majority of this first draft is entirely different. Schmendric and Mommy Fortuna's circus are gone, as is any mention of Haggard and the Red Bull. In their place are different characters, and it's obvious that Beagle was taking the story in an entirely different direction....  <br /> <br />If you haven't read the Last Unicorn, you should. Go read that instead of this version. But if you've already read that, and want to see where it started, I highly reccomend this book.
0316067598|5.0|A great book by a great American Hero. A must-read! I can't wait for the movie.
0385522401|4.0|While I enjoyed \\"Chisel Beach\\",  and would agree that the hotel scenes were finely crafted,  I did find myself losing interest in them at times.  What resonated with me in this slim novel was the beautiful love affair, and its Romeo and Juliet kind of ending.  That last may be a stretch, but from the brief stirring of sensuality in Florence (remember that strand of pubic hair), and later suggestions, it is not hard to believe that had things gone a little differently, the lovers would have overcome her initial frigidity.  <br />    <br /> I think interpreting this story as primarily a social novel would be a mistake. The class differences add interest, but are not really that important  as Edward had no great economic or social aspirations other than to rise above a  financially constrained childhood.  Would things have been different in the 90's?  Given Florence's repressed sexual abuse, it is likely she would still be a virgin. Premature ejaculation still occurs. Relationships still founder for lack of good communication.
0060723513|2.0|I read this book in my 20s, and then again 2 years ago.  It is charming and weaves in many of the indigenous traditions that we'd all like to incorporate into our lives.  However, this book is a work of fiction and has very little to do with authentic aboriginal culture.  This taints the credibility of the author and her book.  So, let it inspire you to seek out authentic indigenous lifeways. But be sure to take this book for what it is: fiction.
0679735909|4.0|This is British literature at its height.  A love story within a love story, Possession takes the reader through the characters' intimate obsessions with themselves, each other, and their work.  And like most British novels, much of the action of this book takes place within rather than externally.  What makes Possession a \\"Classic\\" (as the Booker Prize attests to) is the way the author blends the voices of the main characters through direct narrative, diaries, epic poems, and various other writings woven throughout the book.  The mixture of letters between characters, love poems spanning centuries, journal entries, travel logs, and mythical allusions on which the story is built is more impressive here than in any other work I've read.  For the literary minded, this book stands out among others.
1400063515|3.0|There are some great ideas in this book, but in my mind, there's too much fluff as well. Some of the personal anecdotes are amusing, but there are entirely too many - and too many created characters who don't serve any real purpose.     I feel like the message is dumbed down too much. Clearly the author has a great deal of disdain for the way many people view the world, but too much of that contempt keeps getting in the way of the story. I started to get the feeling that the author felt his readers needed to be beat over the head with his points. The points can be interesting, but just explain them to me, don't give me a bunch of 2-dimensional characters to show a simple example.    Further, I want more depth, and more insight. The ideas are there, but they could have been explained in 10 pages. Use the rest of the book to explain the implications, and how we can use this knowledge in real life. There were too many diatribes against Nobel winners and foolish economists, and too few insights, such as putting a lot of money in Bonds and a little in highly risky stocks.    Some good ideas overall, but it could have been so much better.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I was surprised to hear a new AM song on the radio a few weeks ago, but hardly in a bad way. Their debut album was one of the best I had head in years, and still makes its way through regular rotation on my iPod and home system.  <br /> <br />The second album, is again one of the best I have heard. The song writing is, I hate to use the cliche, but wise beyond their years. With each listen through, I hear a new line that makes me dig them that much more.  <br /> <br />If you haven't listened to the Arctic Monkeys, do yourself a great favor and pick them up. They really are one of the best bands to come from the UK since Oasis. Well done guys!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|What are these guys doing?  What is Chester thinking?  I want to hear Chester screaming and not singing emo like the black Spiderman.  Only ~3-4 songs on this CD rock, but they're still more like B-sides for what this band is capable of.  VERY disappointing CD from these guys as everyone else is saying as well.  I just hope they get back on the sound that everybody likes about them.  Definitely don't buy the CD...  You've been warned!
055358202X|2.0|At first, I thought the author was losing steam in the overall story.  After reviewing his web-site, it appears he's more interested in marketing than in writing anymore.  The novel was a paper thin plot stretched out to novel length in order to sell books, nothing more.  It's strung with more dangling plotlines than a season finale of 24.  Don't hold your breath for A Dance With Dragons, it's already 4 months overdue with no end in sight, something tells me it will be of the same quality.  A shame, but it looks like another talented author has forgotten that it's his readership that matters, IE, Robert Jordan.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a gem of a unit. My previous flash was a 580 EX on a Canon Xti body. It had so many buttons that my head would spin and I could never get the settings quite right.

1594489505|5.0|Since the author was born in Afghanistan, I am completely impressed with his writing and the English language. The characters were people that I really felt I knew and I was rooting for them the whole way. (Except some obvious ones, being most of the males). Although at times, very saddening and disturbing, the author does a great job of describing what it was like to live there during these times. The female friendship was so touching and I even really loved the last sentence of the book. I don't know why it hit me so strongly. But after reading the last line I really felt a sense of love and closure and it hits on the relationship of the two women so well. Great job on your second novel!

1596680199|5.0|I'm a total polymer clay beginner. There are some really good p-clay books out there. This book is the best I've bought so far. The photos and layout are well-though out, informative, imaginative but not cluttered. The top of the page is a gallery with jewelry made from the various beads being featured. The side margins have helpful hints yet the step-by-step instructions are clear and guides you through everything and I mean everything. I previously bought the Art of Polymer Clay by Lark which is an excellent book but beyond my skill. However, with this book as a companion, a novice will be inspired and encouraged to advance to the more difficult p-clay techniques.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|So, why post a review of an album that's been endlessly reviewed?  Usually my point is to reach out to someone who hasn't heard it that's thinking of buying it.  So wherever you are, here I am:    Are you familiar with Wilco already?  Great.  Go get this album, and see how you feel about it.  It has an overall feeling of '70s soft rock and soul coupled with a Grateful Dead/Dylan & the Band/Neil Young folksiness.  The only Beatles nod I hear is some obvious Abbey Road riffage on \\"Hate It Here\\".  Despite all that, there are a few big rock moments.  Faces/Allman flourishes pop up as well.  So far this album makes me a little uncomfortable for how it sounds too much like a throwback.  It sounds so much like a throwback to me that the modern touches (certain crazy grandstanding guitar solos, etc.) sound wrong, like, oh, i dunno, an ipod port on a Model T.  I am, however, happy that these guys keep making records that don't sound quite like the previous record.  We'll all have to wait 20 years or so to decide which albums \\"hold up\\" the best.  We're too close to 'em now to really know.    Not familiar with Wilco?  Don't start here.  I'd suspect you're not familiar with Uncle Tupelo, either, the leader of Wilco's previous band.  Go get the Uncle Tupelo Best Of first.  The other main songwriter in Uncle Tupelo went on to form a band called Son Volt.  You also might buy \\"Summerteeth\\" or maybe \\"Being There\\" as your first Wilco album.

0143039830|4.0|\\"He had always imagined that the key to good detective work was a close observation of details.  The more accurate the scrutiny, the more successful the results.  The implication was that human behavior could be understood, that beneath the infinite façade of gestures, tics, and silences, there was finally a coherence, an order, a source of motivation.\\"<br /><br />Paul Auster's \\"New York Trilogy,\\" consisting of the novellas \\"City of Glass,\\" \\"Ghosts,\\" and \\"The Locked Room,\\" is an intriguing blend of post-modern fiction, metaphysical philosophy, and detective novels.  Through his reliance on the themes and structure of pulp/noir mysteries, Auster delves deeply into questions regarding identity, purpose, obsession, what is real, and examines the often tenuous grip that most people have on their sanity.  His exploration is quite compelling and makes for a fascinating read, but it is unfortunate that the quality of the novellas is slightly uneven.  The first, \\"City of Glass,\\" is far too impenetrable and abstruse to be much more than frustrating.  While it is clear that its protagonist, Quinn, is desperate to shed his identity in order to escape from the painful loss that has left him paralyzed, it is unclear why he becomes so obsessed with the case that he takes on after doing so.  \\"Ghosts\\" is a marked improvement, but it is only in the final novella, \\"The Locked Room,\\" that this trilogy really comes to life.  \\"The Locked Room\\" is eloquent where its predecessors are vague, pointed when the others are intentionally blurry, and poignant rather than murky.  Auster is certainly a great writer, and I will be interested to read more of his works, but \\"The New York Trilogy\\" requires a willingness to stick with it in order to get to its heart.  But I recommend hanging in there, because that final novella is a true gem, and makes the ride worth your while.<br /><br />Here's the grade breakdown: \\"City of Glass\\": C+, \\"Ghosts\\": B, \\"The Locked Room\\": A<br />Average grade: B
0385340559|4.0|Lee Child's hero, jack Reacher, has often been almost a cartoonish hero figure: out-running, out-gunning and out-thinking all enemies with a machine-like perfection that begs credulity.  Even as he begged believeability, he was still toroughly enjoyable.  In Bad Luck, Reacher has much more depth.  He is reunited with three of seven of his old MP special unit investigators and his emotions run faster than he does (he acknowledges slowing with age).  For the first time in this series, there is a deep comraderie that pervades the novel.  The eight MP's were extremely close so that years later, it is still \\"all for one and one for all\\".<br /><br />The novel starts, as does all of Child's, with the tension hitting the reader right off the bat - a live man is thrown from a helicopter.  It turns out to be one of Reacher's former co-horts.  As the remaining four try and get retribution, another one is found, also having been tossed from the sky.  It is soon clear that more than two of the eight are dead.  What is not at all clear is who is doing it, nor how.  The group can not fathom that any one of them could have been out-foxed, no less more than one.<br /><br />The sleuthing is great as Child builds his mystery.  There is more sleuthing and less viloent scenes in this novel than in previous iterations of the Reacher series, buit that does not diminish it.<br /><br />Mr. Child writes with vivid detail that brings every scene to life - even the swashbuckling-like battle scenes.  Readers of the series will enjoy this entry, but it also stands alone well.  I imagine that anyone who picks this up as his first Reacher book will reach for the others in the series, which need not be read in order (all stand alone quite well).<br /><br />This is highly recommended for a good mystery/thriller that is better written (by far) than most in this genre.

B000002BYD|5.0|Conceived at a period of d&eacute;tente in the band's turbulent career, Pearl Jam's fifth album is one that definitively documents exactly where the band was at that particular time (1998). Whereas Yield's predecessor No Code (1996) had been fraught with upheaval and was conversely inconsistent and experimental, Yield itself is its very antithesis.<br /><br />When No Code was released Pearl Jam were still the main players in the - admittedly failing - grunge scene, yet by the time they entered the studio to record Yield Soundgarden and Screaming Trees had disbanded, Alice in Chains were in an irreversible state of coma, and The Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness had obliterated the last remnants of grunge.<br /><br />Yield however, showcases the greatness of Pearl Jam. Closing ranks impressively - the war of egos between singer Eddie Vedder and guitarist Stone Gossard having reached armistice - the band took stock, returned to Seattle and recorded their most honest, instinctual and diplomatic work to date.<br /><br />Vedder's enchantment by nature and wilderness is brought prominently to the fore, and his elegant vocals belie the oft-pious bellow of earlier works. Indeed, Vedder's piety forms the basis of Yield, with the songs 'Faithfull' (marriage), 'Given to Fly' (christianity and penance), and the tiresome 'Wishlist' (contentment) - supported by bassist Jeff Ament's 'Low Light' and Gossard's 'All Those Yesterdays' - bearing witness to a more mature take on life's spiritual and secular ambiguities.<br /><br />Additionally, Gossard and lead guitarist Mike McCready have never combined better than on Yield, with the former's refound gift for compositionally strong riffs perfectly complemented by the latter's uncharacteristically discreet lead playing. Pearl Jam's secret weapon on Yield however, is drummer Jack Irons in what was to prove his final outing with the band. Aside from his generally calming persona (as seen on the documentary of the album's recording, Single Video Theory) his propulsive and often eclectic approach to the drumkit ('Red Dot') suits Pearl Jam's expansive sound far more than current incumbent (ex-Soundgarden-er) Matt Cameron's.<br /><br />Relaxed, inventive and adventurous, and without the merest hint of grunge clich&eacute;, Yield is the sound of a band finally at ease with both its superstar status and its loss thereof.is propulsive and often eclectic approach to the drumkit ('Red Dot') suits Pearl Jam's expansive sound far more than current incumbent (ex-Soundgarden-er) Matt Cameron's.    Relaxed, inventive and adventurous, and without the merest hint of grunge cliché, Yield is the sound of a band finally at ease with both its superstar status and its loss thereof.
B000E1ZK50|5.0|The picture is gosh darn amazing... very friggin' detail and colors... I love the opening part... Black and White. It's very surreal looking and so detail for black and white. And the special effect are amazing for its time and still do good for now. I forgot how violence this film are for a PG-13 film, its should be PG-15... anyway, HD-DVD is indeed amazing HD format out right now!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|This album lives up to the high expectations I had for it after Lulubies to Paralize and the single Sick, Sick, Sick. LTP was a pathetic follow up compared to Songs for the Deaf. I am glad QOTSA is trying something new with their sound for this album. They've gotten a bit heavier and added some dance elements to their already Hard Rock sound. Sick, Sick, Sick is probably my favorite song right now, but the rest are growing on me as well. Era Vulgaris, or Common Era when translated from Latin, is a great album. The band thought it ment Vulgar Era, but it still works. Anyways, if you are new to QOTSA, try this album out then buy Songs for the Deaf. I promise, you won't be sorry you bought it.
0711986746|2.0|I do not care how you feel about Freddie or people who lived his lifestyle.  THE BOOK IS TERRIBLE AND THE PICTURES ARE A JOKE.  I could not even give this book away to the public library!   <br /> <br />You can read better and more accurate material for free online.  There are many fansites that have reproductions of interviews conducted with Freddie and the other Queen members.  A year or so ago, a trade publication dedicated the entire magazine to Queen and I learn new information.   <br /> <br />Take my advice and search the web for information and photographs, you will be glad you did.
0765315246|5.0|I have been reading science fiction for decades. My favorite books being Forever War and Mindbridge. I have read many many pretenders to those books, but I believe Old Mans War does those reads one better. I have missed the \\"reality\\" of human interaction in most scifi and it was incredibly refreshing to read this book and become lost in the characters. I never realized how a few bodily function jokes can add humanism to a science fiction book. This is a must read for fans of not just military scifi, but all scifi. It is the first scifi book I told my wife she should read.

The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed. Yes, I mean Batman Return and Batman Begins... they're both amaziong and well-made movie. I can't wait to get the rest of the other batman movies on HD-DVD!
0060763280|1.0|My 1 Star rating has a negative sign preceding it!! <br /> <br />This book is like all TV \\"infomercials\\" on wealth, success, money, and health. THEY ARE ALL FLUFF - NO EXCEPTIONS!!!   This book was written to SELL DREAMS, to SELL HOPES, to SELL PROMISES, to SELL MONEY, to SELL WEALTH. <br /> <br />THIS BOOK SELLS, the courses sell, the seminars sell. THEY ALL SELL.   But the book is full of clichés and wishful thinking and preys on the uninformed and honest and trusting \\"non-millionaires\\" who trust that someone is willing and able to help them. <br /> <br />This book will not help you become a millionaire, and neither will the courses and seminars. And the author tells you that up front by writing \\"do not believe anything I say\\". <br /> <br />The intent of the book is to sell a dream at a low price (the book), only to persuade you to buy your next dream (a course) at a higher price, only to persuade you to purchase your next dream (fast track) at a yet higher price, and on and on and on. Does the name Wade Cook sound familiar? <br /> <br />Instead of spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on this book, courses and seminars, take the money and buy lottery tickets. The odds of your becoming a millionaire will increase astronomically if you purchase lottery tickets (although they are still not very good) J) <br /> <br />Seriously, what anyone should do is take the hundreds or thousands of dollars you would spend on the courses and seminars recommended by this book and place the money into an IRA account. Then in your IRA account, purchase some Index Funds. Let the money grow and compound year after year.   <br /> <br />What this book does not tell you is that millionaires have made money by investing in tangible assets, real assets, like businesses, real estate, stocks and bonds. And, similar to this book, if you see it on TV - run away from it!!! <br /> <br />Understand you will never get rich until you live on less than you earn, save some of your hard earned money every month, and until you implement a plan to remove debt from your life.  <br /> <br />Amazon has some good books to start you on your way and I would recommend you check out books by John Bogle, William Bernstein, Gordon Eade, or enroll in an investment course at a community college.  <br /> <br />This book many, many times mentions more courses and seminars, promotes itself far too many times. Go and attend these useless seminars if you wish, but do not pay with a credit card, pay with cash - $10 bills or better yet $5 bills. And Do Enjoy the feeling of seeing your money disappear as you hand over each and every single bill. Besides, by paying in cash you will never have debt collectors hounding you if you cannot pay off the extravagant charges you placed on your credit card. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />. <br /> <br />  <br />
B000000OAL|4.0|This is Queen's first album and you can tell they are going places.  Yes, Freddie's voice was thin and the subjects of their songs are weird, but the music is great.  If you are unfamiliar with Queen, please understand that a lot of their songs are tongue in cheek and the boys often made fun of themselves or a situation. <br /> <br /> <br />The bonus tracks and remix of \\"Liar\\" are an added treat!  I have read many references to \\"Mad the Swine\\" and have read it was popular when they toured in the early days, now I have a change to hear it.
0374105235|5.0|A searing and painful book about the experiences of a young man's struggles after his village and family have been wiped out by the rebels in Sierra Leone. The descriptions of physical sufffering are wrenching as is the description of his metamorphosis from victim to perpetrator and back again to young man simply trying to live his life after such horrendous experiences. It is well written and authentic. I greatly admire his courage in describing for us what must have been painful events to live through again in the writing.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|Yes, I loved this movie and it more of true style of racing me and my brother are interest in. Yes, I know... the first one is good cuz of Vin Diesel andf Paul Walker. But this is still the best of all 3 F & F series! The ending is awesome and I knew it, I've read that part a long ago before this movie came out in theatres! I enjoying watch this movie, over over over over and don't get tired of it... mmmm, safe to say I've watch this HD-DVD like 7 times and 3 times in theatres. Anyway, the picture and sound are amazing and wicked awesome!

B000000WFZ|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Ennio's work.  The problem is that ALL OF THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME.  They are a variation of 2 different melodies.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I wish I knew all the names of the instruments that are being played in the score because they are absolutely mesmerizing!  What an amazing score to accompany an amazing movie.  Never a dull moment, I find myself being moved by the overall emotion of the music.  The great thing about epic scores is that they manage to stir up some feelings within you of power, pride, and faith.  It manages to inspire some in many different ways.  I think that's the most important thing here.  You can call it mood music or just simply uplifting.  For me, the best way to listen to a score like this is with a great pair of headphones and a clear mind.
B000E5KJHA|4.0|This is bloody well-done film, very perfect creepy-goo style. Very true-style of Tim Burton's film. I loved it and enjoying the creepy looks of Johnny Depp playing as Charlie. Other than that... the picture are amazing detail... top-noice HD-DVD, trust me, it is a better choice to buy this format cuz the price and software are resonable and very good deal. You won't be disappoint, trust me! Ohh I forgot, the HD sound, is amazing... very ALIVE! That's all folks!
B000J103PC|3.0|I read the book on which this film is based before seeing this film.  I loved the book, & I thought that the film would replicate the book.  I was wrong.  It's a great film, but I was disappointed that the film did not replicate the book.  Some of the concepts in the book are the same in the film, but some are not.  For example, Andy's (Hathaway's) boyfriend in the film is not the same as he is in the book.  I guess they had to make some changes so that the film wasn't so long.  My advice is to read the book!  I enjoyed the book more than the film. <br /> <br />[[ASIN:0307275558 The Devil Wears Prada]]
0743496728|4.0|There are few news events I can think of that inspire more questions than a school shooting. None bigger than: why? Jodi Picoult's new novel Nineteen Minutes allows the reader to witness such a tragedy through every viewpoint imaginable: the victims, the parents, the police, and the shooter. By now, the details are sadly too familiar. On an average day, a young man walks into his high school and opens fire on his fellow students and teachers. Before his rampage ends, ten people have died and many others are wounded. In Picoult's world, however, the suspect is apprehended by police before taking his own life. From here, the novel moves back and forth between the present day in which a stunned community prepares for the upcoming trial and the past where a young boy is relentlssly tormented by school bullies. Most affecting are sections that deal with the suspect's parents, particularly his mother, who are depicted by Picoult as sympathetic loving people desperate to figure out just where they went wrong. Perhaps most frightening is the notion that these were adequate parents whose son was simply doomed to be an outcast. Picoult is a strong writer who crafts moving scenes and fully fleshed out characters. The denouement features a twist that could only happen in fiction and disrupts the powerful sense of reality Picoult has built up to that point. That aside, Nineteen Minutes is a gripping emotional dissection of a very timely event.
B000M3452Y|4.0|I had to think of the Bright Eyes albums 'I'm Wide Awake' and 'Digital Ash'. The first one is a lot about New York, the second is more an electronic album. Sound of Silver sounds to me like an electronic album about New York. <br /> <br />Great album, very diverse, has its mellow moments (NY I love you) and a superdance tune (North American Scum).  <br /> <br />Also a nice crossover album, people who only listen to electronic music will enjoy it and indie fans will as well.
B000NDIAWY|3.0|So many reviews of this CD are glowing, but I review it with more reserve.  It is an OKAY follow-up to the incredible first release \\"Brandi Carlile,\\" but it lacks the luster of the first CD.  <br /> <br />Without a doubt the best song on the CD is \\"The Story.\\"  The remaining 13 songs are more of the folk genre and none of them really stand out.  I say 13 because if you let track 13 continue to play there is an extra song. <br /> <br />This CD was recorded in 11 days and I could tell.  Some of the songs just seem thrown together.   <br /> <br />\\"The Story\\" is a folksy/blues mix which is great if you are into that genre of music.  I lean strongly toward rock.  If you prefer the folk genre you will probably love this CD. <br /> <br />
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Diaz & Winslet star as 2 women that are world apart (one in LA, the other in London) but that are both depressed from man problems.  They decide (online) to switch houses for 2 weeks over the Christmas holiday.  They are both hoping to be able to pay attention to themselves - not men. <br /> <br />     However, they are surprisingly mistaken!  Enter Law & Black.  Jude Law plays Graham while Jack Black plays Miles.  Diaz's character, Amanda, falls for Graham (Kate Winselet's character's older brother) in England while Winslet's character, Iris, falls for Miles in California. <br /> <br />     All of these actors & actresses are phenomenal in this film!  Since the women are only switching houses for 2 weeks, how does this movie end happily?  You will have to view it to find out.  It's totally worth it - a must see romance!
B000NA28IE|1.0|I had to force my way through reading the book. I thought it was horribly written. Tried to hard to be Lord of the Rings. I knew just from watching the previews to the movie it was going to be way worse. It was. I can't believe I even tried watching it. You'd think they'd try to hold to the story a bit more. If I were the author I would of been so mad! TOTAL WASTE!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Ok... So far I've only watched the first 4 chapters, so let me comment about them:<br /><br />Chapter 1 was kinda boring. Let's face it, we've all seen so many extraordinary movies lately that it's difficult to impress us. It's more like a general introduction of what you're gong to see in the whole series, so this lack of coherency made me... go asleep a couple of times.<br /><br />From chapters 2-4 seem the series seems to get better and better with each coming chapter. At first, you might think: \\"I see nothing extraordinary in these shots... They have shots like these all the time in everyday cable TV\\"... But when you watch the mini \\"making of\\" at the end of each chapter, you come to really appreciate the effort put to make even a shot a few seconds long. And when you turn on your cable box again you realize that the shots in everyday cable aren't really that great. Ad you come to realize that this series has some places and animals you hadn't even heard about.<br /><br />Now, if I think the series is so good (after a Zzzzzz first chapter) Why did I gave it just 4 stars? Because of the way the DVDs were made.<br /><br />My first gripe: The BBC makes you sit and watch through tons of ads of their other programs, and there are a few logos, too. In total, you have to skip to \\"next\\" 5 TIMES to finally get to the menu every single time you put the DVD in your player.<br /><br />2nd gripe: The boxing (at least the regular DVD edition one) is made of cardboard, and quite flimsy. Yes, it might look cool with the transparent plastic holding each DVD and everything, but I really feel that I must get these five discs out of this box NOW if this box is to survive another month. I hope they make an edition with regular DVD boxes in the future. I'll post a pic of the box soon...<br /><br />3rd gripe: There's this company called \\"2 entertain\\"... well, thanks to these guys every single disc in the collection has a giant 2 on it, which is quite confusing. The real disc number is harder to find in the darkness of a home theater...<br /><br />Now, I expect to be attacked by an angry mob. Leave your comments!sc number is harder to find in the darkness of a home theater... <br /> <br />Now, I expect to be attacked by an angry mob. Leave your comments!

0792844890|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since I was 4 years old and a Star Wars fan ever since I was 7. Both TV/film franchises hold a special place in my heart. I was also a fan of Mel Brooks (I had seen History of the World: Part One countless times as well as Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, etc.) <br /> <br />Then, at the wonderful age of 17, I saw Spaceballs at the theater. <br /> <br />OH.....MY.....GOD! <br /> <br />From the opening scene when the gargantuan spaceship flies across the screen and keeps going and going and going and going, I knew I was in for a treat. For the first few seconds, I took the scene for what it was, but after I realized what Brooks was \\"saying\\" with the scene, I burst out laughing. How ingenius! <br /> <br />During the run of the film, I laughed so hard that my stomach and face muscles were sore for days afterward. Obviously, a lot of love went into this film. Great attention to detail was made when it came to the names, costumes, special effects, music, etc. <br /> <br />Much of the humor is juvenile, but that's what's so damn endearing about Spaceballs. The movie makes no aplogies for itself and attacks almost all popular sci-fi venues.  <br /> <br />Obviously, the biggest influence of the film was Star Wars, but Spaceballs also pokes fun at Star Trek, Alien, Planet of the Apes, Transformers, and even the old classic Bugs Bunny cartoons. <br /> <br />At the price this DVD is going for, you can't afford to pass up a classic film like this. Comedy fans will enjoy it, but sci-fi fans will love it that much more. <br /> <br />\\"May da schwartz be wit youoooooo.....oh, what a world! What a world.....\\" <br />
1416524800|3.0|I still haven't decided if I liked this book or not.  In fact, I couldn't decide the whole way through.  At times the story line was fun.  At times, so over the top, it was laughable.  The science aspect might have been great if those things interest you.  If they don't, and that includes me, you will find them endless and dull.  The characters were predictable at best and shallow at worst.  I guess I would sum up by saying I wouldn't seek out this book...but if someone lent it to you, what the heck.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Found this story very interesting. It's perspective of the Royal Family was believable as was the hidden emotions of the Queen that struggled to surface.  Good movie.
B0009X766Y|3.0|Just a caveat to all users reading reviews: <br />There are 2 versions of this movie on DVD, and Amazon have put all the reviews for both versions together, so you can basically ignore the reviews here and look elsewhere for reviews that distinguish between the two editions currently out. <br /> <br />Amazon are great at customer service and despatch, but terrible at review maintenance. <br /> <br />One version is pan and scan, and the other is listed as widescreen.  Good luck working out which version people are reviewing!
B000P0J02E|5.0|Definitely sets a appropriately rich, epic, dramatic tone for the film, and also an excellent listen as audio alone.      The percentage of addicting tracks on this CD far exceed that of the other two Pirates scores.    This is without doubt one of the most intense and vibrant film scores I have encountered to date.  And it isn't just one or two good tracks, it's a vast majority of them that simply blows me away.  It really is hard for me to find music that sends chills up my spine like this does.
B000P0J024|4.0|The two Traveling Wilbury albums that George Harrison cut with his friends are finally back in print. The first album is worth five stars. With a combination of Harrison, Lynne, Dylan, Petty, Orbison and honorary Wilbury Jim Keltner on drums how could it not be? \\"Volume 1\\" is a great album that hasn't aged for me at all. The two bonus tracks on disc one \\"Maxine\\" and \\"Like a Ship\\" are both terrific and would have fit well on the album. Sound is very good for the album with more punch to my ears.<br /><br />The second album \\"Volume 3\\" missed Orbison but is almost as good as the first album. Definitely worth four stars in my book, Dylan is a bit more center stage on this one although all the Wilbury's still share lead vocals on a number of tracks. The two bonus tracks here have been released one on the \\"Nobody's Child\\" benefit album the other as the b-side of a single. The first \\"Nobody's Child\\" a cover of a 50's tune and the second a cover of Del Shannon's classic \\"Runaway\\" add to the album although they aren't quite as spectacular as \\"Maxine\\". FYI for completists--\\"Runaway\\" is DIFFERENT from the single version. Jeff Lynne went back overdubbed guitar/harmonica on it and some other bits as he was never quite satisfied with the \\"finished\\" version on the single.<br /><br /> \\"Volume 3\\" had two great singles the rocking \\"She's My Baby\\" and \\"Wilbury Twist\\" and while it still sounds terrific it doesn't quite have the off-hand vibe that made the first album perfect. It's still a terrific follow up.<br /><br />The DVD has a documentary with interviews of the band and plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of the recording of the album as well as some clips from the first couple of singles. It also includes all five videos for the two albums. It's a pity we won't see this quintet or quartet recording any more as they did a pair of terrific albums. The DVD by the way is multi-region according to my box. The package also includes a booklet with comments from former Warner head Mo Ostin discussing how the group came to be as well as the full credits for each album, photos and the contents of the booklets for the original CD releases.group came to be as well as the full credits for each album, photos and the contents of the booklets for the original CD releases.

0141439688|4.0|In Jane Austen's last novel, Persuasion, we meet the Elliot family:  Sir Walter and his daughters, Elizabeth, Mary and the youngest daughter Anne.  Over 8 years ago Anne became engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no one to recommend him.  After much persuasion from a family friend, Lady Russell, Anne breaks off the engagement.  When the reader meets Anne it is more than 8 years later and circumstances have brought her and the now Captain Frederick Wentworth back into each other's lives.  Will they be able to rekindle their relationship or did Anne's initial refusal ruin all hope for them to be together...?<br /><br />Reading Jane Austen is truly refreshing!  The subtleness with which Austen delves into the relationship between Anne and Captain Wentworth among other characters is beautifully done.  A great read!
B00000AOUD|5.0|Many years ago, I purchased \\"Thick as a Brick\\" on vinyl, expecting a traditional rock album, with a collection of 8 to 10 songs.  I was amazed that there was only one song covering both sides.  I listened to it once and was completely lost once it got past the first 3 minute edit I had heard on the radio several times.      I was so bewildered that I returned the album for a refund and was suspicious of Jethro Tull for a few years, thinking that maybe they were just too unorthodox for my tastes.      Now that I own all of the Jethro Tull CDs, I am obviously a huge Tull fan and my opinion of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is quite different.  I like this album.  It might be the best album Tull ever recorded.  Or maybe \\"A Passion Play\\" is the best (which is similar to \\"Thick as a Brick\\" in the sense that they both are continuous play with many movements within).      Or maybe the idea of a single song covering an entire album is too preteneous and less enjoyable for the listener who doesn't have over 40 minutes to spare in one sitting.  I'd say that someone who is just starting to get to know Jethro Tull's music should start with an album with a traditional song format.  You could choose 'Crest of a Knave,' 'Songs from the Wood,' 'Catfish Rising,' 'Benefit' or 'A.'      Still, this album is nearly one of a kind.  If you are relatively new to Tull, I'd play it safe and buy any of the 'Songs from the Wood,' 'Heavy Horses,' 'Stormwatch,' 'A' albums or perhaps 'Crest of a Knave.'  But if you tend to like progressive, ambitious albums, buy this one.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|By Seth Kerin, author of [[ASIN:1590923286 The Elder Worlds: Book One]] <br />Firefly is arguably the best television show that never quite got a fair shake, although thanks to the Sci-Fi Channel it was given a second life, and was furthered by the theatrical release of Serenity. Firefly is part Star Wars, part Western, part cautionary tale, mixed in with a fair bit adventure, humor, and wit. The characters are all well fleshed out, fallible, but ultimately with good hearts - the individual actors do a tremendous job both in the Firefly series and later reprising their roles in Serenity.  <br /> <br />What makes Firefly really great though? It's telling an age old tale in a unique new way. The music, ranging from Western twang to soothing Oriental tunes, set the tone for each scene whether it's a spacecraft chase, a bar brawl on a distant world, or an intimate scene between the cast on board their broken down but well-loved ship. <br /> <br />Firefly is one of the best Sci-Fi series out there - short, but ultimately great. Fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica (the new series), Stargate SG-1/Atlantis, and others will love this set. Trust me - watch one episode, and you'll be hooked too! <br />
B0002TT0NW|1.0|After reading the 3rd book, I was highly anticipating the release of the movie. I'm sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed. Alot of people I know loved this movie, but none of them had read the book. The book was AMAZING! It made the movie look dim. There were alot of main points that occured in the story that were not brought out in this movie. The fact that authors have no say in the way the movie of the book they wrote turns out, is ridiculous.

I made a garden of variegated batik roses to applique on the border of a too-flat-looking spring quilt. It really made an 8 hour car ride pass quickly. I have also made the roses in super size- 8\\" square final size- and put them on tote bags as decorative pockets.
0440237688|5.0|This book is about a boy named Jonas who is living in a futuristic society where color and emotions are non-existent and jobs are assigned to people when they turn 12 years old. Jonas is assigned the job of \\"The Receiver\\". This means he holds all the memories of the past. <br /> <br />This is by far the most amazing book I've ever read. I'd never read a book more than once before this one, and I'd also never read a book in one day before this one. I read this book two years ago when I was in the 8th grade. My friend had suggested that I read it. I had previously attempted to read this book in the 6th grade, but I just couldn't get interested in it. I was not assigned to read this book, but after trying to pressure my other friends into reading it, they explained to me that they had already tried to when they were younger. I don't believe that this book is appropriate for children under the age of 13. It's too advanced, and I don't believe that they would understand or really take in the point of the book. <br /> <br />The best part about this book is that at the end, you get to choose what happens. It's left to the reader to decide Jonas's and Gabe's fate. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book! Lois Lowry is amazing, and I can't wait to check out other books she's written!
B000021Y7X|4.0|This recorded concert of David Byrne and The Talking Heads may not be the greatest concert ever captured on film (as the DVD jacket claims it to be) - but it's a very good concert.  <br /> <br />The concert includes many of the classics Byrne is known for as well as several songs I hadn't heard before. The DVD should have made captioning available for the songs though, because, as with a lot of music of the past few decades, the words get smothered by the amplification, by crowding the mike, and by the background wall of sound. And with Byrne especially, you want to hear the words. He is the e.e.cummings of rock lyrics - skewering, lamenting the humdrumness that people work themselves into. His \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" is like cummings' \\"Anyhow Town.\\" <br /> <br />The lighting is well-done and evocative though, and conveys the mood of the songs even when you can't hear all the lyrics. <br /> <br />But best of all is the choreography. Byrne once again transforms himself into a live and lanky puppet, yanked on my unseen strings, buffeted and punched by forces that remain hidden behind-the-scenes. Several of his background singers are equally talented at that loose-limbed sort of pantomime. They become masters of topsy Terpsichore. They hang it like rag doll prizefighters - never quite getting the best of their opponents, but getting their licks in nonetheless. <br /> <br />
0316067598|3.0|Luttrell's endurance, bravery, and self sacrifice are undeniable. Hats off to him for his actions in Kunar. Readers should know, however, that the man who saved Luttrell, the Afghani Muhammed Gulab, got dumped unceremoniously by Luttrell, the SEALs, Coalition forces, and the U.S. For helping to save Luttrell Gulab came under the threat of death from the Tali and was forced to leave his village, never to return. He is a simple wood merchant. He fled to Asadabad where he was given menial work at the Coalition base there.  Luttrell, according to Gulab, promised him money to resettle himself and his family. He never received a sou. Later, he tried to get in touch with Luttrell, to no avail. Calls and emails were not returned. Worse still, when he talked about these issues with a Newsweek correspondent based in Islamabad, American forces incarcerated him at the Asadabad base for days, interrogating him without ever telling him what he had done to deserve such treatment; his questioners wanted to know why he had talked to Newsweek about unfulfilled promises. He was terrified. He remains confused. His life is in ruins. He can't go home. He was too afraid for his life even to visit the village for his mother's funeral. If he had saved your life -- as he did Luttrell's -- you surely would do everything in your power to repay Gulab. Wouldn't you? Has Luttrell given or even pledged any of his book advance and royalties to Gulab? Gulab doesn't think so. Luttrell in the book says he offered his wristwatch and money but Gulab refused. Please. Luttrell should not insult the readers' intelligence. The sum I heard was $20,000. Never to be fulfilled. Long forgotten. This is a hearts-and-minds issue. Counter-insurgency can never succeed if we treat people as Gulab has been treated. And one last point: Gulab says he helped Luttrell less out of compassion than because he reckoned that the Coalitiion forces would not bomb his village in retaliation for the attacks on the Redwing team ifthe village helped one Redwing team member to survive. Guess what? Once Luttrell was safe again, Coalition forces bombed Gulab's village, killing 17 civilians, women and children. Commanders at Bagram later apologized to President Kharzai who had demanded an explanation. Luttrell did a good job getting himself out of a tight spot, but the aftertaste of Redwing is somewhat bitter, and should be known and told.
B000M4RG42|3.0|This isn't a bad movie, but I don't think it deserved the Academy Award attention it got. Yes, the Battle of Iwo Jima was one of the bloodiest of WWII, but it's unlikely that all the casualties were as cinematically graphic as shown here - with severed heads blinking their last into the camera.  And it's unlikely that all the shots fired tore through flesh with the impact of video game strikes, as they do here. For a more realistic picture of the haphazard mix of hits and misses, of graphically shocking and banal injury that takes place in real war - you probably can't do better than to check out the 1930 Academy Award winner, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\" <br /> <br />Then there's also something extravagantly unrealistic about the motivation in this movie. The men who were credited with raising that iconic flag on Iwo Jima are shown racked by anguish and guilt as they go on their subsequent bond tour. The presumption is that much of their torment stems from the deception they are perpetrating as they allow the heroism and grandeur of that flag-planting to be imputed to them. But it's not clear why that deception should loom so large in their psyches.  <br /> <br />One of the men called to make the tour was perhaps not involved in the actual flag-raising and is a stand-in for a deceased soldier who did help raise the flag. However all the touring men were in the thick of the battle and would have reason to take credit for heroism. Then the fact that the original flag-planting was re-staged so that a second set of photos could be taken would seem to be a minor deception at best - hardly enough to justify all the men's self-doubt - certainly not enough to justify the fact that one of the men spiraled down into lifelong alcoholism and unemployment. <br /> <br />So you never really get to know these men. Their emotions seem incoherent and groundless. <br /> <br />A good commentary on the DVD might have filled in some of these gaps in our understanding. But there isno commentary at all on this DVD containing \\"Flags\\" by itself. So I recommend you get Eastwood's 2-disc set containing both of his movie accouunts of Iwo Jima, plus a full commentary. The action here definitely needs to be put in further context.
1594489505|4.0|I enjoyed the 4 parts to the book. As a woman reader, it broke my heart to read some of the ordeals Mariam & Laila had to endure.  It was wonderfull written and the peek into the culture was an eye opener that truly made you understand how life is in Afganastan, rather than hearing about it on the news.  Good Story, I would recommend to anyone who loved the Kite Runner, however, I think the Kite Runner was better.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|This original \\"Wicker Man\\" (forget about the Nicholas Cage re-make) starts like a somewhat more conventional B-horror film. There are the purposefully unhelpful townspeople on the British island where Edward Woodward is sent to investigate the report of a missing girl. There are sidelong glances and whispers. Mysterious rites are practiced. All these slightly clichéd goings-on build mild suspense. But it's the twist-ending, with its awakening overturn of conventional role assignments, that is the real pay-off of the film.  <br /> <br />What's more, Edward Woodward found the perfect defining role for himself here, even though he would probably prefer to be praised for his more \\"important\\" roles in Shakespearean works, in \\"Breaker Morant,\\" or even as \\"The Equalizer\\" in the TV series. But here he portrays the supreme rectitude that he always seems to be striving towards in his other screen appearances. He is a man of proper, classical demeanor - a very rare kind of man who will not betray his principles for the expedient of satisfying any passing desire. It's the role that made me a Woodward fan. <br /> <br />As a bonus for male viewers, Britt Ekland does the most sumptuously erotic dance here that I think has ever been captured on camera. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Wicker Man\\" ignites from the ordinary to the extraordinary. <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|I cringed as I watched the versions that cut down such a brilliant book in to an hour and a half... so this version remains my favorite, especially with the great acting. After I finished watching the entire 5 hour production, I was dying to watch it again! Definately a classic for my collection!
B0000AUHPB|4.0|This heist movie starts out feeling a little dated, with Michael Caine playing another so-many-birds-so-little-time Alfie-type character - in this case just released from prison and transplanted to Italy. But I was soon swept up in the spirit of the armored car robbery caper he orchestrates. And even though I'm usually bored by car chases, I found this movie's get-away sequence to be ingenious and almost thrilling. It's off and running through impossibly narrow archways, down steep staircases, over bridges, with one literal cliffhanger along the way. A great music score adds to the bounce and jounce of every hurdle that's overcome. <br /> <br />As an additional bonus for foreign car buffs, the DVD includes an out-take sequence with the robbers' cars and the police cars doing an extended, elaborately choreographed minuet in a marbled ballroom. The director rightly decided that this surreal episode didn't fit in with his generally realistic picture. But it's good that the dance was saved. <br /> <br />The DVD bonus materials are overall as interesting as the picture itself. The director's commentary is especially worthwhile, because he recorded it relatively recently, so he was able to reflect backwards and forwards over each actor's career. You get to hear \\"whatever became of...\\" Everyone knows what Michael Caine has been doing. But Peter Collinson recaps the careers of Noel Coward, Raf Vallone, Benny Hill, and others who also star in the movie. <br /> <br />This director commentary is like falling into convivial conversation with a master filmmaker. I only disagreed with one opinion he had about his finished picture. He said he didn't like the way Benny Hill's infatuation with LARGE women had been scripted. I think Collinson felt the character's on-screen enthusiasm, with Hill frequently managing to bury himself in some woman's abundance, was in bad taste.   <br /> <br />But I personally found Hill's irrepressible enthusiasm rather appealing. It's as irresistible asthis movie itself.  I didn't see the recent re-make of \\"The Italian Job,\\" but I have a hunch this original is the version to get.       <br /> <br />

B000002L99|5.0|If you've never listened to this album before, buy it and skip to \\"Get up\\". Songs like this, based on Sammy Haggar's experience as a boxer, just aren't written anymore. A total energy blast, there isn't a single energy drink that can give a kick like this song. The other songs on this album deliver as well.  <br /> <br />One aspect I've enjoyed about the Sammy Haggar invasion is that Van Halen's tunes don't seem to brood as much as they did with David Lee Roth. With Haggar, we get to hear more of Eddie Van Halen's talent in 5150 which previewed in \\"Jump\\" with Roth. More keys, more complex harmonies, more fast songs which in my estimation resulted in more music making make this album a great one. <br /> <br />5150 is probably Van Halen's greatest album ever. Though some may contest this, I can't help but constantly deem this valid when listening to the older and sadly less than exceptional following albums. <br /> <br />Great rock is just that, great. 5150 is great rock!

B000000H57|5.0|I absolutely hated this album when I first heard it.  I had heard \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" off of an independent radio station near me.  Since it was upbeat and somewhat dark sounding, I figured I'd give it a try.  I had already heard the cover of \\"Black Sabbath\\", and not expecting a full album of this slow pace, I picked it up used.  I was so disappointed.  At the time, I was kind of depressed, a sophomore in high school, and I needed something even more depressing.  Generally, I'd reach for Cannibal Corpse or some extreme death metal.  The growling and screaming usually did the trick.  I put this cd in and sat in a corner in my classroom (we were watching a movie at the time) and I could only listen to the same two tracks, the previously mentioned one and \\"Wolf Moon\\" solely because Peter Steele's voice on that track freaked me out.  Safe to say, I sold this cd and moved on. <br /> <br />Now, some 9 years later, I picked it up AGAIN, trying to give it a second whirl.  I am not disappointed this time, and I wish I had never gotten rid of it.  Sure, the pace is slow and dreary, but the fact that it still scares me is unbelievable.  The songs, the lyrics, the vocals, the keyboards, all of it fits the mood.  This album is unbelievable and should be heard by anyone who likes music. <br /> <br />The best song, by far, is still \\"Wolf Moon\\".  Listen to this late at night, alone, and in a car ride through the country and you, too, will get shivers down your spine.

B000NQR7KM|2.0|I'm a huge fan and have an outstanding system. This SACD/DVD-A will disappoint if you understand what breathing is when it comes to audio. Someone got overzealous with a compressor and made the vocal so bright that there are times when the music is gated in order to make way for it. If you want to hear what surround is capable of, purchase any Porcupine Tree disk or pick up the first Crowded House disk. Measure for measure, this disk is great if you are a die hard fan, but overdubbed concert footage and poorly engineered productions don't make up for what you can get from the first stereo remaster even if it was only at CD sampling rates.

0064409422|4.0|So I cheated. I saw the movie before I read the book and now I feel robbed. I feel robbed of the richness of this book that I've had so much fun with over just a couple of days. I was only able to find a few lines here and there that added to what the movie portrayed. They were rich and fantastic lines, don't get me wrong. In short, if you've seen the movie recently, give this book a little while before you read it. You'll find yourself appreciating the remembrances of the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was the first book that C.S. Lewis wrote in his Narnia Chronicles. It contains the foundational scenes for the rest of the Chronicles, even for the prequel \\"The Magician's Nephew.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" the reader finds the clear Gospel story of Narnia. The reader finds the God-Lion Aslan, who is a suppositional figure for the God-Man Jesus Christ. The reader finds Aslan acting as Christ in self sacrifice as well as in final victory. The reader finds a whole new world which is a microcosm of this world --- in the course of 206 short pages, we are taken from the fall into sin to the glory of the restored earth.<br /><br />The Chronicles are meant to be children's stories. There is much scholarship out there that tries to read these Chronicles without the acknowledgment that in order to truly understand Narnia, as with the Bible, you must come with the believing faith of a child. The simple logic that Lewis invites us to engage in with the 4 Pevensie children is that \\"there is nothing more probable\\"(p.54) than another world under God's control and that if we are invited into it - it will mean something to us for the rest of our lives.<br /><br />Like being invited into the world of God's Word - read, heard, and received in sacraments of Baptism and Lord's Supper - we are invited into the world of Narnia which changes us forever more. Narnia teaches us the story of God and it teaches us the story of ourselves. It teaches us the wild and untamed truth that there is an Aslan, or someone like an Aslan, out there just waiting to appear to us and redeem us.elves.

B00008BRBG|4.0|Okay, don't try to tell me this is a punk album. The only real punk song is \\"Next to You\\", which I love. \\"Peanuts\\" is sort of a punk song, but that weird instrumental break ain't punk. No, this is reggae, mon, or at least reggae-rock.  I mean, how else would you classify \\"Roxanne\\"? Damn, that is one good song. No wonder it was such a big hit! It's got the riff, the catchy chorus to end all catchy chorus, the classic \\"hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold\\" theme. Boom, boom, boom. Classic. And I think \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" is even better, managing to be depressing, funny, catchy and danceable all at once. Again, it's reggae-rock, leaning towards reggae. And what's \\"So Lonely\\" but pure reggae and nothing but? Well, reggae with jazz drumming. Naturally, this reggae-rock stuff is the best, but some of it is downright abominable: the anthem \\"Born in the '50s\\"; the immature \\"Be My Girl/Sally\\" (which, as it has been noted, is a love song to a friggin' doll - I think it's the most despised song in the Police's catalogue, either that or \\"Mother\\"), and the weird experiment \\"Maskowhatever Tango\\". In truth, you'd have to get rid of both \\"Born in the '50's and \\"Be My Girl/Sally\\" to bring his up any higher, but so what?  Quite good. Maybe the group's best. Maybe not.
6300181464|3.0|I was intrigued by the title of this movie because one of my favorite songs has the same name and a science fiction based lyric. Unfortunately, that is all they have in common, and the song has a better storyline. I really had high expections for this film, it had so much potential, even for its time. Instead, Bruce Dern is given almost the entire length of the movie (with the help of some poignant Judy Collins songs) to monologue his way through his loneliness, his creative attempts to create companionship with the little robot drones at his disposal, and to keep the forest alive. It never occurs to anyone that Earth itself could not survive without the forests??? It's not as if a forest is an expendable luxury item! Sure, the bunny rabbits and squirrels were cute, but there is a lot more to the value of a forest than the beauty of the flowers and the sweetness of the fruit! Anyway, I was disappointed, and I did have a hard time maintaining interest in the long, drawn out story that really went no where. I wish I had felt differently.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000542C6 The Emerald Forest]]
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bublé's voice takes me to another dimension high above.  His voice has an undescribable quality that you have to experience to understand.  He's like a cross between Frank Sinatra and Jack Jones. If you enjoy the standards of the American Songbook, you'll love the fresh yet traditional versions of the standards which he sings.  I've been listening to the standards sung by Sinatra, Nat King Cole, etc for decades and usually don't enjoy remakes by recent modern artists; Michael Bublé is one of the rare exceptions who outshines all of the recent standards singers wannabes. <br /> <br />This CD is an incredibly great album to from start to finish; there's no need to skip songs which are merely mediocre or plain terrible because each song is a great rendition and a true gem.
0316018953|4.0|As usual I was estatic to jump back into the world of Hary Bosch.  Unfortunatly it was a short lived visit.  At a mere 240 pages (less than half of the Black Echo) the book passes like the story line....lightning fast and over before you know it.  Given it's shortness it lacks the major character interaction that I have come to know and love in the Harry Bosch books.  <br />The story is still fascinating and pulls you along, but overall falls short of the greatness that we have come to expect in a Harry Bosch book.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I had to give less than 5 stars because I though they tried to cram waaaaaaay too much into this movie.  Like most people here I loved the series, but the movie kind of let me down a little.  There were one too many points where I felt like things were too convienient and explained away just to move the plot forward.  Granted this is a sci-fi movie, and a fun one at that, but as a fan of the show it just left me wanting more.
1596912855|3.0|I was so looking foward to reading this book, the premise being very original and interesting but the book fell short of my expectations.  It read as if Shannon Hale couldn't pin down her own main character, Jane, who was all over the place.  One day Jane would be totally into the experience of living like a Jane Austen character and the next day she'd hate it.  Her mood swings made her a frustrating character and very hard to like.  By the end I really didn't care what happened to her.  Too bad, because the premise has SUCH potential.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|This is my first Rihanna album; I wasn't into \\"Pon De Play\\", I wasn't that big into reggae at the time. \\"S.O.S\\" was really played out and had a nice hook but I didn't think she was going to go any further after that. Then I heard \\"Unfaithful\\" and I was hooked on that song up until January of this year. I heard \\"Umbrella\\" and I have to admit, it took me awhile to get into it. My sister loved it from jump, I howeever, wasn't so quick. The beat is really nice and it's a different tone compared to previous releases she's had. She's branching out and doing it really quickly, this is her 3rd album in 3 years. I picked up the album a couple days ago in New York in Wal-Mart and wasn't really sure if it was the actual album due to the fact that it was a thin paper case not a jewel case and it was brief as in detail and look. I saw the price and it changed my mind. I took it home and listened to it through and through and I have to say, it's really good. \\"Lemme Get That\\" \\"Breakin Dishes\\" \\"Sell Me Candy\\" \\"Rehab\\" \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" and \\"Hate that I Love You\\" are my favorites and \\"Umbrella\\" as well. I took a risk and it came out pretty even in the long run. I thought for a minute that she was a manufactured pop girl (i.e. Christina Millian) but she has really stretched her vocal range and personality out on this one and she has Aaliyah-success potential. I was upset at the skimpiness of the album booklet and case, that was just plain cheap.
B00005JPLW|4.0|The visuals are excellent.  I'll give it that.  But story arc is absent.  The main character - Leonidas - is the same throughout.  Whereas, Maximus in Gladiator, for example, goes through changes, Leonidas does not.  There's fighting, there's more fighting, and still more fighting.  Which doesn't give the viewer any opportunity for emotional involvement.  Or watching the character develop as the story progresses.  The characters are flat and one-dimensional and that is my biggest complaint.  But the visuals will blow you away.
B000069HK2|3.0|Man, just how much hype did The Used have going circa 2005/2006. Anarchic yet knowing enough to say all the right things to the metal mags, channeling the debauchery of 80's hard rock while putting in the extra aggression levels required for their audiences generation and with a name evocative of punk. All the while further perfecting their buzz by being, basically, a bit of a screamo band.<br /><br />The vocals of Bert McCracken actually remind me of Justin Hawkins of Darkness fame in use if not in execution and by that I mean that while they have radically different voices both have a sort of gimmick 'second option' with their voices. Hawkins with his silly falsetto 'castrati' schtick while McCracken has a gargled scream but both cause problems by over utilising their signature sound. Please Bert, you don't have to scream at me in every song! And this constant descent into screamo gets wearisome whereas it should be a welcome addition to particularly angsty or brutal songs.<br /><br />That gripe aside we can now move onto the music itself. Which isn't really much to write home to Amazon about. Opener maybe Memories is hard to fault as an explosion of angst with some studio tricks thrown in and really would probably strip paint at 100 yards. And that's a compliment. When the dust settles it give you hope that the rest of the album will bring further crescendos of bile.<br /><br />But alas it doesn't. A whole bunch of semi-emo teeny whining that's very much about everything and nothing at the same time. Vague enough to be catch-all without delving into specifics. Presumably to ensure all the 14 year olds who bought this would be able to mould the lyrics to suit their own perception of their situations. Still, perhaps it's churlish of me to labour the point as a sort of everymans lyrical bent is actually a handy talent for a band to have. And it's easy to see how this fairly simple screaming angst centred on feelings of loss and alienation struck a chord with it's target audience.<br /><br />A forgiving three stars given how the band beats you over the head with a one dimensional emotional attack on almost the same topic for the whole album (and musically it's a few nifty touches by bassist Jeph Howard that are just about the only memorable moves). The Used - as of this early album at least their report card reads \\"must do better\\"iving three stars given how the band beats you over the head with a one dimensional emotional attack on almost the same topic for the whole album (and musically it's a few nifty touches by bassist Jeph Howard that are just about the only memorable moves).

B00000DRWB|5.0|Other than rockin' and partyin', Aerosmith only cares about fourteen things, and all fourteen can be found on the female anatomy. These guys aren't trying to save the world; they're just playing hard and horny rock n' roll. They're loud, they're audacious, and they rock like their lives depend on it. In a street fight, you use every dirty trick you know because it's either his a** or yours. And that's pretty much the way Aerosmith plays rock n' roll. They pull out all the stops, use every trick in the book, throw everything they've got at you, and more. That's just fine with me!<br /><br />Aerosmith's third album, Toys In The Attic (1975), is a rock classic and one of their best. It includes their hit singles Walk This Way and Sweet Emotion. Also here are the wide open rockers Toys In The Attic and Round And Round. Uncle Salty sounds sort of like Aerosmith meets The Beatles, and Adam's Apple rocks with slide guitar and sexual innuendo (\\"She ate it, never knowing wrong from right\\"). Then there's the hilarious rock-swing boogie of Big Ten Inch. No More, No More is a slow/fast rocker that sounds like it would have fit just as well on their Get Your Wings album. The album closes with the emotional ballad, You see Me Crying, complete with orchestration. Like all of Aerosmith's power ballads, it really brings home the goods.<br /><br />Of course, every Aerosmith fan knows Toys In The Attic is essential. If you're just starting to get into Aerosmith, this is a good place to start if you want more than a compilation.
B00005YU1O|2.0|This movie takes the risk and gets silly at times.  It is a series of monologues (Or an alternative description would be 'ramblings').  There is not, however, anything deep or eye-opening about it.  Rather just observations from an 'altered' state of mind.  As a whole, it comes off as pretentious.  The rotoscoping technique used is different but not terribly inventive or original.  I wasn't impressed but it was a good effort.
0316166685|5.0|Have you ever watched the news and there was a case of a missing child? Do you ever think about what the family might be feeling? In this book, it gets down and personal with a family who is going through a kidnapping of their little girl. <br /> This book probably took place in the 1990's to 2000's. Suzie, the little girl who is kidnapped and never found again, is the main character. She's also the one who's telling the story. Lindsey, Suzie's older sister, is important along with her mom; Abigail, her dad; Jack, and her little brother; Buckley. Throughout the whole book they're trying to find out who the person is behind Suzie's kidnap and murder, even though Jack was positive that it was this old man named George Harvey. Towards the end, something weird happens between Suzie and two of her (well, used to be) friends. <br /> I had a lot of favorite parts from the book, but one part that I really enjoyed was when Ruth and Suzie somehow switched bodies. It allowed Suzie to come back down to earth for awhile, while Ruth was in Suzie's form, up in heaven watching down on everyone. <br /> The main idea or theme in this book might be to never lose hope. If you believe something, give it your all to find out. If something came up, like this murder for example, don't just give up, even when you feel the need to. Get down to the bottom of it. Another message that the author might've been trying to send out is that this kind of thing can happen to anyone. Suzie was an average girl with a normal family. Yet it still happened. <br /> I enjoyed this book, even though some part were really sad and depressing. It might even make you cry. I recommend this book to anyone who can get through a long story like this one. <br />

B000EGFVQS|4.0|What would you do if you daughter was murdered and the police just gave up on the case?  Never knowing who killed her or what even happened.  How would you live?  This is what Susie Salmon sees looking down at the world from heaven.  She sits in her gazebo and watches her family get torn apart by the unspoken silence of her death.  She also watches the man who killed her trying to cover up his evidence that he has left behind. <br /> <br /> <br />Alice Sebolds The Lovely Bones tells the story of a 14 year old girl living in the 1970's who gets raped and then murdered in her suburban neighborhood.  It is told through Susie Salmons words with her perspective on how things go one after her death.  She watches he mom wish things were back to the old times.  Her dad suffer and pull away from the family.  She hears her old school calling her sister \\"the dead girl's sister\\", and her brother try to find out what \\"Susie is gone\\" really means. <br /> <br /> <br />My favorite parts in this book would most definitely be when Susie goes back to the past to show the reader how her life use to be.  And then show the present life and all the changes that go on.  How Unhappy and quite her family becomes.   <br />I would say the theme of this book is that no matter how hard it is, life does go on after a death.  This book shows that after death it is hard to bounce back but eventually it will. <br /> <br /> <br />I would give this book four stars.  The whole time I was reading it I wanted to keep on reading.  I wanted to see it the police finally catch the killer or if her brother realized the meaning of \\"gone\\".  I would recommend this book to any person from high school up because it is really detailed in the rape and murder scenes.  You just have to be really mature about it. <br />  <br />
B00005ONMO|3.0|Usually I go into detail when reviewing a complete Mahler cycle, but I have found Sinopoli's too discouraging to criticize blow by blow. I bought these performances as they came out, and some were my first digital versions. As such, DG has not done the best job sonically; quite a few of the recordings sound fuzzy, thick, and  distant. In addition, the Philharmonia of that era (mid-80s to the late 90s) was a shadow of its former glorious self, and the execution cannot compare with the best orchestras. If you want to stay in London for Mahler, Tennstedt's bargain cycle on EMI with the London Phil. is better all around.<br /><br />The last lingering interest for me is Sinopoli's conducting, and being as original as he was, there are quite a few highlights. By general consensus the best performance here is the Eighth, and the Seventh is quite fine as well. I would single those out as touchstones for buying the entire set. But the Ninth strikes me as a failure, lacking drama and conviciton, and the Third, which should have been great, is ordinary. Some critics rave about Sinopoli's Fifth, but no one seems to have much enthusiasm for any other reading.<br /><br />The most intriguing things hwere are the fillers. Birgitte Fassbaender gives a gruly great performance of the Lider eines fahrenden Gesellen, blazing and risky and therefore unforgettable. Almost as good, if slightly overripe, is Bryn Terfel in an anguished and very slow Kindertotenlieder; even if it is too fervent, Terfel's account is one of the best male versions ever recorded. finally, there are six songs from Mahler's early career sung very well by Bernd Weikl. He isn't imaginative enough, but Sinopoli's accompaniments are among the most sparkling I've ever heard. Still, you don't buy 15 CDs to hear the fillers.  As for Sinopoli's Das Lied von der Erde, it's a middling good reading that lacks great interpretations from the two soloists, and in this work great singing is essential.<br /><br />In aum, I can't give you a definitive response, but being fairly familiar with six of these performances, including the 2nd, 4th, and 6th, my reaction is lukewarm to the cycle as a whole.esponse, but being fairly familiar with six of these performances, including the 2nd, 4th, and 6th, my reaction is lukewarm to the cycle as a whole.
0061139378|4.0|Coraline is a little girl about 7 or 8 years old. She loves to go exploring, Coraline gets bored very quickly and her parents cant play with her because they are always busy doing something else, so one day she asks her parents what she could do, she wanted to go outside but it was raining and her parents didn't want her to go outside, then they said to watch a movie, play with her toys, read, well Coraline then watched all the movies in the house, but she didn't want to play with her toys.<br /><br />Coraline walked over to her dad and asked If he would play with her but he was on the computer working then he gave  her something to do, he asked her to count all of the windows and the doors in the house, so she did but then she came to a room with a door in the corner she went to go open It but to her surprise the door was locked, so she went to find her mom who was on the kitchen, then she asked her mother were is the key to the art room.<br /><br /> Coralines mother got the key that was hanging in the kitchen then they both walked into the art room Coralines mother unlocked the door and opened it but there was nothing on the other side of the door, nothing but a brick wall, but later on when Coralines parents aren't around Coraline unlocks the door and is surprised to see what's really behind that what's on the other side she's seen it before.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am sure the details have all been listed-so I will say this: Get some nice headphones that accent the bass, and enjoy this fantastic collection.  Thank god, \\"the suits\\" that ran these boys, coughed up the money, time and energy to get the band on 16mm film. The collection of clips and interviews add to the treasures. This is the power music, that Hendrix and Cream started, but couldn't maintain. Indeed, LZ couldn't maintain it-so the early video when they were raw and hungry-and not yet drugged to numbness-is a real treat!     Also the film/sound technology was just changing in the 60's to capture the music of 60's and early 70's. What a pity, we don't have more color celluloid and 1/4 audio sync tape of Cream, Jimi, the Beatles, Motown.    With the advent of high speed Kodak 16mm film, pilotone synched Nagra 1/4\\" tape recorders, Eclair NPR 16mm handheld cameras, along with the competing Arriflexes from Germany, sync cables, good labs, good mics, transfers and mixes all to end up in its own personal joy, on your DVD platter.     This is music that sounds GOOD loud and rich. So rather than terrify your neighbors-get some headphones with a good bass sound, and crank it.  I heard on a radio talk show, that Plant really thought the early Live at the Royal Albert Hall performance-captured the band at a good musical stage. (considering the sloppy drugged-out future and ultimate demise)    I also heard that US Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice, has studied classical music, and in the morning she enjoys listening to Led Zepellin and Cream. I think Condi, would enjoy this DVD. Bluesy Les Paul solos added with jazz improv free form lead guitar especially on the live slow blues tracks; hard driving rock; eclectic Persian and World music motifs-Classical Bach themes, abit of Celtic folk-traditional themes: it is all electrified and in good form with a lyrical, passionate lead singer who is man enough to get out of the way at times and let the players-have some fun on their own.Long overdue-grab it now!
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  Grace Kelly is so beautiful and elegant in this movie.  It has a great plot and a Hitchcock suprise ending.  Cary Grant is also wondeful and the photography along the beatiful French Riviera is outstanding.  I highly recommend this film.
0393327655|5.0|This book is an intellectual kick in the head to those of us raised with religion.  If you were raised with God in your life, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  It will make you think and if you don't read it you will soon be dealing with people quoting it as they attack your way of life.<br /><br />Sam Harris is a gifted writer with something important to say.  Whether you agree with him or not, if you don't read this book you may miss out on the national conversation of the next twenty years.  This is what we will all be talking about soon.<br /><br />Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 put the war on terrorism in an entirely new light.

B000FP2Z0S|4.0|You know, I absolutely can't stand punk music.  To me, it's the most unoriginal genre of music ever- each and every punk band sounds exactly the same to me.  Which is why it surprises me to no end that I really like Rise Against.  The Sufferer and the Witness was my first foray into Rise Against's world and I must say I'm interested in finding out more about their other works.<br /><br />To me, all the songs are very good, but there are only a few truly standout tracks: their first single from TSatW, Ready to Fall, Drones, Chamber the Cartridge, and my personal favorite from the album- Roadside.<br /><br />All I have to say is that if more bands sounded like Rise Against, I might not have such a vendetta against the genre.  Enjoy- I sure did.

B0000AUHQT|1.0|It reached by even three though only one was ordered.  <br />The order for the cancellation was disregarded.  <br />It resents it very much.  <br />It wants it according to returned goods.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|Era Vulgaris isn't too bad, but pales in comparison to the self titled album, Rated R, and Songs for the Deaf. While I do like the album, I would have to rank it last when ranking their 5 major albums.    For those of you who got into QOTSA during the Songs for the Deaf album, go check out Rated R and the self titled album if you haven't already.    You can currently hear this album for free on the band's official web page.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I'm not a die hard heavy prog fan,but, I have been getting into the sound of Dream Theater over the last few years. I was anxious for this disc and I am not disappointed.They exhibit a difference from song to song which I cant find on some bands releases. I love Forsaken. I did not find the album discontinuous at all. Very well done. A band that can be proud of the work they have done without being pretentious, this is not self indulgent resting on your laurels tripe. Maybe I like it because I am so tortured but really have it pretty good. Poor pitiful me. Maybe I have been Forsaken...
1594489505|5.0|I didn't know if I could expect anything as good as \\"The Kite Runner,\\" but \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was perhaps better.  The story is riveting and the characters are deep and intriguing-- Hosseini must have interviewed many women to have his level of understanding.  Not only is the book outstanding as a novel, it provides a detailed account of Afghanistan's turmoil that can only help you to sympathize and understand the nation's history.  Overall a highly recommended read.
0380789035|5.0|At the time of this writing there are 610 reviews...so I'll keep it short and get my 5 star vote in.  I loved this book...rich in mythology and imagery.  The journey was the best part!  LOVED it.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Before I rate this album, I have to collectively address those who have already left reviews:  <br />  <br />First of all, why does every Dream Theater fan qualify their reviews by first stating how long they have been a \\"fan of\\" or \\"listening to\\" the band?  Does this give you the credentials or expertise to write a review, of which a newer listener is just not capable of writing?  I am tired of reading, \\"I have been a fan since 1992's Images and Words...,\\" \\"I have been listening to Dream Theater since When Dream and Day Unite...,\\" \\"I first heard Dream Theater back when they were still called Majesty...,\\" \\"I knew John Petrucci in high school...,\\" \\"I gave was there when Mike Portnoy was born.  I helped in the delivery room...,\\" ad nauseum.  We get it.  You have been listening for a very long time and we do not care.  I have been driving a Volkswagen Jetta for 5 years but it does not make me an expert in cars, Volkswagens, Jettas or driving in general.  The fact that you have been listening to Dream Theater for 20 years simply confirms that you know how to use a music player and you have functioning ears.  Congratulations.  We are all impressed.  <br />  <br />Secondly, stop wasting our time by listing the members of the band and their amazing superpowers.  By this point, I think you can safely assume that anyone that has purchased or is considering purchasing an album by Dream Theater not only knows each member of the band, but can probably tell you when they were born, the names of their family members and their favorite breakfast cereals.  I do not need to read such overkill statements as \\"...the amazing keyboard skills of Jordan Rudess, which he acquired at the age of 9 while studying at Julliard, come to full fruition during the extended solo of track....\\"  Thank you for pointing out that the band members are all amazing and they have names.  We all have access to wikipedia.org and dreamtheater.net, should we need this pertinent background information.  <br />  <br />Lastly, to those of you who consistently write that Dream Theater's \\"latest album sounds like a rehashing\\" of their previous efforts, guess what?  That is intentional!  For being fans since 1992 or 1989, you sure do not catch on very quickly.  The band openly admits that they constantly weave previous musical themes into their new songs.  It is part of their modus operandi.  There will always be some remnants of songs past that will make their way into new material, so quit making such banal and ignorant observations.  <br />  <br />WIth that said, I will give a brief review of this album, although I do not know if I have the proper qualifications.  After all, I have only been listening to them since 2001.  My judgment of music has not yet fully matured.  For instance, I cannot tell you that this album is mediocre, because I do not recall watching the video for \\"Pull Me Under\\" while it was in rotation on MTV.  But guess what folks?  It is mediocre.  There are certainly great moments, but they are so often punctuated with moments of awkwardness and incredible cheesiness.  Do not get me wrong; despite what I stated above, I really enjoy Dream Theater.  I think many of their songs and albums are truly inspiring and nothing short of genius, but that does not automatically give them a free pass to write crap.  \\"Dark master?\\"  Were those really the best lyrics they could come up with?  <br />  <br />I do agree with many of the reviews, in which they state the bass and keyboards are lost in the mix.  Look, I am an uber nerd/fan when it comes to John Petrucci's incendiary playing, but it sounds like there is only a guitarist and drummer in this band.  Occasionally, some nice piano melodies are heard, and, for better or worse, vocals cut through, but there is such a lack of balance, which is a shame because the bass lines are really nice.  <br />  <br />The bottom line is, Dream Theater has produced better material in the past.  The good news is that this band will likely continue writing music for another 20 years.  Perhaps, by then, I will be more qualified to write a decent review.
B000002UV9|5.0|With this album, Queensryche truly went for broke. Gone were the concepts and fantasy themes of previous releases, but also gone was the more pointed social commentary of previous album, Operation Mindcrime, for a more subtle topical exploration, still political but more nuanced (as on the song \\"Resistance\\").<br /><br />Now to digress, at the time I disliked the album. I thought it was Queensryche's equivalent to the more refined approach of such albums as Metallica's \\"Black Album\\" or Megadeth's \\"Countdown to Extinction\\".<br /><br />17 years on (!) I have realized that the album not only succeeds on all the levels the Ryche's previous albums had, but perhaps more.<br /><br />Musically, the album seems almost to be a \\"lost album\\" between RFO and Mindcrime, the reason saying this is that in between the progressive strains of Rage but also the more refined approach from the more \\"accessible\\" songs on Mindcrime (\\"I Don't Believe in Love, etc).<br /><br />The album starts on a high note (Best I Can) and doesn't let up.<br /><br />Anybody Listening is another highlight, but the whole album is full of killer hooks, great solos, and excellent progressive strains only rivalled by those of a band such as Rush.<br /><br />The airey Floyd influence of main songwriter Chris Degarmo can be felt on many of the better tracks, including the overplayed but still excellent \\"Silent Lucidity\\".<br /><br />In conclusion, me realizing with age that the band didn't set out to make an overtly commercial release but just happened to stumble upon the commercial success, doing what they did best before this one. There are no songs that wouldn't neccesarily be on previous releases, its just that the band hit paydirt with Silent Lucidity  and Jet City Woman (etc), and there were moments of more commercial potential on every album before this.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I respect where they're at even though it could be a heavier album like they've been doing. The Beatles had their own phases during their stint so why can't the bands of today do the same - Korn has done it. I also wish it had been a double-lp. I still like their previous two main albums better but this one is decent enough to keep in my rotation. Hopefully their next album is heavier though & that there will be one despite the previous rumours. Keep in mind they tour a lot so an album for them nowadays must be like a celebratory type atmosphere when they're in the studio. peace
B00000DGUG|5.0|I just pulled out this album after putting away Alanis for a long time.  Infectious, thoughtful, and underrated are words that come to mind.  Gone are the whiny accusations of Jagged Little Pill, replaced by melodic introspection.  Among the best tracks: the life affirming \\"Joining You,\\" the contrite \\"Are You Still Mad,\\" the melacholy \\"That I Would Be Good,\\" and the humble \\"Thank U.\\"  Overall, a lovely and meditative album for Alanis.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Absolutely stunning.  I watched this series on the Discovery channel and after purchasing the HD DVD I wish I would have waited. The footage and color is amazing. The only disappointment I had was not having Sigourney Weaver as the narator. I recommend this to anyone who is thinking of making the purchase.
0141301066|5.0|All of Roald Dahl's key works contain common features that make his books special and unique. Apart from gripping tales of the unexpected, the key reason for their appeal is in the treatment of the baddies in the story. However, Dahl counters this rollicking, uproarious and wicked humour with deep relationships between the young protagonist and a sensible grown-up in his social circle. This theme features throughout most if not all his works, and was first introduced when he wrote [[ASIN:0141301147 Danny, the Champion of the World (Puffin Novels)]], maturing when Dahl wrote [[ASIN:0141301058 The BFG]], [[ASIN:0141301104 The Witches (Puffin Novels)]]and Matilda.<br /><br />On the surface, Matilda may be a gripping yarn that revolves around Matilda's environment of Crunchem Hall Primary School and the domain of fearsome Miss Trunchbull, arguably the most revolting villain that Dahl ever created. This harks back to his own dark days as a student. As with all his books, Dahl keeps his audience of young readers in mind. Not only is his style easily accessible and lively, but he sides with his young audience through his writing, He draws the characters of Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's repulsive parents such that they convey revolting personas and you wouldn't want to befriend them. Dahl particularly draws the character of the Trunchbul effectively such that we readers can really feel her as a \\"holy terror that frightend the life out of the pupils and teachers alike\\". I admit that this book dwells a little too much on the Trunchbull's torturous punishments, but these only serve to make the Trunchbull more real. A signature twist to make this a tale of the unexpected is when Miss Honey reveals that Matilda's father was a crook who sold stolen cars.<br /><br />However, the understated core of the book should be Matilda herself and her relationship with Miss Honey. His portrayal of this relationship offers distinct echoes of Danny's relationship with his father in Danny the Champion of the World. From the moment that Dahl first introduces us to Matilda's maturity, we know that we are getting to know an extraordinary little girl. In spite of her sensitive and brilliant mind, she is a  character who engages our sympathies. Matilda always strives to break free of the thrall of her crooked family, especially her father, who acts and talks like a gangster towards her. Matilda strikes up an acquaintence with Miss Honey and quickly learns of Miss Honey's situation. She is then able to do things in her power to help her and restore her rightful claim to her father's inheritance. This may appear to be self-interest on Matilda's part, but sshe does this because she shows a genuine sympathy to Miss Honey's plight.<br /><br />In short, this swansong in Dahl's long children's novels stands as an undisputed masterwork and demonstrates the maturity in Dahl's children's writing. It's truly a work that shows Dahl at the top of his game, at the pinnacle of his writing career, and sums up all that his children's writing has come to stand for. (Apparently he spent 20 years writing this book.) Although I could have done with less coverage of the Trunchbull's cruelty, this book is still an undisputed Dahl classic that deserves to be up there with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The BFG.
B000H5TH1Q|3.0|Brian De Palma is a director who likes to tear down the wall between fantasy and reality. \\"Body Double\\" his 1984 Hitchcock homage to films like \\"Rear Window\\" is a classic example.<br /><br /> \\"Body Double\\" starts off with a scene at a graveyard where a vampire is about to come out of his casket, all of sudden the vampire freezes and we hear \\"cut\\"! It was all a scene from a movie. This scene reminds of a similar moment in De Palma's 1981 film \\"Blow Out\\" his homage to Antonioni and Coppola and their respective films \\"Blow-Up\\" and \\"The Conversation\\". There we thought we are about to witness a murder when we see it is all a scene from a slasher film John Travolta is working on.<br /><br /> Right from the opening scene \\"Body Double\\" is establishing the idea, don't trust your eyes. Nothing is what it seems to be. After the first scene, we see the credit \\"produced and directed by Brian De Palma\\" in the background we see a wide open field. It looks like the old west when suddenly the background is moved, it was a movie prop. Once again De Palma is catching us off guard. You have to be on your toes.<br /><br /> The film follows Jake Sully (Craig Wasson) a struggling actor who finds himself in \\"B\\" or independent films. He's working though, so no need to complain. That is until he finds out his wife is having an affair and now must find his own place and try to restart his life and deal with the fact we just lost his part as the vampire in the movie he was working on due to his claustrophobia and his inability to get inside the casket.<br /><br /> As luck would have it he keeps running into Sam Bouchard (Gregg Henry), another struggling actor, each of whom have a common friend. The two seem to keep going to the same auditions. Bouchard though has be offered a part in Noel Coward's \\"Private Lives\\" and needs someone to housesit an apartment he originally was watching. Now, since Sully needs a place, Sam thinks Sully would be perfect for the job. And as an added bonus, Sully's neighbor is a sexy brunette (aren't they all?) who like clockwork goes into a sexy striptease, with the shades open (some guys have all the luck!). Sully doesn't need much convincing and agrees to watch the apartment.<br /><br /> Without giving too much away, Sully finds himself caught in the middle of a murder. The next door neighbor has been killed. But was it really her or just a body double? Can Sully trust his eyes. Is what he is seeing the truth?<br /><br /> De Palma does a lot of things right in this film, but the few missteps he takes really hurts the film from being better. Most of De Palma's knock-off Hitchcock films have a \\"B\\" level quality to them in my opinion, despite the fact I may enjoy some of them. \\"Body Double\\" has some bad dialogue and shaky acting. Nothing seems real. These aren't real characters we are watching. They are movie characters, plots devices.<br /><br /> But the film's strenght is in the way De Palma nicely holds the film together. It moves along at a nice pace and there are some nice suspenseful moments. Not many, but a few.<br /><br /> Where the film comes apart in my opinion is at the end. De Palma is playing too many tricks on us. Is what we are seeing real or part of a movie? We keep switching back and forth to the point where I was completely confused. Still something about the film leads me to like it. In a way you can compare the film to a magic act. You know the magician is playing tricks before our eyes. There is smoke and mirrors involved yet we go along with the show. We don't question anything, that is half the fun. The same can be said for \\"Body Double\\". Much of it may not make much sense, we know we are being manipulated yet we go along. And when De Palma and cast are putting on such a good show for us what else can we do but sit back, relax and enjoy the show!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: De Palma's homage to Hitchcock films such as \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" isn't quite in the same league as those other films but it is alot of fun to watch.lot of fun to watch.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Excellent movie now a classic never get sick of watching, a must have for all movie buffs !
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Nothing groundbreaking here....\\"Systematic Chaos\\" sounds like a rushed production. The usuall excellent musicianship is still present, but there are NO memorable songs. JP is fast,but offers none of his trademark melodic solos. DT still has yet to produce the quality and intensity of \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" with their last few outings. Production is excellent , though.
078401115X|2.0|I bought this movie for two reasons. Robert de niro and its excellent reviews. But in the entire movie Robert de niro has only 3 or 4 appearances which was very disappointing. Beside that i think may be the movie was one of its kind back then, but now there are lot better vodoo movies than Angel Heart. Two stars for Mickey Rourke. He is awesome. Rent it but don't buy it.
B00005JPKE|4.0|Too often we focus our hatred and anger on an entire people, when what we really hate is something that was precipitated by their government. We rarely see the people on the \\"other side\\" who are caught up in the situation and used as weapons.  This gives us the opportunity to know the people for what they are; people with feelings and hopes and fears who do not necessarily hate us.  It gives us the opportunity to choose to not hate the weapon, but hate the ideas and ideologies behind the person who wields the weapon.
B000MZHW40|5.0|The second star turn for Leonardo di Caprio in a year, \\"Blood Diamond\\" tells a story of Africa--not the wild beauty that comes to mind, but blood and violence, war and arms, greed and manipulation.  Danny Archer is a smuggler. Diamonds are the currrency of war, and Archer moves them from Sierra Leone, where diamond trade is supposedly banned to avoid fueling internal conflicts, to neighboring Liberia for export. Everyone knows few diamonds are found in Liberia, but all choose to ignore that inconvenient fact. In the service of the trade, rebels capture their own people and make them slaves,  panning for stones in shallow streams.  <br /> <br /> <br />But the child soldiers of Africa are the real story of this film. Boys are captured from villages by rebels and in the best totalitarian style brainwashed and ordered to commit unspeakable crimes. Those who resist receive the same punishments the European powers and American slave traders used so effectively for so long.  Everything familiar is stripped away, and the indoctrination is so complete we see a child contemplating killing his own father. The more things change. . . . . <br /> <br />This a tough movie, and we almost stopped watching because of the violence at the beginning. But it was worth it--this movie will haunt you for a while. <br />
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I can't decide which Buble CD is my favorite! This one is definitely tops right now, and he's done another wonderful job with these remakes of great old standards. If you love the songs of the past, with Buble's signature crooning, try this one. He gives the songs a sexy, yet soft twist of his own.
0786838655|5.0|When I was in college, I was required to take certain courses that were not included in my major, which was English.  I tended to go with the easy stuff; art, geography, music appreciation, etc.  One such class was mythology.  I went into it expecting something kind of boring.  I wasn't a fool, we read Edith Wharton's mythology in high school, and I was bored stuff.  I wasn't expecting much better from the college course.<br /><br />Boy, was I in for a surprise.  I breezed through with an A and a new appreciate for Greek, Roman and Norse gods.  The battles!  The lust!  The murder, love, betrayal, torture, death!!  Mythology had it all!  And then some!<br /><br />So, imagine my delight, when I picked up with little gem. Slightly reminiscent of Harry Potter; our hero, Percy Jackson, has been \\"special\\" all his life without knowing why.  Always causing problems, labeled a troubled youth and sent away to boarding school, Percy is coming into his 12th year and he finally discovers just why he is special.  His father was a god.  Now, caught between bickering gods and fleeing monsters, Percy must recover something very special, and get to know himself and his father along the way.  Not to mention meeting quite a few gods and goddesses who would like to send him on a one way trip to Hades.<br /><br />Percy was, in my mind, a great, true character.  He acted just like a 12 year old.  Obnoxious.  Confused.  A little geeky.  Adored his mother.  Hated his stepdad.  Intensely loyal to his friends.  And, unlike another book I read of a similar subject that I will not mention here because I have to review it for Estella, the gods and goddesses acted exactly in the way I expected them too.  Petty, self-absorbed, violent.  The writing was tight, fast-paced and exciting.  It all came together for a very enjoyable read.  I can't wait to get the next in this series.
B000089CJI|5.0|One of the best albums I own. I've listened to it a thousand times and it just keeps getting better and better. I'm forever grateful to the person who introduced me to the band.
0375831002|5.0|Best book I've read in the past year, or even more.  Creative, words flow so well, touching story.  One you will want to share with everyone you know.  Enjoy
1594489505|4.0|I was not disappointed in this eagerly awaited novel. The story made me feel very sad at times but it is one that should be told. Life with rules and values dictated by the Taliban is oppression and should remind us of the value of separation of church and state. What a loathsome character Rasheed is and, yet, his presence is what allowed the deep friendship between Mariam and Laila to grow. As in Kite Runner, tough decisions are made but the reader understands the compelling, human reasons for the characters making them. Hosseini has a magical way of creating enough tension to make the reader squirm only to come back and paint a picture of tenderness and hope. As long as this gifted writer keeps writing, this reader will keep reading.
0316067598|5.0|This book takes you inside the Navy SEALs training program in Coronado. You are with Marcus Luttrell throughout BUD/S and Hell Week. You fly with him and his teammates in a C-130 to the Hindu Kush, where the hunt begins for bin Laden's right-hand man. But then it all goes terribly wrong, up there in the mountains of Afghanistan. <br /> <br />This book, written by Patrick Robinson, reads like a fast-paced thriller, told in Marcus's understated voice. It is a rivetting, important, sad story of lost friends, valor, courage and the intricacies of modern war. It is an important book, destined to become an American classic.

1594489505|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like this book as much as The Kite Runner (5 star), and bottome line, I prefer The Kite Runner over this novel.  But the story is still very compelling, nonetheless. I actually give it 4 1/2 stars.  And I will continue to read Khaled Hossini's future novels.<br /><br />The story builds slowly but steadily for the first half of the novel.  It starts with Mariam's life, then switches to Laila's.  At first, I didn't get a FULL sense of how hard Mariam's life was with Rasheed, as we were left to imagine a lot for ourselves.  Their wasn't a lot of detail or instances of the abuse she suffered, but you knew it was there. That could be either a good or a bad thing, depending how you look at it.  Then we go through Laila's somewhat happy childhood.  When Laila, through unfortunate circumstances, marries Rasheed, we know her life will never be the same but understand the choice she made.  Again, the story seems to build slowly with few instances of the abusive life she lives.  But it is within these sparse instances that we get a glimpse of the developing relationship between Mariam & Laila.  I will have to admit, that at first I didn't think I cared to deeply for the characters in the story.<br /><br />It wasn't until the birth scene of Laila's son, Zalmai, that you started to get a good sense of how deep Mariam & Laila's relationship had become..... And how much more I cared for these characters.  This is where the story starts to take real shape.<br /><br />From this point, you are gripped to read on.  Much like in The Kite Runner, you are moved, you feel, you weep for its strength (or weakness) of character which was so delicately laid down before.  HERE you get a very good sense of Rasheed's brutality, and the women's suffering and enduring.  The apex of the novel is reached 9/10ths of the way through the story.  What is left, is the aftermath.  Like The Kite Runner, it is also bittersweet.<br /><br />It is very difficult to follow such a hugely popular debut novel like The Kite Runner.  For 2 years, I waited patiently for this 2nd one.  I am NOT disappointed.  It is a good story worth it's own weight.  And further more, I learned even MORE about Afghanistan history and turmoil then I did in The Kite Runner.  It was relevant to the story but not preachy.lt to follow such a hugely popular debut novel like The Kite Runner.  For 2 years, I waited patiently for this 2nd one.  I am NOT disappointed.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|There has never been a production like this one.  I had heard much about this before I purchased it (actually I purchased two - one for my parents and one for my husband) and everyone said that the series was excellent.  Watching these DVDs is like traveling to the far reaches of the earth with the most wonderful tour guides on earth.  The colors are so vibrant, the scenery amazing; the whole thing is breathtaking.  I think everyone should own a copy, and buy one for every special occasion.
0060989157|5.0|All I can say is im not a \\"reader\\". I barley did the summer reading in High School. This book is approx 350-375 pages. I could of finished it in a day or two. But I pased myself and in two weeks I was done. Incredible read! & I'm not planning on cutting my hair anytime soon!...Just Epic
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I went to the theater to see this movie, because the previews made it look so appealing.  About halfway through the movie, I knew I was going to buy it to watch again.  I love both actors and the unexpected twist of two people living separated by two years added another dimension.  I wanted all the loose ends to be tied up and a clearcut explanation for why they could communicate (I like everything spelled out - not open to interpretation) but I still enjoyed every minute.  If you are a romantic, you will probably like this story.  Some great acting in it, too!
B000PTYP5C|5.0|The title pretty much sums up the general form of this album. It's somewhat like an amalgamation of Train of thought and Octavarium in the sense that it's heavy yet still very progressive. It's hard to say what die hard fans of the band will think, except that I'm one of those and I love it. To me, it feels like a much more \\"organic\\" experience than anything they've done since maybe \\"Scenes From a Memory\\".<br /><br />The only minor hiccup in the whole thing is track 5, \\"Repentance\\". At over 10 minutes, you might think you're in for a progrock tour de force. Not so. You're in for 10 boring minutes of a repetitive melodic theme with some uninspired singing and talking over it and about 1 minute of beautiful Petrucci soloing. Not that it's a bad song... it's just way too long for what it offers us (the solo smack dab in the middle), and I expect better from Dream Theater. I have no complaints about the rest of this album, whatsoever- it wowed me from beginning to end.<br /><br />4.5 * with that in mind. I heartily recommend this to any prog fan, any rock fan, any metal fan, any DT fan. Great stuff!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is a great movie that was inspired by one of the most decisive battles during the Civil War. Ronald Maxwell, the director, hired a historain, James McPherson so help him in making sure the battle scenes were as true as they actually happened in 1863. Gettysburg has three days of fighting along with events that led up to the war making it very gory and action-packed. There is alot of death in this movie but since Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest battles with 50,000 American casualties, the amount of death in the movie is appropriate.  <br />The first day of fighting consists of Buford trying to maintain his position in Gettysburg to make sure that the Union army has the best land position. The second day of fighting is centrally located at Cemetery Hill, Little Round Top, and Culp's Hill. The third and final day at Gettysburg consisted of one of the most famous battles at Gettysburg: Pickett's Charge. This is the day that Lee realizes that he has to retreat due to too many Confederate losses.  <br />This movie is, historically, very correct. The locations of the battles are historicall accurate along with the general's names. Mostly everything in this movie was, in McPherson's eyes, historically accurate. One can learn alot about the Civil War by watching this movie because it shows how the soldiers felt and lived and the effects of war on them. It also talks about past and upcoming issues in the war. This was a great historical movie but also very entertaining and i would recommend it to anybody that was interested, or wants to become knowledgable about the Civil War.
B000P5FF46|5.0|I'm very impressed with this album. It's by far one of the best Scorpions album. I thought it was great how they teamed up with American producer Desmond Child to create this masterpiece. Desmond's work has really shown off here. This is no rehash of Scorpions faves, this is a real NEW album. Different sound for the Scorpions. Modern rock+Classic rock. That's how it sounds. I recommend this to any music fan. It's a shame it's not released domestically here in the US, though, that way the Scorpions' record sales with rocket.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I must say I did not have very high expectations for this latest version of Jane Eyre.  How many times has it been done?  But, I will say I am proud to own this video and enjoyed every minute of it.  I think it compares to Wives and Daughters, and is certainly one of the better BBC productions out there.  Where many of the other versions are heavy, this one is actually funny in some places! Be prepared to be impressed.  They took something wrote and made it into something wonderful.<br /><br />As an aside, I have seen some commentary on the \\"inappropriate\\" scene in which the insane wife is seen in a compromising position with another man.  I think it is important to remember that Bronte was not writing a children's novel.  This is indeed a grown up story, ultimately about a man who wishes to have an affair with another woman because his circumstances are a touch problematic, i.e. his wife is mad.  Bronte was not interested in the fairy tale of the typical Austen romance.  She wrote about the real interactions between men and women, and about how sometimes decisions are made for the wrong reasons, and ultimately how love can be redemptive.  This scene is very brief and not that \\"inappropriate\\" when you take into consideration the story as a whole.  Please don't let it deter you from enjoying this film and sharing it with your family.
B000KC8O3S|2.0|Let me begin by stating that I really wanted to give this CD a better review.  Unfortunately, while I give high marks to Murray Gold and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales for some fine performances, this is the most poorly mixed orchestral album I've heard in years.  Every track shows evidence of aggressive compression and normalization (to the point where clipping was evident on some sound systems), and the final track is easily the most distorted professional studio recording I've ever heard.  Probably good enough for a soundtrack but not nearly up to par for an album.  Worth a listen for Doctor Who fans, but it could have been so much better.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums Megadeth has released so far.  I rank it up there with Countdown to Extinction.  Mustaine is on top of things, and so far he is keeping the soul of metal alive.  Rock on!!! \m/
B0000060NH|5.0|Yeah, the Amazon reviewer is a moron.  I suggest you listen to this album.  And Amazon, who the f*** is this dope?  He never listened to the record.  Hope he didn't get paid, since he's a fraud.  This is just as good as the other albums he recommends.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Product arrived in good shape and was a joy to listen to. <br /> <br />Martin Wartenberg
B000002JPA|5.0|It was hard enough to get any airplay on the rock and alternative radio stations in the early 90's unless you were Pearl Jam, Nirvana, or the like.  Dream Theater managed to do it with an eight minute epic in Pull Me Under, what a fantastic song.  The rest of the album isn't too shaby either, a definite recommendation for any rock fan.
B000001DQG|4.0|Elton John's \\"Caribou\\" is the fallback from the brilliant double album \\"[[ASIN:B000001DQI Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]].\\" It is also Elton John at his most playful and least serious. The problem then, it Elton and Bernie Taupin were so willing to take potshots at their own standing - like \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\" - that \\"Caribou's\\" highs were undone by the lows. There wasn't any idea too glitzy or silly that it wasn't worth packing into the \\"Caribou\\" grooves. Elton and Bernie threw it all to the wall and watched what stuck. More than any other album (even GBYBR), \\"Caribou\\" is the soundtrack to Elton John of crazy glasses and kooky costumes.<br /><br />Ah, but when Elton John was at his peak... His Rolling Stones homage, \\"The Bitch Is Back,\\" is glam rock at its most flamboyant. \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" has become a signature song, enough to have been a hit with Elton twice. Elton as a solo artist and Elton duetting with George Michael took this song into the number two and number one positions, respectively. The album's closer, the dramatic \\"Ticking,\\" is Elton at his most theatrical. As additions to Elton's 70's hit machine juggernaut, they prove his unstoppability as a superstar.<br /><br />However, when the material turns slight, well, it's bad cotton candy. The songs \\"Grimsby,\\" \\"Dixie Lilly\\" and \\"Solar Prestige\\" would have torpedoed a lesser artist. On \\"Caribou,\\" they merely make you wonder why Elton placed them between the brilliance. I can even deal with the spacey \\"I've Seen The Saucers\\" and \\"Stinker\\" (a retread of \\"[[ASIN:B000001EG2 Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player]]'s\\" \\"Midnight Creeper\\") over these three clinkers.<br /><br />Considering that \\"Caribou\\" was Elton's 4th number one album in a row and the precursor to his autobiographical masterpiece \\"[[ASIN:B000001EGA Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy]],\\" these quirks can be forgiven. After all, just for \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" and \\"Ticking,\\" \\"Caribou\\" is worth having. The remaster ups the ante by adding \\"Pinball Wizard\\" from Elton's star turn in \\"[[ASIN:B00000K3TV Tommy]]\\" and his Holiday single \\"Step Into Christmas.\\"y adding \\"Pinball Wizard\\" from Elton's star turn in \\"[[ASIN:B00000K3TV Tommy]]\\" and his Holiday single \\"Step Into Christmas.\\"
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is thoughtful, whimsical and just absolutely gorgeous. Hansard has the voice of an angel and  equivalent guitar-playing abilities. Beautiful songs, I can't wait to own the Once soundtrack. Could not recommend this film or Hansard's music more.
B000002KDS|5.0|Yeah, this album is great. However, there is one track that really stands out \\"Halo Of Flies\\", That song is a jaw-dropping, hard rocking masterpiece. High praise for the album. Especially \\"Halo Of Flies\\"

B000PTYP7U|5.0|omg its all good this album really shows how much they have grown up u can see it in the lyrics its a perfect blend of rock and punk and a little emo in here but even tho emo is not the fav it just adds to the flavor in this album  its a great album i luv it to death i recommend  it highly very highly
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Alot of Dream Theater fans take the release of each new album way too seriously. We all love Dream Theater's music cause it's complicated - sometimes hard to listen to and often hard to play. They are just 4 guys jamming who record every now and then and let people listen to it. They are not writing music for you personally. Reviews for Dream Theater albums are funny because nobody can dispute the fact that all the music is complex but everyone always finds a way to complain about something. Dream Theater have ensured that all fans should be happy forever by releasing every type of album possible:   1) When Dream and Day Unite: The \\"shitty production\\" album  2) Images and Words: The \\"untouchable take me on a journey\\" album  3) Awake: The \\"dark scary slick sounding\\" album  4) A Change of Seasons: The \\"longest song we ever wrote\\" album  4) Falling into Infinity: The \\"catchy album with 3 killer songs\\" album  5) Scenes From a Memory: The \\"concept album with sick odd timing\\" album  6) Six Degrees: The \\"layered orchestral\\" album  7) Train of Thought: The \\"Petrucci shred fest\\" album  8) Octavarium: The \\"we can still sort of write actual songs\\" album  9) Systematic Chaos: The \\"we can do whatever we want now\\" album      Enjoy the music and play your favourite album loud at all times!!!
B000PKG6TE|3.0|Already 13 reviews up for this album on the day of its release with everyone proclaiming it to be a dud. Listen up, folks. Any album worth its merit will take you at least a couple of months if not more to fully appreciate. Instant gratification when it comes to a new release is indicative of a short replay value.<br /><br />Yes, I bought it today and found it a bit odd and obviously different than their other albums and you could easily say that they jumped the shark with Lullabies and losing Nick. But the fact that it didn't immediately strike me as their best album gives me the glimmer that this one, like the last one, will get better over time. The only criticism I have is the fact that Josh recycled Make It Wit Chu from Desert Sessions, even though it's already appeared on their live CD.<br /><br />Long story short, if you're a Queens fan, you're gonna buy it anyway. In the meantime, just ignore the peanut gallery and keep listening to the CD.
B000P6R9RG|5.0|I'd read numerous reviews before Minutes to Midnight's release that scared me to death with statements like \\"the new CD was the worst ever, didn't sound like Linkin Park, the new producer ruined them,\\" blah, blah, blah. Man, I don't know where those people got their information because I've had this CD in my player for nearly a month now and I still cannot bring myself to skip any song. Honestly, I enjoy them all.    I've told everyone I know to go out and buy this album--even the people that aren't into Linkin Park. I know this CD is going to gain LP a lot of new fans. There's something for everyone--from hardcore (Given Up) to low key (Shadow of the Day) to kind of punk/80s (Bleed It Out). I must admit there are a few songs that break LP's self-made mold (check out In Between - Mike's vocal and the lyrics blew me away), but they've only improved in my opinion. That's what true artists do though--they continue to grow and look for new ways to express themselves.    The one thing I'm most happy about is the fact that their lyrics are as strong as ever. After listening to how wicked these guys sounded when Hybrid Theory first came out (I can still remember listening to The Blitz and hearing Chester's roar on One Step Closer for the first time), the lyrics are what really hooked me. All the lyrics seem tailored to my life--any mood I'm in, there's a LP song that speaks to my heart and expresses my soul. So, thank you guys for putting out another great album. I don't know how y'all do it, but I can't wait for the next one!    P.S. By the way, this special edition, or whatever you wanna call it, is pretty freakin' awesome. I had no idea when I pre-ordered it how cool it was gonna look. It's about the size of a book, with printed lyrics and tidbits of background info on each song, artwork and more. I'm totally stoked I spent the few extra bucks for this one instead of the plain one, but hey, if you can't afford the one with all the frills, show your support anyway by purchasing the plain jane version. Either way, all the great songs are on there. Oh, be sure to listen to Leave Out All the Rest, too. It's my favorite off this album.
B000001ESF|5.0|After the departure of orginal drummer John Rutsey, Rush took a turn in a different direction with the addition of lyricist and drummer extraordinaire Neil Peart.  One can hear the difference right away on Fly By Night and even more so on the comercially-shunned Caress Of Steel.  In the interim between the first Rush outing and the recording of 2112, Rush was a band still toying around with their sound, their ideas, their voice.  Gone by now were the heavy Zeppelin-esque trappings as they began to find themselves meshing as musicians.  No longer were the elder gods of rock needed to influence, because the pro-rock trio were becoming gods themselves.  2112 isn't the final stop for Rush into the whole concept album forray, but it's one of their most complete.  Side one, as the licorice pizzas used to spin, is entirely devoted to the Ayn Rand-inspired future-gone-wrong song suite 2112.  Elegant and grandiose, this is Rush on full-throttle.  Though many would say that the latter Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres suite is vastly superior in musical construction, 2112 set the standard.  From the ashes of the pretentious, overtly confusing efforts ending Caress Of Steel (The Necromancer & The Fountain Of Lamneth), rose a coherent, cohessive opus of sci-fi angst.<br /><br />2112 -  From the beginning of Overture on into The Temples Of Syrinx, Rush shows that their chops are clean and the music is fused into a solid, slamming, well-built machine.  What 2112's biggest challenge was melding harder rock tunes along with the softer side of prog-rock and making it work as a single entity.  I think they did it with 2112.  I never grow tired of listening to this.<br /><br />A Passage To Bangkok -  Great song.  Straight out rocker.  One of my personal favorites.  We're on a train to Bangkok, aboard the Thailand Express...<br /><br />The Twilight Zone -  Strange song, but one that I like.  Obviously about the television show, the latter part of the song is very eerie.  Geddy sings on one channel and whispers the lyrics on the other at the exact same time.  Kinda creepy.  Still a cool song.<br /><br />Lessons - This song sounds eerily reminiscent of some of their earlier work (maybe Making Memories off Fly By Night).  Staight ahead.  Concise.  Not a bad song.  Not one of their best, however.<br /><br />Tears - This song drags just enough to make it the soft spot on the album.  Light-hearted.  Sounds like it should have been a Barry Manilow tune.<br /><br />Something For Nothing -  This sounds like somthing off their first album, only musically superior in structure.  Straight-forward rock tune.  Catchy, kinda-corny lyrics.  Definitely a cool tune.  You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes...<br /><br />Overall, Rush had matured in the relatively short time between the failure that was Caress Of Steel and the brilliance that shows on 2112.  Geddy Lee's voice is something that takes a little getting used to, but it fits, and it's Rush, for better or worse.  Things would only continue to get better from this point in their career until the masterpiece that was Moving Pictures.<br /><br />Dig it!rs the lyrics on the other at the exact same time.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I have to say, that at first i wasnt feeling this album, but i was thinking it was going to be more like the 2nd album, but then i opened my ears and let the music sink in. This album is phenomenal. Everytime I play this cd I cant help but get up and dance. Let me get that and give me some sugar are the two big ones that i cant stop listening to. they have this beat that trap you in and the vocals go great with them. The best slow song is Rehab and Question existence, her voice is good and they are very slow and catchy. Overall all the tracks are great, but my least favorite has got to be say it. Otherwise this album is worth every cent if you love the first two albums, because its like both albums are fused into one and then some. Its a great cd.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is both one of my favorite albums of all time and one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  Perfect in every aspect.  This is Rush unleashed!  After the near perfection of previous efforts like Hemispheres and Farewell To Kings and Permanent Waves, Rush came together and created their masterpiece.  I could listen to it a million times and still never get tired of the prog-rock trio's best effort.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer -  Hands down one of the coolest songs ever!  Here the boys from Toronto show that not only are they excellent musicians, but they can write a song with hooks from hell.  Memorable and classic.  I love this tune.<br /><br />Red Barchetta - My Uncle has a country place that no one knows about...  Another classic Rush tune.  Written in the 1984-esque future-gone-wrong perspective with an idea garnered from a cool sci-fi story.  This about a boy and his car and the fact that driving has become illegal.  Great stuff.<br /><br />YYZ - One of the most killer instrumental tunes ever recorded.  This song rox!  Geddy, Alex & Neil in complete show-off jam mode.  Solid.<br /><br />Limelight - Another of my personal favorites.  A song about the other side of fame & fortune.  From the opening riff, this song rocks!  All the world's indeed a stage and we are merely players!  Excellent!<br /><br />The Camera Eye -  If Moving Pictures is said to have a soft spot, Camera Eye would be it, although I happen to love this song.  Clocking just over eleven minutes, this is a sprawling, moody tune along the lines of Xanadu or Natural Science.  A sleeper, but still strong.<br /><br />Witch Hunt - I have so many favorites on this album, and Witch Hunt is another.  Written about prejudice and mob mentality, Witch Hunt is part three of the 'Fear Trilogy' (The Enemy Within & The Weapon being the other two parts) that they performed live for a long time.  Killer tune.  Those who know what's best for us should rise and save us from ourselves....<br /><br />Vital Signs -  Great ending song to a magnificent album.  Short and sweet and too the point.  Neil's lyrics flow on their own. Everybody's got to deviate from the norm.<br /><br />Overall, Rush went into the studio and came up big with Moving Pictures.  This is the culmination of their earlier years solidified into something both powerful and perfect.  There will never be another Rush album like Moving Pictures.  This is the peak.  Great songs will follow but there will never be that cohession that this album brings.  Great album to start with if you are just getting acquainted with Rush.  An old favorite for those of us who have been following them forever.<br /><br />Dig it!and sweet and too the point.  Neil's lyrics flow on their own. Everybody's got to deviate from the norm.

Where 2112 was ambitious and sprawling, Kings is more concise and less gradiose, but still better musically than it's predecessor.  You can feel Rush getting more mature, more comfortable with themselves, more cofident to honing their sound.  The compositions here have reached a point where their song construction is clever, adept, and precise.  The classical guitar on Kings, the intro to Xanadu, the acoustic phrasings of Closer To The Heart.  You can feel Rush has evolved.<br /><br />A Farewell To Kings -  I quoted this song in my High School yearbook back in the day.  Great tune.  Very mature.  Alex shines.<br /><br />Xanadu -  Epic! The intro is great with the birds and all the different percussion instruments Neil throws in.  One of my personal favorites.  Excellent.  I scaled the frozen mountaintops of Eastern lands unknown....<br /><br />Closer To The Heart - A Rush classic along the lines of Spirit Of Radio or Tom Sawyer.  Short, sweet and to the point.  Perfect.<br /><br />Cinderella Man - An often overlooked song.  Geddy wrote the lyrics to this tune and it works well.  Solid.<br /><br />Madrigal - Probably the weakest song on the album.  Not bad, just short and very reflective.  Moody.  Sounds like side two of 2112 Lessons or Tears.  Not filler, just not spectacular Rush.<br /><br />Cygnus X-1 - The ten and a half minute vastly superior bastard son of The Necromancer.  In the last few years Rush has started to perform this song live again.  It is a killer tune, just throws me off a little bit with the distorted intro voice that makes me flash back to Caress of Steel.  Defiinitely jams.<br /><br />Overall, you can feel that Rush has reached a point in their career where they actually feel in control of themselves and their music.  The polished feel of these songs speaks volumes for them as perfectionists and muscians.  One of the string of truly great Rush albums that span from 2112 to Moving Pictures on the older side of the Rush catalog.<br /><br />Dig it!ing Pictures on the older side of the Rush catalog.        Dig it!
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|i love this book, its very interesting, and i could read it over and over again.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|This album has already been played to death in just two weeks. It is downright amazing.  The recording engineer and producer needs to be hugged endlessly for providing these sounds.  The drums are some of the best drums ever recorded and the bass playing is downright genius.  All of the songs are brilliant.  It really is that good.  The first album was great but this is even better.  If only radio would play this instead of the American Idol fodder...
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I didn't know if someone already told that on the millions of blogs that certainly are on for this great show. Surely I'm not the one to think that. But I think that due to the final episode from the third season I solved the mistery. The island from lost is the paradise lost from the Bible. <br />Even if i'm clueless here, that doesn't matter at all, since Lost is again a great show. Do not miss this pack dude.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|YES!!!!!!!!! This has got 2 be one of the best films in movie history. I dont care if the critics TRASHED it. They just dont know what a master piece this movie is. It has everything you need comedy, drama, & great dancing. I cant wait 2 get this FULLY EXPOSED edition. Hopefully it will have extended & deleted scenes added in. Commentary by Elizabeth Berkeley etc. These are things i hope are ADDED IN!!!!! WOOOHHOOOO!!!!!!
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Hommes and his bands of misfits, jokers, and all around hellans have once again put out a new CD. Yes, Queens are known for their raunchy 70's southern rock style with tasteful guitar licks and catchy lyrics, but on \\"Era Vulgaris\\", the boys take a little turn from their known style. As an avide Queens fan, I was a little put off at the first listening of the new album. I wasn't too sure that I wanted my Qotsa to be playing a darker and much more alternative approach to music but after listening to it a few times, I can see that change can be good. For those of you that don't know ARTISTS DO CHANGE! Sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, but it is a fact in the music industry. Trying new sounds is what musicians do and some may not like it. I'll admit that this my not be the best that Qotsa has done (not much can beat \\"Songs For The Deaf\\"), but this new take on traditional rock is a good break from the usual poppy boy bands attempting to sound like a rock band. It is a most buy for 2007 and other Qotsa fans might want to try it on for size.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|this is really great for what it is (not a vacuum, i.e. no suction), but great for in between cleaning.  i like it especially for the hard floors (linolium), but it does leave scuffy marks on my floor, like drag marks, not exactly scratches (i hope), due to the plastic of the sweeper rubbing on the floor.  it's not so great with carpet. <br />-dianna

B0000AUHPG|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000AUHPG Once Upon a Time in the West]] From start to finish,is by far the best spagetti western ever made to date. It Stars Henry Fonda as a ruthless outlaw. Along with a pose' he murders and destroys his way through every town he and his gang enters.He shows his victims no mercy, not a drop of sympathy is in his bones. He'll make your blood run cold. Henry Fonda is at his acting best! You have never seen him like this! He encounters a mysterious traveler who plays a mysterious melody on a Harmonica. The traveler seems to be looking for him. Why? Here's where the real edge of your seat action really happens. Finally time to reveal what everything means. Right down to the mysterious song played on the harmonica by the traveler througout most of the movie. <br /> Since this film was made other westerns that followed, used Itlalian director Sergi Leone's touch, i.e. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly etc.)
0689835604|5.0|My baby loves the flaps!! We read this book over and over again
0316166685|5.0|I cracked the cover and could not put it down- except to cry. The writing is superior, the thinking is very powerful! As a sibling of a recently murdered brother, I was overwhelmed by the raw grief that this author so well-depicts in this family - how there is no experience to draw on in order to communicate and express with other family members.  Sebold's story brings us inside a family struggling to process a horrific tragedy from an uexpected point of view - that of the dead victom-  a fourteen yr old girl who is very much alive in the two worlds that she straddles. This \\"living\\" of the victom is very healing for those of us faced with such a tragedy. For those who thought this book was sad, I felt it lifted 50lbs off my chest. <br /> <br />I was comforted and captivated to float with the murdered girl through her processing of her own tragedy and loss - eventually able to shift her \\"weight\\" from worldly watching, hopes and dreams to exploring an interesting new heaven. Even if conjecture on the author's part, the vivid portrayal was believable and I like to think my brother has this ability and is coping far better than his family. <br /> <br />Best about this book is Sebolds' exquisite writing. She masterfully takes us on a linear journey that moves us about in unpredictably new ways - just as a ghost should be able to move about. She also does not spare us the gravity of a gruesome murder... because it is what happens...  and because it's this very horribleness and it's disturbing latent details that makes up the course texture of not being able to grieve \\"properly\\" in the family.  <br /> <br />I'd love to thank the author for this new perspective.  It is difficult to shake the details of a violent death, but I did so with ease in this book. As I think of my brother everyday, I can and am much happier to imagine him \\"living\\" in his new world with the same enthusiasm and curiosity that he had in his earthly life. We can project this perspective for all of our loved ones who have ever left us. This booked has forever moved me. <br /> <br />
1594489505|5.0|It is unusual for me to cry when reading a book...Tears just ran from my eyes...It is a great second book for Hosseini...I hope he has another book soon...
0743496728|5.0|This is a subject that really has to be addressed in today's society.  Every teacher should read this book.  Although it is fiction Ms Picoult has certainly captured the effects of bullying on all people involved.  Too many people today turn a blind eye to this problem.  The only problem I had with this book was the jumping back and forth in time but I don't know how it could have been handled differently.  Thank you, Ms. Picoult, your story will stay with me for a long time.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like this because usually, when I hear a different version of a Beatles tune (usually a cover) it's just not as good as the original.<br /><br />With LOVE, the songs are a little different, but with George Martin doing the work on the remixes, it still sounds like something the Beatles might have released at the time, and it's very enjoyable.<br /><br />The one song I wasn't thrilled with was gnik nus (a back tracked version of Sun King)
B0000VCZKM|4.0|This version of Annie is wonderful. Carol Burnett creates such a wonderful character, and the orphans are extremely talented. This film is a step  above the rest of the \\"Annie\\" movies.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater (whom I will be seeing live, for the first time, at the University of Buffalo) achieves another milestone in an already fabulous career.  They used the three \\"P's\\" to produce, in my opinion, their magnum opus, that is: passion, poise and precision.  Some bands who are quite technically proficient (Planet X comes to mind) write material that is technically challenging, but heartless.  Dream Theater's music is constantly driven, interesting, and unpredictable and hard as hell to play, I know, I'm a drummer and playing along with Portnoy makes me cry................but the music always has heart!<br /><br />I won't bore you with running down the details of each song, if you're that curious borrow it or better yet buy it.  The album is full of bombast, odd time signatures, key changes, tempo changes, and some of the better lyrical input in the last few albums.<br /><br />A couple of very minor sour notes:  I'm not crazy about the track \\"Constant Motion\\" and I wish they hadn't have split up the song \\"In the Presence of Enemies.\\"  Lastly I think Petrucci, sort of dropped the ball on \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\", lyrically speaking.  A bit anti-climactic (think: upheaval, angst, a horrible war inside my head, tumultuous, rage - then, ooops, all better now!)  Great musically, but falls just a bit short lyrically - all J.P. needed to do was stretch out the resolution a bit more, but really no big deal.<br /><br />This is a brilliant work, such that I would rather listen to the out-takes of this album than listen to the finished product of, say, Maroon Five or My Chemical Romance, the boys from DT can play!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This cd is an abomination to the Linkin Park name and sound.  I waited patiently for the next greatest cd to arrive, and here I sit still waiting.  I want to personally thank Rick Rubin for yet again ruining another band I enjoy.  Do not waste your money on this cd, instead, go buy another copy of Hybrid Theory and/or Meteora.  Thanks and God Bless.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Nice! Porcupine Tree have never impressed me to the point of purchasing a CD before. I tried to find an appreciation for a couple previous albums, and 'in absentia' showed some potential. These guys have really stepped it up a notch with 'fear of a blank planet'. I am quite impressed. Every aspect of the music has improved. Things seem to have more of a direction, while remaining progressive. Steven did a fantastic job of keeping things interesting here. It took a few good listens, and eventually I found an appreciation for every song on here. Although it is somewhat short in length, each song consists of so many different elements, and textures. It feels like so much more than it is.  <br /> <br />This album is truly a timeless, piece of art. This is what music is missing now days. I really can't say enough about it. I also enjoy the storyline behind it. I haven't read the lyrics, but it seems like it's following a troubled individual that is somewhat of a product of modern day childhood. Over-exposed to drugs, mtv, videogames, violence, etc. As the album moves along, it seems like the character is growing older, progressively becoming more hollow, addicted, and then regretful. Maybe thats just my interpretation. It's quite good, buy it. <br />
B0001I55SS|4.0|If Walt Disney's 1979 sci-fi extravaganza, \\"The Black Hole,\\" must be looked back upon as a failure, it is an excellent failure. Granted, this sci-fi tale about the crew of the U.S.S. spaceship Palomino encountering a madman scientist (Maximillian Schell) whose own spaceship, the U.S.S. Cygnus, is impossibly perched upon the edge of a black hole, has some very obvious flaws in it. Some of the dialogue is cheeseball, the very *idea* of Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux) having E.S.P. with the robot VINCENT is just plain silly, you can easily see the wires holding up the actors and the robots when they are supposed to be weightless, and the actors should've damm well been wearing spacesuits at the film's climax, when they're crawling to the top of the escape probe ship in open outer space! (Why did director Gary Nelson let his actors get away with that one?) Ah, but still...I cannot help but thoroughly enjoy \\"The Black Hole.\\" The film blew me away as a child, and now, looking at the movie again as an adult, the child in me had a wonderful time all over again---even if you can still see the wires! The main achievement of \\"The Black Hole\\" is the *look* of the film---it's outstanding. The art direction, cinematography and visual effects of this film are extraordinary (utilising over 150 matte paintings). The long, spacious corridors of the Cygnus look like they stretch out for miles, the Cygnus command tower is a total feast for the eyes, and I could go on and on. John Barry's rousing musical score is arguably the best film score he's done outside of the James Bond films (and when will it be released on CD? C'mon, Disney, you released the \\"Tron\\" soundtrack, so where's \\"The Black Hole\\"?). And while the movie's screenplay isn't as polished as it could've been (Mimieux's line about \\"There are old pilots and there are bold pilots\\" still makes me cringe, to name one example), the film's basic plot is still a compelling one, and the movie has a suitably eerie tone to it as the Palomino crew walk through the massive corridors of the Cygnus, and slowly unravel the dark, terrible secret harbored by Dr. Reinhardt. Reinhardt's giant red robot Maximillian, with his huge frame and pulsating red eyes, is still THE scariest robot ever put on film. And the all-star cast of Schell, Mimieux, Anthony Perkins, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms and Ernest Borgnine are all good in their roles, even if these aren't the greatest performances of their respective careers. There's genuine excitement towards the end as the Cygnus is torn apart by the black hole and the surviving Palomino crew make a mad dash to the escape probe ship, and finally go *into* the black hole itself (and there are definite echoes of \\"2001\\" during this amazing sequence). And the film's surreal, cosmic ending, although confusing for many, is, for me, completely haunting and unforgettable (even if it does leave certain questions unanswered). It still disappoints me that \\"The Black Hole\\" was received so poorly back in 1979, and is not remembered with much fondness today. I just think audiences & critics at the time compared it too unfairly to \\"Star Wars.\\" \\"The Black Hole\\" sure ain't \\"Star Wars,\\" but on it's own, there is much to admire about it. Though not an entirely successful movie, it's still very, very ambitious, and if nothing else it's a visual masterpiece for it's technical achievements alone. \\"The Black Hole\\" is a daring film that truly deserves another look. And kudos to Walt Disney Productions for taking such a big gamble with this unique (and controversial) sci-fi movie.
B000FOQ1EA|5.0|While Herbert Blomstedt was conductor of the San Francisco Symphony in the 1990s (after Ozawa and before Tilson Thomas) he led the orchestra to a substantial catalogue of recordings. Not least among these was the unequaled Nielsen symphony cycle and this complete set of the Sibelius symphonies.<br /><br />This boxed set is highly recommended. Although it is the result of many different recording sessions, there is a consistency of interpretation which is much to be recommended. The SFS has both sweet singing strings and a grand brass chorus sufficient to do justice to these symphonies.<br /><br />Although this is a bit of a simplification, one could say that Sibelius turned music on its head: The classical style of Hadyn and Mozart was to declare a couple of themes and then modify and elaborate them. Sibelius tends to start with a fragment (most famously, a single repeated note on the oboe in No. 2), then develop it to a grand statement of the theme at the end of the movement. This is his genius. The music transcends earthly existence and certainly belies the notoriously gloomy disposition of its composer.<br /><br />The \\"fillers\\" on this set are Valse Triste (an early work) and Tapiola, Sibelius's last published work. The one deficiency is that the liner notes in the accompanying booklet are brief indeed.<br /><br />Overall this is a monumental musical collaboration, an achievement of sensitivity and integrity that is a happy testament to Blomstedt's decade with the SFS.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Out of all the TNG movies this one was probaly like just a long version of the show. It was such a very simple concept. A movie based on the violation of the prime directive. It had moral dilemanas that had to be addressed and it reminded me so much of the show. If you are a fan of the show you will love this movie. <br /> <br />The only downside is it's not going to wow you with the fights or space battles. It's a solid movie but, if you aren't a trek fan this isn't the one that will convernt you like say Nemesis with the big battles there would. Still I definately recommemend this film.
1567184855|5.0|I'll admit, I'm still not too sure about multiple lives.  But this book is exceptionally well written and appears to be a truly objective research into what the spirit world is like.<br /><br />If you trust the author, then he was dragged into this conclusion by tons of corroborative evidence.  I made that leap of faith that he was truthful and given that assumption, the rest of his conclusions are inescapable.<br /><br />I would and have recommended this book to just about everyone I meet.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I just don't get it.  I guess I'm just an oldfardt.  The only time I laughed during this film was when Napolean was trying to jump the make-shift ramp with his bike.  I do give 1 star for the very original opening credit sequence.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|If you own an HD DVD player its safe to assume that your into sharp images and clear powerful sounds. I own the original standard box set and like many, went ahead bought the HD version anyway. Well worth it. <br /> <br />The visual is incredible but for me the real difference is in the sound. Powerfull and crystal clear. I cant get enough of Trinity jumping out the building being chased by the Agent. Glass breaking and bullets flying are the perfect sound effects when listening to quality HD sound.  <br /> <br />My opinion; HD is the better format right now. Blu-ray may have the most movies but HD has the better product.
1573223026|4.0|I enjoy Hornby's light prose style and the way he is able to get at deeper issues in his novels.  This is a great novel and one of Hornby's best.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is simply stunning.  If you enjoy nature documentaries this is a must see.  What makes the cinematography so unique is that they used big budget Hollywood film/camera techniques that haven't yet been applied to documentary film making (explained in the \\"making of\\" segments that follow each film).  Planet Earth includes innovative and beautiful footage such as a great white shark, in super slow motion, breached entirely out of the water to catch a sea lion in its mouth.  To capture the breaching shark they used the extreme slow motion photography used to film crash test dummies.  The use of satellite images is integral to creating a global perspective that runs through the series.  Seeing swashes of the planet turn green or the ridge line of the Himalayas from space hammers home the message about how unique, and diverse, life on this planet really is.  Attenborough is, as always, the best documentary narrator ever, and I can't even fathom why the U.S. broadcast of the series replaced his narration.  It is worth buying the DVD to be able to watch the series with the original narration.  Some other highlights include the aerial view of a painted dog hunt, a snow leopard hunt, a mother amur leopard with her cub, and a pride of lions taking down and feasting on a young elephant.  Some segments are more interesting than others (caves was disappointing), but I'm partial to animals over scenery.  The scenery however, especially of various mountain ranges, is breathtaking.  Several segments use time lapse videography in creative ways.  For example, slowing time to show an underwater starfish fight.  In line with other BBC productions the narration is thought provoking and intelligent.  Do not miss Planet Earth, which features some of the best nature documentary filmmaking ever produced.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is arguably one of the greatest debuts in rock history (alongside The Velvet Underground and Nico).  It is an almost perfect album, a feat that doesn't happen very often.  Every song is so beautifully written, crafted, sequenced, and performed by some of the greatest musicians the rock world has ever heard or seen.  The starter, 21st Century Schizoid Man, is amazingly intricate.  It's one of the best songs from Crimson's library, and the middle section is blistering in its intensity.  The quieter songs (just about the rest of the album) are so mellow, moving, and haunting, with lyrics (courtesy of prog rock's greatest lyricist, Pete Sinfield) that still hold up today.  There are only 5 songs on the album (all running epic length), but they're pretty much perfect.  The only one that gives me a slight problem is Moonchild.  The last 10 minutes of the song (after a beautiful introduction) are kind of aimless.  But then, maybe a few more listens, and the song will finally kick in.  This is one of my favorite albums ever.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I have always loved the series of Jaws and wanted my own DVD of the first, especially the 30th anniversary edition. Great movie, excellent copy and great price. I now have the other three added to my library and look forward to ordering many more.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|EDIT:I woulda given it a 5 but QOTSA still needs Oliveri.     Before I bought the album I was at my job reading recent interviews and articles of the upcoming QOTSA album. I bought the album during my lunch time and heard the first few tracks. On the ride home it looped twice, and the album sums up to a very creative, and solid one. The experimental side of Qotsa is demonstrated on all the tracks, they have taken a more uncanny sound into their efforts and it builds to their, now, more unique persona. It would've been safe for QOTSA to have made a SFTD 2, but it seems they had more balls to conjure up a more authentic sound.    \\"You ain't a has been if you never was \\"
0316067598|5.0|God bless, Marcus Luttrell and his team.  I read this book cover to cover and just saw Marcus interviewed on The Today Show. These are the men in service who deserve more praise. They are honorable, brave and decent. We should be all be proud. An awesome story that will leave you thinking.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|If CW doesn't revive Veronica Mars in some way, I'll be one sad puppy.  But I am truly grateful to have been able to enjoy VM for three seasons, anyhow.  <br /> <br />I can't add much to the good reviews already written.  VM really was the best series on TV ever.  Period.
B000P0J024|4.0|The title of this set is simple and accurate, but it could also have been called \\"The Complete Traveling Wilburys.\\"  Since George Harrison was the original guiding inspiration for this fun, shambling supergroup, it's safe to say there won't be any new material, and so this set collects all that there was (audio & video).  These guys were good friends, and their love of the music comes through in the music.  For collectors, the bonuses contained in this collection are rather slight.  On the DVD there's a 25-minute promo documentary on the recording sessions for Volume 1.  It's pretty low quality footage of the home movie variety, but still an interesting insight into the dynamics of these legends getting together.  Each of the two CDs has a pair of rare or previously unissued cuts, the choicest of which is a version of \\"Runaway\\" (with Volume 3).  As for the two original albums, they stand up pretty well after all this time.  Admittedly the songs on Volume 3 are less impressive, but there are still some keepers such as \\"7 Deadly Sins.\\"  All in all, I found it a joy to get reacquainted with this stuff several years on.  Whether you pronounce it Will-breeze or Will-burries, this is a well assembled set that would be a good addition to your collection, especially if you don't already own both Volumes 1 & 3.<br /><br />By the way, it really feels like the spirit of the Beatles is strong lately, what with George Harrison popping up on this reissue, McCartney putting out a new solo record, and the new Darfur-Lennon tribute album.
B000PMGNK4|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time on Sci-Fi Channel's Ani-Monday. I was getting ready to call it a night when this was advertised as being next and had to stay up and watch it. It's a very well done movie with a lot of feeling of the first movie that was brought to the series. Alot of things have changed, alot of feelings are different, but it's all very good. I think I saw an edited version but for the most part it was very well done. All the original cast has returned to do the voices so there's no problem with the english subtitles or with dubbing. Overall it was a good movie.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I deleted my original review because admittedly I had just finished Season 6 and was so ticked off after watching it and by what I read on the \\"spoiler\\" websites so I had not actually watched Season 7.  I doubt I am the first person to have done this sort of thing.    Anyway, after having watched Season 7 over the course of three days I must say I am shocked by how good it was.  It reminded me of seasons 2, 3, and 4 in its quality and balance.  It was almost like the good old days all over again.  Makes me wonder why Season 6 had to stink so bad.
B000060OWV|4.0|I've had this cd  for a few years and really like it. Sure, not every tune is perfect but darn close.<br /><br />Some people pick on Robben's vocals but I think thats BS. To me his voice fits what he plays,and Peter Green to me is another example of this. I mean what do you want,a strainiac like BonJovi, Axl Rose or Daughtry??? No thanks.(Anyone who is looking for insturmental Robben may want check out \\"Tiger Walk\\". More funky than blusey but still a solid cd).<br />(\\"Update time-4/3/08\\"-I took my wife to see Bon Jovi and Daughtry  last night at the HP Pavillion and both acts were outstanding.)<br /><br />If you play guitar do yourself a favor buy this, give it a listen, dial up a nice fat tone and believe me two seconds into track one you'll be smilin' and jammin' with it and just about every track on this cd.I know because I do.
1904233023|5.0|Having blown off life, spouse, and cats on Sunday in order to read cover to cover Ender's Game, I was left feeling cheated that no one had given me this book earlier in life and demanded that I read it. On my brief breaks from the book to forage for food in the fridge, I refused to speak to my spouse as I didn't want to come out of the world created by Card in this must-read book.<br /><br />I'm not a sci-fi fan by nature and so wasn't expecting much. But I was hooked from page 1 and never looked back. I'm off to the local library to see if they carry the sequels.
1582701709|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Bringing awareness to my own life, I could see how many of things Rhonda writes about has happened to me. What stood out for me is the very first chapter. It is summed up on page 25 in Secret Summaries. \\"Your current thoughts are creating your future life. What you think about the most or focus on the most most will appear as your life. I can see that when I believe I can do  something I do and when I think I can't I don't.     The chapter, The Secret to Relationships, was also an eye opener. Dr John Gray says \\"You become the Solution for you\\" It was an eye opening idea that if my relationship isn't working the other person is not to blame and that I need to look at me. This brought to mind another book I've read and highly recommend:[[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]]\\" Ariel & Shya's book is brilliantly written and guides the reader in how to have a Magical Relationship and how having a magical relationship is up to you and not your partner.     Thinking of both these books makes me smile. I highly recommend them both!
B00006I53S|5.0|A good outdoor general purpouse lens.  I think it's a bit too slow for indoor use, but then I have the 28mm f/1.8, 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.8 for that purpose.  Good macro feature.  Works will with the Rebel XTi, which it \\"acts\\" like a 50-200mm lens.  Good for serious amateurs or those thinking about going pro.  This should be the only outdoor lens you'd ever need -- unless you really need to reach out and touch something a long way off or are a super pro.

0143038419|2.0|I agree with the previous reviewer that said that this book is very over hyped .  I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought the book sounded mildly interesting but wouldn't have read it unless two of my friends recommended it.  From page 1, I felt that the author used way too many words to express very little in terms of content.  She goes on and on, tries really hard to entertain us, and it shows.  The section on meditation was illuminating -- she said she had monkey mind, which made total sense because that's exactly how she writes .  It's still an entertaining book, but not a great book; there are a lot of better books around .
0316067598|5.0|The Atticus Review is a disgraceful uniformed lie. The United States Navy stepped up immediately to help Gulab. Who was a policeman not a woodsman.   As Marcus Lutrell stated on the Today show ,the same Ancient tribal law that saved his life, forbid the American Admirals from rewarding Gulab in anyway personally. Any rewards had to be for the benefit of the entire village.  The Navy provided the Village with its first generators to produce their first ever electricity and drove in the first black-top road there had ever been to this mountainside village. Luttrell was there serving as a seal in Iraq at the time.  What a tragedy it would be if Atticus's warped misguided sense of injustice should blind anyone to the true quality of a book like LONE SURVIVOR.  Marcus Luttrell is a great American who continually put his life on the line for his country .  Anyone who writes a review like that is not fit to ties the shoes laces of an American hero like Marcus Luttrell.  After seeing Lutrell on the Today Show I bought and read this book in one day.  This is a riveting Memoir about courage, honor and loss that will live with me forever.
B000NA2776|5.0|This album is genius.  I saw Mika in concert on Monday at the Chicago Metro.  It was fun, incredible, and amazing!  If you like this album, you have got to see his live performance.  But, once you've seen him live, you'll want to see him again and when compared to the live performances, the studio versions of his songs seem flat.  Now I can't wait for the live CD version!    P.S.  To those of you who claim Mika's ripping off Freddy Mercury et al., get a dictionary, look up the word \\"homage,\\" and learn to recognize the difference between a rip off artist and an artist honoring the spirit of a predecessor.     I was 18-20 when Queen was at its zenith.  Mika's music doesn't merely recall that musical time or remind me of events that took place 20+ years ago, it makes me *feel* like I'm 20 again.  How cool is that!  The kid is a genius who deserves all the accolades we can give him (particularly since there doesn't seem to be enough payola flowing to the radio stations to get him much playtime)!
B000E6UK32|4.0|Blondie is my favorite band and I have all of their albums, so I was curious to compare this collection with their first hits collection, [[ASIN:B000003JAL The Best of Blondie]] (1982), and their other [[ASIN:B00006IM9Q Greatest Hits]] album from 2002.    Sound & Vision is much better than The Best of Blondie, with vastly improved sound quality and a bigger selection of songs.  The only songs that The Best of Blondie contains that this collection does not are \\"(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear\\" and the original version of \\"In the Flesh\\"--the version of the latter on Sound & Vision is an awful remix with brand new vocals by Debbie Harry, and it sounds NOTHING like the original.  Sound & Vision is certainly preferable to The Best of Blondie, though, no matter how you look at it.    However, when compared to the 2002 Greatest Hits CD, Sound & Vision doesn't fair quite as well, not taking into account the bonus DVD with music videos.  Greatest Hits has nearly every song from this collection--it does NOT include \\"Good Boys\\" or \\"End To End\\" from The Curse of Blondie, released in 2004, nor the \\"Rapture Riders\\" mash-up, but makes up for it with the inclusion of \\"(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear\\" and \\"X Offender\\", two of Blondie's best songs. It also includes the original version of \\"In the Flesh\\" in lieu of the pointless remix.  Those factors alone, along with the fact that Greatest Hits is quite a bit cheaper than this collection, make Greatest Hits worth getting instead of Sound & Vision.    So, how does Sound & Vision hold up on its own?  It is a decent collection of Blondie's most popular songs, but they are mostly radio edits and not the full album versions.  They even dared to chop off the openings of \\"Heart of Glass\\", Atomic\\" and \\"The Tide is High\\"!  The remix included for \\"Good Boys\\" is decent, and much  MUCH better than the remix for \\"In the Flesh\\", but the album version is still the best.  The remastering is swell, but in some cases I prefer the remasters of the original album versions (for example, \\"Union City Blue\\").    If you're a diehard Blondie fan like me, you will want Sound & Vision for the bonus DVD, which includes some of Blondie's best music videos.  These are not traditional music videos because they were all produced before MTV, but rather they are performance videos of the band lip-synching to the studio versions of the songs.  My personal favorite of the videos is \\"Rapture\\", but \\"Heart of Glass\\", \\"Denis\\", \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\", \\"Dreaming\\" and  \\"The Hardest Part\\" are favorites as well.  The worst of them by far is \\"The Tide of High\\"--love the song, but the video is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.    Most casual listeners will not be concerned with the things I am nitpicking about here.  But unless you must have the videos, you would be better off purchasing the 2002 Greatest Hits collection because of the cheaper price tag.  Thankfully, I found this collection for $12 used, or else I would have bought Greatest Hits, too.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|You are very irresponsible. I wasn't going to say, but since you've come out and dared me to do it, I'll grant your request. Who do you think you are, Michael Bubble? You come in here singing like you're Frank Sinatra after eating a pixy stick talking like you've already had dinner. This album is more of the same stuff. You're like the Nickelback of weiny music. I can't really tell where one song ends and another begins. Women love this guy and they also love me. The difference is that I front a top of the shelf Loverboy/Savage Garden cover band called Loversavageboygarden. We play corporate teambuilding events and rock out. You know what we aren't? Irresponsible. Burns plays outstanding keyboard and eats three square meals a day. J-abs donates a lot of his time helping attractive women find men to sleep with. I walk for charity every Wednesday. Bubble can sit and croon all he wants, but I was the one who was prom king for five straight years at me high school. Yeah, I said me instead of my because I like pirates. That's why I ring the bell after a good meal at Long John Silvers and yell AAAAARRRGGGHHHHH!!!! I just flushed average down the toilet like a #2.

B000002OZY|4.0|The Who's Tommy had been foreshadowed lyrically by \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" - which Pete Townshend referred to as \\"Tommy's parents\\" on Live At Leeds - and musically by the two-part \\"Rael\\" from The Who Sell Out.  (Although I am not sure about the continuity between \\"A Quick One\\" and Tommy.)  Granted, the foreshadowing was subtle, but clearly Townshend had big things in mind as The Who's stature grew.  But as a \\"rock opera\\", if we are to use that term, Tommy was not an entirely original creation.  It was presaged by The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow in 1968.  Moreover, word had apparently leaked to Townshend that Ray Davies was working on Arthur, or: the Decline and Fall of the British Empire.  So just as The Kinks had influenced The Who's early sound, eg, \\"I Can't Explain\\", so too would they appear to have influenced them in the middle period of their heyday.<br /><br />The centerpiece of Tommy is \\"Pinball Wizard\\", whose strummed chords are among the most recognizable in rock, and which serve as a motif throughout the record.  However, I should note - as others have - that it is not too far removed from the chords heard on \\"Old Man Going\\" from the previously mentioned S.F. Sorrow.  (But hey, even the opening to \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" had a precursor in \\"Taurus\\" by the band Spirit.)  Of the two dozen tracks on the album, this is probably the only one known to a wider audience, and rightfully so.  This is an excellent single which stands well on its own, and serves as one of the pillars for an album that also includes three instrumentals (\\"Overture\\", \\"Sparks\\", \\"Underture\\") and several under one-minute adhesive pieces, which are at times reminiscent of the fake commercials on Sell Out.  Among the other solid, free-standing songs are \\"Amazing Journey\\", \\"Christmas\\", \\"Go To the Mirror!\\", \\"Sensation\\", \\"Sally Simpson\\", and \\"I'm Free\\".  Pete Townshend wrote all of these songs, and most of the others on Tommy.  But there is also the smartly chosen cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's \\"Eyesight To the Blind (The Hawker)\\".  Plus, John Entwistle's two tracks introduce the unsavory characters one would expect from him, in this case the bully \\"Cousin Kevin\\" and the alcoholic, sexually abusive Uncle Ernie (\\"Fiddle About\\").<br /><br />Tommy is surely to be praised for its great songs and ambition, but also for the fact that the story holds together quite well.  It is easy to criticize it for being sketchy, but no libretto can serve to illustrate every scene of an opera perfectly.  Townshend obviously expected it to be presented on stage.  I will not go too deeply into the plot, but it is worth pointing out the highlights.  Tommy witnesses the murder of his mother's lover by his father, long thought to have been killed in World War I (\\"1921\\").  Terrified by his father's insistence that he saw and heard nothing, and that his never to tell anyone about it, he is psychologically struck deaf, dumb, and blind.  His parents, bereft of hope,  first seek to heal him first through a strange spiritual leader (\\"Eyesight To the Blind\\") and then hallucinagens (\\"The Acid Queen\\").  Both fail, but in the meantime Tommy discovers he has an uncanny talent for pinball, which catapults him to fame.  Soon after this, his parents find a doctor who discovers that Tommy's symptoms are psychosomatic (\\"There's A Doctor\\").  The refrain of \\"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me\\" comes from Tommy, who is aware of what is happening even though he cannot express himself.  Tommy is healed when his mother destroys the mirror into which he perpetually stares, and through which he saw the murder happen (\\"Smash The Mirror\\").  Thought by many to have been the recipient of a miracle, he acquires legions of followers, who too hope to have their senses revived figuratively the way Tommy's were literally (\\"Sally Simpson\\", \\"Welcome\\".)  Alas, like most so-called gurus, Tommy insists that his followers gain enlightenment the same way that he did.  This, coupled with the fact that Uncle Ernie isheading up the camp, cause his followers to abandon him (\\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\").  Fortunately, Tommy does not abandon himself as the latter half of \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" - released in single form as \\"See Me, Feel Me\\" - indicates.<br /><br />If any band were to make the rock opera legitimate, The Who was surely the big band who could.  Although S.F. Sorrow deserves its share of credit, and although Arthur is a better album, Tommy is the one that everyone knows about.  Obviously such a large project ran the risk of being overblown, but Townshend's penchant for graceful but powerful singles and longer pieces prevented this from happening.  Tommy may not be a Great album, but it is a very good one, and is worthy of its status as a major breakthough in the history of rock.camp, cause his followers to abandon him (\\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\").

I could not put the book down or recommend it more strongly!
B00008MJ8H|5.0|I've hundreds of movie soundtracks but this far by the best soundtract I've heard...The quality of the CD and the music from Morricone is timeless. The music is so haunting and so melancholic that feel inside of you. I highly recommend this album.
B000MV9026|1.0|The entire purpose of this movie is to highlight to children (and the child-like) \\"Humans bad, animals good.\\"  The ideology that humans are the scourge of the planet saturates this movie.  It goes way overboard on anthropomorphism and shows humans with few redeeming qualities.  I am horrified that I actually spent money on this propaganda.

1419810855|5.0|Mildred Pierce is such a soap opera.  The characters are over the top. Wally, Mildred's ex-husband's ex-business partner, seems to have the single minded goal of getting into Mildred's now vacant pants.  Monte is an aging spendthrift playboy, who is violently alergic to work, and vampirically latches on to Mildred's purse.  Veda, Mildred's airhead daughter, is pure spoiled brat - nothing redeeming there, only a mother could love her.  To polish off this soap opera quality, there is an awkwardly inserted scene of a child's death for added melodrama.  <br />  <br />Mildred ties all these threads together as a good little housewife, who is striking out on her own to provide only the best for her daughter Veda.  Her character has the most depth (any depth at all is a change in this movie).  She remains motherly and virtuous, as she reallizes that she can be shark at business to keep the funds flowing for Veda's expensive hobbies.  Similarly, Joan Crawford, who plays Mildred, holds the film together.  It's so corny - I reallized this as I watched - and yet so gripping.  I think that reading the script would have made me gag, and yet this movie pulled me in.  <br />  <br />This is worth a watch for everyone.  It seems like a crowd pleaser.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|There are artists who are on your radar for years, and you know they're fantastic, and you eagerly await each album, but whom you would not include among the likes of Zeppelin, or the Beatles.  You buy each album eagerly awaiting the one where they finally make the \\"leap\\" to that next level...the upper echelon of rock bands.      Sky Blue Sky is the \\"leap\\" album for Wilco.    That isn't to say that their other albums aren't very good...and it's CERTAINLY not to say that Wilco is now on the same level as the Beatles and Zeppelin...I doubt anyone ever will be...but they have clearly elevated their game and made an album that is wholly transcendent.    I have a strong appreciation for music that pays tribute to heroes of days past, but still retains a certain freshness, and Sky Blue Sky has this quality in excess.  At times it recalls Velvet Underground, The Beatles, Phish, and others, but it is never retreading old material.  It remains very new and original.  There is an elegant simplicity to the music here, as evidenced from the start with Either Way.  The guitar solo from this song is simplistic bliss.  I am particularly fond of Side With The Seeds, Hate It Here, and Walken.  The last two of which recall the Beatles so strongly that it puts a smile on my face to think of them.  If you enjoy any of the bands mentioned in this review, then I highly recommend this album.  There is no way...NO WAY...you will be disappointed.    This is music for those who are eternally optimistic about life despite being well aware of the fact that there is no real evidence to support such a positive outlook.  It's heartbreakingly beautiful, and depressingly uplifting.  New and Old.  Obviously, it's highly contradictory, but on the whole, a beautiful album.  Pick it up.
B000P5FF46|5.0|This album rocks! The Scorpions have put a solid effort into this album. The production, the sound, tone of the guitars as well as the guitar playing is outstanding. Hour 1 and 321 are excellent tracks. It reminded me of their earlier work which brought them to superstardom in the early 80's. This does not mean that the songs are dated or anything. They have the Scorpions sound and feel, but mature. The funny thing is, we have twin daughters 2.5 years old. I put on 321 and then asked them if they wanted to ROCK? We had 5 encores of 321. My wife thinks the Scorpions are soooo 80's, but thought the album was very well made. Anyway I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to own a great rock album.   <br />  <br />

Nineteen Minutes was, like the others, brilliantly written. This one was especially difficult for me to read having read it less than a week after the unfortunate events at Virginia Tech. However, I was grateful for the read at this that time because it gave me some insight as to how the parents of the victims might have been feeling, although the situation in the book is very different from the situation at VTech. I do recommend this book as well as any other by Jodi.

B00021R7CG|4.0|I saw this quite impressive movie years ago on television and bought it to add to my movie collection mostly for nostalgia's sake.  The main reason I enjoyed it years ago and continue to enjoy it is its casting of Powers Boothe as the quintessential military man doing his darnedest to follow orders.    I like Powers Boothe.  I like every movie he appears in.  Powers Boothe adds *presence* to movies. <g>    That said, for me this story revolves around Mr. Boothe's pilot character and his battle with an obstinate and very un-military-like female co-pilot.  He wishes to follow orders and drop his bombs.  She wimps out and argues against it.  Somehow beyond my comprehension, the wimpy co-pilot convinces the pilot to disregard direct orders and turn around.    Despite this decision falling into line with the theme of the movie overall, I still find myself wishing the man had stuck to his guns against the childish ravings of the woman in the seat beside him.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.    (I'm a woman, btw, for those of you reading this review who wish to attempt a grasp of my logic here!)    An excellent drama and one worth seeing ... even to pass on for the edification of younger generations! :-)

B00003CX5P|1.0|Hey, folks! I don't know about you, but I've realized something extraordinary! Yoda is a HERETIC! How is this possible, you may ask? Well, here's how. You see, in this highly-anticipated prequel, Quack-Gonn Jinn explains the force to Anakin Snobbwalker. He explains how the force is really just a bunch of microorganisms (similar to sweat) that live in your cells and boss you around. However, in Episode V, Yoda (who in Episode I looks like a monkey) claims that the force is something that surrounds every living thing (something like that). If Yoda is a heretic, that means he's bad. If he's bad, then why do you see him with the good jedi at the end of Episode VI? Meeesa have bad feelzing about this. Can you guess who meeesa is? Youssa right! Issa meeesa, I'mgonnahityouovertheheadwithajellyjar-jar-Bonks.    I am Qui-Gonn Jinn. I am a stone-faced, mature Jedi Master, yet I enjoy the presence of my friend Jar-Jar-Binks more than my audience.    Jar-Jar - Exqueese me! You saved my life! Meeesa your servant for life!    Qui-Gonn - Yes, Jar-Jar. If I were in my right mind, I would slash you with my lightsaber until I could see the individual atoms that you're made of. However, I'm never in my right mind, so I will bear with your company. What's more, I'll even take you with me, so that everyone aboard my ship will lose their minds when you crack fart jokes every five seconds.    Obi-Wan finally meets Jar-Jar. He would also slash him to pieces; however, that would mean he'd lose Jedi points, because destroying an unarmed creature is against the jedi rule. It's bad enough that Padme likes snobby, most-horrible-actor-in-the-world Anakin, but she likes Bonks. How is that possible? I think Jar-Jar is a Sith! How else could anyone like him, than by using Jedi mind tricks? How else could he not die, when thousands of battle droids are around him and none hear his ridiculous screams?    Finally, we see the villain of the movie! Darth Maul, who is not in it at all! What does he do inthe movie? Except for some incredibly awesome lightsaber moves, he rolls his eyes! Probably an addiction he developed when going through the movie's storyline with Lucas.            Who is the hero of the movie?    JOHN WILLIAMS!!!!!!!
B000P7V45S|4.0|I never got the last round of remasters, so buying these was a no brainer, especially with A Trick Of The tail, which has the \\"In Concert\\" film, which is quite good (though I could live without the films during some of Banks' solos.    However, it's not perfect.  The vocals on some songs are quite different.  The first place you'll notice it is on Dance on a Volcano.  The EQ different and much of the reverb is gone.  In my opinion, it's a change for the worse.  You'll also notice that the whistle, during the instrumental closing section, is almost inaudible (that may be different in 5.1, but all my HTS gear is either in storage or being used by others).    Make no mistake, I hear all kinds of things I've never heard before and most changes are for the better, but there are changes, which fans may not like.    I'm glad I got it, but I now think I need to pick up the last round of remasters before they disappear.    If you're buying for the extras, you can probably get a way with this one and Duke.  The others have little of interest, aside from the interviews (which are good).

It's as if they took out every interesting idea that made the comic popular. Except of course the flaming skull which looks like some B-grade reject effect from the peice of sh!t film Spawn. Nicolas Cage's carrer is over if it's not it should be. He makes fun of the character while playing the character,literally. The story should have been serious,dark ,and voilent. Instead they went with a awful comedy that was geared toward kids. Nicolas cage acted like elvis the whole time and no one had any chemistry. Sam Elliot was the only one that seemed remotly beleivable .Everybody else in the film was some how stripped of any acting talent .Then there was the goth girl ...Why seriously why! Hopefully this film gets forgotten and they remake it like they did the batman franchise. Don't rent , buy or even watch this terrble movie.Its not even good for a laugh. If your a fan of the character save yourself from disapointment and read the comics again.By the way they wouldn't let me put zero stars or negative stars .
1428144331|2.0|I probably would have enjoyed this book if I had actually read it. Instead, I downloaded it onto my iPod from iTunes. The narration is just awful. I could barley concentrate on the story because I felt like I was suffering through a terrible reading of the material. Read the book - don't get the audio CDs or download it unless you have to.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|Needed more Mark Lanagan. Needed more Nick. Needed more dave. Needed more of the unique things that mades QOTSA the great band it WAS. All you nick haters out there need to get real. Josh was doing al lthe same stuff as nick. Josh pulled a major powermove. Josh is a baby and is even on probation for breaking a bottle over the lead singer of the dwarfs head. Why did he do it? cause josh was pissed that they let nick tour with them. What a child. This Album reflects current \\"Josh Hommie Band\\" attititude.
B000P0J024|5.0|FANNNNTASTIC!  This set is the greatest way to remember and enjoy the amazing talents of George Harrison and Roy Orbison, who were taken  from us much too soon!  I hope everyone loves this set as much as I do! It's the best gift for any  Wilbury's fan! It has a wonderful varity of songs!! The DVD couldn't have been better or more fun to watch!   I bought two, one to play and one to keep! The shipping was super fast and arrived in time for Father's Day but I couldn't wait and gave it to my husband early! He thought it was just as fantastic as I did!  This set is a real winner in our opinion!  I have not found a better or more reasonable price \\"any where\\" on this set!
B000BCE918|5.0|I have been a nut for Dinosaur movies since I was a kid and they were shown on a square screen in black & white in theatres. \\"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\" was the greatest of its time and now here I get to see these three magnificant movies in my living room !

Delightful, and entertaining fantasy fun for the kid in all of us!!!  GET THE POPCORN!!!!
0151013047|1.0|Caution: Hamid's novel is not the important East-West novel of the twenty-first century probing the ambiguous depths of our complicated entwinement, attraction and antipathy. That novel is still waiting to be written, Desai's recent Booker Prize notwithstanding. First, the English is horrid: business English that avoids the concrete whenever an abstraction will do. Aphoristic and allegorical in a clever but shallow and therefore disappointing way. And full of hate that is never explained,never given psychological or emotional dimension, just assumed to be patently justified and deserved by its powerful object, the West. And forget the love story. Girlfriend Erica is a shadow,hardly real, with tin-ear ultra-boring dialog; as for her dead former boyfriend Chris (come on--these names are thin and silly emblems!Changez? Am-Erica? Chris-tian?), he's nothing but a lame and fragile plot device. Most objectionable, I found the arrogance and hatred in this book chilling.  Though it is a literary bust, the book provides some depressing political insight into the vital significance of shame in incubating the politics of hatred. Probably more than poverty or oppression alone, humiliation is an important driver of   fundamentalist wrath. We do not understand the depths of frustrated feelings of entitlement, and this book shines a light, however inadvertently, on this important if ugly phenomenon.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|[...]This film has believable action compared to the last few Bond films before Casino Royale and has some great set pieces, this is what action films should be like, great acting from Matt Damon and supporting cast, I even love the music as well and cant wait for this to come out on HD DVD as the 2nd film looks awesome on it. [...]
B00002428O|5.0|Well if you like them this is a must have. Lots of that mind stretching harmonies and melodies.
1596912367|5.0|This is just a topnotch job.  The quality of the writing is superb, and espionage fans will especially enjoy the intriguing story it details.  The characters are thoroughly developed, and the locations are nicely evoked, especially, I'm sure, for readers who've had the fortune to visit them on their own.  I found the ending of the story especially strong, perhaps because it was as well done as all that preceded it -- not just a perfunctory tying up of loose ends or a bloody shootout.
1416914285|3.0|This book was so good, i thought it was going to replace Twilight, but then i read the ending and it grossed me out big time. i mean wouldn't you want to throw up, if Clary was in love with her brother! i mean they kissed once in the book, but what if they went farther then that! it took me two days to recover from that book. i recommend that you read half of the book and make up your own ending!lol but people do have different thoughts about that part. my thought is ewwwwww!!!!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|For those who haven't heard this record, buy it, and listen to it about 10 times in a row.  You might not think it's all that special at first, but TRUST ME, you will soon find it to be one of the most incredible releases in recent years.  If you liked \\"Funeral,\\" you MUST have this record, as it is even better than its predecessor!  Get it NOW!  You won't regret it.

0618680004|2.0|The problem seems to be that neither Gods existence nor his Non-existence can be subject to scientific proof. The disappointment of  scientists like Prof.Dawkins is that after the age of enlightment parts of mankind thought that science will conquer belief. It didn't and it never will. For two reasons: Large proportions of science are belief in itself (a scientist who arrogantly  tells the world that science now understands the origin of the universe is close to the belief of Mary having been a virgin - you believe it or you don't). Trying to proof the existence of God by mere natural means (whatever that implies) levels us human beings with God - a pretty presumptuous undertaking. Proofs for this frustration are partly Dawkins strong feelings of aggression. To understand all this I highly recommend some of the works of C.G.Jung. To men like Dawkins it must be further frustrating that religion gradually does return on a higher scientific scale instead of vanishing - he probably has a hard time that one can belief in a creator, not be a fanatic and still be an intellectual, looking at the world as it is, but knowing that there is so much behind reasoning that one would fall short only believing in one God: Science itself. In reverse of what Prof.Dawkins thinks, atheistic scientists who don't accept anything under the sun but their handmade ethics can be as much of a threat to human beings as religious fanatics. Pope John Paul II said: \\"Science can cleanse religion from misconception and superstition, religion can cleanse science from idolatry and absolutism\\".    There are only very few books who deal with the subject in an intelligent all embracing  way. One is \\"Jean Guitton - God an science (Dieu et la science, 1991)\\" - the great Christian French philosopher discusses with two agnostic Russian astrophysicists the origin of life.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I can respect a band wanting to be creative or explore new territories, but I can't determine what LP is trying to do with this \\"sophmore\\" effort.  It's a quality production, but I was hoping for more energy from them after such a long time coming.  I did not expect a mellow release from them and compared to their other two CD's, this is mellow.
B000EF7W3Y|4.0|Is anyone else getting tired of reissues that monkey around with the format of the original release?  Don't get me wrong, I love a second disc or even some bonus tracks thrown on at the end.  But lengthening songs or adding new ones right in the middle of things (like the other Waterboys reissues have) just mucks with the whole remembered experience.  I want \\"World Party\\" to sound just like it did when I first heard it twenty years ago, not with some improvised \\"natural\\" ending.  You wouldn't add new paint to the Mona Lisa, and you shouldn't add new music to Fisherman's Blues!  Throw the \\"full length\\" versions on the second disc, but leave the original LP alone.  It is art, after all.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious, and worth seeing if you need a laugh. I saw this in theatres with a group of friends, and our sides were hurting from how much this show made us laugh. I was only hoping we didn't offend any of the hard core fans who were watching the movie too. It was a very funny show, but had it not been funny, then I would have given it 1 star.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I am new to Megadeth and found this was a great CD.  Easy to listen to and was a blast on the first listen.    Now it is something I look forward to hearing.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is a really good movie musical!  It seemed that, within the last ten years, movie musicals have started to suck. This one was actually quite good. I saw many celebrities that I never knew could sing, like Richard Gere.  What I liked most about this show is that, instead of randomly bursting into song, the songs were performed separated from the events of the show; they served more like commentary. It reminded me, somewhat, of the movie of Cabaret, which restricted the songs to the stage and served as commentary. This is an excellent soundtrack, and the songs are very jazzy.  Some of my personal favorites are \\"All That Jazz\\", \\"Cell Block Tango\\", \\"We Both Reached for the Gun\\", \\"Mr.Cellophane\\", and \\"Hot Honey Rag.\\" I recommend this CD and its movie to all.
B000O174CM|4.0|Have you ever see Eddie Murphy act like that...wow, the man of many faces can also sing and does a great job with his character...but there is more here than just Eddie, we have the Dreamgirls who will enchant you with the several songs they present. The production and direction of this film is slick and things dont get boring too long. It is a musical, and they do sing a lot, so it helps to like music/musicals to really enjoy this film. Hope there are more musical films in the making....<br />Good for multiple viewings....<br />Oh before i forget....im giving a Virtual Oscar to Eddie Murphy.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|This is a great spoof of vampire movies.  It's quite funny, albeit slightly boring.  I do love this movie though.  I'd also like to recommend the musical based on this movie, \\"Tanz der Vampire.\\"
B000001GXJ|5.0|Claudio Abbado's reign at La Scala produced some of the finest productions of Verdi's operas ever mounted on the stage.  From that prolific era came his dark and revolutionary Macbeth (Verrett, Cappuccilli, Tagliavini), the greatest Don Carlo (Freni, Carreras, Cappucilli, Ghiaurov, Obraztsova), the most powerful Aidas (Arroyo, Domingo, Cossotto, Cappuccilli), and this outstanding Simon Boccanegra.  Although I regard Don Carlo as one of Verdi's greatest achievements, I think this Boccanegra is the crown jewel in Abbado's extensive discography of great performances.  He led a fascinating team of soloists with the La Scala orchestra and the great Italian opera producer Giorgio Strehler in what was the greatest stage production of Simon Boccanegra in operatic history.  I don't think even Giancarlo del Monaco's dark, elegant sets combat this magnificent production in terms of symbolic lighting, stage direction, and production value.      Credit must be given primarily to Abbado for handling such a complex Verdi score.  The luminescent and chiaroscuro shades and the dramatic colors begged by the 1881 revision of the score presents a challenge to any conductor willing to undertake the difficult task of presenting the work before an audience.  In several aspects, I think Simon Boccanegra is second only to Don Carlo and Otello as the most difficult works of Verdi to conduct.  In my opinion, only Abbado, Serafin, Mitropoulos, and recently, Fabio Luisi, have been able to successfully bring out the shades of ochre, crimson, and sienna that characterize this masterpiece.  Abbado, of course, attained perfection in his interpretation of the score when he realized the many subtleties.  The La Scala strings have never sounded more shimmering and beautiful, and the typical Verdian musical language is gracefully incorporated by Abbado into producing dramatic moments rather than distinctive arias.  No, Abbado doesn't treat it like Otello, but rather as the continuous drama that it should be with elements of early Donizettian style taken from his incubation period to the thespian sense of his latter years.      Saying that, I think the cast also contributes to the success of this recording.  In the history of the opera's performances, there is perhaps no Amelia more successful than Mirella Freni, and by that I say that she is better than Renata Tebaldi, Zinka Milanov, Antonietta Stella, Astrid Varnay, Karita Mattila, and Kiri te Kanawa, among the other singers who have assumed this demanding spinto role.  Her beautiful, youthful timbre, her natural sense of phrasing, her mastery of the language, and her impeccable legato line allow her to focus herself on the drama of the performance, thus giving us a three-dimensional portrait of Amelia often turned into a cardboard cut character by most sopranos.  A definitive performance indeed, and perhaps her greatest Verdi character on record.  Gabriele Adorno is played by the youthful Jose Carreras, whose youthful, sweet tone is a refreshing change of pace among the dramatic bulls who have no business sticking their noses in a role where lyricism favors dramatic weight.  I would say that he and Carlo Bergonzi are the greatest exponents of this short yet elegant tenor role.  The roles of Paolo and Fiesco are taken respectively by Jose Van Dam and Nicolai Ghiaurov, two of the greatest low male voices in the history of opera.  Nicolai Ghiaurov gives a searingly noble characterization of Fiesco, much like the grand portrayal he gave of King Filippo II in Don Carlo.  I would say that he and Ferruccio Furlanetto are the only basses to have given so much insight to this role.    In addition to all those amazing singers, I believe that the reason to get this recording is to listen to the Doge of Piero Cappuccilli.  There is no doubt that he was one of the greatest Verdi baritones of a bygone era, and in perspective with his Amonasros, Rodigros, di Lunas, and Iagos, there is perhaps no greater assumption of this role than what Cappuccilli has to offer.  There is a nobility, a compassion, and a elegiac quality to his singing that elevates his Boccanegra to a definitive status.  Without a doubt, one of the greatest characterizations in his long career.    My verdict?  This is the best recording of the opera that you will find in the market, so I hope you don't waste a chance to grab it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|No movie i have ever seen takes you on such an emotional ride as this film. From hilarity, to a romance comedy, to the horrors of a concentration camp and tragedy and finally a glorious sweet ending.   <br />  <br />This movie is about 3 people and their love for each other in facist Italy. A man, wife and child. Unfortunately the father and son are abducted and taken to a concentration camp because they are jewish. Their mother who is not jewish insists that they take her on that train also. That's love, that's courage. From the beginning guido tries to convince his son that it is really a game. As someone who has a son close to that age i can imaging the gut wrenching pain of knowing your son is hungry, scared and miserable. Guido's lies help soften the suffering some. Nothing in this movie makes light of what went on there. His son escapes death only because he hates taking baths and is able to sneak back to their quarters. You see the hard labor, you see their numbers declining as more \\"don't make it\\". You see the cold heart of a nazi doctor who was a friend of guido years back but makes no effort to help him.   <br />  <br />Any reviewer who claims this makes light of the holocaust didn't see the movie.   <br />  <br />A beautiful film. One of the best in the decade of the 90s.
0440243777|5.0|I am an avid reader of Grisham's gripping legal thrillers, and I must say that The Partner is one of his best, along with A Time to Kill and The Firm.<br /><br />From the heart pumping introduction to the dramatic climax, The Partner will have you up all night wishing you could just finish before you fell asleep. However, I felt that the ending needed an epilogue, because I was crestfallen with the final twist. I would recommend this book to all fiction readers and fans of Grisham. This read is top-notch.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|All of the classic tunes are here.  What's even better is that they are in chronological order.  You can listen to this album from start to finish and get a glimpse into how the Beatles evolved over the years they were together.  A must have for any fan of classic music.  The Beatles have truly stood the test of time and this album is proof.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|This is a standard Stoner rock album by my standards, with a bit more of it at times sounding like white stripes rather than Queens.  There are about three stand out tracks, 3. Sick Sick Sick, 8. 3&7's, and 10. River in the Road.  The rest is just a blend of long drawn out slow hard rock, not to stand out.  This is quite a bit different from Songs for the Deaf (my favorite by these guys), and a step down from Lullibies to Paralyze.  Still worth picking up if you are a collector, but if you are new, check out the other albums before picking this up.  Don't be mislead by the few singles on the radio at this time, this album will take a bit to fully appreciate.  Get it while it's on sale.
B000OCZD60|5.0|I'm rating this 5-stars not because it's the best look HD-DVD ever, but because I believe this is certainly the best presentation of Road Warrior that's ever been released, or will ever likely be released.  It's a keeper.<br /><br />I remember seeing this movie in the theater.  I don't think even the film as shown in the theater contained this much detail, as I noticed details in the movie that I had not seen before.  It's a excellent picture.<br /><br />The sound is good, but nothing like blockbuster movies from recent years, because Road Warrior was made several years ago, and not exactly on a huge budget.  Still, it's the best sound quality you're likely to hear for this movie.<br /><br />Some purists may enjoy the fact that the movie is shown with the title \\"Mad Max 2\\" rather than \\"The Road Warrior\\" at the beginning, but I don't like it.  When I saw the movie in the theater it said \\"The Road Warrior\\", and had a bright shining metal effect.  I wanted to see THAT, not something that was originally shown in Austrailia.  However, I'm not going to get all misty over it and lower the star rating.<br /><br />If you have Road Warrior on DVD or LaserDisc this is one title that you should absolutely buy the replacement HD-DVD.  It makes a big difference.
B00003CWN3|5.0|There's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said in the other reviews, but I do have a few extra comments.<br /><br />Swank's performance really is incredibly brave and convincing. I was surprised not necessarily by how good her performance was, but how brave she was in really throwing herself whole-hog into the role and truly becoming a man. Her performance adds another vast dimension to the movie, particularly as I feel that in her performance alone does the character's motivation come through. You can sense just how exciting it is for her to flirt with becoming free of her gender, even if what she's doing is getting in a bar fight or doing stupid stunts on the back of a pickup. You can sense her euphoria at getting a taste of the experience of being a man. This creates the motivation for her character, as the man she wants to be IS the kind of guy who would get hurt and get into the kind of trouble she does. This is one case where the performance really IS one third of what the film as a whole is and I have no problem with Hilary Swank walking off with the best actress Oscar.<br /><br />I am surprised that so many people at the time said the film was poorly directed. I think that Pierce has definitely watched her share of David Lynch films and uses what she's learned to cast an air of unreality and mythological significance to the events. I thought the sex scene was particularly good, because you see on Lana's face how Brandon is pleasing her in ways that her other boyfriends couldn't possibly. This is much more subtly done than in other lesbian films, where a character would probably have a line like \\"well everyone knows that only a woman knows what a woman wants\\" or something else-- this film is more powerful because it doesn't preach or be too heavy-handed. It is not without viewpoint, but it handles the matter subtly.<br /><br />It's a little frustrating watching the movie just how stupid Brandon is, but hey, it's a true story and the film makes him out to be stupid and unstable from the start.<br /><br />I'm gay, and as such I found this film's tagline upon release, \\"A true story about finding the courage to be yourself,\\" entirely disgusting. This is not about finding the courage to be yourself, it's about messed-up people who are at the mercy of forces within themselves that are beyond their control. It's about people who are so undersocialized that they have no way of knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel. I am so sick of the whole marketing slant of \\"Being-gay-is-just-such-a-heartwarming-growing-experience\\" that I truly want to vomit. I would like to think that someone out there could credit gay people with enough intelligence to accept that not everything about being gay or lesbian is a wonderful, warm, and affirming experience. I also think a tagline like that trivializes the emotions and experiences of the characters in a film like this. Luckily the film itself is free of such sentimentality.film makes him out to be stupid and unstable from the start.  <br />  <br />I'm gay, and as such I found this film's tagline upon release, \\"A true story about finding the courage to be yourself,\\" entirely disgusting.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|A tad more violent than it needed to be, but this was a great continuation of the Firefly story.  It answered many questions from the series and made the movie even more enjoyable. They pushed scientific possibility a bit far - but you're so busy enjoying the story and numerous surprises that you'll only realise it much later after the movie.  Having seen the full series and movie now I hope they find a way to continue the story. If you enjoyed the story and humor of the series, you can't go wrong with the DVD.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Allright, a lot of people here are bashing this album because its \\"not heavy enough\\" or that it \\"isn't the QOTSA they're used to.\\"  If there is one thing you can expect from QOTSA its that you never know what to expect.  Even the members of the band vary from album to album, so how can you expect them to sound exactly like they did on the last record?  That said, this is a great record.  It is creative and unique throughout, and is overflowing with Homme's talent, in addition to the contributions from the rest of the band.  On the first listen, it comes across a bit rough, but give this a chance and it will blow your mind.  Good heavy stuff: Sick Sick Sick, Battery Acid and 3's and 7's.  Great slower songs: Into the Hollow, Make it Wit Chu and Suture Up Your Future.  Not a good album to start your collection with, as it is quirky, but a GREAT addition to a fan's collection.  Rock on QOTSA!!!
0060589280|5.0|Eleven Minutes was my introduction to Paulo Coelho, and what a start - this is a beautifully written story despite the debatable subject matter which is portrayed tastefully at all times. The author manages to cover such topics as sexual abuse and sado-masochism yet retain an aura of eloquence. Now, that's style.<br /><br />This is one of those stories that I keep thinking about and remembering, three years after I turned the final page, and few books have left impressions like that on me. Come to think about it, Eleven Minutes is one of the most memorable books I have read throughout my not-so-young life.<br />Coelho is an artist and an inspiration not only to his readers, but to other writers as well. Add this to your library if you can.
0060853980|5.0|To all the superior reviews already posted for this book, I can only add:    1.  If you like Christopher Moore and Tom Robbins, you're going to LOVE this book.    2.  I would dearly love to see this on the big screen--if directed and produced properly in the spirit of the book itself.    Wonderfully wicked fun!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Think soul...think hot guitar riffs...think about amazing lyrics about relationships and life into just one album...there is only one person I can think of who can accomplish this and that is Paolo Nutini. I heard of Nutini a year before the album was released in the U.S. and I was amazed by what I heard. Songs like \\"Rewind\\" and \\"Allowgrove\\" are amazing. But it is the songs like \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\", \\"New Shoes\\", and \\"Loving You\\" that make this album as hot as it is. Just one listen to it and its first track and you will be hooked. Nutini is the real \\"it\\" and his career will surely launch with his raw and true style; something that is very unique among todays industry. My personal favorites are \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" \\"Rewind\\" \\"New Shoes\\" and \\"Loving Me.\\" Buy the album and you will see exactly what I mean.
B000001FTJ|5.0|I've had a cassette copy of this album since college. From day one it was noisy and scratchy, I take a pervese pleasure in the idea that Tom would almost prefer it that way. After being a companion on countless roadtrips the tape had become so worn that I had to replace it. The CD was like hearing it for the first time, there are sonic nuances I've missed for years. This is an iconic work from an American original. The dark pictures he paints in songs like Shore Leave and Soldier's Things are bracing and bitterly refreshing in an age of increasingly shallow and meatless pop culture prefab \\"musicians\\".

If you're looking for a bunch of theory or equations or numbers and lab hocus pocus... go somewhere else.  If you're looking for the straight shot on how to do something, without a lot  of depth, start here. Once you get on the right track you should be able to figure out the rest, or know you need more information and go find it.

0156013983|5.0|My first book ever was The little prince.  It was my dad's first present on the day I was born.  Since then I have read it at least 20 times, and every time I read it it delivers a different message.  I think this is a book that will be enjoyed by kids as well as adults.  This french version is beautiful, and very similar to the one my dad gave me in spanish.  Has the original drawings with nice colors. As someone stated this book can be interpreted in different ways and that's why it's so magical. I consider it one of the best short stories ever.  A true masterpice.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|I've been a QOTSA fan for a long time, but this album is a definite departure for the worse. Not nearly enough of the heavy riffs we have come to expect. Most of the songs are passable, but only a few stick out. \\"Sick, Sick, Sick,\\" \\"Into the Hollow\\", and \\"Misfit Love\\" are all OK as far as the first half of the album goes, but definitely skip Battery Acid. After this point, the album starts to pick up, but it's a little too late. Definitely pick this up if you are a QOTSA fan, if only for the studio version of Make it Wit Chu with Mark Lanegan on vocals.<br /><br />I don't know, it sounds like they made this album for hipsters and not rockers. My two cents anyway.
184195392X|5.0|When I first started to read Life of Pi, it seemed a bit slow, did not know what direction it was going... reading on I really started to feel apart of this story. I could not put the book down, because I wanted to see what happened next. It was a great book and I would recommend it... I feel this book is a bit of reality and fantasy, so it might not be for everyone...but I loved it...

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I did not like this movie the first time I saw it. I watched it a second time at a friend's house and decided to buy it. It is a quirky, funny, and enjoyable movie. Sometimes, it is fun to cheese out and enjoy a silly movie.  Amazon delivered it promptly with no problems.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Q: How good is BBC's Planet Earth?    A: So good that I paid $60 to own it now, and will gladly pay another $60 for the HD DVD version the very instant I can afford an HDTV and an HD DVD Player.  And then, when super space-aged 3D HD DVD comes out, I'll pay another $60 for that version!  And so on, ad infinitum.      Q: Can you compare David Attenborough's narration to the narration provided by Sigourney Weaver for the American Discovery Channel production?    A: Can you compare filet mignon with a big steamy plate of turd stroganoff?  Ms. Weaver is an excellent actor and, by all accounts, a fine woman. However, when it comes to narration of wildlife documentaries, there is only one David Attenborough.  Documenting nature is his life's work and I strongly suggest making an effort to appreciate his efforts while you can. Don't you wish that you had shown your gratitude to Orville Redenbacher while you had the chance?    Q: Have you seen the HD version?    A: I have seen bits and pieces, and I would describe its cinematic spectacle as borderline erotic. Not the animals, mind you. We're talking straight production value here.       Q: Would you recommend this program for children?    A: I would unequivocally recommend this program for persons of all ages.  Young children will be mesmerized by the awe-inspiring views of our planet and some of its more curious inhabitants.  With respect to \\"predator v. prey\\" scenes, there are several points worth noting. First, Planet Earth does a very nice job of minimizing carnage.  Children may not even recognize the brutal implications of many such scenes.  Second, Planet Earth can be used by parents as a tool to help breach important life lessons, such as the inescapable nature of death. Better they should learn it here than from the next instantiation of Grand Theft Auto.  Lastly, as the children age and experiment with recreational drugs, they will find that Planet Earth is a far better A/V supplement than The Wizard of Oz playedin sync with \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"
B00007LTIC|5.0|I special-ordered this great album from my local Borders.  Defective.  Special ordered another one, defective again.  Gave up trying.  Anybody want to sell me theirs?
B000PKG6TE|5.0|The new Queens album rocks. It rocks hard, and I'm here to proclaim it's greatness. These negative reviews puzzle me. This is the same band that all of you supposedly love, just dirtier and even sexier. Era Vulgaris grooves like a snake slithering through a greasy garage. Instead of stating my disgust at the ignorance and impatience of the supposed fans, i'll do a brief track by track.     1.Turnin' On The Screw 9/10...Amazing opener. A song that grinds through to it's conclusion and features an amazing chorus and you'll dreamily float to it's 5:20 conclusion.  2.Sick, Sick, Sick 9/10...After you've been slightly rocked with the opener, the perverbial rock bar is raised here. This sweaty slight punk rocker is an amazing song and the riffs layed down here leave me in awe with each listen.   3.I'm Designer 8.8/10...A very unorthadox track more in the vain of \\"Skin On Skin.\\" A wild song with a soaring chorus, great track.  4.Into The Hollow 9/10...A slower melodic peace with a Radiohead Kid A-era riff that slides through flawlessly with Josh Homme crooning in his irresistable falsetto voice.  5.Misfit Love 10/10...This track sums up the album. The first minute and a half let the song warm up, with the hypnotic drum beat and NIN esque mechanical guitar riff. This song grinds through it's near 6 minute duration, and you almost feel dirty after it. No shower will be needed though, because this song is ever so good.  6.Battery Acid 8.5/10...Another unorthadox rocker. The song lives up to the title. A quick rocker with almost a soul like chorus, and grinds through the distorted guitar quite nicely.  7.Make It Wit Chu 10/10...A prior Desert Sessions song, and what a great one it is. My favorite song on the album so far. A slower track that shakes flawlessly through it's funk like bassline and tasty piano. Homme's voice is nearly flawless and stay tuned for a delicious bluesy solo.  8.3's & 7's 9.5/10...Now we're talking. This is vintage Queens. A true \\"stoner rocker\\", that wouldn't be out of place right next to Go With The Flow on 'Songs For The Deaf.' Great song.   9.Suture Up Your Future 9/10...Homme slows us down again; at least temporarily. A slick bassline carries most of the song, and the crashing rocking conclusion is a nice surprise.  10.River In The Road 7.5/10...Just about the only thing on that album that isn't outstanding. A pretty boring track for the most part, with the same drum rhythm throughout, albeit a good rhythm but oh so repetitive. The lone track with Mark Lanegan at the mic, and it is largely forgettable.  11.Run, Pig, Run 8/10...Such an unusual way to carry out the album. A hypnotic drum and guitar riff carry the verses before leading into a wordless almost circus like chorus. Seems like a song that would be playing in a nightmare...good song, weird closer.    Overall, stands right next to the elites in the Queens catalogue. Great record and i'm glad Homme still has it in him to make great albums without Oliveri by his side. Keep rocking gentlemen, and don't be fooled by these bad reviews, on live Queens..
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Batman 5 is a great movie and in HD it is amazing.  HD-DVD version is considerably better looking than its blu-ray counterpart.  I watched them both just flipping the input function, and HD-DVD had a lot better darks and was more crip.  In a lot of HD-DVD bluray comparisons that is common.<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommend HD-DVD Batman Begins.

0385340559|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have read just about all of the Jack Reacher books and I believe that \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is the best. I won't go into detail about the book there are many already, except one tid-bit surprise: Reacher is no longer in Miami, now he is stirring things up in Portland, and  Neagley with all her skills and resources returns. The plot is exciting and the story will keep you turning pages. The characters are well developed and the ending was super. When you read the book I think that you will be surprised at Child's clever conclusion.<br /><br />Mr. Child is one of my favorite authors. In some ways I wish that there was not such a long gap between his novels, but I can appreciate his high standards, so his literary works are worth the wait.<br /><br />In my opinion, I find it rare for authors, like Child that will give that extra 6 or 8 months to ensure that their writings are worthy of their readers time and money.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|This album is a mixture of the instrumental theme, which is incredibly beautiful and haunting, and some very solid country songs. I was surprised by how good the other songs were (you still have to like country music, though). There are only two songs that I don't like at all, and those are the two by Rufus Wainwright - one a cover of \\"King of the Road\\" (originally by Roger Miller). They are great demonstrations of him at his most nasal and whiny. It sounds like he is a French guy holding his nose and singing too slow. It's too bad, because they are good songs otherwise. I guess if you like him, you're golden; but I can't stand these versions. Fortunately, the rest of the disc is really good.
1569242739|5.0|As a big fan of the author's last book, Vegan With A Vengeance, I was excited  to check out this cute book when it finally hit the shelves. I was not disappointed! It's got the same fun, snappy style that makes vegan cooking and baking a breeze, and the recipes are yummy enough to satisfy any omnivore. I wish all cookbooks were able to combine ethics and style so successfully! Definitely on my list of holiday presents to give this year.
0141023384|5.0|Things Fall Apart was written about 50 years ago by Chinua Achebe, one of the earlier African writers.    It is the story of Okonkwo, a Nigerian man from the Ibo tribe, who lives in his tribal village according to well established, intricate, age old customs and traditions of his people.  Okonkwo is a hardened, ambitious and exacting man who fears failure. Striving hard in all his endeavors he pushes himself to the limit and all the people around him have to struggle to keep up to his demands.  He is a highly successful self made man, not without his sensitive side. In his day, age and circumstances he was probably what we would call a tycoon on Wall Street today! The story goes on to narrate the impact of colonialism and the break down of the established social structures and traditions that leaves \\"the tycoon\\" a broken man at the end of his days.    What really sets this book apart as a world class piece of exceptional literature is Achebes beautiful style of writing. If you love English you will love this book for its fine prose penned in a fluent and simple vocabulary. It is very readable and highly recommended for young adults too.
B00005AR3G|5.0|YZMA--\\"Tell us where the talking llamer is, and we'll burn your house to the ground.\\"<br />KRONK--\\"Uh, don't you mean, or?\\"<br />YZMA--(heavy sigh) \\"Tell us where the talking llamer is, OR we'll burn your house to the ground.\\"<br />PACHA'S-DAUGHTER-WHOSE-NAME-I-FORGET--\\"Well, which is it? That seems like a pretty crucial conjunction.\\"<br /><br />That is one of my favorite quotes from the movie. Which isn't saying much, for if I were to tell you ALL my favorite quotes, I would be quoting the entire movie. Which I can do. But I don't think anyone here wants that.<br /><br />Featuring the considerable talents of David Spade, Patrick Warburton, Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, and others, this movie is, in a word, gorgeous. It is one of the only animated movies I can watch now, as a fifteen-year-old, and still adore. (Though I'd love to see the originally planned film, KINGDOM OF THE SUN -- it sounds interesting, according to the professional reviews.)<br /><br />Matching Kronk's wackiness is Yzma's hilarious villainy (\\"Pull the lever, Kronk! WRONG LEVEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\") and matching off Kuzco's selfishness and sarcastic wit is Pacha the peasant. In this movie you end up rooting for the \\"villains\\" -- Kronk and Yzma -- almost as much as Kuzco and Pacha. Kuzco is, of course, at the beginning, more a villain than a good guy anyway.<br /><br />THE PLOT: By firing his millenia-old adviser Yzma, Emperor Kuzco gets himself a death wish from said advisor, aided by her hapless right-hand man, Kronk, who accidentally mixes up the poison with extract of llama and turns the former emporor into a long-necked hairball. Too softhearted to hurl the bratty eighteen-year-old Emperor over the edge of a waterfall, he accidentally trips and throws the bag holding Kuzco onto the cart of Pacha, the leader of a village Kuzco means to demolish in order to build himself a summer house with waterslide -- \\"It's my birthday gift to me!!!\\" Together, Pacha and Kuzco must get Kuzco back to the palace and back into human form -- but meanwhile the new empress Yzma has found out about Kronk's blunder and is chasing him too -- or, rather, Kronk is, and she's riding in a litter he's wearing as a backpack.<br /><br />I can't give much more enthusiastic praise for this movie than I've already given, but I'll just leave you with one last, classic quote between Yzma and Kronk.<br /><br />\\"WHAT? A llama? HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!\\"<br />\\"Yeah...weird.\\"<br />....<br />\\"Take him out of town and finish the job! NOW!\\"<br />\\"But what about dinner?\\" (Kronk is a talented chef, did I mention that?)<br />\\"Kronk...this is kind of important.\\"<br />\\"But what about dessert?\\"<br />\\"Ah -- well, I suppose there's time for dessert.\\"<br />(Kronk nods eagerly) \\"And coffee!\\"<br />\\"All right, a quick cup of coffee. THEN TAKE HIM OUT OF TOWN AND FINISH THE JOB!\\"<br /><br />Rating: Very Goodm -- but meanwhile the new empress Yzma has found out about Kronk's blunder and is chasing him too -- or, rather, Kronk is, and she's riding in a litter he's wearing as a backpack.    I can't give much more enthusiastic praise for this movie than I've already given, but I'll just leave you with one last, classic quote between Yzma and Kronk.    \\"WHAT? A llama?

B00000427L|5.0|A number of years ago, I went to the Classical Record Store in Toronto to acquire a copy of Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos. Like many others, I'd been introduced to Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto by the movie \\"Shine\\". When I asked the resident musicologist for Rach 3, she rolled her eyes. I explained that I wasn't remotely interested in the commercial David Helfgott version. I wanted the definitive version. She smiled knowingly and took me to a shelf. This is the version she handed me. Buy it. You won't be disappointed! Ashkenazy is at the peak of his powers and Previn does a phenomenal job with the London Symphony. It doesn't get any better than this.
0743550927|5.0|I read this book a several years ago and didn't want to finish it, it was so good. So imagine my delight listening to the author, \\"Frankie,\\" telling the story, singing the songs, changing his voice to suit the character and not saying, \\"Chapter Three . . . etc.\\"!!! The CDs just continue, one into the next, and it's almost like having access to a controlled substance! Wonderful stuff!!!
B000002KBU|5.0|I'd only heard \\"Til it's gone\\" from Joni. But I kept seeing this in hi-end stereo magazines (I'm putting a system together) used as a testing source. So, I looked it up and saw the rave around it. Anyway, it has lived up to the rave. 'Tis excellent. I just listened to it three times (consecutively).
B00006RINF|5.0|I own all of Lacuna Coil's music and, like all the others, I find this release  simply great.  Cristina's vocals are, as usual, impeccable.  And Andrea's vocals contrast so nicely with Cristina's heavenly voice.  Is this an unbiased review?  not by any means.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie. It has great characters, great music, great animation. Each time I see it with my grand-daughter, I find something else I missed because of laughing. This is the type of movie we need to be making for our children instead of the violence ridden cartoons. Children become what they see and hear... Happy Feet has an abundance of lessons for children on not excluding others because they are just a little different. It also allows children to learn how forgiving others can help to enrich relationships, and that one person can make a difference...even in the area of the environment.
B000J103YI|5.0|Great CD! A total sing along. Puts me in a great mood!
0767903862|5.0|I like to equate \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" to Australia itself.  It seems to go on forever, and at some points you just want to stop, but when it is finally over you are pining for more.    I'm reluctant to give this five stars, only because I don't want to seem like \\"that guy\\" who gives everything five stars.  But what the hell, it deserves it.    What made this book so excellent is Bryson's perfect blend of wit, wonder and historical facts.  He never overwhelms the reader with too much dry information, his humour isn't derived from negative Australian stereotypes and he always brings to life what a wonderful, strange country it really is.  The cast of characters, so to speak, are simply superb and I'm glad that Bryson decided to include them in this book.    Some people might criticize the fact that Bryson didn't spend a lot of time in each location, or that he missed some really good locations, but I think this is entirely fine.  One of the main themes of this book is that Australia is simply huge and the spaces between civilized areas are massive. If he decided to spend more time in each location, why, he would still be there today.    Bryson's sense of humour in this book is just phenomenal.  His conversations with his friends, his mental dialogues and the commentary about Australia's strange history will make you chuckle delightfully, if not laugh out loud.    This book isn't a comprehensive history of Australia, nor would I want it to be.  What Bryson does instead of boring us to death with a dry revival is pick out some of the most interesting little tidbits of Australian history and present them to us in a way that really gives us a greater understanding of the country.  He often uses the historical examples to prove a point, such as the poor sod Harold Holt and the dangers Down under, and the Japanese atomic bomb that nobody noticed because Australia is so big and empty.    As a recent resident of Australia, I can personally vouch for the claims that he makes about the country.  It is outstandingly beautiful, the people are unfailingly laid back and accommodating, and you will die if you aren't careful.    This book was an absolute treat to read.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I've never watched a film that was so captivating and exciting.  I literally felt exhausted by the end of the movie... which is a good thing in my book.  And DiCaprio proved that he really is one of the finest actors of his era.  If I had a 3rd hand, I'd give 3 thumbs up.  Incidentally an enthusiastic 2 will just have to do.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna has released a solid summer album with lots of upbeat dance music and catchy lyrics. Though she is weaker vocally on the slow songs, they are still tolerable. \\"Say It\\" and \\"Rehab\\" are the most favorable of the slower songs and will probably make great radio hits. The fast songs are all great and are easily her best songs on the CD. The first five, \\"Umbrella\\", \\"Push Up on Me\\", \\"Don't Stop the Music\\", and \\"Shut Up and Drive\\", have more of the pop/rock/r&b sound while  \\"Sell Me Some Candy\\" and \\"Lemme Get That\\" are more r&b/reggae.     This CD is a little bit light on the R&B feel, but that is not a bad thing. Her rock infused pop/r&b/reggae sound sets her apart from other female r&b singers, and it also gives her some crossover appeal.     If you purchase this CD with realistic expectations and an awareness of Rihanna's style and musical abilities, you will not be disappointed. Actually, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is a breath of fresh air from the usual R&B fare.

From all the icons I've seen in my life - \\"A seagull flying high in the sky + the sound of BE\\" is one of the strongest. An absolutelly beautiful work, timeless, for all times, powerful as our own will, transparent, marvelous to the tears roll down for pure emotions. To me, this music put sound to the book. A book I read 15, 20, 30 times? I don't know. Every theme evokes part of JL Seagul's journey - \\"Lonely looking sky, lonely sky\\" - Provably one of the best spiritual go up music made in the western culture. The journey to awakening is lonely...now you can fly with this music as a companion and don't fasten your seatbelt.
0743554450|5.0|I found this to be \\"an excellent read\\" even though I listened to the book instead of actually reading it.

B000OVLBEO|2.0|Drawing from 'Big Marvel' comics and the ancient myth of 'Faust,' 'Ghost Rider' trail blazes hell on earth.  With new dimensions in firey visuals, the movie gives us a lot to look at.  With semi-decent performances, the story skids over the \\"sell your soul to the devil\\" paradigm with a lot of pondering and repetition.  Sometimes it's entertaining; at other times profound, but too often the movie pauses and loses its cohesive tension.  Not that 'Ghost Rider' is meant to be great drama.  It is a comic book, yet mostly it comes off as stylish if not insipid in its development.      Motorcycle stunt rider, Johnny Blaze, is approached by Mephisto (Peter Fonda) one night while commiserating over his co-star father's terminal cancer.  Offering a deal he can't refuse, Johnny doesn't so much consent as he does bleed over a written contract that is binding as hell on earth.  Loving the crowd's admiration as a sort of Evel Kneivel of the ault years, Mephisto covets Johnny to be the devil's own bounty hunter for hell's escaped souls and a weapon against his own son's treasonous attempts to overthrow his reign.  While Johnny's nocturnal escapades make him seem like he's just going for the ride, his willful track is to bond with his girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes).  Meanwhile, narrator/cowboy, Carter Slade (Sam Elliott) may have the key he's looking for to find an escape clause.    'Ghost Rider' is enough of a spectacle to please an audience, but the story takes grand elements and makes a mediocre blend. It can be funny (To unwind Johnny guzzles down pots of coffee while listening to The Carpenters.)  Besides impressive combat scenes, it never really comes together.
B000P2A256|5.0|I was so excited when I found out Maroon 5 was planning to come out with another cd to follow up to SAJ. And right around the time of my birthday! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present. I received this 2 1/2 weeks ago and it's been the ONLY cd playing in my car since then. This CD is definitely worth the playing time!<br /><br />I wasn't too thrilled with the first run through the cd, but since then, it has grown on me like crazy! I agree that there are some filler songs sprinkled throughout the songlist, but overall, most all the songs have the ability to stand alone.<br /><br />I was first impressed with track# 2 - Makes Me Wonder, since I heard it on the radio weeks before the CD was out, so it quickly became my favorite on the CD. After more listening, I soon had many more favorites to listen to, including #3 & #4 - Little of Your Time and Wake Up Call, respectively.<br />#6 - Nothing Lasts Forever - aslower, more emotional track, loved it!!<br />#7 - Can't Stop is upbeat and catchy!<br />#8 - Goodnight, Goodnight is another slow one that draws you in.<br />#10 - Kiwi - quirky, light-hearted romp, easy on the ears<br />#11 & #12 - slow, sensual songs, perfect ending for the cd<br /><br />All in all, the lyrics and music are the epitomy of Maroon 5 style. Sensuous and pleasurable to listen to -  Highly recommended!!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|By the end of the year, I am confident this album will be one of the top 5 hard rock releases of 2007.  Maybe even top 3 if Pumpkins, V. Revolver, W.Stripes and Interpol suck.  This band is very talented and continues to deliver consistent material despite changing members.  Always refreshing and original.  Would you want an artist to sound exactly the same every album??  I wouldn't.  One of the reasons this band is so talented is their range, they can do uptempo and frenetic, mellow, and in-between stuff very well.  I like the whole album, but the immediate standouts are trks #2,3,4, and 9 -\\"Suture up your Future.\\"  This song captures my mood perfectly this year -all the stress I've been through the past 2 months.  Can't get it out of my head.  All three albums deserve 5 stars.  It'll be hard rating this album against Lullabies which I absolutely adore.
0679882820|4.0|Fun story for kids with great sounds and opportunities for them to try making them. Board book is not as complete as the original hard back version. But if you are looking for this title in a compact size with pages that kids can't tear, it's a winner.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Snakes & Arrows is Rush's first album in 5 years, since they released \\"Vapor Trails\\" to decidedly mixed reviews.  I count myself among the long-time Rush fans that were a little disappointed by that offering and wasn't really expecting anything new from the band.  Their 30th anniversary tour in the interim felt, to me, like a farewell tour.  But in \\"S&A,\\" Rush has delivered what in my opinion is their best album since \\"Roll The Bones.\\"  At first listen, I felt much differently, but after really taking the time to dissect the songs and let them grow on me (probably half a dozen listenings), I came to like it a lot.  In general, the first part of the album is much stronger than the last (excepting the instrumentals), but overall, Rush seems to have found a good groove on Snakes & Arrows.    Rush establishes several themes in the album.  First, drummer/lyricist Neil Peart has written that they tried to stick to more basic blues and rock song structures, with more intricate arrangements, an assessment that seems pretty accurate.  Secondly, guitarist Alex Lifeson does use a lot of acoustic guitar here.  Some reviewers seem annoyed by it, but I can't fault Alex for needing to experiment in the same way the band previous has with keyboards and electronic percussion.  In many ways, he seems to have the biggest role in shaping the music on this album.  Despite that, Geddy Lee's bass guitar parts are quite often front and center, more so than in the recent past and it works to great effect.  His parts really drive the opening track and first single from the album, \\"Far Cry.\\"  His bassline in the choruses really drive the song and are what make it so infectious.  That song is probably their best single in years.  It's worth cranking up the radio every time it comes on the local rock station.  Lyrically, Neil revists some familiar themes, such as his contrarian view of religion, faith, and spirituality.  You'll see that in \\"Armor & Sword,\\" \\"Faithless,\\" \\"Spindrift\\" (in a more general sense), and most impressively in \\"The Way The Wind Blows.\\"  In that latter piece, he strikes particularly contemporary criticisms of religious fundamentalism of all sorts, seemingly as much inspired by his exposure to rural America as to events in the Middle East.  What he says here is important and he says it well.  It might be nice, however, to see him branch out a bit.  I think his only misstep is the awfully-titled \\"Working Them Angels.\\"  The name came from one of his books and refers to a comment made about someone pushing their luck.  It makes a nice spoken colloquialism, a bit of printed folk wisdom, but truly rankles me when repeated in a song.  It's really too bad, because it detracts from what is otherwise one of the best tracks on the album.    \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" contains an unprecedented three instrumentals.  The first, \\"Main Monkey Business,\\" is the longest and apparently the only one originally slated for the album.  I feel that it is without a doubt the best instrumental Rush has made since \\"YYZ.\\"  Their more recent efforts for felt like \\"songs without words\\" rather than showcases for their individual instrumental virtuosity.  These guys have an unparalleled collection of chops - I wish they'd show them off as much as they used to.  \\"MMB\\" doesn't have as many notes or solos crammed in as their earliest instrumentals, but it is entirely fitting with the overall style of the album.  \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" also features all three, with an early Rush-style drum/ bass guitar exchange.  Neil wrote that this song was built off of some fretless bass riffs Geddy was playing with (a welcome change of texture here).  Neil did his part of a 4-piece drumset, a mere fraction of his usual setup and as a drummer, it's interesting to here how he works with a limited tool set.  The other instrumental, \\"Hope,\\" is an acoustic guitar solo by Alex.  Recorded from a single performance, Neil called it \\"poignant.\\"  I'll second his opinion.    Among the album's strongestpoints is \\"The Larger Bowl.\\"  It's my favorite song of the collection, not because of overwhelming musicality, which is usually my biggest draw, but because the song just clicks in a way that doesn't seem forced or overwrought.  Neil's somewhat unusual lyrical structure (the \\"Pantoum,\\" which apparently involves the repetition and elevation of specific lines of one stanza into the next) works unusually well (and invisibly) to reinforce the main concepts of the lyrics.      On the downside, Geddy's vocals seem to be in a weird place.  Either he's picked up a new vocal styling that might best be described as warbling or he's hitting the upper limit of his range.  On this album, there are several points where seems to hit this warble, such as the awkward \\"whoas\\" in \\"The Larger Bowl,\\" the \\"...nows\\" in \\"The Way the Wind Blows,\\" during the chorus of \\"Bravest Face,\\" and in \\"Good News First.\\"  Rush fans have noted for years that Geddy's falsetto isn't what it used to be, but he compensated nicely by bringing down the highest notes of the old songs during tours and composing new ones that stayed in his register.  Unfortunately, Geddy's loss of range has really cut down on the intensity of his singing, which was fine with the more laid back albums like \\"Presto,\\" where the mellowing of their music nicely matched his mellowing voice. But it creates a weird dichotomy during any of their harder songs (which  may be why the \\"Counterparts\\" album didn't sit well with me).  Without that vocal push, the driving rhythms in some of these songs seem ill-matched with the lack of vocal intensity (see addendum below).  For different reason, I was disappointed when listening to \\"The Way The Wind Blows.\\" The drum intro and first few bars lay down a totally unexpected conventional blues feel, then all but abandons it for the rest of the song.  Finally, I felt like the album ran out of steam toward the end and found little to note about the last three or four non-instrumental tracks.    As a drummer myself (and Peart idolizer), Neil's drum parts are always the first thing I listen for.  In keeping with the simpler structures, you won't find the odd time signatures that popped up with frequency early on.  The best you get in the songs is, for example, the seamless transition (does Rush have any other kind?) from 12/8 to 4/4 time in \\"Workin' Them Angels.\\"  You will hear Neil spend many more measures playing unadorned ride patterns than he used to.  While I found that Neil wasn't necessarily \\"dumbing down\\" his parts, they felt a little more conventional on the whole than in previous albums.  While perhaps appropriate for the style the band was shooting for, I didn't come away with the urge to see a lot of transcriptions from this album.  There are, of course, some great exceptions to that, such as \\"Main Monkey Business.\\"  Sharp-eared drummers will note the similarity between Neil's intro on \\"Armor & Sword\\" with the riff fellow drummer Dave Weckl used to open his track \\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\\" on the Peart-produced \\"Burning for Buddy\\" tribute album.  I like how Neil adapted this slightly syncopated jazz riff to a beefier rock styling.  You may also appreciate Neil's innovative (tongue in cheek here) use of the tambourine on \\"The Larger Bowl\\" that earned a separate credit on his back-cover bio.    Like any album, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" has its highlights and distractions, but its overall strength lies in the subtleties the band imbued in all the songs.  Those with the ear and patience for the sort of listening engagement required to appreciate those qualities will be well rewarded.  On the other hand, a casual listener picking this up as their first exposure to Rush probably won't be immediately hooked.  I look forward to seeing these guys play this new stuff once their tour kicks off soon, something I didn't necessarily look forward to in the recent past.    **I'd like to put in an addendum after seeing Rush in concert this past summer (for the umpteenth time).  Geddy's voals were demonstrably stronger throughout the concert than I've heard from him in years, either live or on studio recordings.  I'm not sure what he did in the past few years (or since recording S&A), but it worked marvelously.  I'm still not a fan of the \\"warbles\\" that  I describe above, but it's now clearly an intentional styling by Geddy rather than due to declining range.

I have been having some major problems in my life, death of love ones, son has cancer, a nervious breakdown and weight problems.  As I read each chapter I am finding all the conditions in my life are being address and helping me to live better.  Also, by reading this book I have just purchased the movie hoping it will illustrate all the wonderful things referred in this book.
B000003TBP|4.0|This is the album that solidified Beck more so in the mainstream after his first hit single, Loser, on Mellow Gold.  So far it's his most popular album, so if you're looking for some Beck after hearing a tune on the radio this is probably the one you want to go for.
0743496728|5.0|It was tough to get this book out of my mind--before and after I finished reading it. The topic is way too timely and gives insight into what may be going on in our society today in the world of high school students.  As always, the author tells the story from several perspectives.  I really like her style of writing and her topics are alway controversial. This one didn't disappoint me.
B000002GB2|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />In circa 1976 a group of punk rock/new wave/alternative fans that could actually read and write decided that Journey, Kansas, REO Speedwagon, and Styx were responsible for the problems of the world.  They labeled these groups \\"Corporate Rock.\\"  Astonishing to the normal people on earth was seeing the word corporate because it contained three syllables.  What these folks have never understood is the output of a band should be judged on the musical level and not the sales or lack there of.<br /><br />For that reason alone you should purchase this recording.<br /><br />On to serious business.  Styx has had three very distinct phases of the band.  The 1st would be the releases (4) on a small label \\"Wooden Nickel.\\"  Please check out the samples Amazon is kind enough to provide us on that period.  It includes the tremendous tune \\"Lady\\" as well as many other interesting compositions.<br /><br />Phase two would be \\"Equinox\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\", and \\"Grand Illusion.\\"  The next chapter would begin with \\"Pieces Of Eight.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes lost in the shuffle can be a recording or two that a band should be rather proud of.  \\"Equinox\\" and \\"Crystal Ball\\" will look good in any Styx fans CD collection.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Light Up\\" is straight ahead rock and roll.  Getting your attention right out of the starting gate and rightly so.  This is one of the finest tracks from the band.<br /><br />\\"Lorelei\\" with the catchy keyboard mix and strong vocals takes us in a different direction and we aren't distracted.<br /><br /> \\"Mother Dear\\" has really nice inter-play with the keyboards and guitar.  There is a vocal effect that makes the words stand out.<br /><br />\\"Lonely Child\\" offers very well done production.  The proper levels of guitar and voice are crucial for the song to thrive and thanks to the craftsmanship of the production team they have everything under control.<br /><br /> \\"Midnight Ride\\" is a relentless rocker.

B000I5YCCO|4.0|Heres what Im thinking ( But first of all ) This cd is so amazing.  Everytime a artist comes out I compare there album to my all time favorite debut cd Trisha Yeearwood's debut.  5 stars no doubt about it ! This is another great debut and Im thinking by a 15 yo.  Faith Hill didnt even strike me like Taylor Does.  I would have to say my persoanl faves on the album would have to be \\" Tied Together With A Smile \\" and \\" Cold As You \\" both song take the tug at your heart ( and it gets it ) Of course I love \\" Tim McGraw \\" and the beautiful \\" Teardrops on My Guitar \\" Even though I hate the name DREW.  Theres a reason why :-) But anyway this is a really great cd.  Very interesting  to let this 15ypo take you on a little journey.  Taylor rock on gurl !
B000002ULO|4.0|This is one of Paul's most excellent early solo works.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Transamerica is a riveting and absorbent masterpiece about a man in the final process of transforming himself into a woman, whose dynamic transformation is hindered by the appearance of a son he never knew he had.    Bree, magnificently flesh-out by by actress Felicity Huffman, lives a low-income, alienated, monotone, barely endurable life, maintained only by the desire to have an impending surgery that will release him from the constraints of masculinity that have suffocated his true self.    Shattering through Bree's alienation is a 17- year old son he never knew he had.    The son is Toby, whom is jarringly and gruelingly portrayed by Kevin Zegers, who transcendently conveys Toby's physical and emotional abuse, incorruptible suffering, radiant purity, abandonment, torment, wreckage, galvanization, sexual demoralization, ravishment, brutalization, subversion, and desperate desire to be loved and understood.    Toby effortlessly exhibits externally what Bree agonizingly suffers internally.    As Bree travels with Toby to California to have his surgery, their personalities oxymoronically clash and intertwine and meld together as they individually grapple with their unrealized furnace of dreams and desires that tormentingly shame them while simultaneously give them a reason to continue living.    Zegers and Huffman's performances - like Charlize Theron in Monster and Ben Kingsley in House Of Sand And Fog - are transcendent and off the charts, exquisite, idiosyncratic, outstanding, unprecedented, and unparalleled in modern film history.    Brilliantly supporting and balancing their breathtaking and painstaking performances are actor Graham Greene and actress Fionnula Flanagan, Flanagan giving the best performances of her career.    Duncan Tucker's seamless writing and direction, Eve Battaglia's perfect casting, and a magnanimous acting feast have fashioned a film about the ebbs and flows of human suffering.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|So here is another album from Linkin Park. However, when you listen to this CD for about 15 minutes you realize that it sounds nothing like Linkin Park. A lot of people have said that they don't like it. However, I love it. If they didn't change their sound with something new and different then people would become bored because it is the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />They made a lot of changes to their sound in this album as I stated above. However, in my opinion, I think it just shows how talented they are of different styles of music they can play. This CD has more of a, would it be right to say, spiritual sound to it. Not spiritual like religion per se but a spiritual sound of real deep down emotions of the soul. In the small book that comes in the case they explain a little bit of how they really delved deep within themselves in order to do this album.<br /><br />I  really like the sound. It took some time getting used to because I was expecting another loud and in your face set of songs. Instead, it has a few songs like that but mostly songs that hit me in a completely different way. But in a good way. A deep soul spiritual kind of way. I really like it and would suggest it to anyone that is a hardcore Linkin Park fan that understands their reasoning. Because if you don't understand why Linkin Park changed up their sound in this album and their reasoning behind it then you probably will just say that this album sucks coming from them. But if you understand what they were trying to do then you will appreciate it. I know I did.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|I was just plain bored with this album. I loved Funeral and the self titled ep, but I guess my hopes were just too high with this one. The difference between Neon Bible and Funeral is that on Funeral the songs actually feel like they had some sort of energy and they all stick out as great tracks. On Neon Bible, everything just feels slow moving, like the album is trying to build itself up for some great payoff in the end, but it fails. it just feels like its chugging along to nowhere, and derailing itself in the process. some of the lyrics on the album are really embarassing too. I think everyone just really wanted to like this album and i think thats why its getting such great reviews from critics and being called a successful followup. I think it sold so many albums because it got mainstream radio play, and i think, in its defense, it is a hell of a lot better than anything else on the radio. it has its moments, but not a whole albums worth like Funeral.
1400032717|4.0|It took me a little while to get used to the perspective in the book.  As is obvious from the many reviews, the narrator is an autistic boy.  Sometimes, however, I feel that his level of autism changes as he describes different things, but I'm hardly an expert on the book and this does not factor into my rating.  I give it four stars because, to me, it has an average story written from a unique perspective.  It is certainly a worthwhile read as it doesn't take long to go from cover-to-cover.

Not worth reading except as an introduction to the world of following your intuition.

B00005JPQP|4.0|Danny Ocean (George Clooney) gathers the group together because one of their own has been hurt by a malicious new casino owner, Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Bank entered into a partnership with Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) to use his influence, to steal his land and to smooth the wheels of bureaucracy. Reuben doesn't listen to the warnings and gladly helps with all of this. When his usefulness is over, Willy forces him out and Reuben collapses. Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt) show up at his bedside and learn what happened. When Willy refuses to make it right, they set out, on two fronts, to destroy Willy and his new deluxe casino, the Bank Casino on opening night; they want to bankrupt the casino and prevent Bank from earning another coveted 5 Diamond Award. They bring in Linus (Matt Damon), Basher (Don Cheadle), Frank (Bernie Mac) and all of the others. There plan is to attack on many fronts, so they bring in a hacking expert, Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard) to help. His news isn't good, so they refine their plan. Eventually, they need an infusion of cash and someone suggests they turn to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). He agrees, with one caveat; they must also steal the diamonds that Bank gives his wife every time he receives the 5 Diamond Award for one of his hotels. They are secured in a room at the top of the casino. Keeping an eye out for all of Bank's activities is his personal assistant, Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin), a tough as nails woman who seems to only have eyes for her boss.<br /><br />\\"Ocean's 13\\", the second sequel to the remake of the original Rat Pack film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a really fun caper romp. Love those caper romps. More importantly, it is so much better than the last sequel. Sooooo much better.<br /><br />Anytime filmmakers go to the effort of redoing the studio logo to match the look and feel of their film, it is a signal we are in for something special. For \\"13\\", the studio logos are set against retro graphics, something like you might see in a film from the 60s. Given this is a sequel to a remake of a film from the 60s, the filmmakers are clearly trying to return to the roots of the project and deliver a breezy, fun piece of escape to entertain their fans for a few hours during the summer.<br /><br />The \\"Ocean's\\" films are Soderbergh's most commercial projects. He eschews most of the technical tricks and ideas he experiments with in his other films for a slick, glossy production value perfectly matching the Las Vegas setting. \\"13\\" is set at a new casino, which seems to be a mishmash of styles in an effort to attain a coveted 5 Diamond Award, and to appeal to most guests and particularly Asian high rollers. The hotel is filled with dark colors, shiny surfaces (marble, highly polished wood, gold, silver) and luxurious items. Soderbergh's camera (he also serves as the Director of Photography) captures every element of this excess.<br /><br />The entire cast returns and they have added some memorable actors to make the mix exciting and fresh.<br /><br />George Clooney seems tailor made for the role of Danny Ocean. He is a con-man and thief who always seems to be one step ahead of his prey. In each film, there are insurmountable odds, but he and the rest of his crew have come up with a plan that is difficult, maybe even impossible, but there is too much money at stake. They have thought through every aspect of the plan and now feel they can navigate through the treacherous waters. This all makes sense, because they put up their own money to bankroll the plan to reap the considerable rewards at the end of the operation, but wouldn't risk it. They would naturally work out every detail to protect their investment.<br /><br />Clooney has an easy going charm that has helped to make him a movie star. Danny Ocean is for Clooney exactly what the role was for Sinatra; a chance to work with some friends, make some money and give him some bargaining power for more substantial projects. Last year, \\"The GoodGerman\\", directed by Soderbergh and starring Clooney, made about $1.2 million, considerably less than it cost. Warner Bros. produced that film as well as \\"13\\". I'm sure \\"12\\" made \\"The Good German\\" and \\"Syriana\\" possible and now that they have \\"13\\", Warner Bros. is probably not very upset and willing to take a chance on another risky Clooney project.<br /><br />Clooney is a good actor, but this is a breezy role and he doesn't have to exhibit a lot of acting chops. All of the actors just have to keep things moving, keep them lighthearted and keep the audience entertained. If they do that, they have been successful.<br /><br />Basically, we go to the \\"Ocean's\\" films to see Clooney and Pitt, and to a lesser extent Damon, pal around and joke with one another. And \\"13\\" doesn't disappoint here. Clooney and Pitt's characters are the leaders of the group; Damon's character is the step-child always vying for respect. In each film, the leads don ridiculous disguises, and in \\"13\\", Danny dresses up like a 60's beatnik, a hotel maintenance worker and others. Rusty dons the disguise of a geologist who needs a haircut. Damon sports a huge nose as his alter ego, a character he creates in an effort for him to get closer to Ellen Barkin's character. It is a lot of fun to watch these guys don a series of disguises, each more outlandish than the last. I don't think anyone involved expects us to believe these costumes work, but somehow they always accomplish what they set out to do in the context of the film's universe.<br /><br />Clooney and Pitt are the Sinatra and Martin of the group, without all of the alcohol. They have a breezy repartee and seem to really enjoy each other's company, playfully giving each other a little jab here and a little jab there. Danny and Rusty work so well together they are at the point where they can even finish each other's sentences.<br /><br />Damon's Linus has always been the apprentice, fighting for respect and a chance to play a management role. In \\"13\\", part of the plan involves romancing Barkin's character. When this pops up, they immediately turn to Rusty (Pitt), but Linus is adamant that he should do it, as he already has made previous contact with her. Just to make sure, they give him a little help. This is a welcome development in the story and provides for an amusing scene, even with the prosthetic nose Damon wears as his character's alter ego.<br /><br />Pacino's Bank is a formidable foe. Bank, a well-known hotelier, has received a number of 5 Diamond Awards for his elaborate, deluxe locations around the world. Now, he wants to set-up shop in Vegas and has created an elaborate structure that towers over most of the other luxurious locations on the Strip. Bank will do whatever is necessary to make this hotel a success, because he has sunk a fortune into it. He is also an egotistical control freak, which explains why he is so intent on receiving yet another 5 Diamond Award. These two elements of his character are what Danny and his crew set out to attack.<br /><br />After Bank enters into an arrangement with Reuben (Gould), in an effort to secure his land, use his connections, and get some chandeliers from an old acquaintance, he cuts him out of the deal. When Danny and his crew enter the story, they decide to give Bank an opportunity to make things right, he shook Sinatra's hand after all. This is, apparently, a code of ethics among people in Vegas. But Bank refuses the `Billy Martin' and the Ocean's team sets their plan into motion.<br /><br />We quickly realize how powerful and intimidating Bank can be. When something goes wrong with the Koi pool in his lobby, he immediately turns to the pool attendant and says \\"it's not his fault, I should have fired you when the problem first started. You're fired\\". Sponder fires a waitress because she has gained four pounds. Bank and Sponder are on the quest for excellence and this will ultimately lead to their downfall.<br /><br />When the plan starts to get out ofhand, and their resources run low, Danny and the crew decide to approach Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the mark in \\"Ocean's 11\\" and the owner of the Bellagio. Benedict is in, because he can't stand Bank's new hotel, it casts a shadow over his pool. But for his involvement, Terry wants them to steal Bank's jewel collection. Every time Bank receives a 5 Diamond Award, he makes a big show of presenting his wife with an elaborate necklace in honor of the award. Each of these necklaces is on display in secure room at the top of the hotel. Stealing these necklaces would be the ultimate way for him to give his chief rival a kick in the backside. The jewels are worth $250 million, but Bendict just wants them stolen.<br /><br />David Paymer has an amusing turn as the inspector for the 5 Diamond Award. Danny and Rusty are able to learn his identity and they do everything they can to make sure he has an unpleasant stay at the Bank Casino.<br /><br />Another fun aspect of \\"Ocean's 13\\" is the ability to see a variety of people work together again, to see how easily this group of friends meshes together. Of course, the core crew from the first two films returns, and Eddie Izzard's Roman Nagel from \\"12\\" returns in a greatly expanded role in this new film. Vincent Cassell also returns as a French jewel thief. But \\"13\\" adds both Pacino and Barkin, both of whom steamed up the screen in the sexy \\"Sea of Love\\" many years ago.

B000MRA5EM|5.0|While nothing compares to seeing this on the IMAX screen, this DVD is the next best thing. It will simply blow you away! The undersea colors and sounds are amazing. I didn't think of the creatures under the ocean as making sounds like animals on land do, but they do! I learned so much about undersea life, all in a context that was not just educational, but often amusing. Danny Elfman's sound track makes it all the more enjoyable - the man is a genius. The naration by Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp is perfectly adapted to what you're being shown. Fantastic for ALL ages!!!
B000001FS3|5.0|'Running to Stand Still' is essentially, THE archetypal Joshua Tree track in that it is imbued with an American sound, but a meaning far removed. The song deals with a girl struggling with heroin addiction, with the \\"seven towers\\" being a reference to the Ballymun Seven Towers area of Dublin, an area with a notorious heroin problem. Just as on The Unforgettable Fire's 'Bad', Bono tries to bring somebody back from the brink, a person so consumed by their addiction that they have already misguidedly accepted that there is only one escape. Suicide.<br /><br />In certain respects, U2 can be said to be one of rock's most underrated bands, a contention almost laughable when considering their stratospheric success. Yet amid the hits and the bombast and the zeal, the intricacies and idiosyncrasies that have endeared them to the discerning listener have often been lost. Whereas (two of U2's other triumphs) 1993's Zooropa was something of a parody to Achtung Baby!'s (1991) pastiche, The Joshua Tree offers an earnest counterpoint to their oft-laconic 90s forays into electronica.<br /><br />First and foremost the album is a startling artistic achievement; a master class in onomatopoeia, through artwork and aesthetic, subject matter and performance The Joshua Tree is expansive, invigorating and consummately cohesive.<br /><br />America's arid south-west - the Nevada desert in particular - is the record's heartland. Desolate and unforgiving, yet numinous and majestic, the region's historically blurred demarcation between frontier and wilderness is perfectly articulated by the music through the band's enchantment at their surroundings. Where the ode 'One Tree Hill' and the exhalant 'In God's Country' and 'Trip Through Your Wires' bore witness to the stimuli of the landscape lyrically and musically, the real success of The Joshua Tree lies in its amalgamation of typically cherished American modes, particularly folk, blues, rock n roll and country, and heterogeneous humanist concerns. Indeed such aesthetic syntheses often leads to an intriguing incongruity upon closer inspection, for the specificity of Bono's lyricism is often dialectical in relation to The Edge's evocative America-infused guitar work. A notable example of this is 'Red Hill Mining Town' whereby his lyric \\"through hand of steel and heart of stone\\" alludes to the closure of England's northern coal mines by NCB chairman Ian McGregor and the disastrous free market economic policies of PM Margaret Thatcher, yet the instrumental pays homage to the classically American folk and blues genres.<br /><br />Faith and religion also constitute a large part of The Joshua Tree's lyrical canon, but it is another area rife with contradistinction. Bono seems at ease with Christianity ('Where the Streets Have No Name'), despite its many innate paradoxes ('I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For'), yet simultaneously at odds with fundamentalism.<br /><br />The Joshua Tree also calls on America's more unseemly secular traits to convey the band's antinomy toward the Land of the Free. 'Exit' deals with a violent death, yet whether it is murder or suicide is indecipherable, while 'Bullet the Blue Sky' is the album's most flagrant example of antipathy with reference to then-US president Ronald Reagan (\\"His face red like a rose on a thorn bush...peelin' off those dollar bills, slappin' 'em down\\"), the economic blockade and civil war supported by the US in Nicaragua, and the US-backed campaign of murder and oppression in El Salvador. The album closes with 'Mothers of the Disappeared' a lament to the mothers and wives of student opposition and dissidents under both the Argentinean military juntas and Augusto Pinochet's brutal regime in Chile following his US-backed coup in 1973.<br /><br />Massively successful, The Joshua Tree, by virtue of its three mega-hits ('Where the Streets Have No Name', 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' and the claustrophobic, masochistic ballad 'With or Without You') served to propel U2 to the position they had appeared destined for after stealing the show at Live Aid in 1985, that of the world's biggest band, a position they have held unopposed for nigh-on twenty years.ppeared destined for after stealing the show at Live Aid in 1985, that of the world's biggest band, a position they have held unopposed for nigh-on twenty years.
B000063CPL|5.0|I have to admit this live Maiden album surprised me at how good it really is. The thing that amazes me is how a crowd of 250,000 people sang along with Bruce and sounds so damn good. Usually when a crowd sings along with a live band performance it totally blows, but with Rio I was totally amazed at how well Bruce and the Maiden pulled this off. Bruce Dickinsons vocals are ripe and blistering. There is alot of \\"[[ASIN:B00004TH7Z Brave New World]]\\" material on this cd, because \\"Brave New World\\" was released several months before this January 2001 \\"Rio\\" show. \\"Brave New World\\" was new and fresh so alot of material from this BNW was played on this Rio cd. The early 1980s songs were performed beautifully. There were also three guitar players on this Rio cd. Believe me Maiden needed three guitar players to pull of some these excellent live song performances. Bruce performs \\"The Clansman\\" and \\"Sign Of The Cross\\", believe me Bruce sang this Blaze material really well, and actually sounds better than Blaze himself. Whatever Blaze lacked in the vocal range in these two songs Bruce more than adequetly filled in, and it shows when you hear these two songs performed on this \\"Rio\\" cd. The only thing that annoyed me, there was no \\"Wasted Years\\". After all these years Maiden still got that great live performance magic. I did'nt think Rio would be so good, I have to admitt this Rio cd rocks. Any metal hard or rock fan should own \\"Rock in Rio\\" along with [[ASIN:B000063DHK \\"Live After Death]]\\"

B00005JKGZ|5.0|This has been a favorite with our family since it first came out on VHS. It's a great classic movie with catchy songs and great dialog. Even in our modern day and age, the family touching and humorous family dynamics in this film still ring true. See it. You won't be disappointed!
B0000019HU|5.0|Unheard of by many, revered by almost all those that own it, Slint's second (and last) album is regarded as one of the most influential alternative records ever released.<br /><br />Brian McMahan's primarily spoken vocals offer a haunting juxtaposition to David Pajo's (later of Tortoise and Zwan) jaggedly ornate guitar playing, with the lyrics seemingly having little connection to the stop-start syncopation of the instrumental. From McMahan's tale of a ride on a roller-coaster with a gypsy fortune teller at a carnival in Spiderland's opener 'Breadcrumb Trail' to his reworking of Coleridge's opus The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ('Good Morning, Captain'), at the album's close, Slint's final work runs the gamut of marginal human experience, abstracted against a backdrop of jazz time signatures and 'spidery' guitars, to create a stifling air of impending doom. For all that however, 'Washer' is one of the most startlingly beautiful elegies committed to record.<br /><br />Sexy, claustrophobic, unashamedly arty and conceptual, Spiderland is considered by many to be the first true 'post-rock' album, following their Steve Albini-recorded 'post-hardcore' debut, Tweez (1989).
0529064847|5.0|Great bible. Traditional translation. The sparse footnotes tend   to be more factual in content. Not much doctrine.
0307276902|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The words touched me in a way that many other authors can't achieve.  I think that if someone is intrested in reading than read it. The lies that may have been told in this book shouldn't stop you. I mean really, does this honestly have any effect on your daily life? I highly doubt it, so don't treat it as it is, like many of the other readers have.
B00008DDSC|1.0|DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE COVER - NO STOCKINGS, NO HEELS.  ONE BRIEF SPANKING SCENE (no flesh included) is the highlight of the film.  Perhaps lifestylers would get nostalgic about this story, but for the curious weekend thrill seeker this DVD is sure to disappoint, if not get you 'shut out'.  Definitely not a couples movie unless your lady is VERY much into BDSM, in which case this would only be a 101 level course if not a grade school primer. Don't judge a DVD by its cover!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's third album is unquestionably the most complex work in my record collection, so much so that it is impossible to explore even half the aspects of this multifaceted monster in such a short review.<br /><br />Indeed, three different running orders have been mooted as means of piecing together the Lateralus puzzle. The album benefits from 'The Holy Gift' arrangement (6, 7, 5, 8, 4, 9, 13, 1, 12, 2, 11, 3, 10), in that 'The Lateralus Prophecy' (6, 7, 5, 8, 4, 9, 3, 10, 2, 11, 1, 12, 13) makes for a slightly top-heavy listen, and the title track is so invested in the Pingalan Fibonacci sequence that this arrangement (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12) renders the recursive notion transcendent to the detriment of Lateralus' varied themes. That said, it is perfectly feasable to say that you could put this beast on random-play and still get a cohesive and engrossing journey from it...but hey, if you felt like it you could always do something totally far-out and play it 1-thru-13 too!<br /><br />Imbued with connotations alchemic and metaphysical, the album is a challenging listen, often sparse in comparison to their preceding work, Ænima (1996) and abstracted with regard to their debut, Undertow (1992). In terms of musicianship however, Lateralus is the quartet's foremost work. Mixed 'inside-out', so as Danny Carey's supreme drumming and Justin Chancellor's convoluted bass suffuse the front of the mix, Maynard James Keenan sings from the back, supported by Adam Jones' understated guitar.<br /><br />In base terms, Lateralus, can be said to deal with the deterioration of a relationship, whether personal/professional/metaphysical ('Ticks & Leeches'), the initial bitterness engendered by the split ('The Grudge') and the quest for alleviation ('Disposition'), yet perversely, the fact that Tool deal with subjects in such fundamental terms (religion, philosophy, astrology, mathematics) that renders the album so difficult to comprehend yet so rewarding to experience.

0743289684|5.0|Ali's is gripping tale of a Muslim girl growing up in East Africa, and her struggle to realize her dignity as a human being. Having been \\"married off\\" by her family to man for whom she had no desire to wed, she confronts generations of traditional attitudes toward women to which she had become accustomed, and seeks asylum in Holland.  <br />  <br />Her narrative is compelling as she discovers her liberty in Western society, where the police are kind, dissent is tolerated, and critical thought is encouraged -- even by women.  <br />  <br />Her study of Politcal Science, after earning her way into Dutch University, seeks to understand how such disparity between European and East African governments can exist. Her answer is theological, and her criticism of Islam as a root cause of suffering in East Africa gets her targeted for assassination as an apostate.  <br />  <br />Her thesis is that Islam has never experienced the equivalent of the West's \\"Enlightenment\\" where faith and reason can coexist and therefore give rise to representative governments that respect the right of the individual to dissent. She further argues that Western society is  complacent and somewhat naive in its assumption that members of any society will naturally integrate and adopt Western thought. Instead she warns that enclaves of refugees to whom European \\"Enlightened\\" thought is reprehensible from a religious perspective, particularly in attitudes toward women, form a isloated sub-culture that is ultimately incompatible with the notion of European democracy. In other words, in a spirit of pluralism, the Dutch welfare state is funding its own demise by sponsoring religious schools where radical Islam taught within its own borders. She punctuates her arguments with statistics, that she was instrumental in getting the Dutch government to collect, regarding honor killings, rapes, and beatings -- things considered normal in her native culture that are criminal in the West.  <br />  <br />Ali opensthe door into a mindset that advocates the murder of anyone critical of the culture in which she was raised, and provides a glimpse into understanding how someone could be targeted for publishing a cartoon, making an offhand remark, producing a film, or in the case of Ali herself, being branded an Infidel.
B00005JKGO|5.0|There's not much to add to the laudits for this film.  Groundbreaking director in what some consider his most groundbreaking film.  The era  produced many innovative films that influenced cinema thereafter, and La Dolce Vita is primary in that regard.      More to the point of this review, this Criterion edition meets the highest of the quality standards they have almost solely set for the film DVD.  Any DVD today that doesn't have commentary and features are a rip-off for buyers, but the quality varies significantly (I dare you to sit  through Rob Reiner's commentary on \\"When Harry Met Sally\\").      Criterion truly understands the film lover, the person who wants to know as much as possible about the film, including the how and why of its elements and the who and what behind its making.  They realize that not only film students are interested in the process and people of moviemaking.  Not cheap, their editions however offer far more value than the usual DVD release.      The commentary by Richard Schickel, a true expert on film, is extremely literate and informative.  His command of his knowledge keeps the insights coming non-stop.  His purpose is to inform and to interest, and he stays right on the mark throughout.       Enough features are included to require a second disk, and I believe this edition contains more than any other Fellini film edition.  Interviews with Fellini himself as well as others involved in the production give excellent background and context to the film and to Fellini and his career.      Film buffs will appreciate the care with which this extensive set of extras has been compiled.  Criterion certainly has set the standards for film editions, and this is one of their best.
0792846443|5.0|Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) is one of the best horror / thriller icons since Hitchcock's Norman Bates, right up there w/ Dr. Lecter! She is both terrifying and pitiful at the same time, causing simultaneous fear and sympathy. Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is Annie's perfect foil, doing all the wrong things, and making Annie have to (in her troubled mind, anyway) resort to sadistic control tactics in order to keep him honest, thus preserving her own little dreamworld. The relationship between captor and captive is hellish, humorous, and increasingly twisted, as Paul tries to stay alive. If you don't own MISERY, just buy it right now...

B000MRAAJW|5.0|I was one of those who wanted to sit on the fence and wait for a victor to emerge from the hd dvd/blu-ray wars and then adopt the winning format.     This release changed my mind. I decided to enter into the fray but on the HD dvd side as HD dvd has more functions and features available than Blu-ray. This is not evident in this release but for other HD dvd releases.    The vistas in this documentary are simply amazing. This is now my default demo disc for hd dvd (for picture and sound quality) and I have managed to persuade others to go the hd dvd route with this release. Documentaries like these are made to be seen in high definition. Standard Definition Dvds just don't do justice to the majestic and awe-inspiring vistas. No, not even upscaled Standard Definition Dvds.    The one complaint I have is the absence of the \\"making of\\" featurette that is included in the dvd box set.
B000P2A256|5.0|Good news, Maroon 5 continues to be Maroon 5 on this great sophomore disk. Picking up where \\"This Love\\" and \\"Harder to Breathe\\" left off, songs like \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" and \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" prove to be more smooth and ambient than their predecessors. They keep the tone light and funky enhanced with slick Rock groves. Now that several years have passed since their debut, I'm happy to say that I actually prefer \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" to \\"Songs About Jane.\\" I was ready for something fresh and new. Had this been a total redux of \\"Songs About Jane,\\" it would have been a tad boring. The new CD doesn't really lull in places like I felt the other one did at times. The first seven songs on the new disk are much stronger than the first seven on their last one. I think one of the big shifts is perhaps in the way the songs are arranged on the CD. This time all the big heavy hitters are up front with the ballads closing the album. Last time, they saved some big numbers for the end. Perhaps, that's one thing altering the perception of those that find this one lacking. Ultimately, \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" stands tall as a valiant sophomore disk and follow-up to \\"Songs About Jane.\\" If you liked the first one and can appreciate a glossier production element, then there's a good chance that you'll at lest enjoy this one as much as the last.
0552550299|5.0|Stroud's book is something out of the ordinary for young fantasy readers.  Rather than a clever, wizard figure to help him along his quest, Nathaniel ends up with a wize-cracking, dangerous, sometimes philosophical but usually dangerous djinni.  From the very first, it's clear that Bartimaus has no concern for his young master, but only for his own 5,000 year-old skin.  Fortunately, the boy is sufficiently ingenious to think of a way to bind the djinni's fate to his own--so Bartimaus is forced to help.  As the novel progresses, it's difficult to tell whether the djinni develops some liking for the boy, or if he's just caught up in the game Nathaniel is playing and hates to lose.  At any rate, it's a sophisticated tale that draws much of its appeal from shifting motives and an idea of \\"universal magic\\" that affects everyone in this new kind of London, from paupers to prime ministers.
B00005JP5P|5.0|As this film has already been released in the UK, its disappointing to see such a great film getting such a quiet, limited (and late) release in the US. Sunshine is a gorgeous film with an amazing cast, elegant dialogue, frenetic plot advancement and is, overall, an inspiring story about human sacrifice. Moreover, nearly every element of this film feels great - from the   intense action sequences right down to the complex character interactions on the Icarus. For a film with no huge name actors, Sunshine holds its own with a cast of semi-unknowns. Surely, most of the cast are people you've seen and will recognize immediately from other films. Cilian Murphy (28 Days Later), Chris Evans (Fantastic Four), Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai), Michelle Yeoh, (Tomorrow Never Dies), and Cliff Curtis who played the grieving Muslim father in Three Kings.     The story/premise feels real enough, considering the constant threats that face our planet. The Icarus 2's set design is done wonderfully and especially shines in locals like the Oxygen Garden or Kitchen area - as they are enhanced with touches of human emotion that feel realistic and lived-in. The film's running time of 113 minutes feels perfect. The pacing of the films events feel dead on. Sunshine feels speedy enough to get on with the story, and slows down when it needs to to emphasis a moment or scene. Character development is excellent which comes heavily into play when things on the ship start to go wrong. The movie is smart in its presentation - because no time is wasted with backstory. Viewers are thrust into the narrative at one moment in time, and are forced to gather information as they go along. There are no long, grandiose, narratives that play out before the movie begins. We are only focused on the lives and actions of 7 crew members.     One of the films strong suits is of course, Danny Boyle - who brings an amazing vision to the screen. He seems to know how to perfectly balance regular and artistic stylesof film-making to please just about everyone. When a scene is rather static, with people simply having a discussion (for example) - Boyle treats the scene as is - with basic coverage that feels solid and grounded. However, when a scene begins to show signs of suspense or action - Boyle knows how to change the coverage, and throw in his own personal flares of style. With gut-wrenching camera vibrations, Extreme rack focusing, and gaussian blur type effects to mirror peoples distorted perceptions as they near the sun - the film snaps right into line when it should. Another note to mention would be the ingenious score for the film, that helps to raise the emotional intensity of certain moments, while purposefully diminishing others. The mix of electronic synth and classical symphony help to give the film its own feel. All in all, the film presents itself masterfully, with great control of its own presentation.     Even better yet, the film employs one of the most powerful techniques in cinema - that no one ever seems to utilize anymore-- not showing the audience what's supposed to be scaring them. In this film, you see just enough to allow your mind to play with you, but not enough to where (if you did see) you would be disappointed. So this way, your mind creates something far more disturbing than any Hollywood makeup could ever do - and in the end, your more emotionally vulnerable.     With all the hollywood garbage out nowadays in theatres, its nice to know that films are still being made by people with brains. Sunshine is an example of superb film-making, and I support it full-heartedly.    My only gripe with the film, was the bizarre Icarus 2 space suit. It looked like something from a bad SNL skit.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|With out going into detail of what the film may or may not be about, I will say that it is possibly the most disorienting and disturbing piece of cinema I have seen in a very long time...maybe ever! By the end of the movie you feel like you've been slapped around in your seat for 3 hours.  But considering how boring and nonexperimental movies have become today this is a wonderful thing. Highly Recommended!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD series is great!  I really enjoyed the cinematography and the narration.  Each topic took me to a place on the earth that I would never be able to see on my own, but made me feel as if I were there.  One of my faviorite episodes was the Jungles.  They timelapsed different plants growing and competing for sunlight...amazing. The birds featured were so beautiful and unusual too.  I also enjoyed the Planet Earth Diaries at the end of each episode.  That gave a more in depth view of how they made that particular episode. It was very interesting. I highly recommend you adding this DVD series to your collection.  I will watch Planet Earth repeatedly.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The songs are beautifully crafted with inspired intros that are followed by brilliant harmonies, but at the same time, gut wrenching. Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova complement each other well with his acoustic guitar playing and her piano virtuosity accompanied by their voices harmonizing to perfection. They create magical melodies on the soundtrack. Hansard is the lead singer of the Irish band the Frames, whose recent release [[ASIN:B000M06K98 The Cost]] is a must buy, and Irglova is a classically trained pianist. They previously collaborated last year on the album [[ASIN:B000GH3CVQ The Swell Season]]. Some of the songs from \\"Once\\" can be found there. There are additional songs too on \\"The Swell Season\\"  that are equally as beautiful.

B000MXPE74|5.0|With their hit single, \\"Chelsea Dagger,\\" the Fratellis successfully recreate the glam sound of T-Rex. The song even starts off with a yell similar to T-Rex's \\"20th Century Boy.\\"  The Fratellis pull off having a  retro sound, but with a gritty sound ala Mando Diao whose latest album  [[ASIN:B000NIIUXI Ode to Ochrasy]] is out now.

B000MV8AE0|5.0|it is an excellent movie.. you'll enjoy it.
B000002MTU|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out and have loved it ever since.I am slightly biased because I idolized Clapton as a kid when he was in Cream but had basically given up on him for nearly 20 years(the last purchase after LAYLA was EC Was Here,really only for Have You Ever Loved A Woman).A flash of brilliance came when EC played Live Aid but Budweiser(Miller?)commercials and such really didn't move me until \\"From The Cradle\\" came out.I read a feature in Guitar World magazine and liked the idea of the tunes being recorded pretty much live and if a take wasn't up to par ,it was done over.Man,this release did not dissapoint.Sure its not perfect(I usually skip Torn Down,Motherless Child and How Long Blues) but thats only because these songs aren't as fun to jam with.Speaking of which,when \\"Five Long Years\\" comes on I am always knocked out about how Eric steps up to the mic and does a totally awesome vocal after just playing his heart out.In GW he said this was one track that took multiple takes to get the keeper and I'm not surprised.People might pick on the vocals but I think they're fine.I prefer the Allman Bros version of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" but Eric's version is smokin'.\\"Some Day After A While\\" is another knock out track.I was lucky enough to see Eric when he played the HP Pavillion in March this year and was happy when he  played \\"Driftin'\\" during a  sit-down portion of the concert.Just beautiful and an awesome show(kudos to Derek Trucks,what a monster player).Anyway if you love electrified blues this selection needs to be in your collection.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Let me first start off by saying, I've been listening to Dave Mustaines music since the \\"No life til leather demos\\", about 24 years worth. No I'm not old and balding...but I do know a good record when I hear one! \\"United\\" is fantastic...each song flows well into the next, the sound is pure megadeth...EXCEPT: no David Ellefson! We all know about the lawsuit, but the \\"sound\\" of the band is different without his unique style of playing, which filled out the bands sound, I'm not saying they have gone all artsy Metallica....but the sound is a bit different. Only purist will hear this, THe Drover brothers are in top form here and the new Bass player J. Lomenzo has a good sound, but it's not in the fore front of each song like Ellefsons, you hear the bass, but it doesn't have the Ellefson SNAP! Dave's songwriting and playing are in top notch form here, not for the politically meek!! \\"Amerikhastan\\" is pure political dynamite, even Dave's reworking of \\"A tout le monde\\" is far better than the original version on \\"Youthanasia\\"...Christina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil was a perfect choice to duet with. Glen Drover has an incredible sound..his guitar playing reminds me of Chris Polands chops, Chris being the first Megadeth guitarist (and my favorite!) as far as I'm concerned Poland set the bar for every Guitarist that has ever set foot on a stage under the wings of Vic Rattlehead. NO ONE plays like poland, Save for Dave himself. The two of these guys together, would shread your face right off!! Shawn Drover is just an amazing drummer, His sound seems more like Nick Menza, but I don't want to insult Shawn Drover. Over all this record has a great look, sound and feel to it! Especially in todays world of Wars for Oil and a President buying into a system he designed to keep the American people down, Just ask the bodybags coming back from Iraq what they think! The Only thing that pisses me off about this record is that Dave recorded a version of Led Zeppelins \\"Out on the tiles\\" which isNOT on the american version, It's only on the Japanese import! Why I don't know, you'll have to ask Dave himself, but other than that...this record is worth the money!
B00004UEIF|2.0|i LOVE this collection.    in fact,  i'd got so far as to say i can't go very long without listening to it.  the music is amazing..    the crying shame of it IS-- the piano is SO distorted in transients, that i can't listen to it without cringing.  it's so clear and great on bass and drums.. you feel immersed in the space.  but...  bill evans' piano is farting out in so many places.. it's really sorta atrocious.   i thought there was something wrong with my system-- literally.  but it's the discs..    i really don't know if it's the masters, or the mastering.. but sadly.. either way.. it kinda bombs.  if you listen in the car or as a background.. this is a fantastic set.  if you REALLY sit and listen.. i'm really sad to say, this ain't your collection!
B0000AZKLF|5.0|Very pleased with this SACD, sound is awesome.  I agree with all other highly rated reviews, it is more than words can describe.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Patience is a virtue when listening to Boxer, the exquisite new album by outstanding Brooklyn-based artists The National.  Anyone familiar with their last album, Alligator, might be surprised by its lack of what the Onion referred to as \\"controlled-detonation rockers.\\"  What it does have is excellent tunes, tight musicianship, strange, witty lyrics and the incomparably gorgeous voice of Matt Berninger.  Every listening reveals more subtle touches that add up to what I consider the album of the year (in a year with many, many outstanding albums.)  It's also an album that deserves to be listened to as a whole every time, as the sequencing of the songs is perfectly done.  Standout tunes for me are the lovely, romantic \\"Apartment Story,\\" the '80s-sounding (in the best possible way) \\"Brainy,\\" album opener \\"Fake Empire...\\" If I go on, I'll have listed every track on the album.  I can't stop playing it.  It's that good.  Buy it now.
1596912855|1.0|I read such great reviews of this book and being a Jane Austen freak, I ran to the book store, hoping for hours of reading pleasure. What a surprise....boring, silly, not worth my time at all. I put it down half way through, actually threw it down in disgust. Sorry Ms. Hale, I don't mean to be rude...but readers out there, be warned, this book is terrible.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I've always been a sucker for vampire movies, and no matter whether the story is a deep, thought provoking one; or a good solid action packer like this is, I'll see it.  When I first saw trailers for this film I knew I was going to be there on opening night!    This movie (in my opinion) will become a classic.  Whether it becomes a mainstream classic or just a solid cult-classic remains to be seen.  The story is very well written and as someone pointed out, it revolves around WHY there is a war between vampires and werewolves and less on the creatures themselves.      The acting is just about as superb as it can get.  In my opinion not led by Beckinsale, but rather by Bill Nye who plays a very convincing Viktor.  Slight over-acting in spots by Speedman, but overall he plays very well off of the rest of the cast.    The directing is just as superb.  It is over the top with the effects but only in the spots where it is needed.  Enhancing the story, excitement, and tension all inter-twining the characters and their respective stories as to how the war began and where it will go.  The ending leaves the option for a sequel (which we now see is the case) and it keeps the viewer hooked for the next chapter!    Highly recommened and will be a classic over the course of time.
630463949X|5.0|I saw this DVD being played at a Bose outlet store and could not move from the performance being showed.  Watching Fleetwood Mac perform \\"Silver Spring\\" was a real eye opener!  It was as if Stevie and Lindsey were singing only to each other.  Wonderful music!
B000AARKOO|4.0|I have always been a fan of middle-age era, gladiator type movies and never got around to seeing this in the theaters.  I'll be honest, I really only bought this movie after seeing it so many times whenever I went to a store.    The movie itself has some very good, solid acting and nothing from this perspective seems rushed, forced, or fake.  Bloom does a wonderful job as the man you want to be the hero and the one man that can save his Kingdom; but also shows that he is just human and he can make mistakes and bad choices just like anyone else.  The man who plays the king (the one with leprocy) does such an amazing job!  He makes you understand his point of view but also shows how conyving and ruthless he truly is!    The one downfall I see with this movie is it being a bit rushed.  They never really get into the family and why Bloom ends up doing what he does; and at times the war between the nations can get a bit confusing.  Its almost like you don't know who is good and who is bad!    Overall, a good movie with very well-developed storytelling and top-notch acting.  Worth watching.
0385340559|5.0|This is the first Lee Child book though not the first thriller I've read and I plan to read more of his work. One aspect that was refreshing about this book was that the conclusion was well written, plausible and not rushed. Some of the recent thriller writers have a tendency to take an interesting premise, develop a formidable villian but then flounder with an ending and wrap up the story in rushed, somewhat incomplete manner in the last few pages of the book. This book was a page turner with some unexpected twists and surprises, witty dialogue and a well written conclusion. The story didn't contain any \\"filler\\" events that were not related to additional character or story development which is another flaw I've noticed in recent best seller thrillers. I understand this is Child's eleventh book with Jack Reacher as the hero, but I didn't feel I was missing anything by not having read any of the other books.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Check this movie out.  It's not one of those deep, inspirational movies that will make you think.  This movie is just a simple, fun, action packed movie to sit and enjoy.    It has the right mix of action, comedy, and the bit of romance that is shown and needed to enhance the story.  The main characters are portrayed by two people that seem to fit those characters perfectly (Pitt, Jolie) and the small role played by Vince Vaughn is just pure comedy relief at the perfect moments.    I recommend this movie for just the pure fun time it is.  Yes it can seem slightly boring and drag on at times, but what movie doesn't?
B0000029GA|5.0|This is one the best hip-hop albums ever made!!!
B00005JMXX|2.0|I saw this movie when it was released, and I must say I was not impressed.    The concept of the movie had some serious potential, but the ball was dropped due to a number of factors.  One, the stoy was rushed.  Almost instantly the viewer is thrown into the story with very little build-up, which also costs the viewer time to get into the characters and actually get to care about what happens to them.  Secondly, when it comes to the order of how things happen, there is no order.  Random acts occur almost out of nowhere and without any real explanation.  I know that nature itself is unpredictable and for that reason only, it works.    Also, due to the rush of the story as I mentioned, there is no time to really get into the characters and thus, there is no reason to care about them (aside from the dog.)  I found myself actually saying that these people weren't prpared and they deserved what they got!    Overall, its a good movie to watch just for the heck of it and getting a good laugh; but its not worth any time beyond that.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is one the best albums out there just go get it!!!
1582701709|5.0|This is an easy to read book, done in short paragraphs so you can absorb the concepts at your own pace. It's the secret that's the challenge. A book that can change your life and the way you live it. I recommend it to anyone. If we all followed the secret what a wonderful world this would be for everyone.
B00009RDGA|5.0|It's great a movie.<br /><br /> Everyone needs to see this movie so they can recall scenes in conversation. Basically, seeing movies like these, keep you in touch with most present day social situations.
B000E33VWW|3.0|This film is based on a small period of time in the life of American writer Truman Capote. He is a well respected (yet full of himself) writer who becomes fascinated with two men who murder a Kansas farm family of four in cold blood. The effeminate Capote is both entranced and attracted by one of the killers, and he is able to relate to the man's difficult childhood.    But Capote uses these men to sell a sensational story. He lies repeatedly to the confined criminals about his progress with the book (he does not represent the men in writing as sympathetically as they may have hoped), and his friend (the venerable writer of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" Nelle Harper Lee) rebukes him for caring more about the project and the attention he receives than the prisoners.    To be honest, I found the film to be pretty boring, and Capote's accent hard to decipher. I give it 3 stars because the acting is superb, but the storyline is less than mesmerizing.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This movie came in excellent condition and it was a strange movie. It was a gift for my Mom. She loved it. Thanks for helping make her Mother's Day great.
0743270754|5.0|This book is a great \\"read\\", showing that being on the morally right side of history is insufficient, but depends for its eventual victory on understanding politics and wielding power to bring it about. Maintaing the union and ending slavery were political acts with a moral repercussion, but they were political acts. This history is fascinating pedagogy in showing that what should be (the moral question) is not independant of what is (the political question).
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm glad Linking Park went in a new direction with this new album.  Meteora was just a recycled version of Hybrid Theory --- even though it was a good album.  BUT, I also knew that if they didn't try something new with their next album, it would be a flop.  And something new they did.  In brief, this album rocks --- there is hard stuff and soft stuff.  \\"Shadow of the Day\\" is the best track, and my only complaint with the album has to do with \\"Valentine's Day\\"; the music is good, but the lyrics for the chorus are really lame.  Otherwise, nice job, LP.  Looking forward to your next direction...
1594489505|5.0|I've read both of Hosseini's books and found this one even better than the last one.  The characters are very well developed and you feel enormous empathy for them.  The story was well told and the twists and turns were great.  I literally had a hard time putting this book down.      I pretty much could follow the Farsi as it was written within the context of the sentence.  I loved the book but am sad that I am done with it.  I hope the author writes more but maybe the Afghanistan setting might need a change for a third novel.
0316010669|4.0|As he did in The Tipping Point, Gladwell masterfully condenses social science research into prose that is readable and even dramatic. It's almost as if he confides in the reader and chats with him or her across the dining room table.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that while Gladwell does well to emphasize the power of intuitive, unguided, unplanned thinking in human endeavor, he never really reconciles the contradictions that he finds. On the one hand, intuitive reasoning is a remarkable tool for distinguishing real art from a forgery or for negotiating the \\"fog of war.\\" On the other hand, it involves snap judgments about people that are nothing short of racial or gender prejudice. Although Gladwell acknowledges the contradictions, his solution -- to \\"train\\" the subconscious mind -- is not very convincing.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I have been a big fan of Pink Floyd for many years and David Gilmour is my personal guitar hero.    I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I bought this album, but when I listened to it, I was extremely pleased.    On an Island does not \\"rock out\\" like many Floyd songs. This album is more closely related to Floyd's mellow compositions. The song writing is top-notch, Gilmour's guitar playing is masterful (as always) and the vocals and harmonies are perfectly executed.    Gilmour turned 60 when this album was released and I think these songs reflect his maturity (I'm not only speaking of his age, I'm also talking about his maturity as an artist). Instead of the angst and social commentary of Pink Floyd's previous works, Gilmour shows a softer, sweeter side with songs like \\"Smile\\".     After my second listen of this CD, I couldn't get many of these songs out of my head.    Those that were expecting Gilmour to release a Pink Floyd-like album may be disappointed. Gilmour has moved beyond that now. Don't get me wrong. I still love Pink Floyd and will treasure all of my Floyd CDs, but David can't evolve as an artist or as a human being without expanding his art beyond what it once was 30 or 40 years ago.    I, for one, respect and appreciate his artistic direction.
0374105235|5.0|This is among the top ten books I have ever read.  While its content is beyond sad, and the deeds these young boys were forced to commit while under 24/7 habits of cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, and \\"brown-brown\\" and the sole desire to kill and commit attrocities so horrible we can barely read about them, we cannot but be aware at the same time of how beautifully and masterfully Beah writes.  At the end of the story, well....I won't reveal that.  Rest assured that you will marvel at this true tale and the amazing talent if its storyteller.
B000N6UERK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000N6UERK Deja Vu [Blu-ray]]] Perhaps because we had not seen this film before, we were completely satisfied with Deja Vu. The Blu-ray edition was worth the added expense and Denzel was excellent. Recommend this for an evening of compelling movie-watching. It has a story and the story keeps you involved.
B000M4RG42|2.0|I think it is almost a remake of an old movie about an Indian that was one of the soldiers at the flag raising.    The story is terrible it is about the soldiers who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Then tells how they were used as propaganda by the United States government to lift the morale of the American people and raise money for the war effort. It then allegedly shows the effect on the war on the veterans.     The filming is good but hardly brilliant. The acting so poor that I don't think anyone performance is worth mentioning.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|THE BAND: Sting/Gordon Sumner (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitars), Stewart Copeland (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (2007) 28 songs on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 110 minutes (Disc-1 at 50 minutes, disc-2 at 60). Included with the discs is a 6-page fold out containing song titles/credits/times, band photos, a \\"Police Raid Madam Wong's\\" (1979) advertisement poster, a 1-page intro, what songs came from which albums, and year released. Remastered digi-paks were released in 2003 of the band's entire catalog - with the sound on this Police compilation being superb, I'm assuming these are digitally remastered... but fail to see in the liner notes indicating so. The song \\"Fall Out\\" is the only song to not be featured on one of the band's 5 studio albums - recorded prior to the band's debut in 1977 with Henri Padovani playing guitar. Label - A&M Records.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Outlandos D'Amour (6 songs), Reggatta De Blanc (4), Zenyatta Mondatta (5), Ghost In The Machine (4), Synchronicity (8), bonus track (1).<br /><br />COMMENTS: Their rise in England was quick. Going from small pubs to monstrous tours and sold out stadium dates in less than 5 years. Releasing their first studio album in 1978, to their last in 1983. They covered several music categories - punk, jazz, reggae, rock & pop. Millions of albums sold, Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame members each... every music collectors library needs some Police in one way or another. Don't want to purchase all their studios albums or the pricey boxed set (\\"Message In A Bottle: The Complete Recordings\\"), this 2-disc compilation is THE place to start. THE GOOD: All the celebrated hits are here - \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", \\"Message In A Bottle\\", \\"Walking On The Moon\\", \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\", \\"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\\", \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\\", \\"Spirits In The Material World\\", \\"Every Breath You Take\\", \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\", \\"King Of Pain\\", etc. There are some excellent deep album cuts including \\"Hole In My Life\\", \\"Bring On The Night\\", \\"Voices Inside My Head\\", \\"Demolition Man\\", \\"Murder By Numbers\\" and \\"Tea In The Sahara\\". Songs are presented in chronological order. To me, this is a bonus - you can hear the band change/grow from album to album... from raw punk, to polished pop rock outfit. The sound is flawlessly crisp. The 3-fold cardboard case is sturdy and well put together. THE NOT SO GOOD: No compilation is perfect and this one isn't either (however it's very close). Three small gripes. 1. - A few important (but not critical) songs missing - \\"When The World Is Running Down...\\", \\"Secret Journey\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", and the oddball from their debut \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\" (also - nothing from their underrated '95 live album). 2. - Large amounts of unused disc space - 30 minutes on disc-1 and 20 minutes on disc-2 - this is criminal. Including the 4 omitted songs (mentioned previously) and a few live tracks would have made this collection perfect in my book.. plenty 'o space. And lastly, 3. - Why the heck did it take almost 25 years to get here? Now that it's here, I suppose it was worth the wait. OVERALL: Excellent mix of Police tunes any way you slice it. Looking for a studio album - start with \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" or \\"Synchronicity\\" (beware of the song \\"Mother\\" here). Looking for a great introduction to The Police - look no further (5 stars).ding \\"Hole In My Life\\", \\"Bring On The Night\\", \\"Voices Inside My Head\\", \\"Demolition Man\\", \\"Murder By Numbers\\" and \\"Tea In The Sahara\\".

0316018953|5.0|The Overlook is Harry Bosch at his best. Harry's new assignment to Homicide Special came with a rookie partner, Ignacio Ferras, complete with generation gap. There is a Doctor assassinated, some radioactive medical cesium missing, killers screaming Allah and the word `terrorists' starts to flow around. This draws in the FBI in the form of Rachel Walling, the girl Harry could never quite get it right with and still has trouble. Harry tries to stay in charge of the case fighting the FBI all the way while balancing national security with a single murder. Then the bodies start to pile up, Harry puts it all together and the `terrorists' are exposed. A great straight through read!
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This remastered version of Fleetwood Mac's 1979 double LP hit album features a multitude of previously unreleased tracks that I believe were recorded during these very sessions and had to be excluded to facilitate(fill to maximum capacity) 2 LP's. I believe the band and their producer chose the very best recordings for the LP. Anyway,now for the hits:SARA,by Stephanie Lynn \\"Stevie\\" Nicks,which plays for approximately 7 minutes,is pretty cool. The title track,features a marching band and an elephant's blaring trunk. Those songs were recycled for GREATEST HITS,released in late 1988 or early '89. They also appeared on 2002's THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC,along with THINK ABOUT ME,STORMS and SISTERS OF THE MOON. All the content of this disc would facilitate four LP's,which would have been awesome and priced at approximately $20 apiece(in the late 70's and early 80's). The other songs are great.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|It is different than what most LP fans are used to, thats for sure. It isn't such a bad thing, as they really show their range in this album. However, some of the songs are hit or miss. For the die-hard fans, the songs that most relate to the old LP are, What I've Done, Given Up, No More Sorrow, and to an extent Bleed It Out. The other songs they attempt to go where they haven't gone before, and they score with Shadow Of The Day, but then miss with The Little Things Give You Away and In Between. Hands Held High is a tweener because I like that it means something, but I feel it could have been better.     My favorite songs from the CD are What I've Done, Leave Out All The Rest, Valentine's Day, and Shadow of the Day.     I guess to sum up, this CD is still definitely worth buying, but fully expect to hear something different than what you're used to. Also, they went somewhere they hadn't before, using profanity, unfortunately, so expect that in a few songs as well. My final opinion, buy it, they've grown musically and it isn't such a bad thing, even for the most die-hard fan.
B00009RAJH|5.0|Here is the point of Fleetwood Mac's legacy where Stephanie Lynn \\"Stevie\\" Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are inaugurated into the band. They are the second and third American overall members(Bob Welch was the first and just left to pursue a solo career). Also at this point,the band reached the peak of their popularity which would rapidly increase with 1977's Grammy-winning RUMOURS,this album's follow-up. Nicks and Buckingham,songwriters themselves,were a musical team before joining FM. They are still in the band today with drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie(John's now-ex-wife,Christine Perfect McVie left the band before recording 2003's SAY YOU WILL). Now for the songs:MONDAY MORNING,composed and lead vocal sung by Buckingham,begins the 2002 ultimate compilation THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. WORLD TURNING isn't too bad(vocals by Buckingham and CPM). CPM does a great job on OVER MY HEAD(composed by CPM and Eddy Quintela). CPM awesomely performs SAY YOU LOVE ME. You also get encores(the single versions recycled for GREATEST HITS) of OMH and SYLM. I'M SO AFRAID,by Buckingham,is pretty cool. The live version,which is a clone of TANGO IN THE NIGHT from the 1987 album of the same title,appears on TVBOFM. Of course,there's the megahit RHIANNON,composed and sung by Nicks. There's a single version of RHIANNON on this disc also which also appears on GH. The other songs are great. Nicks and Buckingham later went solo,although Nicks' solo outings were more successful then Buckingham's. CPM even went solo with her 1984 hit GOT A HOLD ON ME. Nicks' solo hits include STAND BACK,LEATHER AND LACE with ex-Eagle Don Henley,STOP DRAGGIN' MY HEART AROUND with Tom Petty,THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN,TALK TO ME,I CAN'T WAIT and ROOMS ON FIRE. Buckingham hit the Top 20 with his 1984 solo hit GO INSANE,from the album of the same title. If it hasn't happened already,both Nicks and Buckingham are eligible for induction into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame since their solo careers both began in 1981. Buckingham's solo debut didn't garner any major hits. Nicks' solo debut album BELLA DONNA spawned LAL,TEOS and SDMHA. Her sophomore effort THE WILD HEART,released in 1983 was a commercial success as well. This album,released in 1975,originally bore(the LP label) a view of Sunset Boulevard,known as \\"the Burbank label\\". The Warner Bros. headquarters building was located in Burbank,California. This album would later be re-issued,with its original catalog number and original track line-up still intact,on a solid white,peach or tan label,which would last through the vinyl phaseout which began in 1989.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Awesome, truly awesome CD.  I have followed these guys forever, and it's about time they put out something this good again.
B000002KXO|5.0|This is the first Fleetwood Mac album of the 1980's and the fourth with American latecomers Lindsey Buckingham and Stephanie Lynn \\"Stevie\\" Nicks still in the band. After success with FLEETWOOD MAC,the Grammy-winning RUMOURS and TUSK,the band would perform hits like HOLD ME,GYPSY and LOVE IN STORE in music videos during the early days of MTV. The aforementioned songs later appeared on GREATEST HITS(LIS was not part of GH) and THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. After this album,FM did not disband but did take a five-year hiatus,giving Nicks,Buckingham and bassist John's now-ex-wife Christine Perfect McVie the opportunity to carry on with solo careers. Before this album,Nicks' and Buckingham's began,but afterward CPM scored with her 1984 solo debut hit GOT A HOLD ON ME.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|This is probably the most \\"experimental\\" Queens CD thus far.  Sorry to say that without Nick Oliveri in the band the last two CD's have been lame as compared to the first three.  Mark Lanegan is hardly featured and the new \\"members\\" couldn't hold Josh's jock strap if they tried.  The remake of \\"Make It Wit U\\" is also nowhere near as good as the original.  There are a few decent tracks on the CD but if anyone states that \\"3s and 7s\\" is the best song Queens has ever written I think I will puke.  The best Queens song ever written is Infinity - HANDS DOWN!  Bring back Nick and turn up the amps PLEASE!!!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|didn't like this CD as much as the previous ones - not sure why.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Well, this is a strange movie indeed, and I have to disagree with some of the reviewers that say this isn't enjoyable to watch or very entertaining, I think it is extremely fun to watch and extremely entertaining. This is the most creepy, depressing movie that I've ever seen. The one thing that I do know is that this movie is supposed to be a dream(or a nightmare I should say). I've also had the idea of turning a dream into a film(or a film into a dream)and can see that David Lynch had that same thought almost forty years ago and pulls it off perfectly. If you have one of those dream trans-later books lying around it would probably help to dig it out for a viewing of \\"Eraserhead\\".<br />I believe in actuality that Henry Spencer is a normal man with a some-what<br />normal life and that we are just witnessing his dreams and his doubts about life, lack of communication in his relationship,doubts of being a father, loneliness, suicide and the after-life. I don't think anybody really knows what the message is behind \\"Eraserhead or if there is a message but thats the great thing about it. Oh yeah,and THE LADY IN THE RADIATOR REALLY CREEPS ME OUT.
B000OY8NII|3.0|This show is not for rocket surgeons, or was that brain scientists?    It however, is some light entertainment to pass potato couching time. The stories aren't very original, but seem to be quite watchable and it made me  giggle quite a lot. I quite like the characters and it is easy to watch.....sooo I'd recommend it. There's much-much worse out there.  Most of my friends have been pleasantly surprised.      But it's no Stargate, Gilmore Girls or Firefly.
0812580346|3.0|Great concept, but not a great execution. The characters are all unlikeable and behave in illogical manners. Worse, Sawyer has the tendency to tell, not show, and has an unfortunate taste for melodrama. He also has a strange view of what humanity will be like in 2020. Floating cars and androids. Well. We'll see. I'm still waiting on my rocket car promised to me by 1980 in old Bugs Bunny cartoons.<br /><br />I started the book and liked the concept (being able to sneak a peek at the future). Then I finished the book and just felt vaguely unpleasant about it afterwards.<br /><br />I'm reading this at the same time as Tipler's The Physics of Christianity, which turned out to be amusing, since one of the characters in the novel quotes Tipler, though not very well. Both books have a fascination with the Higgs Boson, so it was kind of interesting to read them in parallel.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|PEARL JAM's ASTOUNDING COMEBACK WITH ONE OF THE MOST AWAITED ALBUMS OF 2006 PROVES THAT THE SEATTLE BASED QUINTET HAS BEEN MASTERFUL IN THE ART OF REMAINING A RELEVANT VOICE FOR PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROCK AFICIONADOS.<br /><br />BY: Fernando de Mello Pimentel<br /><br />It was with the first jamming power chords of their anthemic and revolutionary debut album \\"TEN\\", back in 1991, that Pearl Jam really brushed up the rusty edges of mainstream rock's conformism and lack of creativity of the previous decade. Now, fifteen years, more than half a dozen studio albums and over one hundred official bootlegs later, this colossal musical mammoth - bred from the fusion of Hendrix's bluesy guitar lines and elements of 70's classic rock - returns from a 4-year creative hiatus with an enthusiastic appetite for re-conquering its throne in the Alternative Rock circuit.<br /><br />With a tempting overdose of heavily distorted guitar driven tunes, finely calibrated with a pure dose of freshly revitalized and angst-filled lyricism, \\"PEARL JAM\\", the Seattle quintet's 8th studio achivevement to date, also known informally among fans as the \\"Avocado Album\\", has rapidly established itself as a promising new milestone for the band, quite nearly duplicating the \\"sound and feel\\" of the early 90's primal grunge atmosphere.<br /><br />What most fans might have realized by now with this release is that gone are the days of Vedder's personal lament and melodrama. Instead, the plot that \\"PEARL JAM\\" so merciless and competently explores through-out most of its tracks concerns a series of unfolding events which are all direct by-products of crass post-9/11 domestic and foreign affairs policies. Ultimately, with its sharp stinging verses aimed at the Bush Administration, the album is a wake-up call for world-wide alertness. Such thesis is revealed true by the content of songs such as \\"World Wide Suicide\\", \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"Army Reserve\\", and \\"Marker In The Sand\\".<br /><br />Eddie Vedder and Company evoke nostalgic glories of an era when the Seattle quintet was a fearless locomotive of youthful bliss - a time when the group's performances were marked by its frontman's outrageous defiance of gravity, as he leaped for the crowd through remarkable stage-dives. In addition to Vedder's undeniable charisma and astounding vocal qualities, Pearl Jam's reputation as a state-of-the-art musical act has also been relying on the thrusting machine-gun riffing power of guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready. The \\"kitchen\\" has always been subject to constant drummer replacements during the band's history. However, as of the 1998 \\"LIVE ON TWO LEGS\\" tour, bassist Jeff Ament finally found a permanent drumming force in the figure of the virtuoso-percussionist Matt Cameron.<br /><br />Whether \\"PEARL JAM\\" is your very first-hand experience with the band, or if you're a seasoned die-hard fan striving along the last 15 years accompanying the band's musical trajectory, the least you can expect is a thrilling rush of musical ecstasy provided by one of the band's most mature and relevant accomplishments to date. Although not always as dazzling as the first three releases, \\"PEARL JAM\\" is a mandatory pick for any serious rock junkie.<br /><br />***** FIVE STARS!

B000HIVQLW|3.0|Pink Floyd is arguably the definitive album band. Therefore, a compilation, even a two-disc one, won't really do them much justice. The new listener must exerpience The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and such in full if they want to really hear Pink Floyd. That alone is enough to defeat the purpose of Echoes. Another is the track selection. Seven tracks were picked from the 1981-1993 period that's by far the group's weakest. Out of those seven, I can justify none of their inclusions. If you must package Floyd, how can you do so without Interstellar Overdrive, Brain Damage/Eclipse, Run Like Hell or Mother? These are just a few of the bare essentials I'm talking about here, people. And in their place? Learning to Fly? High Hopes? Marooned? Keep Talking? The Fletcher Memorial Home? When the Tigers Broke Free? Sorrow? What was the thought process behind any of this? Okay, giving a complete overview of their career I get. But I'd rather hear all (or at least mostly) good songs. And most people who know Floyd just from the radio would be more familiar with, say, Run Like Hell or Brain Damage than Learning to Fly or Marooned. Another track I don't get is The Happiest Days of Our Lives, an interlude from The Wall. Again, who wants to hear that? Wouldn't you rather listen to Young Lust? I would.<br />I also feel that Animals is underrepresented. Sure, Animals isn't a compilation-friendly album. Which again justifies taking off some of the more recent songs. Let's face it, Dogs is a much better song than High Hopes. And an edit of the title track? Ha!<br />Mostly, though, they made the right selections. I really don't think I can justify all my complaining about Dark Side of the Moon, because that's an essential - but Money, Time, Us & Them and Great Gig were all good calls. Same with Wish You Were Here - the FULL Shine On must be heard - but that album's title track is my favorite Floyd song ever, and it's here, so cool. I've already whined about Animals and the Wall (though in truth I'm not a huge fan of that one). Good picks from Meddle, other than the shortened Echoes... PATGOD represented nicely, but no Interstellar Overdrive? A Saucerful of Secrets was nailed, Ummagumma (the only PF album I haven't heard) and Atom Heart Mother weren't represented at all (the latter's If would've been welcome, but whatever), I've already discussed Meddle through the Division Bell.<br />So that about wraps things up, I guess. This is an okay overview, but wouldn't you rather the real album?ough in truth I'm not a huge fan of that one). Good picks from Meddle, other than the shortened Echoes... PATGOD represented nicely, but no Interstellar Overdrive? A Saucerful of Secrets was nailed, Ummagumma (the only PF album I haven't heard) and Atom Heart Mother weren't represented at all (the latter's If would've been welcome, but whatever), I've already discussed Meddle through the Division Bell.  So that about wraps things up, I guess. This is an okay overview, but wouldn't you rather the real album?

0761944516|5.0|I am a 4th year PhD student and wish I had discovered this book earlier. It is far better than any of the graduate level statistics course I have taken, and definitely better than any of the textbooks I have seen. In fact, I have thrown out all my other statistics textbooks - this is the only one I need. Aside from explaining the theory in an easy to understand way, Andy Field provides the practical aspect that no other texts or courses do (or, if they do, they fail to link it to the theory). Field shows you how to use SPSS to implement the theory in an easy, step by step way; he even tells you how to report the results in APA format. Don't waste your money on any other statistics textbooks!
B000OONTFU|5.0|This set gets a 5 purely on the fact that the movies have never looked or sounded better. I am only rating the Audio/Video quality not the actual movies themselves. I am not happy with the HD-DVD cases, I am not sure if Blu-Ray is the same but they don't stay closed. If you like Matrix this is truly the Ultimate set.
B000P2A256|3.0|i didn`t really like the first single, which promoted this album, but i thought the rest won`t be so bad. well, i was wrong. theirs first album is great, i was listening to it over and over. this one is mostly in a style of a this first single. and it`s some funky pop or something i can`t even describe. i liked two or three songs in general, which were more in theirs old style. this one is only ok as a background music... pity.
B00004YA66|5.0|Though FREQUENCY is a bit old but has a brilliant story. Everything is perfect. I searched for the complete DVD in our local shops (in Sri Lanka) but couldn't find. You know, most of the movies are copies and they don't have the complete stuff (making the movie, discussions, deleted scenes, etc.).  About the service of Amazon, I should say THANK YOU. When I put my order it said that the item should arrive between June 14, 2007 - July 25, 2007 and I got it yesterday (June 13).  Simply brilliant. This is my second order with Amazon and I will definitely continue.

034547581X|5.0|Battles achieve legendary status - however as modern times proceed, we don't hold the same reverence that we do to those battles from the time of Napolean to Gettysburg to Normady.  This battle is on the same grounds and deserves the same reverence of how war was fought.  Every military history buff and military strategist must read this account.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Some of the most beautiful visuals ever - after finishing this 9 hour high definition geographical masterpiece , I was all ready to do it again. Everything was filmed very well - there were a few moments were images were a little soft, or fuzzy , but I know that was mostly due to the circumstances - for example ; since they didnt want to disturb the natural reaction of the species being filmed - they used some major zoom lenses that are really tough to control at such great distances - but the end product was still well worth the mild flaw in focusing. Overall - very sharp images , very informative - and very happy !!!!
B000004286|3.0|Ok, but what's with the shaky, quivery, vibrato-laden flute playing all through the CD?  If only the flautist had played it straight, this CD would have been so much better.  The 'Irish pipes' referred to elsewhere in these reviews are called Uilleann pipes (elbow pipes) and are a sweet and balmy alternative to the overblown shrieks of the banshee bags.
060634604X|4.0|People call it a lie, people call it a joke, but I call it, a good book. Though he did not state to Oprah and all of America watching that he had alternated the characters and even some of the story the first time he was on Oprah, I enjoyed reading it. It puts you through suspense, worry, fear, and hope. This book had me turning the pages until I finished it. This good book is called A Million Little Pieces by James Frey.  <br />  <br />James Frey tells about his experience in rehab, after sent to Chicago on a plane knocked unconscious, confused, and needing serious care on his face. He looked in the mirror and saw how bad his face really was. Once he overcame the pain from his face and the sickness from the addiction, he had bigger problems to solve. Even though being told by many doctors and counselors, if he kept doing drugs like he was, there was no doubt he would die within 2 years. James suffers through much of his past that he never wanted to face. He realizes the reason foe his unbearable anger towards his parents, his haunting past of love, and his powerful hate for his life.   <br />  <br />One of my favorite parts of A Million Little Pieces is James is sick of rehab, tired of the counselors, and just wants to go and do drugs. He starts talking to one of the counselors and the counselors says that he has to give rehab 24 more hours, that he can leave. 24 hours later James sees the door and nobody's watching, he has the perfect opportunity to leave. But does he?  <br />  <br />This book tells you to believe in yourself, never give up, even when times are rough. If you set your mind to something, you can accomplish it. If you have done bad things and want life to get better, the only way that will happen is by admitting your mistakes, taking responsibility for your actions, and get determined to make things better. This book gave many good examples of these themes.   <br />  <br />A Million Little Pieces I would not suggest as a good family book. There is alot of swearing and inappropriate parts. I came about reading this book by Oprah putting it on her Oprah Book Club. When I heard it was not all true and parts were alternated, that made me just want to read it more (just to see what all the chaos was about. I just pretended like it was an auto-biography and I liked it. The books starts out by catching your attention and just wanting to see what is wrong with the guy and why he is so messed up. While the book unravels about his past and his childhood, you become hooked and all you want to do is read it. By the end when so much is happening and you don't know what is coming next, you can't put the book down until you finish it. This book keeps you guessing whether or not he is going to stay and go through with rehab or hang up the fiddle and abandon the clinic. Hearing about how the book being a fraud made people stop reading it, it didn't stop me, and I am glad.   <br />
B00013RC8O|4.0|I bought it cause they were talking about it in the recent Grind House movie that came out in spring of 2007.
0142403881|4.0|Have you ever wanted to see inside of a chocolate factory? Well in this book a kid named Charlie gets that chance. He finds a golden ticket in the rapper of a chocolate bar. So he and his grandpa along with all the other kids that found tickets get to go to take a tour of the factory. Why they are in there some pretty interesting things happen to all the kids. Each kid finds a way to get in trouble in there own way.  My favorite part of this book is when Charlie and his grandma get in trouble. They drink so soda that makes them float and have to find a way down. Then they think no one saw them but they get caught in the end.  I believe that the theme of this book is that \\"good things happen to good people. I think this cause Charlie is a nice boy and very good things happen to him. He is quickly rewarded for performing good deeds.  Overall this was a pretty good book. The beginning is a little long and boring but after that it is good book. This is probably a book meant for kids 10 to 13.   This book has a lot of imagination in it.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an HD-DVD I know I can go back to, time and again, and continue to enjoy and learn something new from.  I am still amazed at the quality of the video images -- not just because I have a new HD-TV -- but primarily because \\"Planet Earth\\" takes the medium to its limits, and this even though my HD-DVD player only delivers 1080i.  If you want to see what your HD-TV can do, this DVD is a great way to demonstrate its abilities.       I don't know why there was a different narrator on the Discovery Channel presentation of the series (Sigourney Weaver?), but I prefer David Attenborough's narration on this HD-DVD.  It occasionally gets cute and preachy, but overall it is a truly enjoyable listening and viewing experience.  I think it should be required viewing in school for several reasons:  its high production values offer a good academic benchmark for budding documentarists and cinematographers; it provides exposure to parts of our Earth most of us have never seen (and probably never will); and the simple education and lessons about ourselves and our orb are hard to beat.    I have only trace amounts of dissatisfaction with \\"Planet Earth\\" ... too small to measure.    G.Houck
B000EPR7NE|5.0|\\"Sauniare, please pick up. The other three are dead, a monk from Opus Dei has killed them, and he is here right now looking for the keystone, Oh no.\\"   \\"Hello sister.\\" And the monk shoots the helpless nun and asks her \\"where is it.\\" Just before she drops dead on the floor of the Chapel.   The book the DA VINCI CODE is about two people, Robert Langdon, and Sophie Nevue. Robert is a Harvard educated symbologist who is a Harvard professor of symbololgy and religious history. Sophie is a French police code decipher for the French DCPJ DEPARTMENT. Together they must find the Holy Grail. Sophie's grandfather was the grandmaster of a secret religious society called the Priory of Sion, his name was Jacques Saunaire and he was murdered along with other important people who belong to the Priory of Sion. They were the protectors of the Holy Grail and the only ones who know where it is hidden. Saunaire left clues for Sophie and Langdon to find the Grail and protect it. But along the way the encounter many problems. One is the monk who I mentioned before, but this monk is also trying to find the location of the grail so he can give it to his master which is the enemy of the Priory of Sion Opus Dei. This monks name is Silas. The other problem is Sophie's boss captain Fache. Fache is certain that Sophie and Langdon are the ones who killed Saunaire. He is trying to catch them. The final problem is there friends, they make lots of friends to help them but most just betray them. This story takes place in Europe in 2003, and the plot is to find the Holy Grail. This is a very action filled book.   My favorite part in this book is when Sophie and Robert This thing called the Keystone, which tells them the final resting place of the Holy Grail. There is a code that needs to be put in in order for the keystone to open. It takes them forever to crack the code and I can't tell if they do it or not because it will spoil the book, but anyway a man they have trusted just betrayed them and whathappens next is for you to find out but what happens is amazing.    There are many themes to this story but my to favorite would be, one you can't trust anyone because in this book there is lots of betrayal. Number two would be you have to go with your best instinct because Langdon is always making decisions that could cost him and Sophie's lives.   For my opinion this was my favorite book and I would give it a rating of 10/10 because it is action filled and full of surprises, deceit and lots of mystery. What I like about this book is that it is almost like a history book because all the history in this book is true. Someone who should read this book is someone who likes action, mystery, and adventure. I would not change a single thing I this book because it is that good.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|Okay, yes this seems to be a stereo only SACD but in my humble opinion, it has never sounded better and I know the MFSL versions as well as just about every other version out there. Having grown up around this album, I can honestly say that there are things on here that I've never even noticed before. The echo that Tony Clarke uses on here gives this album an almost ghostly feeling that really comes through on this version. the backing vocals on Voices In the Sky sound like a heavenly cosmic chior. Justin's acoustic has never come across better than it does on this version but really the same can be said for every thing else. Ray's flute on Visions Of Paradise reminds me of light drifting through the cosmos. One of my all time favorite Moodies songs, the Actor sounds so clean and the drums are so crisp that I think I've fallen in love with it all over again. the bonus disc is a wonderful addition and I'm glad that they aqdded Michael's A Simple Game as this was the only problem with the original version of the album as it was only a single B side to one of the songs here. It's also nice to hear Justin try it although Mike's is the keeper. The two outtakes that originally appeared on + 5 actually fit better here What Am I Doing Here and King And Queen have never sounded better. the live stuff is wonderful. It's a shame that the SACD format has gotten such a bad rap with some as I myself  would love to see other artists and bands put out more SACD's. Imagine SACD albums by artists like King Crimson and Traffic.
0061150142|5.0|Picolt Jody, The Pact, 496 pages  By: Sam Bowman      What would you do if the one person you loved the most wanted to kill themselves, and top of it they wanted you to commit suicide with them? What if you were the only person they confided in about it and they made you promise that you would not tell anyone?    Chris and Emily had known each other forever and their parents are also very close friends. But, when Chris decides he likes Emily as more than just a friend they become involved just like their parents had planned. Chris and Emily have the perfect relationship and everyone at school was jealous. No-one would have ever guessed that Emily was unhappy with her life and her relationship with Chris. So, Emily makes a decision that she doesn't want to live anymore and she makes a suicide pact with Chris that he never wanted and never really agreed with. But, when Emily kills herself with Chris' father's gun and Chris at the scene of the crime he is the main suspect and his life is turned upside down. This is a suspenseful story about a boy who is lost, in love, confused, and has to go through hell and back to realize that may be Emily wasn't as great as he thought she was.    Overall this book was awesome and I really liked it. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes page turners. My favorite part in this book is the first time Chris realizes he likes Emily and he kisses her. Then after that Chris' dad walks in on them and saw them kissing and was going to stop it but then he realized this is what Emily's mom and dad had wanted and it was also what he and his own wife had wanted. So then he just leaves and went and told Emily's parents and his wife and they were all really excited.    The main theme or idea of this book was definitely that life is a bumpy road but if you ride it out than you can come through it and see the sun again. By this, I mean that you can go through bad things, but you will get through them most of the time. What I liked most aboutthis book was every single detail seemed to fall together perfectly and it was pretty cool how Jody Picolt changed the style of how she told the story from going back in time and coming back to the present tense.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Well, I was not expecting this when I watched it! It's amazing. It's not actually horrific, there's little blood and almost no violence. This movie is something amazing, something a little creepy and sweet that gets into you and makes you bawl like a baby... ok, makes me bawl like a baby, but hey, I was really tired, ok? It's complicated adn strange and surreal and beautiful and follows an inevetable chain to the end. You really have to pay attention and think - it's not gonna let you space out for a couple hours or miss bits and coast along. But it's easy to pay attention, it's so beautiful.<br /><br />So - one of my favorite movies.
1416911049|5.0|What if you lived in a world where you were ugly until you turned 16?  Talley is about to turn 16 you become pretty.  Tally can't wait, but when she meets Shay, things start to go downhill.    My favorite part of this book is when Tally meets Shay.  Shay has a hover board, something that Tally has always wanted to try out.  Shay and her become friends, and Shay teaches Tally how to hover board as good as she can.    I think the main idea of this book is that you shouldn't judge people by what is on the outside, it should be by what is on the inside.    The ending of this book is good but it leaves you hanging, because the story continues on in the next book, Pretties; which I have also read.

1416524800|5.0|As the glacial winds caught the shoot, Rachel, Corky, and Tolland accelerated down the glacier nearing the edge, and the plunge into the icy Arctic waters.<br /><br />Rachel is a senator's daughter who works for the US government writing reviews for the President from data. Her and two other scientists are called into investigate the discovery of an old old asteroid lodged in a glacier in the Arctic. Under closer observation they uncover a DEADLY secret.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Rachel, Corky, and Tolland are whipping down the glacier. This is my favorite part because I could see it happening.<br /><br />The main idea of this book is Power because NASA abuses their power and tricks even the President.<br /><br />I liked how developed the plot and characters were and how when I finished the book I couldn't remember if it was a book or a movie. I wouldn't change anything about the book because it kept me reading and had a lot of excitement. I would say anyone who doesn't mind a medium length book would enjoy this book.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Queens Of The Stone Age have never put out an album that sounds like their previous work, so don't start looking for a repeat here.  The closest comparison may be \\"Rated R\\", if only for it's eccentric and varied approach.  The production is intentionally oddball, with copious amounts of natural and processed distortion piling up over lava hot grooves.  At times, it almost seems like this is the band's take on post punk.  There is less of a focus on riffs and more emphasis on mood and attitude. That being said, there is still an avalanche of great guitar licks, basslines and excellent drumming. The lyrics and artwork are quite tounge in cheek and help to erase some of the pretentious air QOTSA sometimes projects.  Era Vulgaris is a creeper, you may not get it at first, but the more you listen, the more the record opens up and swallows you.    Just to be clear, my true rating for the album would be a 4 or 4.5 but I had to offset some of these uninformed, 1 and 2 star reviews.
0399236201|5.0|Alex hears the door bell the ring. It's never good news when the doorbell rings at 3 o'clock in the morning. Alex looks out his window to see who it is. There are two police officers standing out side waiting. Alex tiptoes down stairs and answers the door \\"Can I help you guys?\\" Alex says.     \\"Are you Alex Rider?\\"    \\"Yes I am, what can I do for you guys?\\"    \\"Actually, we came here to give some bad news. Your uncle, Ian, is dead. He died earlier this morning in a car accident.\\" What would you do if this happened to you?    Alex Rider is a Fourteen year-old boy who finds out his uncle just died from a car accident. At his funeral he meets Alan Blunt, he worked with Ian Rider. He tells Alex to come meet with him. Alex does and there he finds out his uncle was a spy for MI6. He was on a mission and had been killed because of it. Now Alex must complete the mission his uncle had been on.    My favorite part in this book is when Alex is sent to a training camp to train and get himself ready for the mission. At the training camp he's the only fourteen year-old there, the other guys are about seventeen years or older. All the guys there think he's not capable of doing any of the training. He proves them wrong. Alex does all the training but at a slower pace. He's not as fast and strong as the others, but he still does it. That was pretty cool.    The theme of this book I would have to say is, believing in you and to care about others, not just yourself.    I really liked this book. It was an intense, action packed book that will keep you reading on and cheering for Alex Rider throughout the whole book. I would recommend it to people who are into adventurous and action type books.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|I came across my homemade video of this wonderful concert.  I sat mesmerized and even missed Jeopaedy to watch it.  Liza is ( in my Opinion ) the ultimate performer.  Her rapore with her demon divas,her Bob Fosse numbers, the costumes,the orchestra, were all topnotch.  It is top on my to watch again and again list.  I might even splurge on the DVD.  Mother should see her now !!!
0446608955|5.0|\\"At the beginning of this book you'll smile, and then you'll cry.\\" This is the story about a boy and girl, Landon and Jamie. Landon's your average High School jock. He's funny, popular, and all the girls want him. Jamie's pretty much the complete opposite. She wears sweaters, plaid skirts, and carries a Bible wherever she goes. She's known to Landon, and everybody else, as the Minister's daughter. Until they have to do the winter play together, when Landon notices how beautiful Jamie is and develops a crush on her. Eventually he asks her out. Hesitant at first, Jamie agrees making him promise one thing, not to fall in love with her. Then one day, Jamie finally tells Landon her secret, she's been living with leukemia. Landon tries everything possible to try to help, but in the end, it's too late.     My favorite part of this book was when Landon stood up for Jamie in front of the whole school including all of his friends. I thought it was special because it showed how much Landon actually cared about Jamie and that he wasn't embarrassed to let everybody know.    There was absolutely nothing that I would change about this book. It was great exactly how it was. I give this book 5 stars because it had great details and it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book for anybody who likes romantic novels, but I suggest having a Kleenex handy.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|You must own an HD-DVD player to watch this version. Not an upconverting DVD player. Don't listen to the hype the salesman tells you, upconverted DVD is NOT High Definition. The more you expand the picture, the worse it looks. Buy this on HD-DVD and you will be blown away.    HD-DVD players are not much more expensive than the better dvd players (<$300 and recently as low as $199) and cheaper than some of the high-end ones.    The only downside is when you watch this with your family, the kids complain about their old tv now. Just remind them that's what jobs are for. :)

0761129235|5.0|Good book that explains an important life principle, and you can read it in one sitting ! How nice is that ? Actually, the thing works. I went to sleep the other night thinking about an issue and woke up with one small \\"solution\\" this morning. My mind was clearly mulliing over the small question I asked myself. Instead of asking my mind to solve one huge issue - which might have given me nightmares - I asked it to solve a small, non-threatening problem, and it came up with a nice solution. That is what the author is saying.     I think one good example would be that Apollo 13 mission that went bad. If Mission Control had \\"thought big\\", the astronauts would have been toast (literally). The first thing they did was say, \\"what small step can we now take\\". And after that, what is the next step, etc. etc. etc.... until a solution was there.     Or think of a baseball batter: do you swing for the fence, or try to do one small thing at the plate, which can often result in something \\"big\\" ? Thinking \\"big\\" is overrated in U.S. culture, as the author states. Small solutions are vastly underrated in our culture. For instance, I love watching \\"small ball\\" baseball, rather than the \\"swing for the fence\\" stuff.     Good book that I will use often.
B000NQR7NO|3.0|There's no denying their great talent. Their sophmore album goes for a looser more chaotic sound than the first.  This works wonderfully with the first single Brianstorm.  But otherwise these songs sound unfinished and perhaps even more disappointingly the lyrics arent as memorable.  If you can find their B-sides and early tracks, you'll enjoy them more than anything on this CD.  Let's hope the next one is better.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|Once in a while, everything works. This is a magnificent success, for all three artists. My thought when it began was that this event would be the passing of the torch from Domingo to Villazon, the best of the the recent tenors to today's best, with today's best soprano thrown in for good measure. In part,it is that. But in the whole, it is much more. Domingo started slowly, but by the end of things, he had shed 3 decades and a little coarseness- everybody on the stage was in their 30's and madly in love with life. These are three colleagues, consumed with music and the need to share it, and brought to new heights by each other's art and spirit. It was thrilling to see the audience brought deeper into the magic of the moment with each new aria, duet, and,finally, with the two encore trios- they were swaying, dreaming, and realizing that they were now part of this magic, and part of a night that they would always remember.  At the end, the two tenors were playfully vying for the beautiful soprano, but it never seemed cliched or sexist, even when Placido went so far as to pinch her chin. The feminist wars of the proceeding generations are over. Anna Netrebko had nothing to prove. There was no question, in her mind or in ours, that she was sharing the stage with her equals, effortlessly and joyfully, displaying a power and confidence the match of any I have seen before, male or female.  However, to me, the revelation of the night was Rolando Villazon. I saw him for the first time live in the Los Angeles production of La Traviata last September, where he stole the show from Rene Fleming, and convinced me that he is the best tenor around. But he is more than that. He has the potential to be, if he isn't already, the best tenor since Edison's invention of the phonograph.  Just as Callas melded music and drama last century, the public will be not be able to accept a singer who is careless or incomplete in his art, or lacking in passion, after they have experienced this young tenor.  I could go on, but I will close by commenting on only one number that he sang so successfully that it was brought it to a new level: Rosini's \\"La Danza\\".  He sang it with the exuberance and abandon of the young Mario Lanza, the intelligence and finesse of the great Jussi Bjoerling, and a musicality and personality so complete- so much his own in style and intensity, that he left all of the dozens of past performances I have heard of this old warhorse trailing in his dust. I feel as if I have never really heard \\"La Danza\\" before this incredible performance, done with a naturalness that both enchants and draws you in. From the sound of the audience, I am not the only one who was enchanted.
B00000099Y|5.0|I am a big Tool fan, got to see them a few weeks ago in Corpus and they rocked. This in my opinion is their finest album. Hands down one of the hardest and most creative albums I have ever heard. This is Tool at their very hardest, and at their very best.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Considering I first heard this DVD sitting in my dentist's chair having a tooth extracted, you wouldn't believe it's effect.   It certainly helped take my mind off the immediate situation.   Beautiful music, soothing mellow voice and a delight to hear at any time.
B000P2A256|5.0|i love the album and it came in perfect condition!
B000M4RG42|2.0|This flick is just a bummer.  If you're looking for \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" don't bother.  There are no characters here to actually root for with the possible exception of Adam Beach.  The battle scenes have no visceral impact.  The film's worst sins are it's contention that the fighting men were not staking their lives for their country and that the homefront populace was sick and disengaged with the war effort.  Doesn't director Clint Eastwood and scripter Paul Haggis realize that we were fighting an enemy that invaded our soil?  I think the makers of this film are confusing the Second World War with subsequent U.S. military entanglements.  News Flash!!!  This was not Vietnam!  It's also insulting to think that the civilian population of that time needed to be spoonfed  propaganda to further the war effort.  \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Kelly's Heroes\\" have more credibility than this flick.
1594489505|3.0|I bought the Kite runner cd and loved it from the first minute on. I loved the text but also the way it was read by its author. However, for the author second book, I very much regret that he chose to have it read by someone else. There might be a point to the fact that he chose to have it read by a woman. However, to me, nothing can be more convincing, more enjoyable than for the author himself to help us discover every line of his novel. His tone, his pace, and his emotion did come out in the audio version of Kite runner. I was looking forward to having this extra angle when I got his  second book on audio, but was truly disappointed. Indeed, voice is a very important factor in communication. It is not only the medium to carry the message through, it is also part of the message. Hopefully, Khaled Hosseini next book will be read by himself.
B00005JPKE|5.0|To say that \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is a great war film does it an injustice.  I found the film to be more of a tribute to humanity than a war picture.  It must have taken director Clint Eastwood a lot of courage, growing up under the specter of war, to make a film that humanizes the other side.  What Eastwood concerns himself here is the effects that the American assault on Iwo Jima had on the collective psyche of the Japanese fighting men.  These are men who were indoctrinated in a system that taught them the invincibility of Japan who under fire are finding their original assumptions eviscerated.  These are not the cliched Banzai shouting samurai sword wielding cartoon characters in the films of old.  These are bakers, shopkeepers, laborers, etc. who find themselves defending \\"sacred\\" Japanese soil while the powers-that-be divert prescious resources elsewhere.  There are any number of scenes here that will break your heart.  I approached this film with trepidition because I wasn't a big fan of Eastwood's other Iwo Jima epic, \\"Flags of our Fathers\\".  This film is infinitely better.
0064430227|5.0|We recently purchased this book for our 2 1/2 yr old son.  This is the first book that after reading to him, he has said, \\"Read it again!\\"  We read this at least three times in a row the first night.      Harold uses his crayon to bring his imagination to life and take him on an adventure.  He wants to take a walk in the moonlight, so he draws a moon and a path...later he needs something to eat, so he draws his favorite pies...he can't eat all the pie, so he draws animals to finish the pie...    It really is an adorable book and does a great job of capturing the child's imagination.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Although I loved this movie, I can see where others would think it boring and not very funny. However, it is touching in my opionion. To think that he was being \\"watched\\" and written about, but even the author didn't know he was real was amazing. I found it slightly boring, but in the end, I just had to smile!!
B00000ADG2|5.0|With lyrics like hers, there's almost no need for the music.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|For the foremost, this is a very typical Michael Buble CD. I happen to be a fan of his music...I love the swing sound. The lounge/cocktail feel this guy brings back is very cool! I definately like the touch of soul he's added to a couple of tracks. Notably Tracks 3,\\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\"(Billy Paul still ownes this song)and # 5 \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" includes some beautiful harmonizing from Boys II Men and is a nice upbeat number. As is to be expected, he has done a great job reviving some great hits from the Sinatra ERA and before. \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\",and title track \\"Call Me Irresponible\\", \\"I've got the World on a String\\"(I don't care about his lisp!!!) are a few of his latest revisions done very well. My favorites on this disc include #2 \\"It had better be Tonight\\" featuring Meglio Stasera (giving a distinctivly Latin flavor to it...i really like it!!!) #8 \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" is a smooth sounding remake of a Clapton Classic...I also really like his version of \\"Always On My Mind\\"( although this one will always be Willie's tune!!!)Finally i love the Gospal Feel provided by the chior featuring one Siedah Garrett(u may remember her from Micheal Jackson's \\"I just can't stop Loving You\\" off his \\"Bad\\" album) on \\"That's Life\\". With this CD, as was and is for past ones,it's \\"Here We Come Wedding Receptions\\".
B000NA2776|4.0|This record is almost a buffet for pop fans. It seems like every genre and sub-genre of pop is covered, from the raucous dance-floor anthem (Love Today), to the syrupy ballad (Any Other World); to high camp (Lollipop)and low silliness (Big Girl), to the sublimely ridiculous (Grace Kelly) - they're all there, with a little bit of cabaret thrown in just for kicks. Behind it all are the brilliant vocals of a brilliant song-writer and the results are nothing less than magical.     Maybe Mika thought he had something to prove, what with all the shout-outs to pop fads of yesterday and today. Maybe he wanted everyone to know that he could not only write in every style, but he could blow them all up, too. His musical inspirations and obsessions are obvious on every track, from the Beatles, to the Bee Gees, to all manner of acts from the previous decades, and his mastery of all of it is pretty convincing. So, Kudos to that. The downside is the record is awfully schizophrenic - it almost makes one dizzy. I understand the compulsion to not be pigeonholed, but I think some focus and artistic direction might be a good thing from time to time.     I look forward to Mika's work in the future, especially if he settles into a smaller orbit in the pop universe. There's nothing about his voice or talent that makes him suited to one style or the other, so it's really just a matter of choosing.     All that said, this record is one that shouldn't be missed. I can't overstate how fun and well done it is. Every track is catchy and brilliant its own way. Highly recommended.
B000001FS3|5.0|What can I say, for me this is one of those CDs that you love most or all of the songs on, and in my humble opinion that is a rare thing. This is a must have for anyone who loves the band and/or 1980's music.
B000784WMW|4.0|I know that is exactly what some of the earlier reviewers particularly liked about this Timothy Dalton/Sian Pattenden version but I felt like there were just too many words at times in this adaptation of Jane Eyre. (I even fell asleep at one point.) Even though I am certain that it is more true to the book than the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens adaptation, I personally preferred the Toby Stephens one.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|A walk through the album:    The album starts off pretty strong, with one of their standard instrumental intros, followed by \\"Given Up\\" which contains all the elements of what made LP a popular band: Strong vocals, lyrics and driving rock/metal rhythms.      All too soon we shift gears to a ballad (\\"Leave Out All the Rest\\"), but as ballads go, it is a good one.  You've probably already heard it on the radio.  Then we shift gears with \\"Bleed It Out\\", a decently powerful song featuring a live feel brought to us by simulated clapping by a crowd.  It almost feels like LP is hanging out in a bar doing this one.  Not what we are used to, but decent enough.    Then we drop into a ballad AGAIN.  It seems like the album is having trouble maintaining a high energy level.  Emo kids and your depressed girlfriend will love \\"Shadow of the Day\\", folks who enjoyed Collision Course will not.  The next song, \\"What I've Done\\" is the same feel with a different melody.    Then we arrive at \\"Hands Held High\\" which is apparently an angsty political statement.  I think this is the song other reviewers referred to as the U2 song.  The chorus is, literally \\"Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen\\".  I can't bash this song even if I find it to be a tad trite.  I'm just too jaded to enjoy rock stars adding prayer into their lyrics.    Next up is \\"No More Sorrow\\" which, though Emo-punk-flavored, at least takes the step of trying to rise above the sadness, rather than wallowing in it.  Welcome to 80s metal.    In \\"Valentine's Day\\", Chester starts out trying to imitate Trent Reznor, and ends up making LP sound like a Nine Inch Nails cover band, but without the balls.  The song then devolves into a weak ballad that could be by any one-hit wonder band from the last decade or so.    Mike Shinoda take over lyrics for \\"In Between\\".  The problem is, he sings.  Not raps, not shouts... sings.  He isn't paid to sing, and it shows why in this song.  The lyrics are his usual cleverly twisted verses, but the track sounds like some guy singing a Jewel song at Karaoke night.    Chester takes over the vocals again for \\"In Pieces\\".  Sadly, after the previous track, this is a relief, even though this song constantly teases you with the possibility of rocking, but never makes it there.        \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" is over six minutes of sappy filler they needed to make the 44 minute album just long enough to not count as an extended EP. 'nuff said.    In an Interview, Chester stated that he hated most bands in their previous genre and wanted to take LP in another direction.  The result is an album that has a smattering of quality, but mostly quasi-emo-flavored tripe that could be by any other band that is out today.  One can only hope a few of the numerous solo-projects the band members are apparently working on will result in something worth the drive space.     In the end, Linkin Park seems ready to join the countless other bands that ran out of steam once they no longer had sufficient angst to maintain their edge.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My daughters and I loved this Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre. I agree fully with the earlier reviewers that Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are wonderful in their roles and the story moves along delightfully. The one drawback is the scene that another reviewer noted with Mr. Rochester's wife and another man. That scene is totally inappropriate for families with younger children and completely unnecessary for the story line. I would ask Masterpiece Theatre: \\"Why sully an almost flawless film?\\"
0156027321|3.0|When I was reading the opening credits to this book it said that it would make me believe in God.  After reading that I expected an amazing, life-changing book!  It was not that great.  It was entertaining, but so is a good movie which would take less time to finish.  I've read quite a few more books that have significantly changed my life more than Pi.  Sorry to disappoint.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|This Series is really worth the money. It looks Awsome on my HD DLP TV. (This series does have a few boring part, but all nature shows do.)
0743454537|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is the story of 13-year-old Anna, a girl who was born specifically to be a donor for her older sister Kate who was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. Anna's parents hadn't planned on having more children, but when faced with the loss of their youngest child. they do what they think is best and see a geneticist to create a child who will be a perfect match for Kate. Somewhere along the way the medical decisions they make for Kate begin to take precedence over the rest of the family, including their oldest child, Jesse. My Sister's Keeper tells the story of what happens when Anna decides to stand up for herself and say that she won't be a donor anymore.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is told using alternating points of view, including Anna's parents, her brother, the lawyer she hires for medical emancipation, and the guardian ad litem appointed by the court. I heard so many great things about this book that I had to read it. It tackles difficult subject matter with elegance and aplomb. There isn't a doubt in my mind that when writing this book Jodi Picoult thought through all the different permutations of what would be right or wrong for a family put in the awkward position of having to use one child to save another. But with all that in mind the ending just did NOT do it for me. I know it may seem a just and fair ending to many people and put the perfect cap on an otherwised unfinished piece, but for me that isn't the case. The way the sacrifice is made, the frivolous nature of the final decision... it just didn't fit in with the depth of emotion I'd felt up until that point. This book was beautifully written, it tells a fantastic story and does it in a fantastic way, but I am not okay with the way that it ended and that's the only reason it gets 4 stars from me rather than 5.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000EHSVQ4 Kingdom of Heaven - The Director's Cut (Four-Disc Special Edition)]]  I just bought this product to present my father at father´s day in Brasil.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|While I will join others in echoing that season 7 was not the best, I will say that I will miss the characters and the town that seemed so real to me. I can't wait to finish my dvd collection. My daughter is the one who turned me on to Gilmore Girls. So often the relationship between Lorelei and Rory echoed our own. We would talk on the phone and compare our reactions to the various episodes. We were both outraged when Lorelei and Chris got married (yuk....no chemistry - which was odd, because in previous seasons the chemistry existed - the timing and the writing were all wrong). I doubt any new series will have the ability to bring generations together the way Gilmore Girls has. What will I do on Tuesday nights now - maybe a mother daughter movie night!
B000008GHW|5.0|Though all of these songs appear (remastered at that) on First Rays of the New Rising Sun, I prefer this album and wish it was still in print.  Rays (like the older out of print Voodoo Soup) is filled with great songs, but the sound is all over the place with different line-ups and studio work.    This album was almost completely made of up songs perfored by the Hendrix-Mitchell-Cox trio (with guest Steve Winwood on I believe, Ezy Rider) and as such this feels like a complete album.  It sounds like the songs were meant to be a single album.  Those compilations feel like compilations.      Though I've rarely heard any of these songs on the radio, nearly every one of them is great.  In From the Storm, Freedom and Ezy Rider are three of his strongest most straight forward rockers.  His best collection of straight ahead rocks songs since Experienced.  Plus the great ballad Drifting and the amazing Angel.  (Fiona Apple closed her shows in 97 with a gorgeous version of Angel.  Very awesome)      You might not be familiar with the songs when you buy this, but you will wonder why you weren't more familiar with this.  Though I'm sure this was compiled from various studio sessions, the end result sounds more like a signle tight band than even Band of Gypsys did.      A final note, I'm basing this review off of my old Reprise label CD of this album which has the song listing above and not the song listing mentioned by Kurt Leith in his review (Beginning, Izabella and Highway Chile are not on this).  Also, other than the front and rear cover, I've never seen the artwork shown above.  Did MCA rerelease this before Experience Hendrix deleted the title?  Or is that the Track gatefold import?
075640407X|5.0|The time to the sequel will seem endless, but that is true with any fine piece of work!
B00004BZ0V|5.0|This is a great compilation album of the Clash's singles.  It's an excellent CD in particular for those who [like me] aren't serious punk fans.  The Clash weren't just noise, as a lot of people regard punk.  They had meaningful, intelligible songs.  Cool songs:    White Man in Hammersmith - a take on race relations in Britain.    I Fought the Law - good remake with a punk edge    London Calling - one of Clash's most famous; heard on jukeboxes in bars in college towns.    Train in Vain - more recognizable by the \\"stand by me\\" line in chorus than by the title.  One of the Clash's few [at least on this CD] tunes about a relationship    Bankrobber - slow tune, not well known in U.S.  Interesting lyrics about singer's dad being a bankrobber, but not a bad guy really    Call Up - has a cool kinda warning feel to it.  It's about not getting drafted into war.  Relevant to the present day U.S.    Hitsville U.K. - features women singing    Know Your Rights - activist song about standing up for your civil rights    Rock the Casbah - most famous radio tune probably.  Tries to put kind of a humorous spin on Mideast situation    Should I Stay or Go - other big radio hit
B00005JNEI|5.0|Excellent movie - sad, but true!  A must see for everyone in this country.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|When this CD came out I have to admit I was kind of expecting what we've heard from her before. However, once I heard it I found myself bumping to most of the songs on the album. Very good.
0316166685|4.0|This was a good read with such an interesting perspective.  I enjoyed it and read it quickly.  It had me interested by the end of the first page.  Characters were interesting and storyline was good.  An excellent summer read.
0764574124|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent introduction to using VBA in Excel. The author provides clear and usable examples to illustrate what he's talking about and demonstrate good programming practices. Clearly written for beginners who have never really used VBA, this book will get you writing VBA in no time, and best of all, it's not some boring technical manual that threatens to put you to sleep.
0743289412|5.0|Until just a few days ago I didnt care to read Lisey's Story. I read the jacket cover and decided it wasnt worth it. Didnt sound intriguing. Then I checked it out at the local library. This book is wonderful. Stephen King takes a woman's struggle as a widow and turns it into an awe inspiring story. Lisey's Story makes you laugh, makes you cry, disgusts you, and leaves you longing for more. A truly wonderful story and a must own for any Stephen King fan. Everything the same, Mr. King. We truly love you.

0807126063|5.0|I found out about this book reading the intro to a Pearls Before Swine comic book, written by Stephen Pastis. Stephen expressed loving the humor in the early Saturday Night live skits, Mr. Bill, John Belushi and other comic books such as Calvin and Hobbs. He greatly admired Toole's novel, as being comic genius. So since I love the comic genius of Pearls, I gave A Confederacy a go. Well happily I found out that its one of the funniest books I have ever read, intelligent, and pure. Thanks Mr. Pastis for the recommendation!
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is one of my favorite movies!!! I thought it was about time I bought the DVD.
0393317552|5.0|I read the whole book including his 2003 addendum. Very well written and fascinating book that looks at why different societies ended up the way they did and thus either dominated our were conquered. It rejects the racist idea that there is any difference in the capabilities or intelligence of human beings in different parts of the world and examines the different environmental factors and available resources that allowed them to progress at different rates. After reading it, I look at so many things in a different light. I especially like how Diamond turns conventional explanations around to demonstrate the fallacy of that explanations as well as wondering why history did not go in a different directions.  Upon reading many of the negative reviews of this book I wonder how many of them read the whole thing (or even most of it).  Most criticism they bring up are addressed in the book.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Superman: The Movie was a great film, but to me, the sequel (most of which was shot concurrently with the first film), was great at some points and not so great at others.  Then I later discovered that the reason was due to there being two directors and a lot of the scenes I had a beef with were shot by Richard Lester not Richard Donner, who was fired after the first film's premier.  Most painful to watch was the Clark Kent tripping scene and the Lois Lane Niagra Falls jump scene.    And then there's the stunning lack of Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  A decision that was made to save money.  Thankfully, that has been rectified.    Amazingly, Dick Donner and Michael Thau were able to recut the film using footage that was thought to be lost and did a whale of a job.    And fittingly, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, is dedicated to Christopher Reeve.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Dream Theater have always proudly worn their influence on their sleeves and in some cases, they have gone as far as to wear their influences as a complete suit. For a band of their technical ability it is a bit of a shame that in past releases there have been moments within their arrangements that virtually plagorised the artists that they have found inspiration from. Sader still is that they created a niche for themselves with their second and third albums but have failed to truely be the outstanding group that I thought they were going to become. Even with the negitives, I still enjoy the odd  moment within Dream Theater's records and probably will continue to buy their albums for the musicality alone.     'Systematic Chaos' is another album in their set that shows they have chosen the shred factor over solid songwritting and creative vocal melodies. Take the track 'Dark Eternal Night' which drives a hard and heavy low tuned groove with an impressive bag of riffs which in most regards is a proud progressive metal moment. Regardless of the amazingly mindblowing display of dexterity, speed and transitions, namingly the instrumental section through the guts of the song, the vocals within the verses are boarding on being primitive and mono tonal. For a band that knows instrumental melody, they have really fallen short in the innovative vocal melody department. Granted the chorus see Labrie pulling out some catchy vocal twists but then you have to deal with lyrics that could have been born out of some mid 1980's Eastern European metal act. From a group who brought 'Images and Words'and 'Awake' into the world full of superb lyrics and great vocal meldoies (which for the most part have stood the test of time), it still stumps me what they are doing here and what they have done on the last three disks they have released. Maybe it's because they are self producing their material these day and are not getting some valuable third party feedback from outside the group?    I definately think Dream Theater are an awesome live band and that most of the material off 'Systematic Chaos' would be spectacular to witness on stage however the album does not resinate particularly well just like the last few albums.     I'll leave you with this quote which sums up Dream Theater's latest album to me:  \\"The songwritting's as weak as Steven Hawkins wanking wrist but the shredding is world class.\\"

B000PTYP5C|3.0|Once upon a time, you knew an album was great just by the very first listen. If you need to listen to it 10 times for it to \\"grow on you\\", its not a great album. I was looking forward to systematic chaos since I threw Octavarium in the garbage (Yes, I did listen to it ten times, but it didn't become a better album to my ears).<br /><br />The album starts out well with some very insane playing (as to be expected).  However from Repentance (fifth song) on, the songs overall become longer/slower and loose their momentum to sustain themselves. Unfortunately, I lost interest during \\"side two.\\" There are some decent passages during \\"...Enemies Pt II.\\"<br /><br />A shorter song structure on the second half and dropping \\"Prophets of War\\" might have produced a stronger effort. But honestly, I would have dropped the last three songs(36 minutes) and issued it with the DVD (which I haven't watched yet).<br /><br />So after one listen, not a great album, but overall a better effort than Octavarium. So I won't be throwing this one out, but I may not listen to this one as much as other DT works.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I have been anticipating this release since I picked up All We Know is Falling and I must say I wasn't disappointed. Paramore's maturity shows on this disc both musically and lyrically. It is one of those rare sophomore albums that's as good as the debut, if not better in my opinion. Songs like Hallelujah (my personal favorite) and Born For This give glimpses of All We Know is Falling while songs like the Fences and Misery Business bring along another side of Paramore. Overall It's a very entertaining disc from beginning to end and one of the best I've heard all year.
0061142026|5.0|I have read this book multiple times over the last couple years and for anyone who loves fantasy, or just loves to revisit that childhood mystical innocence, will enjoy this book. Don't be fooled though, Stardust is not a children's story. Gaiman throws a little sex, violence, and pure insanity into the mix, as usual! It's why his fans love his writing. It's never quite what you expect...
0446530573|5.0|When I opened this book, my first laugh came immediately upon seeing the photo of Livia Soprano in the kitchen on the inside cover spread. The rest of the book is great humor interspersed with authentic Italian recipes. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of recipes included. Obviously the humor and entertainment value depends largely upon the reader being a Soprano's fan, but if you are a fan, I highly recommend this book.
B000O1799U|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD,but I don't want to see it again.I did want to see \\"Lady sings the Blues\\"over and over again.I think Diana Ross should write her life story and bring it to the screen,with the GREAT music from the Motown area,now that would be a DREAM to see.
032147404X|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for.
0393307050|2.0|I began this book prepared to like it, I really did. Actually, I was pre-reading it to see if it was suitable for my son. It is not.<br /><br />First, let me say that this book is not for children. Certain topics of a sexual nature are routinely mentioned, indirectly. All of that action takes place off-stage or implicitly.<br /><br />At the start, I was all for Captain Aubrey. I wanted to like him. After all, he is the hero of twenty more sequels. I tried to like him. I just couldn't. He is an obtuse, vain, vulgar, amoral jerk. His only real and true skill is in seamanship and the classical violin.<br /><br />The author uses the immersion method to introduce his audience to the terms and jargon of early nineteenth-century navy seamanship. Nothing much is explained to us landlubbers, which makes following the copious sailing and battle descriptions a bit sketchy. I tended to gloss over at the mention of too many \\"stuns'ls\\" and \\"topgallantmasts.\\"<br /><br />There is a vein of anti-Catholicism which surfaces several times. Two characters are secret Catholics, and neither acquits himself heroically in that regard. One takes an oath against the Pope to obtain his commission; the other avoids revealing his true creed by turns of phrase and re-directing the conversation. Aubrey hates all Catholics (if he knows them to be so) and makes no bones about it. Of course, one would not expect to find pro-Catholic sentiment in His Majesty's Navy.<br /><br />All of the technical jargon and religious differences aside, the story did mostly hold my interest. In the end, I was not satisfied with the resolution of the story. I am sure that is directly related to my dislike of the main character. I don't plan on pursuing any of the abundant sequels at present. I think I'll try the [[ASIN:1883937450 Midshipman Quinn: Collection (Bethlehem Budget Books)]] books next.
0060920084|1.0|Mr. Bryson may appeal to certain types, but I find no humour in his trashing of small town life in America.  Bryson finds great pleasure in seeking out the worst in every town he \\"visits,\\" then writes disparagingly about the inhabitants, even mocking the various dialects he encounters.   He paints a negative image of the places he visits, often perpetuating outdated stereotypes in order to make the place seem worse.  Anyone who goes looking for the worst elements of a locale will likely find them.  He then exaggerates those findings.  Such great talent has he.      Mr. Bryson seems to have a rather high opinion of himself, but his writing reveals that he is actually full of himself (and full of something else).  He lived in England for a number of years apparently curing him of his American upbringing.  Now he has returned to report back to the rest of the world how bad his native country really is.    His boorish exaggerations, intentional disparaging remarks, frequent use of vulgar language, and lack of any genuine interest in his subject matter (other than to sell books) leads me to believe he is a less decent form of life than any of the people he so mercilessly belittles in his book.  For all their perceived shortcomings, those people are authentic.  Bryson is a phony, and I might add, a very unattractive bloke himself.   What a shame so many readers fall for his second-rate comedy.      Please move back to England Bryson, and don't return.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|For nearly 3 decades RUSH has been my number one band.  But alas, no longer.  After Neil got his head together and the band offered Vapor Trails, I was elated.  I didn't like the album but I was just so glad Neil, Geddy, and Alex were back to making music, and that at least some healing had taken place and things were moving in the right direction.  I didn't know what VT was going to offer and frankly I didn't care, I just wanted the individuals of RUSH to be happy, unified and ready.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I don't offer this review lightly, I have listened to the CD well over 30 times, both in ambient conditions and with headphones.<br /><br />I waited with great anticipation for the next release which turned out to be Snakes and Arrows.  Without going into a long winded, laborious review detailing the pros and cons of each song I will simply state the following in my humble opinion:  the magic is gone.  The music has little passion, and even less coherence, the melodies (when you can find them) are vague and obscure and their overuse of layered guitar has me beside myself.  Neil's drumming is less than inspired and may very well be considered pedantic based on the high benchmark he himself had set.  Lyrically, Neil's high brow \\"rational mysticism\\" is trite, perhaps even banal and is now quite irritating.  \\"I don't believe in beliefs\\" (a phrase from one of the tracks) is actually in and of itself - a belief!  Sadly, I think it's time for those three exceptional musicians to find other outlets for their creativity.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Ever since hearing the song Sick, Sick, Sick I have been anxiously awaiting this album. Like every album by Queens this album moves in a different direction as far as sound. Standout tracks for me are Turnin' On The Screw, I'm Designer, Misfit Love, Make It Wit Chu, River In The Road, Suture Up Your Future, 3's and 7's, and Sick, Sick, Sick. There is not a bad song on here. I did download a Torrent for this album before it came out and the sound quality was really bad but after getting the cd I have to say this is another amazing album it also reminds me of Rated R in the fact that it is so schizophrenic. Now if I can only get the title track and the other bonus tracks out there.

1591840562|5.0|This is a wonderful book written by a person with a lot of experience.  As usual, Guy tells it like it is and gives concrete and specific advice.  Step-by-step he explains what the problem is, what are the common wrong ways of solving it are and what are the common correct ways of addressing the situation.  Guy gives examples and employs his excellent sense of humor.  The structure of the \\"Art of the Start\\" allows reader to use it as a reference manual - chapters can be revisited at a later time for a \\"refresher\\".  There is simply no BS in the book - it is all about the subject matter.  I wish more authors followed Guy's example.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|I really have liked all of what Josh Homme has put out.Rated R will always be my fave,but do love his latest,Era V a lot and previous 2 albums.It has a mix of fun diddies.Harder,softer,just a fine mix.Sick,Sick,Sick,Into The Hollow and battery Acid are my faves on the album,after a few times listening.Other goodies are Turnin' On The Screw,Misfit Love,Make It Wit Chu,3's & 7's and River In The Road. It's a real good album from start to finish.I don't think old QOTSA fans will be disappointed and many new fans should be made. It is a solid 4.5 and am sure the future will get only better.Just straight in your face,fun rock.Get it or you will regret it!!!!!
B000OVLBEO|2.0|There are some really good movies that have come out of the Marvel Comic Book stable of titles: The Blade series [[ASIN:B0007WFX62 The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)]]. The Spiderman series [[ASIN:B0002XK190 Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Editions)]]. The X-Men series [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2: X-Men United/ X-Men: The Last Stand)]].<br /><br />And there've been some really crumby ones too: Howard the Duck [[ASIN:6300185788 Howard the Duck]], Elektra [[ASIN:B000A9QK96 Elektra - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]. And now...Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Ghost Rider had its moments of cool special effects. But the movie is ruined by a very slow start (you're 45 minutes into the film before we finally even see Ghost Rider), absolutely horrible melodramatic dialogue, overacting, and completely unrealistic situations.<br /><br />Eva Mendez is the leading lady. Eva was great in 2005's Hitch [[ASIN:B000957O82 Hitch (Widescreen Edition)]], and this actress clearly has real potential under the right direction; but that potential was lost in Ghost Rider under the direction of Mark Steven Johnson (who also wrote and produced the dismal Elektra back in 2005).<br /><br />Johnson also has the potential to do a better film as he proves with 2003's Daredevil [[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]]. But he for whatever reason, deliberate or not, went with the way-over-the-top for Ghost Rider; I found myself uttering, \\"Yeah, right!\\" several times at the events and scenarios in Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Nick Cage is Ghost Rider and you'd have to go back to before Mendez was even in her first feature film to see him in a better than average movie (I'm thinking 1997's Face Off [[ASIN:630512762X Face/Off]] maybe?). Man, this guy gets a lot of work. Unfortunately, when I see his name attached to a film my expectations are for average at best; and there was no surprise with Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Ghost Rider is definitely not one for the DVD collection. If you've got nothing better in your viewing queue, it might be worth a peek when it comes on cable.othing better in your viewing queue, it might be worth a peek when it comes on cable.

B000002VFW|5.0|A well-crafted homage to the Philadelphia soul tradition, Lisa Stansfield's &#34;Affection&#34; was a refreshing change of pace in 1990. &#34;All Around the World&#34; and &#34;This Is the Right Time&#34; were big hits, yet the stellar track remains &#34;The Love in Me&#34; (featuring an impressive horn section). Stansfield also delivers the vocal goods with &#34;Mighty Love,&#34; &#34;You Can't Deny It&#34; and &#34;When Are You Coming Back?&#34; This smashing debut represents her best album to date.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I never even heard of this show until my stepdad recieved it from showtime as an emmy screener. This show is the best written show I have seen in years, not to mention the brilliant concept in itself. What is most seductive about this show is how much empathy Dexter can actually make the viewer feel. You find justification in everything that is his curse. I have gotten many of my friends and family hooked on this show and can't wait til October for season 2.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale's Trevor Reznik hasn't slept in a year.  He's so thin you can see his ribs and spine.  His main social interactions are with his regular call girl and the waitress at the local airport late-night diner.  He's obsessed with cleaning his body and house with bleach.<br /><br />As the movie opens, we see a husk of a man inhabiting the grimy, industrial streets of a coastal city.  Reznik is a machinist, and lately he's been seeing a new guy at work that no one else can see.  Reznik is obviously hiding from some traumatic even in his past, and the movie consists of the unfolding of the jigaw puzzle of his life.  The Machinist is an atmospheric movie, one that will transport you to a waking-nightmare state of dark colors, somber music, and a general haziness between reality and horror.
B000PA9Q6E|4.0|Muddy Waters' work on Chess Records from the late 1940s to the early 1970s is truly amazing.  He was the most powerful blues artist and one of the best songwriters.  Many fans think he was in decline in the mid-1970s when \\"Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down\\" was recorded.  This concert document should dispel those thoughts.  It might have taken Muddy longer to build up a head of steam, but when he got rollin', he was as \\"mannish\\" as ever.  With old pal James Cotton blowing away on harp and Johnny Winter (who ignited Muddy's revival by producing his later records on Blue Sky Records) as his co-stars on the 1977 tour, Muddy was pushed to the heights he regularly reached in his 1950s and 1960s heyday (\\"Pinetop\\" Perkins on piano, and Bob Margolin on guitar also shine).  The live version of \\"Can't be Satisfied\\" - the second cut on the disc - is as strong as any live recording in his career.  I saw this band at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. and the three stars were on fire and having a whale of a time.  When I bought \\"Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down,\\" I thought, \\"there is no way this recording will be as good as I remember the show.\\"  But not to worry, it's all here and hearing it again made me smile at the memories of Muddy, James, and Johnny pouring out electric blues.  A rousing \\"Got My Mojo Working\\" (the encore) finishes things up nicely.  Someone once said, \\"In Muddy Waters' hands 'the blues' is a misnomer.\\"
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I saw many potential pitfalls going into Anthony Minghella's 2003 epic \\"Cold Mountain\\". One, Anthony Minghella directed the film. He's the chap who lensed \\"The English Patient\\" back in 1996. I never saw that movie, but what I'd heard and read didn't sound promising. A schmaltzy romance set during World War II? No thanks. Two, \\"Cold Mountain\\" stars Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellweger. Ugh. I can't stand Kidman and her pinched little nose. I also don't care much for Jude Law, an actor trying to set the world's record for the most movies made in less than five years. And Renee Zellweger? Forget about it, baby. An actress known for appearing in chick flicks and romantic comedies, Zellweger's presence in this film signaled storm clouds on the horizon for this viewer. I'd rather rip my fingernails off with a pair of pliers than watch a Renee Zellweger picture. Third, and finally, I heard that the central element in \\"Cold Mountain\\" is a romantic entanglement between Kidman and Law. Again, let me utter a hearty 'Ugh'. I looked at the film's runtime, 154 minutes, and blanched in horror. No way am I sitting down for two and a half hours to watch two performers I don't like make kissy faces at one another.<br /><br />\\"Cold Mountain,\\" set during the bleakest hours of the American Civil War, follows the various misadventures of two characters, Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe (Kidman). The latter moves to the small town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina to care for her ailing preacher father (Donald Sutherland). To say that Ada is a fish out of water in this tiny village is an understatement. She knows nothing about farming, the economic engine that fuels Cold Mountain, and her outfits and manners are woefully out of place in the sticks. Nonetheless, she soon strikes up a rather odd relationship with the grubby Inman. The two never say much to each other nor do they spend much time together, but it's definitely a case of love at first sight. Before the two can form a more lasting relationship, the war rears its ugly head. All the young men in Cold Mountain-- including Inman--can't wait to take up arms for the Confederacy, and he soon marches off to fight the Yankee invaders. As millions of young men throughout history have discovered, however, war isn't all its cracked up to be. After Inman nearly dies in a terrible battle, he decides to desert and head back home to Ada.<br /><br />Inman's journey home assumes epic proportions as he encounters all sorts of odd characters and life threatening scenarios. He runs into a shifty chap by the name of Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), helps carve up a dead cow, narrowly escapes doom at the hands of Junior (Giovanni Ribisi in a performance one simply must see to believe), and protects a woman named Sara (Natalie Portman) from Yankee depredations. Everywhere around him lurks violent death and temptations of the heart, yet he continues his journey home to the lovely Ada. Speaking of our young heroine, she's also fallen on hard times. The sudden death of her father leaves Ada in dire straits. Complicating matters is a local thug with designs on her property, a thug who also happens to head up a vigilante squad. Monroe nearly starves to death until a local sends over the loquacious Ruby (Zellweger) to help bring the farm back to life. This young firecracker knows everything there is to know about agriculture, and in no time the two strike up an unlikely bond that provides the film with many humorous situations. As we shift between these two parts of the movie, we wonder whether Inman and Ada will ever meet up again. And if they do, what happens next?<br /><br />I think that's enough summary to convince you that I watched the movie. I know I said I wouldn't, or couldn't, view this picture, but I forgot to take this out of my online movie queue and ended up watching it anyway. I'm glad I did. I still didn't care for the romantic angle, and I'm still not much of a Kidman or Law fan, but imaginemy surprise when I came away from \\"Cold Mountain\\" with much admiration in my heart. Why? Three reasons. One, Zellweger hits a homerun as the spunky Ruby. She's a real hoot and steals every scene she's in. Two, the battle sequence involving Inman and his compatriots took my breath away. I can't remember the last time I saw such a gritty, harrowing portrayal of warfare. It's dark, bloody, grim, and deeply disconcerting. There's even a scene where an explosion literally blows a man's clothing off his body! Now that's realism, folks. The battle sequence alone would merit five stars. The last reason is the movie's depiction of agrarian America. For most of our history, our country was an agricultural nation. \\"Cold Mountain\\" really captures this America, and does so with a great eye for detail.<br /><br />For those three reasons, I'm giving \\"Cold Mountain\\" five stars. Minghella's picture really is an epic journey through a dark time in American history, and such an epic deserves an equally epic DVD treatment. The two-disc set I watched contained an informative (read: worth listening to) commentary track with Minghella and editor Walter Murch, mucho deleted scenes, and several lengthy featurettes. \\"Climbing Cold Mountain\\" takes us behind the scenes to show us every aspect of the film's production. \\"A Journey to Cold Mountain\\" comes across as one of those promotional features Hollywood uses to sell a film. \\"Words and Music of Cold Mountain\\" is a concert featuring some familiar faces performing the film's score and reading sections from Cold Mountain the novel. A few storyboards, trailers, and a four minute featurette called \\"Sacred Harp History\\" round out the set. \\"Cold Mountain\\" is a winner, an excellent film that stays with you long after you watch it. Highly recommended.away from \\"Cold Mountain\\" with much admiration in my heart. Why? Three reasons. One, Zellweger hits a homerun as the spunky Ruby.

1582701709|5.0|I highly recommend anyone reading this book. It changed our lives!
0151013047|3.0|This is a long-winded and mildly amusing piece of hate mail from Pakistan to the United States.  The punch line, that \\"no country inflicts death so readily upon the inhabitants of other countries, frightens so many people so far away, as America,\\" is hardly worth the meandering trek through the self-conscious musings of a directionless Ivy Leaguer.<br /><br />The book follows a newly graduated Pakistani student, fresh from Princeton, who takes on a posh job valuating companies and falls in love with a waning Ophelia (whose name is Erica).  He comes to an abrupt rejection of his financial and educational foundations after a single conversation with an otherwise irrelevant character, and she actually ends up in one of those clicheic gardens behind an inhouse psychiatric facility as he pines away over unrequieted love.  That's pretty much the whole plot.<br /><br />An unnuanced homage to Camus' The Fall, complete with first-person narration, a burly waiter, and a woman by a river, this work fails to honor a better book, like a college sophomore pointing at his professor.  It is not so profound, only sarcastic.  His admission over smiling on the event of Sept. 11th (p. 72) is not psychologically insightful but childish.  This is only reinforced by passing references to Brittany Spears and Top Gun.<br /><br />The one strength is not of the book but the writer, and that is: he knows how to make it flow.  It's a fun read, and it even kind of makes you wish he would write another one, only better.  I wouldn't give up on him, but I'd pass over this one.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I think How I Met Your Mother is the new Friends, this show has the potential to be on the air for a very long time.  Neil Patrick Harris is the best thing that's happened to prime time since Jason Bateman in Arrested Development.  Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan are delightful as a couple, they have great on screen chemistry.  I watched the entire season in two days.  The episodes are so much fun, you'll figure there's always time to watch one more.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Veronica Mars is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen and it is such a disappointment that it has to end with season 3. I loved both the first and second season immensely. The second season finale came as a shock to me. I mean, it was so unexpected but you always have to expect this in this show. I fell in love with Kristen Bell because she is such a talented actress and she played the role of Veronica Mars excellently. I doubt any other actress can do that.     Is the third season coming out on DVD or what? I would love to get it on DVD but till now, there is nothing.
B00005JPQP|3.0|I was very excited to see Ocean's 13 and I hoped that it would be a great stylish film. Sadly enough, expectations weren't met at all. The plot was unrealistic and so weird, and the storyline had loose ends.  Regarding the acting you had the feeling just like in Ocean's 12 that here are a bunch of $20 million actors strolling around who truly enjoyed their payday. It was good to see Andy Garcia, but not enough of him - he should have driven in his Cadillac SUV from the TV commercial, so that he gets out of the office. Producer Jerry Weintraub had to be in the flick as he's often in his own films, and he drove off in his very own Maserati Quattroporte - that was fun.  The fictitious hotel structure was unique, but not really anything that fits on the Las Vegas Strip, and therefore so unrealistic that it was almost a joke.  Al Pacino was there as the bad guy, and although he had the characteristics of a certain real winning Las Vegas hotel owner, somehow the edge and sophistication was missing.  I was hoping to see more of Las Vegas to add flair to the flick, but the film plays mostly in offices and enclosed rooms here and there.  Is it worth seeing this film? Let's put it this way, I would have lived perfectly happy without ever seeing it. There are a lot of slow passages and it's sad because with that kind of budget, pool of actors and premise a so much better movie could have been made. But then there was no foul language aside from one outburst and there were no stupid sensual scenes, ... so it's a save movie that should have received a PG rating although it's not a film for kids. I doubt it that after this Ocean's 13 that there's an Ocean's 14 in the works, but if there is then they have to kick it up really a whole lot.

You could name one star EVA and the other MENDES because her scenes in the movie are the only things keeping you from blowing ur head off watching this horrible movie.      1. Plot is really cheesy(WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN NOT TO SALE THEIR SOULS TO THE DEVIL?).  2. Casting and costume designs are slightly cheesier than the plot(EMO demons are not scary!)  3. subtract 3 stars just for having Nick Cage anywhere near the movie.  4. Sam Elliot gives an OK performance.
B000RVK1AQ|3.0|Ghost Rider certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is just about the most disappointing. I have to commend the advertising team, though, because they really sold me on the movie, and I went to see it despite the horrid reviews.<br /><br />The movie ended up making [...] in the US alone (according to Yahoo! Movies), so I'm obviously not the only person who went into the theatre expecting the movie to live up to its previews.<br /><br />The movie started of strong; gripping opening credits and score. From there on out, it went straight to average. And I mean AVERAGE. It's almost as though they made an extraordinary effort to make sure that this movie would be as un-memorable as possible. Every time there's a scene that excites you about what's to come (the arrival of the three elemental bad guys was quite sweet), there's a reciprocating let down (I won't give away what happens, but let's just say that their encounters with Ghost Rider were less than impressive).<br /><br />But there's great special effects, right? Hhhmmmm, yes and no. What was in the previews was pretty awesome, and all that stuff is in the movie, but most of the CGI looks half done, as though they ran out money half-way through post production.<br /><br />I don't think anyone was really expecting a great plot, and I certainly wasn't, so the predictability of the film isn't one of my complaints, but the dialogue did suffer from a certain amount of cliche-itis.<br /><br />So the bottom line: For what it is, it's not bad. There's no nudity and very little bad language or innuendo, so I'd say that this would be most appreciated by a younger audience looking for a neat action flick (under 16).
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I have to say this album is much better than Blackmail handsdown.I went into wally world to buy Black Rain when I seen this by chance put my trust & $14.00 in Dave.

B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Their first CD is raw.  Their second CD is so emo even I get depressed from it.  The Black Parade is as close to a masterpiece that any modern band has been able to achieve.  Of course, this band borrowed quite a bit of the musical feel from the '70s.  From infinite harmony parts to beautiful stadium-rock guitar solos (thank you, Ray!), this album just screams classic rock with a modern twist: Gerard's voice and a theme of death and agony.  The comparisons with the Smashing Pumpkins that have been made are justified after this album: both bands disappoint their old fans in a wonderful, interesting way.  With time, maybe those disappointed fans realize what a great new sound the band has created (or half-recreated, in MCR's case), but what is certain is that new fans will be brought along with the new sound.  I'm one of those fans.  I'm not a big lover of their earlier works--too sappy and boring and similar to other bands--but this album is really something.  MCR are a rock band again, not emo, not soft punk, but rock.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|All in all not a bad way to kill some time. Some good parts. Certianly does the G. Novel no justice what so ever. But with the topic a live action would have been cursed to begin with. The story is interesting, and had potential. However the biggest problem was \\"the cheese factor\\"  the voice Ghost rider used was bad didnt work cinematicly, which is were most of the cheese factor comes in to play. some sceans were acted out poorley, reminded me of some student films ive seen. the efx however where spectacular, with the most amazingon the particle effects. as in the fire, dust smoke, liquids etc. More cheese came from the way the demons look not very..... believable???? if you like good fx films, youll appreciate this one. if your into acting..... well this isnt your movie. i would give it a chance, and just not expect a oscar leval performace.... some cheesy lines, and deliverys....  makes me wonder about the director mind state or situation when shooting.. but hey i have seen fare worse. what graphic novel is next to debut on the silver screen?  maybe an archie movie isnt fare off. lol.    thats my 2 cents

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The movie evoked turn of the century Vienna, all sepia toned and mist shrouded. Edward Norton plays a charasmatic magician who forms a childhood bond with a young duchess. Paul Giamatti plays a police inspector, who starts off cynical and slimey, but becomes more sympathetic towards the end. Jessica Biel plays the duchess, and she is lovely to behold. She looks gorgeous, but even more attractive is a certain something, charm, charisma, warmth, she just seems like she would be very easy to fall in love with. The magical effects are very well done, and you are never sure if they are meant to be just clever tricks, or if the Illusionist is a mystic, able to conjure up ghosts from the other side... Rufus Sewell plays the evil prince, and he is a splendid villain, looking very much the dashing, yet evil prince, like something dreamed up by the Bronte sisters.
B000002KDZ|5.0|The gorgeous single Suavecito in itself, deserves the purchase price of this CD that is one great Latin-Rock album that holds up today as it did then.In the emerging early 1970's, a whole slew of \\"ethnic\\" bands emerged on major labels that quickly faded but left it's imprint on others..Latin @ African bands like Azteca,Mandrill,Osibisa had their day capitalizing on artwork covers(Osibisa)by Roger Dean of prog-rock giants Yes fame and the hybrid funk of Mandril later gave way to a more commercial War.<br />Malo boasted a steady lineup of 8, including 2 guitarists(Jorge Santana on lead) with 2 trumpet players adding a more Latin than Rock feel to the majority of the music.Heavy shades of Santana on Cafe\\" while the rest of the album moves along really smoothly.<br />Guests include (Coke Escovedo) Timbales,Congas,bongos timbales and interesting that the lead vocal is a fellow named Richard Bean who is not a member of Malo but a co writer of the hit Suavecito that he sings lead vocal.<br />Also of interest is the lush front cover of the Mexican warrior and his lady..indeed it is comparable (coincidental?) to Santana's 1970's Abraxas (both depicting themes of women looking up to a man/angel)...in any event further comparisons stop there since this debut is a fine one that deserves 5 stars recorded in California in 1972 whose emotional groove and joy remains intact.
B000002UAO|5.0|I love the Beatles, but this CD is definitely a necessary one for the enthusiast. The tracks show a change in Beatle's music from their 64 album \\"Meet the Beatles.\\" The sounds are unique and with the advancement of sound technologies, can open up a new discovery of what the group did to their music. I do not think it is the best album they made, but I think it was a revolutionary one given the time they made it!!

B00004SZWB|5.0|Let me put it plainly.  I have purchased this album in every medium-Vinyl, cassette, and CD just so I would NOT be without it.  I will admit that I am a long time Stevie fan, but this release is just hot! Whenever I'm out and I see this compilation in the juke box, I immediately put something from it on, usually \\"All I Do\\", never a groan when the intro comes on, always \\"yes\\", \\"alright\\", or \\"that's what I'm talking about\\". I won't say it has something for everybody, but I believe it has something for most.
6305609705|5.0|In terms of visual impact and scenes that live long in the mind, no war movie can really surpass Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'. War can be a difficult business for film makers to deal with. There is the possibility of becoming bogged down in poignant, overly sentimental, personal stories among the soldiers, or reveling in the gruesome bodily disfigurement of the battle scenes. 'Apocalypse Now' skillfully sidesteps both of these potential pitfalls to bring a war movie of true originality.    'Apocalypse Now' is infused with a black humour that adds an extra dimension. In a spirit akin to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', the battlefield seems like a playground to some of the GIs, blending off the cuff jokes with brutal killings in a bizarre mix.    Martin Sheen's portrayal of Captain Willard is a compelling one. An experienced marine, who appears intimidated by his mission, but pushed forward by honour and his desire to do his duty. This performance, however, is surpassed by the unforgettable imprint that Marlon Brando leaves on the film. His intense, brooding acting style is an exact match for the persona of the renegade Colonel Kurtz. His famous half-light scene inside his temple is possibly unsurpassed by any other in film in terms of intensity and impact.    'Apocalypse Now' is regarded by many as the greatest war movie ever made. I feel that most people who take the time to enjoy it will come to the same conclusion.
0316018953|2.0|I really don't understand why so many reviewers were impressed with this book.  I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan, so I snapped this one up as soon as I saw it in the bookstore.  Unfortunately, the book reads like Connelly was under pressure from his publisher to get a book out in time for \\"beach reading\\" season, never mind the quality.  The characters are mostly two-dimensional, and you get the sense that the plot is being rushed, with only a nod to the usual in-depth writing that we've all come to expect from the author.  This was especially disappointing after the masterful \\"Echo Park\\", the previous Connelly novel in the Harry Bosch series--I was looking forward to the next installment.  In short: save your money and wait till this one hits the library shelves.
B000P6R9RG|5.0|This is just an Amazing Record, of one of the greatest bands ever, this special edition is excellent, the package and the dvd is worth the money.

A  very good purchase....
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Dream Theater's latest release, Systematic Chaos is another strong release for the Prog Rock Kings.  I have to admit after the first few listens, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it.   But after a week of constant listening, this is one hell of an album, maybe one of their strongest to date.  With the usual outstanding playing of Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung, Ruddess, and the great lead vocals of LaBrie, this is what we've come to expect from DT. They do not disappoint.  Check this one out!
B00006AVRK|5.0|Jeeves and Bertie are as fresh as ever--even though Woodhouse wrote these little masterpieces more that 60 years ago.

B000002J29|5.0|I have treated Seconds Out like it was a case of vintage Dom Perignon since I first heard it at age 16, shortly after it was released. I only bring it out when I need true transcendence, and it has NEVER disappointed.<br /><br />  The first four tracks are pleasant but, compared to the rest, merely excellent (though Carpet Crawlers is hypnotically mellifluous). From Firth of Fifth on, there is pure magic in every tune. They are almost all Gabriel compositions from the band's best era, and Collins had yet to go pop, so he gives each song the loving respect it deserves, and his strong voice takes the music places Peter's never could. Melding some of rock's wisest and most transportive lyrics with myriad melodies and thunderous climaxes, this is Genesis' masterpiece, and no other band has ever made it to this particular musical Valhalla.<br /><br />  Back when inner voyaging was my main occupation, I could always count on Firth of Fifth and Cinema Show to take me to the crest of a peak and launch me into the heavens. Time after time, year after year, those tunes carried me all the way home. If you've ever peaked so hard your entire body convulses with every note, you know what I mean. If you haven't, do your research on how to get there cleanly and wisely, get in the right time and place and mindset, and put these two tunes on, LOUD, loud enough to make you feel the music in every cell of your body, not just hear it; you'll get there, and it will change your life from that moment on.<br /><br />  This is yet another amazingly perfect live show recorded in Paris, like Babylon By Bus, Bill Evans' Paris Concert, and so many others. Paris makes the magic come to life. Spend some time in the city and it's easy to see why. The architecture and ambience are non pareil; it would be hard to not be inspired there. Genesis clearly were.<br /><br />  This music breathes and takes on a life of its own, especially on Firth, Cinema, the Musical Box crescendo, and Supper's Ready; how many bands can write a 25-minute rock symphony, and have it go this many places with this much color and depth? I can think of only one.<br /><br />  I haven't heard this cd, so I can't say if they've come close to the incredible vinyl version (hope so but doubt it). I have three original copies, and my pristine japanese virgin vinyl version still emerges from the vault once a year or so when the muses let me know that it's time to ascend to the land of pure bliss again. When cds were invented, my first thought was, Seconds Out with zero crackle and pop! But alas, cds suck and are flat and dead; digital simply can not touch analog for warmth and depth. Still, if ever a recording deserved a 5.1 super-cd ultimate This Is It version, it's Seconds Out.<br /><br />  Apparently Hackett left after this record because he was mixed down too far, among other reasons, but I think that helps the ghostly textures he created with his volume pedal and delays become part of the overall music, rather than a normal lead sound. There is a haunting feeling here (haunted by PG's spirit making sure his music and incomparable lyrics were respected?) that is far beyond the sum of each player's part. Chester's drumming (and Bruford's on Cinema) is in perfect harmony, their jazz chops adding to the band's progressive/classical feel, and the drum duet on Los Endos is another fine peak. Collins was a hell of a drummer, a forgotten fact.<br /><br />  Banks shows himself to be a major part of Genesis' magic, his endlessly melodic parts always making everything sound sublimely musical. He and Rutherford and Hackett were a magnificent team, and they left us with this incredible document. I've listened to many Genesis bootlegs but have never heard a show that was as musically superlative as this, though some of the Lamb tour is killer. Add to that the legendary sound quality...this is easily one of the finest-sounding live albums by any band ever---thank you Mr. Hentschel, you are a genius...and wehave one of the sweetest recordings for inner space travel available on this planet.<br /><br />  This is NOT background music. It demands total immersion on great headphones or an audiophile system, vinyl much preferred, volume waaay up, lights out, phone off the hook, doors locked, mind wide open. Give it the respect it deserves, and Seconds Out will take you places you have never been, places where you become part of the music of the spheres and you are complete.<br /><br />  Bon Voyageeee!!pace travel available on this planet.

0767810856|5.0|I love this \\"feel good\\" movie.  It is corny , but I like romantic comedies that are like this.  Rock Hudson, Cary Grant, and Tom Hanks all made some of these.  No blood , no horror, no amazing technology, just relax and enjoy a movie that makes you feel good about people and romance.  Good and basic escapism.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|This album is mellower and more pastoral than the last two albums. I suppose that could have something to do with Jeff Tweedy's improved emotional health. I must admit I do miss the angst a little. No single song stands out head and shoulders above the rest. That is largely due to the fact that they are all excellent. The other reason is the album is produced so well each song seems to run seamlessly into the next. The only problem I've had with this album is once I've started listening to the album I really can't bare to interupt it. Not even to go to the bathroom. It's very embarrassing as I'm sure you can imagine. Worth every Penny.

B00004T0UT|5.0|After spending years putting out lame movie soundtracks (singing songs like \\"Do the Clam\\" and \\"The Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce\\"), Elvis Presley's confidence as a performer was about as low as he could get.  Getting out of the movie contracts, Elvis returned to the music studio with a desperate desire to retake his throne and remind everyone what made him the king of rock and roll.<br /><br />The raw energy and pure determination we all saw in the Singer TV Special, or \\"The 1968 Comeback Special,\\" is on full display on what is definitely one of his finest albums, FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS.<br /><br />About ten or fifteen years ago, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the 100 greatest rock albums of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s (I don't take RS too seriously since Yoko Ono is usually one of the judges for these things), but this is album was the one of Elvis' to make the list.  They even called his version of \\"Long Black Limousine\\" a \\"harrowing\\" take.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever heard a more tortured voice who sounded like he had some much to prove than on these songs.  The despondent wail of \\"Long Black Limousine\\" IS harrowing.  Other songs, after nearly forty years, still can bring tears to the listener's eyes.<br /><br />That to me has always been the lasting appeal of Elvis Presley: his voice could make the most painful agony sound so good.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is based on the story of Anneliese Michel, a German student who, in the mid-1970s, was the subject of one of the rare exorcisms sanctioned by the Church in modern times. The results were less than ideal: Anneliese died of starvation, and her parents and the priests involved in the exorcism were put on trial for negligent homicide.<br /><br />In the film, Anneliese has become young Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a devout small town American girl who heads off to a big city college and goes and gets herself possessed. The family priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), is called in after Emily returns home. Believing she is possessed, he performs an exorcism that goes awry, resulting in his standing trial for her death.<br /><br />Trying the case are prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a self-described \\"man of faith\\" who nonetheless scoffs at the idea of demonic possession, and Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), an agnostic corporate attorney looking to climb the ladder in her firm. Thomas attempts to establish a medical basis for Emily's death, while Erin - thanks to some creepy moments courtesy of the \\"dark forces\\" (as Father Moore calls them) surrounding the trial, comes to realize there may be some credence to the priest's story.<br /><br />Anyone who's seen the previews and is coming into this movie expecting a straight-up horror flick is going to be disappointed. What we have here is a courtroom drama, punctuated by horrific flashbacks. Naturally, any movie that deals with the concept of demonic infestation has to be careful it doesn't draw too many comparisons to the Big Kahuna of the subject, \\"The Exorcist.\\" Fortunately (or not, depending on how big a \\"Law & Order\\" fan you are), \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" dwells less on the possession itself than on the subsequent trial. There are elements of Friedkin's classic here, as any possession movie is going to contain creepy demon fu and a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. But \\"Emily\\" also pulls in references to \\"The Amityville Horror\\" and \\"Ghostbusters\\" (you'll know it when you see it) as well.<br /><br />Linney, as always, does a fine job, and Wilkinson is believable as the tormented priest, but Scott is stuck playing a guy who's such a douchebag he doesn't see the hypocrisy in decrying a ritual based on \\"archaic mythology\\" when he himself is a Christian (he also has one of those James Keach moustaches favored by LAPD officers). Then again, if anyone gets short shrift, it's Jennifer Carpenter, whose Emily Rose spends most of the film in painful contortions and barking in Aramaic (maybe Mel Gibson can find a part for her in his next movie).<br /><br />I have to admit, I don't believe in this stuff any more than Scott's character, and yet it still freaks me out. The exorcism scenes are reminiscent of the 1974 film (which I count among the scariest of all time), without being utterly derivative. And even the idea that the defense could trot out some of the stuff they did during the trial and not get laughed out of the courthouse was amusing in it's own way.<br /><br />Why Sony decided to assemble a cast that includes the likes of Linney and Wilkinson and then place the untested Derrickson at the helm is beyond me, however. In a more capable director's hands, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" could have been both a gripping courtroom drama and a chilling \\"is she or isn't she?\\" horror tale. What we have instead is a movie that drifts, almost unmanned, from plot point to plot point. A few more scares and a little less chatter from the principals would have made \\"Emily\\" much more memorable.ulls in references to \\"The Amityville Horror\\" and \\"Ghostbusters\\" (you'll know it when you see it) as well.

B000KQGOA4|5.0|First off, this version of The Planets is sonically superior to the other release that contains The Enigma Variations by Elgar. Secondly, I also think this performance and interpretation is much superior to Karajans 1981 release of The Planets with the Berlin Philharmonic almost 20 years later. So if you are a Karajan fan, you might want to opt for this disc. If you don't have this one, but have the other, I think you will greatly appreciate hearing the difference.<br /><br />Mars, the Bringer of War, is brutal and menacing in this recording. The timpani strokes are sharp and pronounced and the brass playing is very bold. There is something nightmarish about the whole thing. It's very good indeed.<br /><br />Venus, the Bringer of Peace, is in great contrast to Mars of course and demonstrates in my opinion some of Herbert von Karajan's most tender conducting I have ever heard. (Much more than his 1981 recording of The Planets.) There is a sweetness in the strings, and in the violin solo, that are present in no other recording that I have ever heard. This creates a real atmosphere you can lose yourself in.<br /><br />Mercury is always a difficult movement to rate, but this version serves nicely between Venus and Jupiter.<br /><br />Jupiter is a nice surprise though. It is truly a bringer of Jollity here as Karajan mixes up tempi nicely. There is some very jaunty playing from the Vienna Philharmonic with music that they must not have been very familiar with (keep in mind that in 1961, The Planets had not been recorded that often and was not all that well known in the German/Austrian region). But they do a great job here navigating the extremely difficult scoring that Jupiter poses. The ending has some of that other-worldly enviroment as the central theme returns in the basses and tubas and swirling strings.<br /><br />Saturn is the ponderous onset of age. In the middle section Karajan uses some unusual bells, that the liner notes describe as Wagnerian \\"anvils\\". Its does sound quite different, and rather eerie too. At the end though, there are the usual bells as horns seem to play through the mists and there is something of the feel of a miracle and some mystical closure, rather than fear or doubt. Just my impression of course.<br /><br />Unranus the Magician is another explosive experience. Karajan always had a way of getting great forces from orchestras and this is a good example of that.<br /><br />Neptune the Mystic is simply etheral. Holst Planets ends as an unanswered question and this performance has a great mysterious feel about it. As in Venus, the music just seems to swirl about you and finally into darkness. Great piece of music for contemplating the infinite.<br /><br />Don Juan is always fun to listen to and this is a good performance.<br /><br />Again, I can't say enough about the remastering here. 1961 seems very new when it is heard in 24 bit digital. The 1961 recorded sound is full, spacious and vibrant. It's great to see, and hear, these older recordings remaining in print and being restored to their full grandeur.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|In the wonderful romantic comedy Stranger Than Fiction, Chicago IRS auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) has suddenly found himself the main character in a novel, which is perhaps an odd subject for a movie. But here the juxtaposition of picture and sound works perfectly, whereas in a novel, the double-jumble of words (as Harold performs an action and the narrator describes it) would prove too constricting.<br /><br />Harold goes about his mundane life until he suddenly hears a narrator (the voice of Emma Thompson) describing his actions and thoughts. It's distracting to be sure, and mostly inconvenient, until the narrator says something about how Harold is going to die. Hoping to live a bit longer, Harold consults a literature expert, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who attempts to decipher whether Harold's story is a comedy or a tragedy, as well as who the author might be. Meanwhile, Harold falls in love for the first time, with his complete opposite: an anarchist baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Harold meets her while auditing her; she explains that she has only paid 78% of her taxes because the other 22% goes to war, bombs and corporate cover-ups.<br /><br />In Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), a character asks: if one could save from a burning building either the last known copy of Shakespeare's works or some \\"anonymous human being,\\" which is the correct choice? Stranger Than Fiction asks a similar question, as it turns out that the Thompson's writer, Kay Eiffel, is in fact creating her masterpiece. Is Harold's life worth more than that? But while Allen leaves his question hanging, Stranger Than Fiction ultimately works its way into a corner, and forces itself to come up with an answer. And no answer could possibly be as interesting as the question.<br /><br />Until this unsatisfying ending, however, the movie flows exactly right. Ferrell manages a streamlined, uncharacteristically low-key performance, and he compliments Gyllenhaal's loose ferocity. They have a wonderful chemistry of the type that graced hit films like When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral. (Try not to smile when Harold brings a box of \\"flours\\" for his date.) First-time writer Zach Helm introduces a few bizarre, subversive elements, such as the punk/alternative music that Ana listens to. Professor Hilbert slurps down a constant flow of hot coffee and Kay continually stifles her cigarettes in slightly damp tissues. Food plays an important role as well, from Ana's warm, soft cookies to the cold, creepy dinners eaten by the IRS men.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster has floundered thus far with realism (Everything Put Together, Monster's Ball) and flights of fantasy both maudlin (Finding Neverland) and baffling (Stay), but he shows a nice touch here, even if he's sometimes clumsy or misguided (as with a trick shot of the inside of Ferrell's mouth while brushing his teeth). If the filmmakers had plunged a bit deeper, worked with a little more ambiguity or independence, they might have come up with something more along the lines of The Truman Show (1998) or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Stranger Than Fiction instead swaps genius for pleasure, but sometimes that's enough.wonderful chemistry of the type that graced hit films like When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album has been long over due. With the release dates pushed back and the criticism received for this album. One of my favorite and perhaps the one song that garners the most fire is Washington is next. The rifts are fast full of energy and relevant lyrics for our time. The evil king and new form of slavery. Sleepwalker was the 1st single which was released as a free mp3 single. Gears of war is also a very gritty and well done track. Don't let me be your judge, pick up the album and judge for yourself.
B000ENC6XM|4.0|Basically all the previous 4 or 5 reviews are correct about the film. So lets talk about the picture, its in a word, great. The story is like action-Exorsist.  I think most people will like it. Constantine is dark and its based off a dark comic.  Its full of extras and includes an alternate ending so you will NOT feel bad about your purchase.  If you are looking for something different to try on HD DVD, then pick up this and a copy of Serenity on HD DVD. This movie is a great way to round out you HD DVD collection.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I watched this film for this first time this past weekend (6/10/07) and I cannot get the images of the four ruined lives out of my mind.  I was angry after viewing this movie--not at the movie itself but at the disease of addiction and at those who promote it and profit from it.  The director and actors did a very good job of telling the story.  I would recommend this film but with caution to those who are squeamish.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Meet Harold Crick. He's a lonely IRS agent, systematic to the point of being [...]-retentive and obsessive,  and intrigued with numbers. He hears a voice that appears to be directing his life, or is he directing his life?     Stranger than Fiction is a fresh breath of air from Hollywood, and its format is much akin to the previously mentioned (by other reviewers) The Truman Show in that we have the main character apparently living inside another world with someone else looking down upon it. The biggest question that Harold ( Will Farrell) faces is how much control he ultimately has in his fate, and whether he should try to save his life once he knows it is in jeopardy. Once he discovers that he is hearing a voice narrating his life, he begins to take action to see what he can do about living a happy existence. After getting little help from a psychologist, Harold seeks help from someone who knows about characters and plot, a literary professor (Dustin Hoffman). There are a series of tests for Harold to decipher whether he is living a comedy or a tragedy, and how much he should make his life's \\"plot\\" move forward. After wavering back and forth between the two, the best advice comes from the professor: \\"Go out and live your life...make it the one you've always wanted.\\" Harold tries to do this, but eventually is able to identify the narrator's voice, and then there is the race to find her, and what to do ultimately about Harold Crick's fate...     Several quirky characters and the stars that play them, as well as a unique story, make this film not your average comedy. Will Farrell epitomizes Crick, with his deadpan appearance and humor, and he gives the film a creative edge. Emma Thompson plays Karen Eiffel, the narrator and author with serious writer's block who cannot figure out how to end her main character's life. Dustin Hoffman turns in a solid performance as the coffee-drinking professor (a bit of a stereotype, but good nonetheless). Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) does a fine job as the strong-headed baker who refuses to pay all her taxes, and ultimately has a romance with Crick.     Another commendable element of this film is the point of view and perspective. By taking the story from two different points of view, there is the element of fate vs. individual decision intertwined in Harold's life, and this is what drives the plot forward. We are left to wonder until the very end which one will win out.     There are a few criticisms of the film. One of these is the unnecessary addition of Queen Latifah's character, who is the writing assistant to the author. This character just followed the author around, and added nothing of significance to the story's plot. Over all this character was strictly pointless, and seemed to just slow down the movie. Another slight criticism is the ending, which seemed to be a little too \\"pc\\", and didn't coincide with the film's over all originality. It wasn't too obtrusive, but it could have been better though out.     Still, Stranger than Fiction is a smart and clever comedy/ drama. If you are looking for something different, love movies that get inside the main character's head (literally and figuratively), or are a literary person or writer with a nasty case of writer's block, this is the film for you!
B000E5KJES|5.0|Ray Liotta and Lorraine Brocco are simply amazing and they couldn't look any better than they do on HD DVD!

0060920432|5.0|I stumbled upon Flow and was pleasantly surprised. The book, based on extensive research into the nature of happiness and man's most fulfilling moments, promises to provide steps towards enhancing the quality of life. With many examples and concrete suggestions, I found that it delivered to an impressive degree.<br /><br />From the appreciation of art and science, the deepening of friendships and romance, the establishment of a long-term life goal, and the continuous challenge of one's intellect - I found almost all of the book's suggestions to be based on sound reasoning.<br /><br />The single most important factor in achieving happiness in life is, according to Csikszentmihalyi, actively taking charge of one's attention and creating order in the conscious mind. Csikszentmihalyi recommends a life of continuous challenge, learning, and focus; and provides many useful guidelines for doing so successfully. The reward? Enjoying the \\"flow\\" experience often, which he describes as: \\"...a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to absolute absorption in an activity.

Especially in its description of the conditions for \\"optimal experience,\\" including clear goals and rules that provide constant feedback, matching the levels of skill and challenge, unselfconscious absorption, and the expenditure of mental effort as a prerequisite for enjoyment. Perhaps even more useful was a review of common reasons why most people don't experience \\"flow,\\" or enjoyment, very often.<br /><br />Despite some disagreements I have, such as with mechanistic or genetic explanations for chosen values, and an exaggerated stress on experience over fact, I found this book overall to be a well-reasoned and useful guide to improving daily experience.erall to be a well-reasoned and useful guide to improving daily experience.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|The Complete Matrix Trilogy is absolutely incredible and you get a free copy of The Animatrix if you have the Xbox 360 HD DVD player with Xbox Live access! This set already includes over 25 hours of extras and I feel there is no need to waste the extra cash on the Ultimate Matrix Collection unless you do not have The Animatrix and Xbox Live. Also you get to watch 'Enter The Matrix' (over 1 hr long) which are all the live action scenes from the videogame that shows what Narobi & Ghost were doing while Neo was battling his way thru The Matrix.     The picture quality of this HD DVD set is flawless and the first film (though 4 years older) blends in perectly with the final two Films. I know the Wachowski brothers are proud of this release!  The In Movie Experience (picture in picture extras)is perfect and the Dolby TrueHD is astounding!  Do yourself a favor and make this (along with Planet Earth -HD DVD) your first boxed set purchases on HD DVD.  I was never that interested in Matrix Reloaded but now that the HD DVD picture has kept me glued to the screen, I've learned to appreciate the film and have watched it numerous times.     With your purchase, you can rest assured that Warner Brothers, with HD DVD, has delivered! You're going to absolutely love the picture quality and enjoy the sound when Neo takes on over 100+ Agent Smiths! Lastly you get a ton of commentaries from not only the actors, but philosphers such as Cornell West, and even critics that critized the film!  The Complete Matrix Trilogy has tons of replay value from In Movie Experience to extras.  If you own an HD DVD player buying this set is a must!  It truly is the Look and Sound of PERFECT!  Thank You Warner Bros.!!!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|...like a bad fungus that won't go away.  I thought the CD sucked at first, but give it some time and you'll really appreciate it for a solid piece of work after listening to the words of the songs and making a concerted effort to forget that Mike Shinoda and Mr. Hahn are no longer key contriubtors to the group.<br /><br />However, Hands Held High is undoubtedly Mike's most profound work ever.  No More Sorrow, Bleed It Out, and Given Up give the CD the oomph we normally come to expect from LP.  The rest of the CD is lacking testosterone, but it gets better with time.  Just give it a fair shake before you give up on it.
B000ICM5W6|5.0|Though the movie did not gross as much as Universal had originally hoped, this HD DVD is still a winner!  Even if you do not appreciate the film, it makes wonderful HD DVD demo material!  Personally I liked the film, but I give the film itself a 7, story is 6.5, the picture is a 10 and the sound is a 9.  Ang Lee (the director) did a good job using multiple scenes on a single screen using comic book templates!  I loved to see Hulk Smash all the tanks in the dessert in pure HD!  Batman can't be the only Superhero in you HD DVD collection and Hulk is a lot better than Superman!
B000MRAAJM|3.0|\\"Planet Earth\\" is a great series, both the BBC series and the Discovery Series. A tremendous accomplishment and it shows. Nature at it's best -- on TV. But, there are differences. The BBC series presents the series as a nice show to watch, nice music, nice narrator with a nice British accent. It's nice. The Discovery series presents it with drama... dramatic opening sequence, serious music, tough \\"Aliens\\" lady narrator. It's dramatic, it's no-nonsense. Watch this or die.    I have both sets. I bought the Discovery series at a local Discovery Store.     I do like the \\"Diary\\" featurette at the end of each show for the BBC series. Gets into the nitty-gritty of how the scenes were filmed. The Discovery series breaks it apart in a separate disc menu selection. The BBC series' menu is odd in that to start a show, you select the first chapter. There isn't a \\"Play\\"... or maybe I missed that.
B000E1MTY0|4.0|Unfortunately, I did not like this film as much as some of the other reviewers.  The story was ok, but I think Scarecrow (and some of the special effects used around the charatcer and Batman) really kept it from tanking because Katie Holmes was just plain corney. I really think they could have used a better actress (a la Charlize Theron). The HD DVD picture quality of course is there and the In Movie Experience is what helped make this one of the highset selling HD DVDs ever. Its a good film but not perfect. Still this is an essential HD DVD purchase if you can overlook some of the film's shortcomings.    HD DVD picture 8.5  HD DVD sound 9  Batman Begins story 7.5  Action 8.5
B000PMGS8G|5.0|I have been wanting this movie for my collection for a VERY long time!  It was never affordable until now.  This is an awesome film that pays perfect homage to the serials and has a KILLER soundtrack from Queen that is absolutely perfect for the action.  I can't wait until it arrives!
B000MNP2KI|2.0|The only reason why I give this Bond two stars is for the action sequence from the supporting stuntman in the beginning of the movie, Wow! Other than that, is definitely not the Ian Flemming's James Bond that I have grown to love. Instead, Hollywierd decided to go the way of mainstream and make a vicious punk into a British Agent. Too many sequences in this flick don't make sense. How did the girl get on the middle of the road in a high speed chase? How did the gate behind Bond blow up, him with no scratches? How much more could you stray from the classy character that was so intricate to the Bond movies?  I understand that Martin Campbell was trying to show an edgy dark side to the Bond mystic. But the only thing he achieved, in my book, was to tarnish the Bond image and blasted the doors open to destroying what made the Bond movies fun to go see, the humor, the \\"British refinement\\", and the gadgets. I would have liked it much better as a movie without the Bond name on it. As it stands, because of the warm reception from the movie going world, I fear that Bond will now head down the path of becoming just another violent and uninspired movie series created just for money, that America seems to thrive upon.
