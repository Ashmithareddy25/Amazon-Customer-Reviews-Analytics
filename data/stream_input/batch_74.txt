B002SEC9DM|2|The sizing is way off.  But the item itself is beautiful.
B00D1R84ZC|5|The size was just as expected. I have been using it to help with my post op and it is doing a great job. Some wear and tear after one week of using it 24/7 but holding up well and looking as those it will last for a while. For the price it's a great deal!
B00CY4003C|2|I ordered a 1X which is larger that I needed and it was very tight in the arms and fit snug. Also the stitching was not done correctly.
B004NEJ0A0|5|I bought this in turquoise for a slim 15 year old girl. It's prettier than I expected, especially the beaded tie. Another reviewer said the smocking was not comfortable on her bare chest, so I bought [[ASIN:B0077D3ZCS Zenana Outfitters Women's Allover Lace Bandeau Bra Tube Top]] to go with it. The bandeau bra is nice and soft over the chest, and the color is a perfect match just in case it should happen to show. I also ordered [[ASIN:B002BF88R4 Dritz Fashion Straps - Clear with Rhinestones]] in case she wants straps on the bra or the dress.
B0041LUS06|3|This mask is appropriate for what I plan for it but I will have to find a way to make it more sturdy as it is very thin.
B003B3P1JI|5|Wow! This was a such great find. It's a shaper that is comfortable and, because of the firming inset, actually works. No riding up and very comfortable. I can't overstate what a wonderful (and essential) wardrobe piece this amazing cami is. I'm a petite size 6, 34C, and the medium is perfect. Keep a look out at the discount stores and you can find them for a steal.
B00IJA0XUU|5|VERY NICE....
B00ML34Y4C|5|Sexy just right for the beach<br />I'm 153 order the large I'm 5'3
B00UMUNQAY|3|The bra is very nice and will fit better if they kep the sizes correct this was supposed to be a 40C and after measuring it only have 34 inches.<br />I kept it because I have wore it. Otherwise the style is very good.
B0095ZX2XS|5|Tempurpedic bed is warm and shirt eliminates that issue.  Soft comfortable.  Love this shirt.  Would like to see more colors.
B008Z83P9M|5|My son wore this as Tommy Ross in a local production of &#34;Carrie: The Musical.&#34; He had to dance in it and wear it through rehearsal and the show run. He loves it.<br /><br />He's going to order another to wear because he got all his cast mates to sign the original one, which is now framed and displayed proudly.
B00HVZOE7W|5|The colors are gorgeous and the fit is perfect. Beautiful summer dress. I love the convenience of Amazon...so easy to order and returns are just as prompt.<br /><br />**I bought this on my husbands amazon**  michael's wife
B00XBUO7FA|4|This is a beautiful bra, with soft fabrics and easy to open clips.  The fit is very flattering.  The only difficulty I had was with &#34;folding down&#34; the cups during feeding-the shaped cups don't fold well, so I need to roll them to get them out of the way, and they can interfere with latch if I am not careful.
B004DD50AU|1|I like the looks of the coveralls and the legs and arms fit fine, but the length from the shoulders to the crotch is way to short.  I am not a tall person (5'8\\") so all of my work coveralls are always too long in the crotch.  I am not very happy with these coveralls and I say this at one octave higher than normal.
B000F6X34Y|5|This jacket and pants really surprised me, they fit great and look really good. The pants are very low cut, so watch out for that if you don't like low cut jeans
B0034G65RY|5|Love it most wear it
B00CE3NM92|2|These do not look like the picture at all. My friend had galaxy pants and I tried to order ones that looked like them, and these were a major disappointment. They are too thin of material and it is almost sheer when wearing it. I am not a big girl and these do that on me. The waist is also awkward and they don't breathe at all like a normal cotton or spandex pant. I would not recommend these.
B00A8FYKAI|5|Measured wrong and had to send back. Was so easy to exchange. Once the new size came, I was thrilled beyond words. Looks fantastic and curves in all the right places. And feels as great on as it looks!!!! Thank you True Corset!<br />Jennifer Horton<br /><br />Just to be clear-my WIFE is the one with the corset, not me.
B0013N6OMG|5|Excelente producto, entregado según lo indicado por el vendedor, con la calidad esperada, cubriendo tadas las espectativas tanto en puntualidad como calidad del servicio
B00F168BHC|5|Very very comfortable soft cotton. Love the design. The only thing - I got black, and it's more like dark green, but it doesn't really bother me. If you are looking for a truly black top, this is not it.
B00KFVR41C|4|it was to big but i love it
B002QFH4G0|5|I purchased this t-shirt for a little boy at our church who loves the Marine Corps since my husband serves. The shirt is \\"official\\" Marine Corps licensed and is super soft. It is just like the ones my husband wears when he works out. I am not sure if the sizes run big, but I got the xlarge and it is big on me (5'5'' 125lbs female). It hasn't been washed yet so it might shrink. Overall really happy with this shirt - and the price is unbeatable with free shipping!
B004VOHJNW|5|The hat was perfect for me it is so nice you can wear it to go out not just for the fair love it
B00AWWQAH8|2|Beautifully made yet extremely small.
B005NL5SYY|5|had already used this model boxer seem pretty comfortable and soft to walk in the house, I use it especially for sleeping
B00GUZ01YY|5|Love them.
B00IOSCZSK|5|Good dress for the price
B00NIYBG58|1|Did not like these shirts
B008YU8VMC|5|Love it
B00SZCF9V0|5|- Very thin<br />- Perfect for Spring/Summer wear & Tropical climates<br />- Great Value...
B000WN3VUG|4|I like the gloves--there isn't as much fur in them as I'd hoped.  They keep my hands warmer than my old gloves.
B009T9TJ78|5|Purchased April 30, 2014<br /><br />No more cheap plastic collar stays. These fit well and firmly. I don't have to worry about them holding their shape while maintaining a sharp and upright collar.
B00DSQT5U4|4|These are a good quality and have a nice fit. Need I say more? My son wears these all the time.
B00K7TT21W|4|My daughter loves this leo and it is well made, it was small for the size I ordered, but I read the other reviews and expected it. I order the 6-7 for my almost 5 year old and it fit her well.
B00FG12KAQ|3|Nice swimsuit but too small in the breast area. Not true to size
B00NPK6CLI|4|They are very cute.
B00M747R62|5|These bands are fantastic, and much cooler than shorts or shape wear under a skirt in muggy summer weather.
B007MHG4C2|2|I had a hard time keeping it on my wrist and I have pretty big/strong hands for a woman. I bought this as a gift and I know it wont fit my friend who has very small womens hands. It also feels like it weighs about .5lbs while you are wearing it. Sadly, I have to return. I included a photo next to the ruler to make it easier for customers to see its size.
B00N3K2DS6|5|The gloves were beautiful.  The leather extremely soft.  Excellent quality for the money.  The gloves were a gift for to my brother and he loved them as well.
B002XSR9JC|5|When we switched to FR clothing at the company I worked for, the pants were less then work worthy. I quickly purchased a cpl of the Carhartt FR pants and felt at home the first time I put them on. Durable, comfortable, and just an all around awesome pair of jeans!
B00WFTPIY2|1|I order thiz dress but i get another dress,<br />Totally different from thiz one , not a good thing wen im days oway from 4 of july , now i dnt have time to return the dress and get the one that my daughter was supposed to wear!!!
B00NULTVPQ|5|These are my favorite leggings.  I'm 5'7&#34; 125lb and they fit great.  Not too tight at the top, and they don't slip down.  The print still looks awesome after dozens of washes.  The only sad things is a bit of pilling on the hips area, but it's not affecting the print and it's barely noticeable so I'll wear them until I can't.
B00LW4G63S|5|Good!
B0016Q5BZG|1|This was a terrible buy.  It is way too small...and I was worried that it might be too big.  Very uncomfortable.  These items made overseas in Asian countries generally run too small, and this bra is at least 3 to 4 sizes too small.  I will never buy anymore on line.
B000N8PYLY|5|I don't care what anybody say about this pants I love it. The size is just right and the look is what I want, I will be buying more for sure.
B001HGBZPK|4|I always like my Levi's and these are no exception.
B00IMB1DBO|5|Got here in 2 days, and fits amazing ! Definate 5 stars. Just wear tights under or a cup. Fyi
B005Q8UQEG|4|The fit was a little small.  My son who is only 5'1&#34; struggled with how tight and short it was.  One of the seams started coming unsewn the first time it was worn, probably because it pulled so much from being too small.  It also crushed his face and was rather uncomfortable.  I think with a bigger size it would have been fine.
B00EYXZ4UU|5|Read the reviews first to set your expectation.  I knew it was going to be smaller.  I am a girls 1x and so I bought the XXXL.  Tight on my chest, but that's to be expected with mens clothing on a woman.  Over all I think it's very cute.  It does have a slight weird fit on the sides of the jacket.  It sort of flings out. - Hard to explain, but wasn't a deal breaker.
B00RNPHVGG|4|Great color. Great look. Wish matching stockings had come with it. Fit 5' 2&#34;, 140 lb. woman.
B00CLMFYBK|5|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  Arrived quickly and as described.  The sizing was as I expected.  My son is a big Walking Dead fan and loved the shirt.  Would purchase again.
B00L8REFKA|4|For a plus size the shirt is not too loose or stretchy but it does have nice color
B0079MI3B0|3|too bright and extremely tight...no stretch at all
B000E21SXW|5|I love this shirt. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.
B00BGVJ2KG|5|I am 5' 10\\" and so of course have always had difficulties finding pants that fit appropriately.  My inseam is 33\\" and these fit perfectly.  With the stretch they hit right at my ankle bone.
B003E948EI|3|Not the right Size
B003TKFMF6|4|bubble gum not blush pink color as pictured
B0071UAQ06|4|Cute
B008LDG71Y|5|My daughter love her new purse thanks alot!! She will love to order more hello kitty purse from the company
B00DB2998S|3|Good fit,  comfortable but not crazy about the convertible straps. I also found them to be too narrow. Exchanged for similar Bali comfort  bra but with wider traditional straps.
B000YQNUKM|4|Comfy! It doesn't give you the best shape nor is it super supportive but I'm not terribly large chested so it's fine for me. It's SO comfy soft fabric, and easy to nurse in. The straps are thick and it doesn't hide well under summer clothing but it's worth the comfort.
B007OXJILI|5|Bought this to use as a robe around the house. It's great- pockets are deep- nothing falls out of them, snaps are quick and easy, and I even wore it at the end of my pregnancy (just button the top snap) and post pregnancy (the snaps make for easy nursing). I've washed it countless times already with no sign of wearing.
B00P043ANU|4|Cute dress!  Glad I read the other reviews though.  I normally wear a small, so I ordered a medium and it was still a little small.
B00GT5A3SY|4|Good buy for the price.  They are a little too long for me.
B001ATZT1A|5|I have three of these (so far). Very easy to throw on and the variety of wrapping styles makes it one of my most versatile pieces!
B000H6F1PQ|2|Its way too large
B009RA6864|5|Great looking top. Wife loves it
B003N5HD36|5|This shirt fits great.  I have an apple shape, and it falls below the &#34;pouch&#34; lower belly. It has a beautiful color and shape.
B00O0GEH2W|4|Definitely an adorable top!! I usually wear a L or XL, i feel the majority of the tightness in the sleeves.
B00PWEW8PE|4|It's wonderful and soft, you could easily make it if you have the patience. It looks just like the picture. smells funny though
B004TSCNPO|2|Looks fine but falls down constantly so I cannot wear.  As you walk it slides down so I don't ever wear it in public.  It's as if the elastic gave out, even though brand new.
B00JTHU6ZE|2|To big
B00RZ4Z0UE|5|Love it!
B00CMQ9FK6|5|Great value, good price.  Will buy another belt.
B00KWETXZ2|5|Perfect good quality and fit
B0093PDH62|5|This Little Black Dress was just the perfect thing for a young lady who needed a dressy black<br />dress for an orchestra performance. It fit just right, not too big or small, and with a little silk<br />shirt under it, the top can be transformed into a short sleeved dress for dancing and cotillion.<br />It was very soft and feminine, but still serviceable. A good choice for us.
B005BYB3F6|5|hilarious. i don't live in California but everyone here wears California shirts and sweaters. Had to have it.
B00CEY2V34|5|It fits perfectly and it's comfy.  I love that it is 100% cotton.  It is easy care, no touching up with a warm iron is necessary.
B00D76ZVNU|5|Cute backpack, it lights up on the top half (where it says twinkle toes). Super cute but kinda big. I got it for my 3 year old to take to preschool and it was just too big so I had to return it. But I would say that overall it was well made and a pretty standard size (just a little too big for my munchkin!)
B00KAB4WB2|5|Love it
B00E4HKBZY|5|Was looking for a some Calida pjs and couldn't find any - these are just as nice.  Soft and good fit.  Wash well.
B001JBH16K|5|I have been buying my Underwear from J.C penny's for a long time. They have been Haines..<br /> I found these by accident and just stuck with them. Haines comes in a 3 pack these come in a 5 pack for a few dollars less. Now it's fruit of the loom .
B00O4SI6O6|4|For the price I was pleased.  I like to be able to grab a black dress from my closet and throw it on for a more formal event, and this will do nicely.  It fits everywhere pretty well (I bought a size 4 and usually wear a size 4).  Not too short (shorter on model who has long legs!).  It's cut a tad wide in the hip area, but really no complaints.  It's a lazy, sort of flapper style.  Different with the addition of ivory at the bottom.
B00EFV0FQO|3|It looks way cool and a bit artsy (in a good way) in the photo but ts a bit more &#34;cowboy&#34; in person.
B002T6NMWG|1|Rides up terribly in the back. I am constantly pulling them down. Very disappointed
B005BNJ6D8|5|These jeans fit perfectly and the look is great. I intend to order another pair.
B00FWPV660|4|just so so
B005MFHCRW|4|Comfortable and warm. I was cautious because I didn't want it to be too small, I should have ordered my regular size.
B008P46T8U|1|These are fluorescent pink, much darker/lighter than the pic
B005VLWULA|3|The item is exactly as pictured, 100%. However, it is big around the ears, and the air holes in the middle (the little metal ring you can see in the picture) don't make the item look nice, but rather somewhat cheap. It's not adjustable either, so if you know that your head is smaller than average, or bigger, it may not be for you. The item is okay, nothing special. But I'd rather pay extra for nicer ear muffs. This item is plain, simple and average.
B00PAYO9BC|5|I got this product on lightning sale on Amazon Prime day and it was VERY well-worth it! I read the reviews saying they ran a bit small & that's true. In American products, I am usually a Large or an X-Large (31 pants) depending on the brand and material so I ordered the XL. It fits perfectly snug.<br /><br />Shipping was 2-day prime (yas). It is made of nylon and spandex, which allows my legs to BREATHE! They feel great and are NOT a &#34;cheap&#34; material like some reviews say, but moreso a thin material, which is ideal for me in any season. It is absolutely great quality.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is sheer and a little see-through (another reason why I ordered the XL instead of L). It fits me well enough that my bum isn't see-through, but the lowest part near my calves is a little see-through. It works well enough for me!<br /><br />I do not think I would buy this product full-price. But on sale, the quality is great!
B008OVL6Z0|4|This cotton tank fits well and straps do not show.  Very comfortable and washes well, keeping its size and shape.
B00B19NVWS|1|Do you pay 65 $ cap make in China?<br />I Don't. So I reture it.
B00FY8U8LO|4|Great long tank. Not bulky under thinner items.
B006OTY50C|3|The stitching holding the mitten part on came undone the first time my child wore them. I had to sew it back on. Haven't had an issue since. Very cute, though!
B000CEM5MU|3|I ordered what I thought was a pair of mens short pajamas and it turned out to be only the bottom, I would like very much to get the tops and don't know how.
B001717AAE|5|Excellent service!  Very nice shirt, cheap, good quality, and I got it 4 days before the estimated 'receive' date. Would definitely buy from this vendor again.
B00ANX3W5E|5|I love this shirt. The cut and shape of it is very flattering. Plus I love the design. I had to contact customer service and the woman who responded to me was very helpful.
B005ON2Z74|5|I love the weight of this belt (and yes, it is heavy!) and the sound the rings make as I move.<br />Great quality, great price. Now if only Amazon still had it in black ... Please?
B00I919F08|2|They are very thin but after wearing them for 20 minutes @ -4 degree Celsius with no wind my fingers were numb. I was hoping for gloves a bit warmer. even in 10 degree Celsius they made my hands cold.
B00QEGHY0S|4|Nice color and fabric, even though it is a bit thin. Overall a very good shirt. Would definitely recommend.
B004ARZKJA|5|Bought for husband. Very well made, great price! Would buy again.
B0031U0P7Y|5|This belt arrived exactly as decried, in high Carhartt quality, and very timely.  It is new and still in the packaging and very soft leather.
B00CKIH4FY|5|i love the robeez socks and just keep buying more because others just don't work now that my son is walking, running, and climbing.  the extra elastic around the ankle is great, and the grips on the bottom really help on our hardwood floors.  GREAT socks.
B00IO90T3M|4|It was a tad short for such a large shirt... I did order a 2XL. But overall, satisfied!
B003N63FNC|2|These a spandex and polyester. They are thin too. So, far they hold their shape well and the fit is good. However, I would have preferred cotton.
B004N94H8A|3|It's a nice mug, but it is difficult to get the top off.  You must get your fingernails between the lid and the cup and then try to pry it off.  Be careful if you have something hot inside.  I would not let a child use this with hot liquids inside unless you are sure they won't try to remove the lid.  It would have been nice if there was a little tab on the lid to help get the lid off.
B00ME4YPQK|1|Cheap, overpriced junk
B008FUCJJC|4|Warm but a little bit broad in chest for me.<br />Warm but a little bit broad in chest for me.
B009H6L71E|5|Perfect 👍
B0093FLKPM|5|Scarf is a synthetic,the colors are vibrant and the feel is very good.<br />It does not hurt that it honors my personal favorite doctor.<br />The length is not too much or too little; I am not quite (by along shot) as tall as Tom Baker.<br />I generally wear it with a black jacket and my wife says it looks good.
B00OANE5CM|5|These came earlier than expected. Super soft. Vibrant color. I can't wait to show them off!
B00FEJ6OR0|5|Excellent socks for yoga or Pilates. They are not too thick and not too thin and the soles really help you to maintain your stability. I bought a single pair first and loved them so much that I immediately ordered 3 more pairs.
B00ALLAZIU|5|These are a really great deal if you are looking for comfort and affordability in your socks.  I got them for practice sock for skating and they are very comfortable...Highly reccomend them...
B00KTU4RSM|1|It was just to small i normally wear a medium but even the large was too small
B004AYJ12A|5|Great quality, great fun, fast shipping. I will definitely order again, use for Zumba * We used them at a family party, gave all the women one as a Party favor* Wow, we never took them off* Put on some J Lo, Flo Rida, Rhianna etc and danced all night*
B00SG849EQ|3|I like the colors and material. But they were a size smaller than expected. I didn't return them as I had already started using them.
B00EVMYKUO|4|The stocking portion is so silky smooth. Feels like they should cost so much more.
B003RD7SM0|1|Red stone is red plastic.  In fact it all is plastic, down to the 'lace.\\"  Add to that fact it was folded and smashed in shipping.  Save your money.  Go to the 99 cents costume jewelry store.  You'll be much happier.
B00D2GH0XY|5|Color is fresh for a cold winter day.<br />Fit is very flattering with anything you where casual or semi casual.<br />love all of Vivienne Westwood clothing.
B001MKVUCE|2|I don't know how they can call this black... in no way is this a fine gradient of grays and black. It is shades of PURPLE. The veil also holds static if not treated with anti-static spray, which is annoying. It's extremely lightweight and probably not what you're looking for!
B00MTHH2I0|4|Purchased the largest size and it barely covered my stomach! It is a nice quality, just runs really small.
B0010Z1EE0|4|i am sorry i am disagreeing with what i am hearing... so i believed yas, and ordered a size large,,, anyway, at first it seemed true to what you all were saying, until i wore it for awhile, it stretched out... i am a woman,,, 5'7\\",, 130, work out actively,,its too big... its stretches, past my hips... and looks too big, i had to tuck it in.. to look, good... dissapointed because i agreed to what everyone was saying,,, its correct to sizing,  knowing that it is fitted slim.... think about what you are getting... \\"fitted\\" (slim to size,,,,,) its suppose to be fitting,, not your everyday \\"baggy\\" t-shirt... i wished they had a medium... anyway will keep.. LOVED THE COLOR...!!!PRETTY...
B00NOUYDTM|4|I love it cant wait to receive it!!
B004NRNR6A|5|These socks are really nice. My husband has had nothing but good things to say. He finds the fit good and they are comfortable when confined by shoes - heavens :). They feel quite soft and dense but are not bulky. The seams are not irritating. They come out of the dryer in excellent condition. If this keeps up, they are definitely in for repeat purchases.
B00M436ZRI|5|Product is exactly as described and came earlier than expected!
B002OTKJ9M|5|I bought this jacket for my friend and she adored it! It came just as described and I have no complaints!
B008L51HVM|5|Nice fit I'm just to endowed for them lol
B00BK81NAM|5|Perfect love it!
B00IALLSIE|5|Nice pattern and comfortable shirt.
B00PLCLK9W|4|Very cute
B000X8ZGVC|5|My daughter practically lives in these, she loves them so much!  Thank you.  We would definitely order again and recommend.
B00XQNVFJS|3|Cute and flirty.  It's a bit small but fits.
B009TLWG76|4|Not much more to say. I'm Silver Brand loyal and personally love that I can buy long/XXlong. These are true to size, although they may stretch a bit, they shrink back up if you dry them. Love love love my Silver Jeans!!
B00JUPNCFQ|5|Fits as expected.  Comfortable even with the underwire.
B00I3D14LK|5|I can't get enough of Paige jeans!!!  I think I've only ever purchased one pair of Paige jeans that absolutely did not work for me.  Oh well, I returned that pair.  It happens.  Nothing is perfect.  Otherwise, I have only had 110% positive experiences with Paige jeans, so Paige will continue to be my &#34;go-to&#34; denim brand.  I normally don't purchase lighter-wash jeans, but I really liked the look of these in the photos and wanted something a bit summery and a bit shorter length-wise.  For lighter jeans, these are just so flattering!  I am sure I'll be getting lots of use out of these this summer, no doubt.  Paige continues to be my favorite denim brand, and the prices on Amazon are unbeatable!
B0029F26BK|5|I like that it's adjustable, so it fits very well.  I am able to put my hair up with a clip and the hat fits just fine over it.  Can't do that with my other hats.  The brim is wide enough, but not excessive.  Cute.
B00075ZWVK|5|I use this as an under shirt. It is heavy enough to know it's there, but light enough to breath. I was worried at first, when I bought it the shirt seemed thin, after washing it was exaactly as I like it with seemingly no shrink. The only weird thing is a tag at the bottom that can be cut off, with the other tag is &#34;tagless&#34;.
B00E1JO9VC|5|First of all I love it because It's beautiful.  One time I wore it to my sons college graduation, this last four hours in the middle of the day.  everyone was sun burned except for me, the blouse protected me from sunburn!!!  Added bonus.
B001JDA8R2|5|This item turned out to be better than expected the quality of it is excellent! The only thing I'd say is buy a smaller size because \\"for me\\" I found the sizing of the actual garment was smaller than what's written on the chart
B00P3NS8GW|5|Wore this dress this Sunday. Perfect for spring weather. Very roomy and also fits in the right places.
B00FMXT182|5|I have plenty of friends and family who deer hunt. I knew I needed this shirt when I seen it. I love how bright the pink is. The shirt is more on the heavy duty side versus the thin tshirts. I actually like that better. Fit just like my other tshirts. Everybody loved it!
B00LCZE2HE|5|Super cute!
B004SVK2ZU|5|These wings were the perfect touch to my Halloween costume!
B001RNO3NY|5|the material is great, the logo is awesome and wont come off. Bottom line, I recommend it. If your a Sublime fan, you'll really love wearin this.
B00EYU5516|5|I liked the look of the shirt and now that I have it I LOVE the look of it. Very slick and smooth looking, elegance without looking too formal.
B0037J0TU2|5|My fiancé loved this belt! He had been looking for a camouflage belt and this one does the job! Shipping was fast and product exactly as expected.
B0031U0QCS|4|Can't disparage the quality of these and once I moved the adjusters as far down as they would go and moved the front clamps back on my jeans to the front pockets they just barely fit. I guess 5' 10\\" is the maximum height for humans if \\"one size fits all.\\" Been wearing them all day working on machinery and they are comfortable on the shoulders due to the elastic and wide straps and keep my pants up like they should. I did notice the \\"little biters\\" another reviewer mentioned and will probably make some cushioning wraps for the ends like he did. I wish I had another 6\\" length though so I could just pull the things away from my waist and solve the problem altogether. If these are \\"Made in China\\" like so much is nowadays perhaps someone from Carhartt should tell the manufacturer that Americans are generally taller than Asians.
B0089KAIH8|5|It's a great jacket, though not as tough as my Zero Xposure. But guess what??? The liner that came with this jacket actually fits my Zero Xposure coat (which I bought without a liner at a thrift store) so now I can use them both! I was very happy about that and this Free Country jacket is perfect for staying warm in places where nicer clothing is preferred.
B00539RK1A|5|Thick, gooey, red; Blood gel.  As advertised.  It does the job.
B006N0WWT8|5|My 2 y/o son absolutely loves this shirt! It is 100% cotton, light, and perfect for active little kids. My son feels comfortable in it. :)
B005DD9MD0|4|Pros:  Nice material, fit is as advertised (I got the U.S. XL for the longer arms (mine are 34-35), and it fits well), comfortable, and it's a very good look<br /><br />Cons:  May be a touch on the effeminate, side but that's my take.  My wife assures me that it's not.
B00YGOI8WS|3|Brought this bathing suit for my wife who is an US size 12 and it took a month to get here from china and it fits my 12 year old daughter who fits a size 14 kids  from most stores (ex. Children place, Justice etc.)  in the US. The material was good but please purchase 3 sizes larger
B005SICJN0|5|perfect fit and actually work better than i thought. i have a very happy teenage daughter at home!these are perfect for standing at the bus stop on cold mornings.
B003KEHYP2|5|fun fun fun.  usual soft foam balls with slit in side so it just slips onto the nose.  We shared the extras and had a ton of fun...
B000WTKILU|4|The button fell off after two washes and the hems looks like they may be coming apart already.  This is obviously concerning.  Fortunately the pants fit great.  The elastic waistband provides good fit and pockets are generous.  The grey color looks great and quite formal.  I have a pair of a non-button (clip) style that I will go back to on my next order as that has held up better.  Still a good value either way.
B002NPCJ5O|5|worked great for my daughter
B001H6VYXI|1|surprised husband Loved them, not pretty but fit well.
B007RGCX64|1|Ordered 2, got 1.
B00C2XVOTY|5|Bought this for my husband who is 6' 187 lbs...ordered large but had to return for Large Tall - Loves the jacket - incredibly warm in WI winters!  Very pleased with the quality!  Great product
B008UYMR6S|4|They seem to run a little large and were thinner than I expected, but still nice socks to wear to work.
B005VDXQDY|5|This item shipped fast and fits great!! I love workaholics and now can make people laugh when I go out.
B005KHHOAM|2|The cotton Gerber uses is of low quality and very thin. These pajamas as well as onesies I've been gifted in the past are not true to size and instead run much smaller. I bought the size 4T pajamas for my average-sized 2.5 year-old and the top is already riding up over his belly. The seams are also poorly constructed and too tight. Making a mental note to myself not to buy any Gerber clothing ever again!
B00CGW7TM2|5|These arrived yesterday, a full week before I expected them. I couldn't wait to try them on and WOW, these are just soooooo sexy. Yes it took a while to get them on and get them smooth all the way down my legs, but when you do get them on they make your legs look incredible. I am 6' and 185 lbs and I got the large and they are perfect fit and length. You should see them with a pair of heels. As I said, incredible.<br /><br />If your waist is bigger than 36 and your hips are bigger than 41, you had better get the biggest size because these are tight.<br /><br />Overall, I think I will be getting more of these.
B00A78ZESI|5|My daughter loved this shirt!!!
B0026P4602|5|Comfortable and great support.
B0077DR55G|5|Love the T Shirt!
B00D8GO0TK|5|at first I thought it was a real tie and jacket but when I got it waseven better plus its thin so it is cool when its hot outside not recommended for the cold though.
B00LMVAVKA|5|very good fit, for an industrial make suit
B00ENLQ53S|4|I like it. It's a great accessory for a Dipper Pines fan
B007XD6JWA|5|I absolutely love this dress its super cute the lace part is somewhat see through. But I just wear a shirt under and it comes with a belt so cute! I'm 5'3 and it ends at my knees
B0020MMNUQ|4|I could not find these in store anymore. My others were getting old and these are their replacements.<br />Got just waht I paid for so I'm happy with them. Will probably purchase more closes online in future.
B00LKVW1RI|5|I'll be completely honest I thought it would be a little metro sexual because of the unisex thing but I'm very surprise how it looks and feels. I'm very muscular and big so a lot of beanie type caps do not fit me well. It's pretty heavy and looks sturdy. I like the tabs on the side you can buckle it down shorter. I will definately order a couple more. I would recommend this product.
B00GH0VV00|5|excellent
B00BKWTKM6|1|the pants were just what i was looking for but was disappointed in the quality,and the size was about 6 inches too small
B00DTIO8ZI|5|Ordered this for my Brother who is a kid at heart!  The quality was good...the size was as expected and he put it on right away and had fun with it!
B00AE9L5LU|1|This wallet looks good in the picture but the leather is very flimsy, and the most part cheap..looks are deceiving with this wallet...I ended up returning this wallet and going to my local harley store end buying the same style wallet, but waaay better quality leather...
B010N2P1DA|5|Great fit!  Just enough stretch so toes don't get pinched, and also fit nicely around your toes without extra material that could make wearing them uncomfortable.
B00PMB4II2|5|This shirt is true to size. My son turned 2 in October so I've been debating on getting him 2T/3T. Some 2Ts fit him a bit snug so I know he won't get much wear in them. I got the 3T and its a bit big, but he LOVES mater! I know this will last until next winter so I'm happy. I already washed it and the colors are still vibrant and it did not shrink.
B0063DODOC|5|&#34;Ugly Christmas Tie&#34; needed - check!  And really it's not that ugly.  Was perfect for my son and he wore it several times throughout the holidays.
B00L40R6WU|5|The coat fits perfect...I bought a large fit me perfect as I am a size 10 but have heavy arms, plenty of rooms for the arms!  Love the cut of the coat, they way it is sewed, and  the back is perfect..., hood large but  it sure kept my hair dry during the rain.  The coat is light weight perfect for going shopping in department stores and warm enough to go from the house to the car to a store or restaurant, perfect for me!!!!  The large gold zipper looks great.... Loved all the reviews positive and negative which helped me to select this coat.....
B00ACIGUBI|5|great fit and comfort
B00FFGQJ5Y|5|Great product, excellent shipping time, and very accurate description. I am going to be purchasing more shirts from them.
B00Q4353AE|3|It's ok
B008AE2JXY|4|Beautiful and full train/vail the only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because the actual panties part was very large, I don't know if I would say it was a one size item, I am usually a medium but this was the size of an xl
B002DEVND4|5|Was a gift and he loved it. I would recommed this product to anyone for the quality. Great Look !!
B00664M840|5|I read all the reviews before purchasing this dress and i buy LOT'S  of Shoes and Clothes.  This dress no let me say this company for the price, time and style. I've purchase 3 more outfits.  I am just your normal customer but appreciate when people tell you the truth about things when your spending your $$$$$$.  I've purchased 3 dresses now and one shirt.  Listen ladies true to size their quality and prices are EXCELLENT.  Not to say anything about the way this company sends your purchase out.  Wait till you get your package in the mail.  Purple packaging, then wait until you see inside.  You'll feel like you purchased it from a high in boutique.Thank you everyone for your honesty.
B00I1QIWIW|3|The sizing chart seemed to be accurate. I ordered based on my son's measurements on the chart, and the suit fit as described. It is not as tailored (fitted at the waist) as the picture shows, it is a bit looser. I will probably have it taken in a little to have a more stylish look, but basic fitting is as expected. The material is not of high quality. It is polyester, and while the Jacket is lined and looks good, the pants are unlined and rather thin material. But for the price, and the fact my son will probably only wear it once for his sister's wedding, before he outgrows it, I think this Tux is worth the $45 I paid.
B00G8ZI7RY|2|Strangely cut. The body is too small and the sleeves are way too long (even though I'm 5'11&#34; and have very long arms).
B00BD4B628|5|Fits wonderfully and I am small busted so a nice fit is hard to find. The only negative is the straps tends to pull out of the holder when putting it on.
B00N93N8NQ|4|not waterproof
B00B7MBMGG|5|Hubby is hard to please when it comes to boxers, but he loved this brand!!  He wears a 40 size pants and these XL boxers were the perfect fit. Roomy legs, comfy, stylish and hallelujah the dryer didn't shrink them!! I got him 5 pair in different colors. Happy hubby!
B00FJ1TU88|3|it is a little small,not tall enough.could not put much money.
B00IXO2PGC|5|Came on time as expected.
B00CNGTWDU|5|Good fit
B00EY7AN70|3|Love the sweater but the arms are a little small.  At first I didn't think I could get me arms into the sleeves.  They are definitely not loose like in the picture.  Maybe it was just mine.
B00D4KTJDW|5|My granddaughter loves the outfit.  She wears it to school.  I think you will be pleased. Good value for a fast-growing child.
B00D3QZTTK|2|I have a couple NuBras and was hoping this would work a bit better for cleaning them.  But I think that just using hand soap works much better.  This is watery and doesn't really seem to do much.
B0009JE7CY|5|The SpaSilk bodysuit will go down as one of the best items I've ever purchased for my son. The cotton is thick and soft, and the suits are extremely well-made with wide, soft seams. The suits wash well, don't shrink, and don't lose their shape. <br /> <br />After trying these myself, I'll now include these as shower gifts for friends. I highly recommend them. I only wish they came in larger sizes, as my little guy will outgrow his in the next couple of months.
B00EWC8Q5S|5|First time customer
B005C4XT98|3|The sizing runs small on these skirts. The waist sits VERY high and the material is somewhat thin. I like the design, but its sized quite small and I ordered a Large, when I really needed a XL. (I usually wear a L)
B000JLIYEO|5|Shirt was as described. The color is fantastic & the quality is good.
B00T37ACJ0|5|Exactly as described
B00910VFS6|4|It's definitely NOT the orginal kigurimi, the pikachu nose reminds me of a halloween pumpkin. I ordered the large and it was probably 3 times too big, but it is extremely warm so I'm happy.
B003DX1QEK|4|This visor is perfect.  Nice and sturdy and well made. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I would have preferred a military green, rather than a Kelly green, but that color was not available.
B00I5UUMPA|1|It didn't fit like I expected
B006ZU6UL2|5|perfect fit, A Success in the xmas party. My Friend love it, everyone that look at her told me that she looks amazing
B0029F86FA|4|Hat fit perfect. The cost was not to high. Will be great in all my plays.at church during Texas Independance Day.
B009JZHSIE|5|I love these pants.  Super durable and the quality surpasses my expectations.  I love these.  They are very comfy for my little man and he loves them. This is my second time buying them, I had the smaller size.  I will continue to purchase these pants as he gets older.
B00F3J3EOW|2|They are basically two puffs that are equally poofy on both sides, meaning they do not lie flat on the  ears and therefore don't cover them well.  I may try to rip them apart to try to redistribute the stuffing so they actually cover the ears well. If I can't, they will be wasted because they are not practical.
B00DWGXDWQ|5|thanks
B00OZOF4W6|5|THIS ONE COOL HAT!!!!I LOVE IT!  IT PROJECTS ME  WITH  A  ITLIAN  FLAIR , I JUST FEEL GOOD WHEN I WEAR IT!  THANKS!!!!!!!!!DR STEVE HOBBS DARLINGTON SC
B00L905O74|5|Very cute swimsuit. I'm a girl of a certain age (44) and the suit doesn't look silly or immature on me. Matter of fact I also bought it in polka dots, still cute without being &#34;too young&#34;.
B00S8EWDNW|3|Sort of skimpy.  Calling it xxl is a bit of a stretch.  The button down pocket is too small to be of any practical use. Otherwise, it is an ok inexpensive summer shirt. The designer should get his color vision checked.
B000LNL5EG|5|it was really cute and could use it over and over. I ordered a pair of cheap purple leggings from amazon and that worked great to go with.  you don't need the gloves.
B0080FO7AQ|5|Love the way it looks with the side panelling. Does seem a little bigger than any other scrub top, but it's perfect if it would ever shrink in the wash at all.
B00KNSWYH6|2|Okay, but too short for me at 5' 8&#34;, and snug.  If they were longer I would keep them and hope to loose those 5 lbs I need to loose :)
B0052BILFI|5|I needed a maternity tank to wear under sheer tops. It gives a tiny bit of support now that I am in my third trimester and helps hold up my maternity pants that tend to slide down (it's no bellaband, though!). It fits as expected.
B00APJFDYO|3|This is irritating because in the picture, they have the shirt pinned back like on store mannequins so it looks body fitting when in fact it is not! Even the shoulders are not fitting like that.  It is a straight tank with no fitting any area.  I can tuck mine in my jeans but not sure how that will look.  I will return if it doesn't fit right.  But beware.  The print looks more snaky on the picture but in person, it looks a little  bit like snake print.  Can't explain it but just be cautious of these two factors.
B00OZD9XMY|5|I love Bio World's snap backs, This is a one size hat so you can re-adjust it. The colors were extraordinary. It had no flaws and It is probably one of my favorite Snap backs now. I would recommend this hat if you like vibrant colors but is contrast off the black. It gives the Fade a great depth. The picture on the cap is very nicely touched. The fabric used for the hat itself is very nice. It's thin But not too thin, over all I think this is a great hat a 10/10 purchase.
B00FLP3N9E|1|hOrribly it was falling apart, in the picture looks very pretty but is definitely not the same  don't buy it horrible, horrible, hOrribly
B001B6N6SK|5|Excellent quality. Made well. Did have to lay armband out flat with book on top for a few days to get it to lay properly, but everything else was great!
B0002A4JM8|1|The sizes for this product are way too confusing and not accurate at all. The fabric doesn't look at all like the picture either.
B00DSYAMYO|4|a little large but has nice color, matching with my new pants,what is more it keeps me warm in winter
B007OX43QS|5|Grate Del Rossa Men's 100% Cotton Woven Pajama Set, Large Black (A0714BLKLG)<br />Grate Del Rossa Men's 100% Cotton Woven Pajama Set, Large Black (A0714BLKLG)<br />Grate Del Rossa Men's 100% Cotton Woven Pajama Set, Large Black (A0714BLKLG)
B00JGF96HS|5|If you want to be a DIVA!!!!!, WEAR THIS WITH RIGHT COLORS ALONG WITH YOUR JEWELRY. AND DO NOT FORGET THE HANDBAG!!!!
B00LPDEA4S|5|The coat arrived very quickly and because the product fit description warned to size up for American sizing, the coat fit well. The cut of the cost is fantastic, very flattering. The lining is unique and beautiful and as promised, the coat is very warm even though it has practically no weight to it, and kept me warm during the early 2015 cold snap. Highly recommend this brand.
B00MNRRKL0|5|I find these scarves to be perfect for general winter wear. The multi-color styles are compatible with all kinds of coats.
B0042D2L76|5|Very pleased with the suspenders I ordered. Very good quality and fit my boyfriend who is 6'5\\" so definitely good if you're very tall.
B00KM5S6LI|4|It fits well and i was so scared that it wasn't gonna fit. I'm 5'9 and 160 lb. The only problem is that the is an air gap where the curve in my back but beside that it will fit a curvy lady ( size36 D and Size 11 pants). It better than getting the halloween cat suits i recommended this cute cat suit.
B00502KE1S|5|You can't beat Levi's for quality or Amazon for shipping. They fit perfectly, shipped rapidly and look great! I have bought from all other stores, and Levis are the only jeans my daughter can stand to wear, they're soft, durable classics.
B007NLX4BG|5|This dress is soft and flattering. It is fun to twirl in, and it looks great with a cardigan. The color and cut is lovely.
B002TNQBEA|4|Cozy & cute for layering. I reviewed this in a different color, too - great top! I love the hood - and only wish the elasticized waist (which is only on the front) was a drawstring that went all the way around, but I can make that adjustment myself.<br /><br />The length is perfect to wear as a babydoll with stockings or tall boots, or layered over jeans. The deep V neckline is very sexy, or can be dressed down easily by layering a tank or Tshirt underneath.<br /><br />The decorative design is subtle & may go out of style, so I hope these are offered without a pattern or with a new pattern so I can mix it up. I wouldn't mind less puffed sleeves, too, but these are fine.<br /><br />This 3X (as recommended by the sizing guidelines) is a bit loose on me, which is fine for slouching around the house and allows more room for layering. Shrinks a tiny bit when it is washed, but is still loose.
B00YSMP0SS|5|The shirt look better than expected
B00827RPW4|5|My wife loves them and she looks gret in them
B00K21326Q|5|I bought several masks to wear at my Masquerade Wedding Reception.  This one was by far the best.  The eye holes are nice and large...so my eye lashes don't hit and the mask sits nicely on my face, no major pressure points on my nose which was annoying with one of the others.  It is kind of heavy but it's really nice.
B00MAWHRFC|5|it worked out great!
B002GHC3QE|3|The fabric is a little thin and also a bit scratchy, but the shirt does just what it's supposed to do and the pocket is nice. If you cut the emblem on the pocket off carefully (thread by thread) before you ever wash it you can make the shirt look better. This isn't a great choice, but it is a good one.
B0045DYNOW|4|It's ok for Winter if you have heavy socks and boots underneath. I don't have thin legs either. Washes ok.Needs shaping after wash when you lay it out to dry...
B005GSYGDS|2|had previously purchased these exact jeans - size - color- style locally,  The waist on these Jeans is 3 inches smaller than the older jeans, which still fit very well.
B001KU5N0Q|5|Comfortable, warm, fits perfectly. Reasonable price, good communication, quick shipment.  Will buy again.
B00286FLRQ|5|Great
B00ARB8E0K|5|I was more than satisfied with my purchase for this dress; excellent quality, well designed, unique color, great fit, perfect length for a dressy affair.
B00891VPE2|1|Though this listing says it's from Sazac the product I received WAS NOT! The quality is much lower than what's pictured with no hood lining or high quality materials of the real thing. I would've just bought one of the cheaper knock off one's if that's what I wanted but I wanted the high quality Sazac ones.<br /><br />So if your item is going to be shipped by PenSan cancel your order NOW!!!
B00EU4C442|4|It does fit as expected , however I ordered 5 sweaters of all different colors - but I received 3 identical blue & 2 identical black , so that was disappointing.<br />But they look and fit good .
B00DVI991O|4|The ensemble is adorable. Buy Oh My GOODNESS! They have about two lengths of leg material on them. Other than that, they're a good deal for the price. Just be aware of the sizing.
B00BU1ZAHQ|5|These fit perfectly. I love the way they feel too.
B001LPHL9G|2|I bought as accessory for Halloween costume. Turned my neck green. If you're like me and plan on only wearing it once, it's okay. If you plan on wearing this multiple times like for belly dancing, etc., then I would definitely not recommend.
B001V7KIUS|5|This is a very professional looking tie.  I have gotten compliments on it and very fair pricing.
B008EIS56Q|5|Finally, able to find dresses in the right sizes to fit all my granddaughters.  These are really cute and will look great all winter!
B006AAHMPK|1|I am very sorry to say that the I got was not what I expected I didn't like. It at all I wish I  bought the other dress that's what I get for not listening to another reader who said something about busted women  but even if it did fit I wouldn't have like the dress is ugggly!
B00AQDPX12|5|Love it! It is very elegant and beautifully made. The color varies a little but its still a very beautiful color! :)
B00EI4KJ4Q|4|Like the socks and they are a good thickness.  Most funky socks are very thin these are thicker.  Plus a t-rex breathing fire!
B00PW0JZ7W|2|Was too small and wore once, washed once and shrunk even more.  Order a larger size than normal.
B0024YXG10|5|This is exactly what I was looking for.  I barely know it is in my back pocket when I sit down and I can throw it in my front pocket easily as well. The quality is top notch and the leather is superb.
B00EISV65S|5|The material of these pants are not the same as it was years ago, when I use to wear Dickies all the time, but they are comfortable. The comfort waist band helps me, because a 38 is to tight, and a 40 inch waist is too big for me in standard pants. This helps me get a good fit without having to tighten my belt so tight that it hurts. The price point is affordable too, for someone on a limited budget.
B00L65JIOM|5|Nice cardigan.
B00GGP50NA|2|toe holes after 3-4 wears for 6-8h
B00GLR3ZHG|5|I love the dress and I will be ordering again!!!!!
B001FAV4AY|5|Nice inexpensive red ball cap to match my girl's softball team red visors.  Comfortable to wear too.  Very happy.
B009S3IB7Y|4|Beautiful color and style. It is not the exact what I wanted, but I like it. I will try to wear it for my next concert.
B006OP4Q2I|1|The dress is beautiful and sexy but the material is literally so horrible and it start going bad after a week or so so i had to return it and get my money back !!!
B006H6VYMO|4|Love it
B00641VDUA|5|My nephew loves it!
B004BDOPUS|3|Just about what you would expect. No complaints on my part, but I just use them as undershirts. Basic Hanes.
B00HQXAO9Q|5|These were for my 89 year old mother to warm her feet while recovering in the hospital after surgery.  I wanted the hospital personnel to know she is Wonder Woman, not just some little ol' lady.  She thought they were fun.
B00MERU7GE|5|It's pretty.
B002IRK4PE|4|A super comfy costume, except the chest muscles occasionally get too warm. Get the light-up ring, sold separately, for the full effect. The kids loved it!
B00ARAZLRK|5|Ordered the small but came as a large, which must be the international equivalent, because it fits tight on the last set of hooks (there are 4).  Pleased that you can adjust if you are trying to lose weight.  Well worth the $.
B007BHXBU6|2|Not a good material. Never wore it. Wish I returned it.
B00EXWUE48|5|The Material was perfect, the Length was Ideal, thickness was great, even wore it twice in a row i loved it so much! OH and the Seller was Super Awesome! sent a handwritten personal note with the shirt! Thank you!
B006BCPMCC|5|Cute and warm
B00JR60G1G|5|Beautifully made! Natural color authentic Merino Wool. This is a Comfortable fit with natural ease in the Arms Chest and Hip. Sleeve length is perfect extending 1\\" past my wrist.<br />The overall length is generous extending 6\\" past my fingertips and has a 2 way zipper, a very pleasant an unexpected feature, score!<br />I bought the XL, I am 5'5 , a 44C bustline with 37\\" waist and 48\\"lower hip.
B00712VSVA|5|Excellent quality for the price.  Knot is well made and holds up well.  Clip works so that it is not visible, most of the time.
B001N1C8ZA|5|I used this for my 3 month old son for Halloween and it was perfect! I live in Michigan and it was cold that night so there was lots of room for him in there. My son is on the larger size of babies ~12# at that time. I would buy this again. I wish it came with a superman hat--instead I bought one online from somewhere else.
B0012FRMCQ|4|Fits well, is well made, a little lighter weight than I hoped for but my fault for not reading the fine print. Overall, nice shirt.
B009CCRL6I|5|Wearing these as I write this review, They are very comfortable and warm, which is great for the fall and winter season. I know my feet are still sweating, but I guess the wool breathes better, so my feet don't get cold and clammy like they do in cotton socks. The  pricing is very competitive and can't be beat.  The socks are well made and themselves remind me of my Smartwool socks. If these socks last a couple of seasons and they seem like they will, they will have been are a very worthwhile purchase.  Unlike other reviewers I did not find the socks too loose around my ankles or calves. I wear size 11 extra wide sneakers, not sure if you have larger feet if these will fit well.
B000TDQ9PS|4|This is a VERY detailed mask for what you pay.  I have to admit i enjoy viewing it from a distance rather than wear it though.  It looks amazing, i mean the picture does do it justice.  It's a bit on the oversized side though.  The main problem i had with it is the lack of air i was getting.  I had to cut some larger nostrils, eye holes, and eye brow slits to make it more bareable.  Its hard to wear for long periods just because of the airflow issues.  I have it on display now and am still enjoying it deadly gaze on a daily basis.  Good quality mask, slightly oversized, but overall im please with my purchase.  4 out of 5 stars!
B005RR0IJ4|4|Jeans of good quality. Were a little too big in the waist and the hips well and sat down. A little stretch, that could be taken and smaller size.
B004LNTAC6|5|My sister was glad to receive this as a gift.  It's just the right size, and in her favorite color as well.  She really enjoys this wallet.
B00CE88UIK|5|This is a great Yoshi shirt - really fun green and Yoshi is printed brightly and clearly. Great shirt! The size is true to size too.
B00S4PLC28|5|It's perfect. .beautifully  made
B00EFXC2RW|5|These jeans are perfect.  They are hard to find in local stores.  They are a little tighter on the legs than the older series but not too tight to be an issue.  Love them will definitely be buying more
B00F2VI2SO|5|EXCELLENT !! LOVE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS ITEM MANY THANKS AGAIN, I HAVE NO COMPARISON TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ABOVE ITEM
B008DGGC78|2|It is sized way too small. Very narrow and only a very tiny child could wear it. Had to return it.
B001DTV14Q|4|My last conquistador hat was made of metal and extremely heavy.  When I battled, my neck would get tired and I would sometimes slouch over on my horse.  With this fake plastic flimsy conquistador hat, I've left all those worries behind.  A must buy for every Spaniard!
B00BZ5Y99C|5|my daughter was soooo  cute,  in it I wanted it to be a real denium and shirt but oh well.<br /><br />I was worried it'd look cheap and it was great!
B00BI20IGK|5|My son loves these socks.  They are easy for him to slip on, and easy for me to pair up when folding the laundry.
B00FXPSHWK|5|The fit is good and the quality is excellent. Extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to everyone. Very warm shirt and good in the wind also.
B00W77KWE8|5|I have the blue denim capris, so I knew the white ones would fit.  I love Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and capris.
B0099LVHU8|5|Great clothes, good quality, the quality i expected fron Polo and low price compared to dept. stores. And it arrived on time.<br />highly recommended.
B007C3OOGO|2|This should not be labeled as S/M, it fit more like an XS, I am so disappointed. But it looks as pictured and I think I would have loved it had I been able to actually wear it.
B00NEHO3NQ|5|Awesome  value
B0091VHEFS|4|Does what you'd expect it to do. Vision is kinda blurry, and when you talk/rap, it can sound kind of muffled, but understandable. The top of the mask is wrinkled funny so wear a hat! Also, the logo is pretty visible on the back of the neck so I usually just flip it over so you can't see the logo.
B006GQP368|1|I didn't buy this here, this is such a cute mirror but I saw it at Claires for less then six dollars $
B00KZZ8TGM|5|Great!
B008FVEO58|5|Love it. I wear it without the belt. It is light enough to have on all day with an outfit. Length is great for leggings
B00IJHIZDU|5|lightweight and comfortable.  Perfect for summer days and nights. Throw a shrug or bolo over it and it is perfect for work.
B00SIHWPQY|1|Ended up shorter than I expected, had to give away.
B00ATLFOXI|4|I haven't worn it anywhere but it fits amazing and looks very classy.  I have a feeling this is going to be a favorite.
B0012XXAG0|5|I love this bra.  I've had it for about 2 months now and it is honestly the most comfortable bra I've ever owned.  I was a little worried that because there was no underwire that it wouldn't really give me the support I was used to, but it's holding up great! hee, hee  No, really.  I get the support I want, the shape I want and it's comfortable.  Besides that, it's great quality - after two months it hasn't stretched out at all, no rips, tears or fraying.  I only bought two - just to try them out, but I'm definitely buying more.  I highly recommend this bra.
B00G334R84|1|It did not look anything like the picture.  Half of the hair fell down and wasn't even connected to the the rest of the wig.  I couldn't even get it on my head it was so small.  I am not sure if it was defective or not but I ended up buying another wig because this one did not work for me at all.
B00BMDC016|1|As stated by other reviewers, the neck on the shirt is sewn very strangely. My son refuses to wear it, because it looks so weird.
B0054J9WX8|5|Fossil makes great belts, well constructed, good quality. I wear 29&#34; waist jeans and the medium is perfect.
B00QVQY36O|5|poop
B005N7YXZS|4|I waited to use the band b4 writing this review and i am now 7 months, 1 week and wear the band pretty comfortably with my normal clothes/pants/skirts. Its a good quality band - i bought the size 2 since I'm normally a medium (6-8). Only complaint is that the band scrunches up the butt fabric area of my work pants when i wear this at work but that's not a huge issue. I'll also add that during months 4-5, I actually also used a band that I bought from the $1 store - it's meant to be worn over jeans but its basically the same as the bella band, just made from cheaper cotton fabric. The concept is the same however.<br /><br />I would reccomend this band to anyone who is reasonably slim and thinks they will stay this way during their pregnancy. i.e. I'm still wearing a lot of my pre-pregnancy clothes/pants/jeans - i just wear everything unbuttoned and then wear the band over it.<br /><br />The only reason I'll stop using the band is when its placing too much pressure on my bladder since I've certainly reached the need to urinate often phase!
B00D8WM0NM|5|Wore it yesterday and got many compliments on it.  Nice color,nice fabric.  Foxcroft does a very nice job.  Thank you.
B00CJB7SP8|2|It's a cute outfit, but the top runs small and short so I've had to forgo using the top in favour of a similar one that fits her.  The other parts of this outfit fits fine but I don't want to buy an outfit for my g/daughter only to find that only part of it fits right..  Otherwise, it's well made, the material is good quality and it has had only minimal fading over the several times it's been washed.
B003APIRAM|2|These headbands were cute, but painful to wear.  Most party guests took them off soon after trying them on.  In addition, the shamrock head boppers easily fell off.  When I opened the package, one headband had a shamrock missing (which I found separated in the package).  As guests tried them on, multiple headbands lost one shamrock. I would not recommend these headbands.
B00OLFXRSW|5|Fits comfortably, looks great! Fit as expected.
B005Q0OHIA|1|The shirt in the picture is obviously gray, the shirt I received is bright purple.  Either let people know they may receive a different color or update your picture.
B00PNT3SXO|5|nice
B00HUNY056|1|This hoodie turned out too be to small and the fabric was very cheap. Do NOT buy this hoodie the piece of crap is not for your hard earned money
B00A5CKGNY|3|Pretty nice jacket. The color is just as it is seen on the internet. and it sheds a a few
B004PBJ2UE|5|I ordered this product one month after having my second c-section and wished I would of sooner! At the hospital they gave me an abdominal binder tha was just ok. It started to lose its shape after a few weeks. I went on the hunt for something better. I came across bellefit and after reading the reviews, I knew I had to order. I used the online sizing system and ordered a medium corset style since I had a c-section. It came two days later, so super fast shipping!  I took it out of the package and thought this is no way going to fit me. I had help from my husband and sure enough, it did! I clasped it on the first row.  I have to say its very comfortable, I'm able to sleep in it and only take it off to shower. It gives you better posture and your tummy feels tighter especially since i did have a csection. Im only 4'11 and I love the fact that it covers from the bottom of my bra down. So i get full abdominal coverage!  My stomach is so much flatter and I'm almost back to pre-preg weight having about 10 lbs to go 2 months after baby is born. With my first it took me nearly a year to get to my pre-preg weight!  I now can clasp it on the tighter row and almost ready to go down to a size small!! I wish I would've discovered this the first pregnancy. It's amazing and anyone who orders won't be disappointed at all!
B005V3HEJQ|4|-The logo isn't as big on the shirt as it is in the picture. Other than that, it is a pretty good purchase.<br /><br />-Minimal shrinkage, order your normal size.
B00E9QBNMK|3|The color and images were as pictured. As it was a bit pricier I expected a thicker shirt, this is a lightweight. My son loves it and the green is vivid. A cool shirt, a little bigger in terms of fit.
B009KE5XCM|5|I have tried it with a RFID card and key chain.  neither of them worked when inside the wallet pressed up on the scanner.
B00FKHRESO|5|Very soft and super comfortable!
B0019LMNB8|1|Poorly made. split in half within 4 months.
B00GTB0MX4|5|It was a bit tight at first but as I lost the weight it fit better, Very good product for the price.
B00PCMXMIS|5|Very happy with the gown.
B00DR5I052|4|I am 5 feet tall and about 111 lbs.- I recommend the petite size for anyone around my size.<br /><br />I love the product, but they aren't the traditional &#34;soft&#34; feeling. You can definitely tell that they are made with durable thick fabric. For someone who works a lot and may be willing to pay $50-60+ on scrubs these are definitely nice, but if you work part time and take good care of your scrubs, I don't necessarily recommend paying the steep price.<br /><br />If you have the money- 100% recommended.
B0030DFCRA|1|Not Amazons fault but got these with the seam from the crotch to the back belt loop blown out!  Bought to wear to wedding so never opened till then and then couldn't wear them and had been to long to send back! need better quality control!
B007JPKKJU|4|on the large side but works great just the same.  Thin material so plan to layer. I really like it.
B007NDA5CU|4|I'm not good at figuring out sizes from the measurements given in the product descriptions so I was expecting a smaller bag.But it is a really pretty bag and well made so I'm still very happy with it.
B000GZFDMO|5|I've been wearing tams for 30 years but have had trouble finding them in Navy Blue.  Never got a bad hat from Kangol.
B003GXFTU4|5|excellent!
B00ED4T6P4|1|Read reviews and the concept is great (as others stated)? I didn't get to find out as these split shortly after putting on and walking a few feet. Ordered medium, which was still a bit large for me, and walked to the next room, heard a swish noise, seam ripped completely from the rooter to the tooter and then a breeze across my back end.  These were lacking in material to even attempt to sew them back up and I wondered how they were even held together.  The slimhot logo is an iron on which was already coming off when removed from the package?  Not happy at all with this product.
B00RUE42LW|2|Too thick to wear for running.
B002G9UEJ0|4|Got this hat for my husband to walk in the neighborhood in the winter. He has a big head and it fits him very well, covering his ears fully. It is soft and molds to the head. Looks good, even to wear to work. I got him the brown and it goes with his tan heavyweight suede jacket. He likes it and says it is very comfortable.
B00NMTOPP2|5|The shirt was just as I expect. Fits good and I was pleased with fast shipping
B00E3VT4AO|5|Beautiful and elegant!! Perfect for a gift!
B001JBNDLW|5|Have used these for 30 yrs. Run true on size. Price ok. 7 pack is way to go. Advise you to buy
B0031U0PO2|4|I always have trouble guessing at belt sizes from different make so here after buying my first carhartt belt...<br /><br />first notch ( belt set for girthiest :) ) on size 34 belt is a snug 34, if you tend to range up a bit from there you should probably get the larger.<br /><br />Belt seems fine, real test is how long it lasts, maybe i'll remember to update it.
B00NH9MGOO|3|I'd say you're good with the size you normally wear in sweaters. I was worried that since it's from China or somewhere it'd run really small, so I bought an XL when I normally wear like a Medium in most sweaters, and it was way too big. I could have done a Med or Large, depending on how tight I wanted it. But anyway, maybe it was because it was too large but it did not drape like it does in the photo. The zipper pockets were nice, however, and the fabric is super soft and comfy.
B00MMTRDG6|5|Great shorts! Rugged and comfortable, these shorts have quickly become my favorite. I primarily wear them for farm work and they do a great job. The cargo pockets provide ample room for storage and the dedicated cell phone pocket really comes in handy. The material is heavy and built to last. My only concern is where the cargo flaps are stitched - this seems like a weak point. Time will tell but I'm very happy with them so far. They do seem to run a bit small so I'd recommend ordering up a size.
B00IPFB3BM|4|as I expected
B005CSNWEQ|5|The best tights. I will only buy these tights from now on. Stay in place while running/working out. Perfect price. LOVE THEM!
B0018OMLWC|3|seem somebody use that before, i dont mind used that. but if you need everything are perfect, i advice dont buy that
B000WBGB96|5|Received this and I Love It! Very well made. Fit is true to size. Would recommend this belt to others.
B002QYMCVI|5|This robe fits me perfectly... And I'm a big guy standing in at 6'7\\" 250 lbs. I can't go a day now with out USO my big soft robe. Quality is great and so is the feel
B005CKGR4Q|1|Wig looked nothing like picture.  Yes, I should have known by the price, but only needed it for one night. Unfortunately wig was totally useless. Basically was just a bunch of hard, stringy fake hair in no pattern. No greaser look, no pompadoo, just fake hair stuck together on a flimsy base.  Don't waste you money on this one.
B004XDUAH8|5|Got this for my future Marine husband as anniversary gift, he loves it, its holding up well and very well put together. Ordered 2 days shipping it arrived on time.
B00TFSAGQG|4|I only have one problem with this dress (Taylor brand in general) and it's the size. I saw that other reviewers said the dress runs large, so I bought one size down. That was NOT enough. I recommend buying 2 to 3 sizes lower than your norm. I wear a 24 and I bought a 22 the first time, returned it and got a 20. The 20 is still a bit large. I should have gotten it in an 18 but didn't want to go through the effort again. The dress is really quality material, but MAKE SURE YOU BUY AT LEAST 2 SIZES LOWER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR.
B007GB8F08|5|I love Leveret! fabulous product... way better than my traditional pj methods such as Old Navy etc..<br />This is VERY well made.. I won't purchase anything else!
B00ABDLH8A|5|Purchased for my teen as a cover over her swim suit. She loved it. Well pleased with the quality of product.
B0078KWB02|5|I love love love this wrap! Very soft and well made.  I have received a lot of compliments on it.
B00OTFGY2A|5|I love these. They are comfortable and stylish. I like that they have a pocket on the side for my phone.
B008S20IF4|4|These hankies all measure 15.5\\" by 16\\" which I point out only because the ad claims they are 16\\" square. Four of the handkerchiefs had loose threads around the borders.<br /><br />They appear to be of average quality.
B00P6S43R2|4|A nice pj dress. I wear a small (size 4) in regular clothes, and this is a tad big. But...they're pjs. so they're just extra comfy. :)
B0064Y4CSM|5|Just perfect!
B000NJY14O|2|The T-shirt is gorgeous and my son loves it.  Unfortunately, I had to repair the seams in the shoulder before it was even washed!
B00L4AWRZQ|5|I'm hooked.  This bra is completely comfortable, provides enough support and is sexy, too.  Can't beat that combination!
B00CLVMJ5A|5|My husband loves Champion Men's double dry training shorts. He wears them just about daily and just requested another pair.
B002AQ47OC|5|Love them - length is great - hard to get
B00B6EATUU|4|The scarf is a beautiful color as pictured with a very faint paisley woven into the fabric but not at all obvious.  The size is good, larger than most. My only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that it is very thin.  I did not want a heavy scarf but I am not sure this will offer much warmth.  I bought for a fall, evening, outdoor wedding I will wear it and hope I'm not too cold.
B00BWKK3IQ|5|my sister asked me to buy this dress for her . It was awesome and perfect . she said that she will order two more from the same brand
B00B8Y5B1K|5|Great shirt. A little big for a small but the shirt is good quality.
B005IDI6NW|5|I own a lot of drivers caps. This one is my main one I wear. My favorite. Fits my head perfect. I love it!
B00NXYU7AS|5|The socks were as described, thanks.
B00AE49AYY|5|I wore this dress to my future daughter in laws shower. It was a huge hit  I received many complements.  I plan on wearing it again to a spring wedding. The fabric is so comfortable. I chose the coral and I loved it!
B000UGVDVY|4|larger than expected
B00EUXHMZO|1|This is a very cute top but I ordered the XL and thought it would fit....  VERY, VERY small...  more like an XS... no way to return...  will not order this type of item again...
B00Q9BQXDW|3|it is really long but small in width
B00JSPYPOU|5|The color of this dress is a fantastic peacock teal. I love the drape of the cut and the fabric.
B00ISD37RE|4|These fit fine except for the length. I am 5-7 so they came down to only mid-calf on me. I wanted something that would go down to my ankles. However, they are great thick material and warm for winter.
B00JB6BHKQ|5|My daughter fell in love with this dress. Really nice quality and excellent price. It's a great purchase and I'm very happy with how well made it is. It isn't a really hot weather dress. The upper part is heavier material so it's not for intensely hot weather but is a perfect warm weather dress. So darling on her too and she feels really beautiful wearing it.
B00M0H13M0|4|Anne Klein attire offers customers value for their choices, and this dress is no exception!  Material is a bit heavy for warm weather,  but more importantly it fits amazingly, has quality and style. Very pleased with this purchase!
B00J5UOPBQ|5|My daughter loves these cheer socks in her team colors. They fit great and are perfect for winter cheer in NH!
B0082UWF3U|5|Sharp looking!  Uses the Jayne &#34;cunning hat&#34; instead of the Chive logo.  Wear on days when you anticipate having the desire for some grenades but you remember that you cannot legally posses M67 grenades or a 40mm grenade launcher.  Should be paired with a Jayne Cobb Knit cap which I got at Amazon!
B00E0G1T5A|5|excelente.-.
B00KXU0MJQ|5|Absolutely one of the best backpacks I've ever owned!
B00EAZ6V1I|4|Decent Shirt, Decent Price.
B006LQA9SK|5|It has been a year now that I purchased these iron on collar stays for my valet team at our condo in hopes of lowering our uniform costs.  I'm happy to say that the product has worked as described and has saved us money. I've noticed since the first time that I bought them that the fabric and glue is thicker and the corners are now rounded to prevent fraying. It's nice to see that the manufacturer is continually improving their product. In my experience, I found that you can reinforce the collar by also ironing a second one on top, if you like \\"extra starch\\"..<br /><br />I totally disagree with the person that gave it one star.  He probably didn't iron them on long enough.
B00AEE57H8|5|I absolutely love this bottom! The color is rich and beautiful..I would recommend to anyone who wants to look sexy..:)
B001M14D54|5|Nice quality, big hit!  My husband loved it.
B00LCSAB5S|4|dress was a little to big but took a seam up and fit fine..
B000TIT32O|5|I have purchased many of these for my 5 grandchildren and they always fit beautifully!  They are easy to care for and nice and warm!
B003V4AL5G|4|I wanted very tiny wallet that fits my pocket, and it does fit into my pocket, but it is vey prominent from outside. in other words, if you want small one, i dont recommend this wallet. it is also thicker than my old wallet. the good dthings are pleny in this wallet. for example, nice leather, many pockets to credit cards, excellent packaging, are pros. in brief, it is still one of the effordable and comfortable wallets out there, but dockers have to make it smaller next time.
B007MSN1GI|5|Gorgeous hat! Looks just like in the picture. It fits my large head perfectly, so it might be a bit big on many people. Looks extremely classy and sophisticated on the beach. It arrived perfectly on time for my Florida vacation with Prime shipping. Feels sturdy and well-constructed. Wonderful buy considering the price!
B00KOK91YW|3|Ok Product
B005OFLTE2|1|Very bad the quality
B008XOXMPK|4|They were a little better than I had expected. I am 105lbs 4'11 and the small fit me well...just a tad loose in the lower legs but fit well in the booty and waist. for 10 bucks they are worth the price. they seem just as good as some i see in stores for 30-40.00
B00245G3O6|5|Very nice, thank you!
B004ZMRMAU|5|Awesome/Sexy/Comfy. What a great product that serves as a functional hose, while being sexy and comfy all at the same time. A HUGE hit with NY Sig Other and held up through several washings! Gorgeous!
B00B58ICOM|5|IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD!
B00J94528I|5|Love the dresses. They are a little too big but she will grow into them.
B009PMJZUA|5|I cannot begin to explain how comfy this shirt is. And keeps me warm on those nippy days. I've washed it a bunch of times & it hasn't shrunk. Wish it came in other colors because I would SO buy them all!
B00BFH39RI|5|The smocking makes this dress extremely comfortable. Slip over head and off you go. Like the on or off shoulder option too. Very cool on these hot days. Vendor service is excellent too.
B00E1JO9VC|5|Love it! I get lots of compliments
B00AEUIL9S|5|My child is 18-24 months size in the waist, depending on the clothes.  This fits very well/slightly loose but not falling off.  He loves them.  Price is a bit high to buy a lot of these, but I had to get boxers because he already dislikes underwear.  I try to put him in underwear first, then use these whenever he refuses the underwear.  The only down side is that when an accident occurs it is a flood since these don't contain anything (the pants part is loose on my tiny boy).
B003ICCUEQ|3|HUGE! I'm an XS but this was S-M (since there's no XS) so I bought it anyway. When I put it on, it was way too long at the bottom and way too loose at the hips. So all I did was roll it up at the top to the desire length and tuck it under the belt I had on my pitate costume. Needless to say, it worked! Sure, it's a bit itchy but for one day wear, it was worth it.
B00PCAXPAU|2|I loved the outfit and it was super cute! The first time I washed it the flowers on the shirt bled all over the shirt.
B00F6IGE7E|4|Very comfortable, touchscreen works like its supposed to, the price is perfect unlike many other touchscreen gloves that can run you over $30.
B00K1FK1EO|4|Cute shirt, but fits an entire size smaller than expected. It is cut very narrow and runs smaller than the standard t-shirts from the disney store.
B00FOPME4Q|5|something big but charming me
B00F6YH03K|1|this thing looks nothing like the picture and its to big for a new born, also she hasn't returned my money :( its been over a month.
B00DZI3QXC|4|I like the pattern on this set. It felt a little small around the shoulder/armpit area. I had to return it, worried if washing & drying many, many times it would shrink and be tight.
B00CD7LWGO|5|I gave this to my daughter last Christmas when she was nearly 4 and it was too big (she's a tall girl!).  She has worn it any way and loves it to pieces and this year it fits just perfectly and she still loves it very much.  It's soft and cozy and we both like the inner tie as well as the outer tie.
B001E1KUJU|4|Price was adequate.  Shipping and communication from seller was great.  My problem is that the \\"one-size-fits-all\\" statement for LRG beanies doesn't account for adult males.  I wear a 7 1/2 hat size...and this beanie was waaaaay too small for me.  Karmaloop's return policy is that the buyer must pay return shipping.  Which would have meant I pay 6bucks for nothing.  I'd rather give the hat to my girl...which is what I did.  The hat looks great...and the seller was fair...but the product isn't appropriate for an adult male.
B000IBFGF0|5|Got exactly what was described you can't order your exact waist size unless your wearing it over your underwear but with work pants and shirt you gotta order it 1 size bigger if you want it snugged 2 sizes bigger if you want a lil room so you can reach in your pockets or scratch an itch. Also I'm only 5'9&#34; and a 28 length was perfect don't bother with the 30 length unless your almost 6'
B00KJBUYBU|5|Perfect fit.  My 16 year old son loves it!
B00MZF0B0C|4|Very cozy. They fit perfectly...I am 5'8/165 lbs so I got the right size. Like a second skin :) Length is perfect and they are very soft and not too thin. Can't see through them. Nicely made and they don't ride too low, which was a concern of mine. The bottoms for some reason started to roll up a little bit...thought that was odd. Overall, great for the price and I would buy again. Got the gray..looks like the picture.
B00I1QITF8|1|poor quality and ill fitting. Silly shoulder pads. I returned it.
B007EKOSS4|4|You can tell these are quality socks. But they do run a little big. I wear a size 7 and they are not a snug fit. Also, they are not warm socks and do not keep your feet warm in cold weather ( below freezing). I have a pair of small Men's Carhartt socks that are super thick and my feet never get cold. These socks are more on the lightweight side.
B00CB3CIO0|2|The shirt fits fine, but the throat collar circle is way to small...feels like it's choking me.
B00IHGQ1T8|4|These pants fit fine.  The length is an issue for me.  The model in the image must have a short inseam.  I am only 5feet 5inches.  However, my inseam is 33 inches.  These pants are not full-length on me.  They are move like capris.
B000J40Y7G|5|We loved it!  My daughter loved it!  She was adorable!  And warm!  We still use the the turtleneck as a shirt for her daily outfits.
B00S7X19OI|5|It was super cute but was to small!
B001RTSCOO|1|The grey shirt is 90% cotton and 10% synthetic. The product description is misleading. Here is the text:<br /><br />  100% Cotton<br />  Label-free<br />  Generous length<br />  Durable pocket<br />  Machine Wash Warm. Tumble Dry Low.
B00IOPNMCG|5|I tought this dress came with an invisible zip to the back as an opening but it has a large zipper that is accessible from either end that runs down the entire back of the dress. When I stepped out to work I looked HOTTTTT everyone commended me and the unique placed zipper took the cake. I would most definitly recommend this to a friend.
B00L53SOA4|5|warm and fit in size
B00HUTX1WI|4|very good
B005G6LDB8|5|I ordered these shirts for my husband and brother. We all love the show \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" and I wanted to surprise them both with these shirts on Christmas morning.  They will love them! The shirts are perfect!<br />The size is as expected and the quality is good!  I love the Reaper Logo and I can't wait to see their faces when they open their gifts!<br /><br />Judy
B00CIH620K|5|Love the style, color and fabric. Extremely satisfied.
B00NGS6DD6|5|Very comfortable fit
B00APT9QYW|4|Would have love to been able to use it, but it was too small in the bust line for me to wear, it your busty.
B00BTO3REC|2|The shirt has a nice cut.  However, it is much smaller than advertised.  It says a large but is way too small to be large.
B005CSOHMW|5|worth to buy it
B009EVX0XA|5|My granddaughters call me MIMI. This shirt is awesome and she likes it too. Washes up well. And I love it.
B00X69GHW2|5|Fit great, good quality!
B00M3RYUJK|5|After no luck in finding a beret-style hat at any local store, I went to Amazon and found this.  I took a chance and ordered it in black and gray because I really liked the style.  They took weeks to ship but it was worth the wait.  Warm and stylish!
B00NHN0H4G|3|Poor quality, the Tshirt came with holes at the tag ties.
B00KZ18BRS|4|I was at the upper edge of the 2X measurement chart and decided to take a chance and get it instead of the 3X based on the reviews that it ran large.  It fits well even with the fleece lining in.  I have not used the liner yet.  It does not show through the navy color.  The sleeves are a perfect length for me, and I have long arms.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, it does have a rubbery feel with the liner out.  Walking for a distance in a downpour it did seem wet inside, but I'm not sure if it was rain soaking through or perspiration.  Not happy that I had to pay so much extra for the navy color, but I am happy with the purchase.
B008OC7Z4U|5|These pants are just what I was hoping they'd be.  Typical Geoffrey Beene quality and fit.  Very nice.  My expectations are fulfilled once again.  I wasn't thrilled about the way they were shipped however.  They were delivered in a plastic bag-not a box.  Not much was protecting them from getting damaged.  They didn't thankfully.
B008YEZGZI|5|These are thick, warm, high quality dress socks. They are nice and soft and they will go perfectly with my dress shoes under slacks. Mine also say machine wash. I was concerned when I opened the package to see &#34;size 9-11&#34; because I am size 7.5 in shoes, and a petite, but they fit just fine.
B00IKBT37C|5|Excellent
B008KAEK8K|5|These are great! They are soft, warm and look really cute on fully extended or with a bit of slouch. Excellent product!
B002R0FGQY|4|thanks
B00K0WZ986|5|great
B004M489Z8|4|the case came as expected and as outlined in the ad to purchase.  for a cheap product the quality is more than adequate and the shipping was exacatly as described on the purchase document.  would not hesitate to order again.
B005IPKHJQ|5|Bought this for my husband because he needs to keep the sun off of his face and neck.  He loves it!
B00BJOFHG8|2|These clearly aren't American sized.
B003NX8D9G|2|The quality of the item was not what I expected from Columbia.  I own other fleece type jackets and vests and the material of this jacket is not as soft/warm and comfy as I would have liked.
B004WY8NO0|4|I ordered these for my cruise coming up in a week and I haven't had any reason to use them right now since it is currently 30 degrees out side.  But they fit, which is always a plus.
B00TAEDV58|5|I got a black and grey one and they fit perfectly they're so cute. And the price is amazing for the quality the shirts are. These shirts at online boutiques are 13+. Very happy with nlmy purchase and will be ordering a white one soon.
B00Q8CHHW8|1|These are leggings not actual pants; very disappointing. Gave them to my 10yr old daughter...
B001AE9FJM|5|Great fit, great colour and my SO is very happy with them.
B00NIN6MWG|1|Only giving this 1 star because they don't have a medium..... This sweater is freakin awesome, but my size is out. Once I can buy one of these bad boys I'm sure this 1 star will bump up to a 5!
B00285TYI4|5|These are wonderful, one time wear pasties! If you have never worn pasties before, only buy for how big your ariola is. Mine can be covered with a quarter so I bought the small ones.<br />Also- they sent me one of those &#34;boobies&#34; rubber bracelets for breast cancer awareness month!!! How stinkin' cute!!! Absolute love it and will wear it on my honeymoon!! Thanks so much guys!! Keep doing what your doing!! Made me opening my package that much more sweet and special!! Made me smile a little bigger!
B002VCCTE0|5|Bought for my husband for Father's Day.  He loves it. Picture could be better though.
B00FS2NUU2|3|Beautiful
B00CE32ATK|5|Love it!!!!
B00EW0OODI|4|This hat fit the way a wide-brim hat should fit.  I wear a 7 1/4 and the Large fit perfectly.  It is a great looking hat and  shipped well protected.  If you are looking for a black straw cowboy hat, you can stop looking...you found it!
B004D69ZRG|4|I've been working out in these pants for a couple of months now, and they work great. I did notice that they have extra tummy room, so they are a bit large on me, mostly in front. If you're high waisted, they will probably be perfect.
B00JYB3NJG|3|The color and style of this top is delightful, however, it is a bit binding around the bottom. I am very tall and prefer a looser fit. This is a bit too clingy for my taste. Fabric is a bit too slippery and feels uncomfortable in hot weather.  Overall this top is a cute design and a great color. If you have any extra weight that you are hoping to hide, I would keep looking.  Looser fabric and the larger size was not beneficial for the desired look. I think this top would be beautiful on anyone who is thin. Otherwise it sort of accentuates areas you would rather diminish.
B00NCAGKMC|4|Much softer than I expected! They are listed as a unisex pajama, but really do look like they're made for boys. Regardless, my daughter loves the pants and wears them with a t-shirt to bed.
B00M8C24XE|5|While the kids might view this as a toy, we adults enjoy the fact that our kid has a hat on when it's pretty cold outside.  My kid enjoys pulling the hair and wearing this thing all over the place.
B00YCAJC4E|5|I am very, very happy with the scarves. I will order from this vendor again.
B0093KJ3CO|5|Most comfortable trousers that I wear and they look stylish<br />Recommend that you try at least once! Also very durable
B00UFMSWIU|5|Mediums fit perfect on my size 12 feet. They're comfortable and concealed even with boating shoes on. I love the rubber grip on the heel which prevents the back of the sock from sliding off. I plan on buying more of these!
B00KF7WGD2|5|It fits perfectly
B003TQL2X6|4|Considering the price and what it was going to be used for, I have no complaints about this item whatsoever. It was as advertised on the site.
B00NGKMCOS|5|It fits really well, it's not too tight or too loose. I'll 5'8, 162 lbs and I got a medium. I would definitely buy this again
B004DCA71I|4|These are kind of a faded black color.  Casual looking jeans.  These have the zip fly, and I prefer the button fly.  These have a slightly looser fit than some other Levis jeans.
B00IKHJ8SK|5|qute. it's warm. my boy likes it.
B0038JMOJK|5|These are the first pairs of fingerless gloves I ever bought. I am very happy with them they fit well and have a nice cuff that isn't too short. It's nice having your fingers able to do tasks without removing your gloves. I bought three pair, and then went back and bought the last three colors.
B00L2IMTBW|2|This costume was just delivered and it in no way looks like the picture. The tutu is not full at all. Extremely disappointed
B008XL2C8G|5|OK, it is on the large size so if you have a tiny head, either know how to take it in or don't order. But I have a medium sized head, its a little big but I love it that way. This hat is really warm too. Everyone that sees it adores it.
B00BS27VQA|4|Sizing charts do not help much when they are so generic. A better description if the item would help. For instance, stating that this skirt sits below waist so do not use waist measurement, use hip size.
B002TMI1K8|4|Just got the bag in from Fed Ex and there was already a problem. The box it came in was open. The delivery guy wasn't sure if it was someone at his facility or from where I ordered it from but the tape was ripped and the box was half open. Although I opened it and the bag was fine I am kinda disappointed only because it's raining today and if it wasn't in a plastic cover it could have been damaged. Also, I ordered 2 day shipping and it didn't get here for 4 days. It's okay though because the shipping was free anyway. Despite that the bag is fine its self. I was also concerned about how skinny the strap is and if it would dig into my shoulder if I were to carry heavier books to my classes. But that's fine cause I have an extra shoulder pad from an old bag that I can use. I love that inside is water proof so if it's raining my papers and books wont get wet. ^_^. I love this bag and I love The Nightmare Before Xmas. I'd recommend this bag to anyone who loves it as much as I do.
B00BIPUUH4|4|Lots of compliments, but the material seems kind of cheap, and you can't machine wash it (I mean really?  Sorry, but I sweat when I do ballet...).  It's a bit like very thin bathing suit material, but it does have the liner for the bra area.  I ordered the blue and black, and it's really pretty.  The neckline is less flattering than I'd hoped, but again, I get compliments every time I wear it.  I'm 5'9&#34;, 141 lbs, and I ordered the large, which fits perfectly.  back straps are a bit loose, but hey, I expected that - the torso length is great but is otherwise really a bit too big.  That said, I'm not swimming in it, either.  I think all in all, Natalie's sizing is more forgiving for taller ladies.
B008X1JN7O|5|Love this dress! I purchased a size larger than my usual, due to the reviews. Thanks for the reviews about sizing it helped me purchase a fabulous dress!
B000PC8E6U|5|I had been searching for months for something that would help prevent my daughters' heads from hanging so uncomfortably and bobbing all over the place whenever they fall asleep in the car.  I had tried a couple of other types of pillows, but had not found anything else that really worked until I came across this one on Amazon.  What a great idea!  I ordered one for each of my oldest girls and we tried them out on a few short trips and they really worked great.  We just recently came back from a very long road trip too and these things were wonderful.
B008KAUB5G|5|Love it
B000BRMGJU|5|Good service. Will buy again.
B00YISUK2S|1|way to small !!! Ordered the xxl and it is like a medium.
B000VK3SSA|5|This bra is super comfortable. The fit is as expected and designed. I will buy again.
B0058D1Q20|2|This bra has inserted foam cups that float around in the bra.  They have to constantly be adjusted. After washing the cups can come out or move to the other side.  I ended up taking mine out.
B00PQN9R5K|3|The pants feel nice but just a tad loose in the waist area. It wasn't pulling down while I was being active, but still made me a little uneasy.
B00K8LZCPO|5|Love this outfit for my newborn!
B007G3LTVS|5|LOVE!!!!! I am not what you would consider an XS, but I know how BCBG fits, so I ordered down and am glad I did. It is so wonderful, the perfect summer dress! The cut is so flattering, and the length makes it great for daytime or I would wear this for dinner and drinks out. Really a great dress!!!
B00D9M38DW|2|, I normally wear a XL to fit my shoulders,
B00BQM1IPW|3|I like this fine.  It's pretty and fits to size. The only trouble was securing the panty hose onto it.  It was not as easy as I imagined it would be.  Also the back was very hard to reach alone.  My idea now is to secure it before putting it on w/the stockings.  I think this will work out well although I haven't tried it yet.
B00I55OKNA|3|The built was in good quality. However, the design was not fit for asian headshape. Too tight for left and right sides.
B001HKYIVY|5|This is such a great flapper dress! Nice quality for the price. It does run on the large end of the size scale, for example, I'm a 12 on the bottom, closer to an 8/10 on top, and I ordered the large. It was a bit large in the chest area, but a flapper dress should not be tight!! If I had been wearing it alone, I probably would have taken in the fabric under the arms, but I was wearing a fringed shawl so I didn't even bother. I'm 5'4&#34; and it hit me above the knee, which was perfect. In my opinion, the dress in the image of the model shown is too tight anyway. Flappers weren't about showing off their curves! The headband is cute and looks great with the feather. The feather is not attached, so you can place it anywhere. You could glue or sew it on if you need to. I wore this with my lacy shawl, pearls, cigarette holder and t-strap shoes and it looked AMAZING! Got a lot of compliments!
B00328HRFI|5|I love them
B00AMA1QEC|4|Fits and looks great! They get a little bit loose after wearing them all day but overall I love them, especially with boots.
B001I8HJSE|1|I bought this with the impression that it was a nursing gown. However it's just a night shirt. The buttons don't go down far enough to even attempt breast feeding. There are no slits either. The sizing is way off. Buy the next size up as they run very small. The quality is not v good. Definitely not as nice as in the photo. It was very expensive. I tried to return it, but the customer service is NON existent!
B00HYMCSSO|3|Soft and cute but I got it and pulled it out of the package and one of the seams ripped so I sewed it up and the second time I wore it it got another rip in the seam. Its almost like there isn't enough material on the other side of the seam to hold or something I'm not sure. But It was worth the money I suppose since it was cheap.
B004282HW0|5|Excellent
B00LHZN9YQ|5|I don't generally write reviews, but I am absolutely thrilled with this coat. It is definitely the warmest coat I have ever owned. I was actually a bit too hot in it today, since it was relatively mild today for December in Chicago (it was about 35 degrees). I am confident that this coat will keep me nice and toasty even in the nasty subzero temps that we are sure to have this winter. I'm glad that I chose to go with a size medium- I will have room for a thick sweater underneath (not that it will be necessary with how warm this coat is!). I am 5'4 and 130lb and the medium is perfect. I would definitely recommend this coat, particularly for anyone who lives in a place where nasty winters are common.
B001T18IPI|1|Tje mask smells terrible, the plastic smell is umbearable, i could mot use the mask for more than 5 minutes and i am sure that if i did i would have been intoxicated. I yurned the mask inside out and left it on my balcony, it has been there 3 weeks now and the plastic smell is still there.
B00WQRHXJQ|5|super cute, luv luv
B004WPHWUK|5|This dress exceeded my expectations for the price. I sized up as recommended by some reviewers and to be honest its probably a little big for me, especially as the material is quite stretchy, but as I intend to wear it outside at night, this will allow me to wear layers underneath.<br />Otherwise it looks good, skirt comes down to the ground (I am 5'7&#34; and so many costumes are way too short, they look ridiculous) and I will match my vampire dog perfectly this weekend. Happy Halloween everyone.
B002YPCCHS|4|We are leaving for Mexico in about six weeks and this is perfect for my husband. First of all, everything needed for international travel is in this passport travel wallet. So nice to finally have everything on hand to go through security without having to search in several places for what they require instead of scrambling in multi places for each item that you need to show them before you pass through.
B000EBO9FM|5|After receiving Army universes suit i can say this is the rigt suit for me because its fit on my body,the sleeves is tight enough.Im very pleased with it and i would recommend them to any of my friends.<br />Iwant to say thanks for Army Universes because send my order very fast and in agood condition.Im looking forward to order more suits.
B00HJBFFPI|1|Lace makes fat bulge on thighs, i cut it off then it rolled up, not tight enough, people say order a siE up but i shouldnt have, doesnt really do anything like butt lift or tighten and the bra part holder suck as well. U get what u pay for.. If i disnt cut the lace i would of returned it.
B0093FIBEA|5|Was perfect for Comic Con.
B002QRG7UM|5|The order was correct, the size was correct, the color was correct, I like wearing these belts. Completely satisfy with this product.
B00BEZ6EA0|2|I mistakenly ordered this skirt twice because it said 1x.  It might (MIGHT!) be a size 6.  LOVED the skirt, it's just not sized correctly.
B003ZK6RNQ|5|the quality and workmanship of this wallet is unbeatable! i have been searching for a zippered wallet all over the web and came across this one and am so glad i did, you can see right out of the box the care and craftsmanship that went into this wallet for such a great price. if you are looking at this wallet and wondering \\"is it as good as it looks?\\" let me be the one to tell you its better! buy this wallet you will have no regrets
B00JGHM21I|4|Beautiful
B004JZ7DYS|5|Very cute and flattering! This has the best of both worlds. It's a stocking with a fishnet print. I am very self conscience of my tummy but with the design it hides it. I feel very sexy in this and it drives my husband crazy!! So yes I recommend this to friends ;)
B00W0Y273M|2|I was surprised how big this shirt was..I returned it.  I am not sure if it was because of the size but it doesn't really have the same look as it does in the photo.  I ran across this issue before when I purchased a sit that wasn't shown on an actual person.
B0042GNLMM|1|To keep this short and sweet, the logo is so off-centered that this shirt is unwearable. Highly disappointed. Based on other reviews I'm not the only one, so take the gamble at your own risk...
B00JR3ZGXM|5|GORGEOUS, and so very soft.
B00IGEJNUK|5|So happy with these! Was pleasantly surprised by cottony soft feel and stretchy comfy quality! The colors are awesome! Very good value.
B00BYQQYMM|1|Horrible fabric. I ordered the medium and they were too short (and I'm only 5'4), and the leggings were not snug to my ankles (they were loose by the ankles and made my legs look wider).
B001SIEWNE|3|Size runs true. I'm an 18/20 and I had reservations initially about the fit prior to receiving the garment and tried to cancel however the company does not allow cancellations for costumes in the month of October. Also they don't allow refunds / exchanges only. Luckily the costume ended up fitting and can be worn, otherwise I would have been stuck with it.
B00RX8H366|5|Great hat, love the SPF factor.
B009E6RCFM|5|I love the scarf! Nice color. Very happy with it. Looks delicate but sure can take a lot of handling. Looking to get another in a different color. Brown, perhaps...
B00HW38OOW|5|This dress works on so many levels.  It can be dressed up or down very easily. It is very comfortable and chic!
B00UXFMMOY|3|Very pretty, but has very little support. It looks great on and would be nice to impress a date, but isn't what I would wear daily.
B0089XUFLY|2|Really was not flattering. The dress clings to all the wrong places. I doubt I'll ever wear it. Should have returned it.
B00BCYDTLK|5|Tutu and headband were just as shown though I did have to adjust the pompoms since they all had settled to the bottom of the tutu. But the outfit was super cute on my daughter for her cake smash photo shoot and 1st birthday party.
B00DRGJTUQ|3|They fit fine but they were a little to long. I don't know if I can cut them to size
B00CX54952|5|The greatest!
B00NXKX3SU|5|Love them !! They are a little snug because I have thick legs but I love them!
B007WA3K4Y|4|This is a pretty cute top. I love the bow at the neckline, and am really excited to wear it!
B00F756ZHA|5|Small company, so it took a couple of months to custom make for us, but fit is perfect, leather and workmanship are wonderful and the hat is better than we hoped for.  So nice, it will be worn for more than just a finishing look for steampunk attire.
B00850091C|5|Great pants!
B00OK31XXQ|1|Doesn't look anything like the photo. What I received looked like a night gown.
B004P589TA|2|As a 6'4&#34; man, this costume fits WAY too tight In the crotchal region. Not bad everywhere else though.
B0018OMSN4|4|good
B007E7SH48|5|Low rise, nice dark color.  Tight fit on the waist and butt, but not tight around the legs as I like.  I've worn it for two days straight so far.  Though my one complaint about all jeans is the sticker on the leg they put with the size.  I wish jeans never have that.  Only cause I keep forgetting to take the sticker off.
B00DT9NDQW|3|Small and thin, but my daughter liked the pony. I guess she can wear it for a couple of months.
B00KB59FIW|2|I was really excited to get this shirt in the mail, but when it came and I tried it on it was really short and didn't fit right. I ordered a large. Ended up giving it to my sister-in-law and it fits her perfect and she's an extra small/small beware when you order!! Would have loved it if it would have fit!
B00JB076DE|5|This is EXACT as picture. Dont worry about quality, it is great. the top is very small on me and the bottom is perfect but I am 34dd and size 4 so to be far.....<br />Very sexy!
B00DV3S9DS|4|I bought this as a gift for a friend who is an avid reader, loves &#34;Watership Down&#34;, and works in wildlife rehab. She loves it (although it seems the &#34;women's-cut&#34; sizes run a tad small.
B00JN7JOW6|5|Love this skirt. received many compliments and the material is very nice. I would suggest washing by hand as the dye bleeds out.
B00K1YAPDC|5|LOVE THIS SHIRT! SUPER SOFT FITS GREAT!!
B000JC0YJQ|5|Great product with good fit, pockets for ID, keys, Kleenex. The shorts launder well, & are a good buy for the price. The only caveat? If you're exercising/walking the dog, the fabric may snag, so keep the dog's paws off!
B008HACOKY|5|My 6 year old (super tall) rocked these pants all day on the ski slopes. Best part, these pants, and another jacket we bought, can extend/expand another 2 inches. Great pants. We got what we paid for with Columbia gear.
B00YS7CQZ8|5|Love it!
B00FWR50ME|4|Could have got a bit larger in size.  Fits ok.  Ordered a 5x to fit my 58&#34; waist.  A bit tight.
B006MJL6ZG|5|I have not bought one yet (I'm about to) and I found that the sizing guide on their website [...] (Or google \\"undercover mama size\\" if Amazon removes my link.)<br />It is more specific AND different than what is shown here. They recommend one size smaller than normal shirt size.
B00561VI4A|5|I get compliments every time I wear these shorts. They're so cute! They're also very, very comfortable. I've paired them with a plain white tank; a nice, teal, chiffon ruffle-neck top; an olive green t shirt and jean jacket...the list goes on. Stylish, summery, super cute. One note: they're really short so you've got to be comfortable wearing short shorts and flaunting your legs!
B00E5TFG6U|5|Fits great
B00BQ6LPJ2|3|The bottoms were perfect .. I just wish the top had more hold but overall I love it
B00NL74EAG|5|This scarf is simply beautiful ! It is just as pictured only prettier. It came packaged with great care. The scarf was even packaged in its own package and they even used common sents and leave the tag separate from the scarf, (perfect) so I don't have to cut it off and risk damaging the scarf! It is also a very nice size, could be worn as a wrap/shall.Ext. The colors are even richer in person and also of a very good quality!<br />I would recommend and buy from this seller again 😁
B00PKNYOA4|3|This coat is not too heavy.  If one is looking for something heavier, this coat is lighter weight.  It has to be dry cleaned as well.
B00CLI6RFG|4|Nice on first wearing.  Good quality.
B00C77YHTO|5|This is the best hat I've ever owned. I've had this for 3 years now and it still has held it's shape and is very versatile. You see a lot of &#34;packable&#34; hats but this one I have taken to the beach, pool, gotten it wet, packed  in suitcases ( with surrounding clothes for support) and it still looks great! The key is the fabric and the woven looking synthetic  material that does not crease like traditional woven material. And this price for an Eric Javits is VERY good. I still receive compliments after 3 years of wear.  Mrs. Salinger
B00L42I7Z8|4|I ordered a medium, it was snug but still fit, however if i order this again im getting a large
B0042U14RC|4|This is a basic costume wand. You are getting what you pay for, but it is a fine accessory for any Halloween or dress-up fairy princess.
B00HR0N7Z6|5|Nice jacket
B00EEGSBD4|5|So much better than standard goofy looking board shorts
B00OKD01KM|5|I love this companies items for kids. There prices are generally reasonable for the quality of their clothing. This coat is perfect for the winter. It is very stylish and it looks good on my son. The coat fits as expected so he will be in this coat all winter. I would recommend this coat and company to any parent.
B00FDLXMLU|5|My granddaughter will be 8 next month. These Jammie's fit her great now, plus she does still have a litTle growing room. And she loves to wear then!!!!
B00FRGLV5U|3|I bought this case because we were going on a trip, and I wanted to take underwater pictures. when I first water tested it, it worked just fine. Then when I did it again, I noticed my camera was foggy! Water had leaked through the seal!! Because of that my speaker doesn't work anymore! besides it leaking, every person I talked to said they couldn't hear me, so I was practically yelling, and they still couldn't hear me. Other than it leaks, and no one can hear you, its ok if you want it just for shock proof.
B001B3W81O|5|I purchased these jeans in licorice and denali, size 12.  They fit true to size and have about a 32\\" inseam after washing.  They have an attractive fit to my figure and unique detailing that I like.  The back pocket flaps seem to lay nicely which was a concern of mine.  I like the straight leg, not too wide, not too tight.  At under $14, I could hardly go wrong.
B00OUTTVL6|5|Granddaughter loved it and it was cool during an unusually hot summer.
B0017HWUSK|5|Tilley does give a lifetime guarantee. I gave as a gift but I have one like it and unless one has put it on their head one can not truly be appreciative of the fit,  It is worth the price. I would have liked it to stay with brim rolled up but couldn't get it to stay up.. It travels well. I still give it 5 stars still with brim down.
B00NCUDUFC|3|I loved the corset because it fit perfect with my costume. However, I ordered a large (I am a medium) and while it seemed to fit, the ribs in the front are annoying as hell to get the hooks on. I thought I could just easily remove them, but the hooks are actually attached to the rib. Also, as others have mentioned, the pins that the hooks go onto are not deep at all so when you finally manage to get each one hooked after an hour, they come undone.
B00CPQMRMQ|5|Would have bought something like this at the mall for at least $20, nice quality for the price! Arms are a little tight but I have tiny arms so its not too bad.
B000LQF6HK|5|At Rex Kwan Do, we use the buddy system. No more flying solo. You need somebody watching your back at all times. Second off, you're gonna learn to discipline your image. You think I got where I am today because I dressed like Peter Pan over here?    Take a look at what I'm wearing, people. You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? Forget about it. Last off, my students will learn about self respect. You think anybody thinks I'm a failure because I go home to Starla at night? Forget about it!
B00D8V9YQY|5|Fiance loves it.  I got this to match my ivory colored suit for my wedding.  Matched perfectly, and relatively well made.
B00PLP8PEM|5|This jumpsuit is as beautiful as it looks!
B00JIUEI2E|5|My grandson loves these Pj's.  He's a fan of batman, so the design is perfect for him.  They are very soft and will be nice and comfortable for him.  Perfect when the warm weather is here.
B00UCHRMT8|5|I loved it! It is comfortable to wear . I'm a mom of 3 had a hard time finding swimming suits but this for me is right. I will buy again ....thanks! Hope the sizing won't change.
B00HJMQDKI|5|This is my go-to bra for the summer. I wear it with my racer-back tees and dressses. So comfortable I don't feel the need to remove it when I get home. Sometimes I even sleep in it....it's THAT comfortable! I has more support than the original Ahh bra by Rhonda Shear...a pleasant surprise.
B00AMTRTOO|5|I am working at a construction site which is really windy and dusty. I have had difficulties before in similar kind of weather but after I wore this it has been a life saver for sure!!
B00BUCSQK8|5|Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she LOVED it. Good quality material, picture looks good.
B00C1YIJME|5|Being muscular, it fits me as expected!!
B008O55AJ4|1|I sent this to my sister for her birthday and it was misprinted and too small; company never notified me of her dissatisfaction and it was quite a while before I found out that her gift was returned. Quite disappointing because shirts looked great online and I had planned  to order more as gifts.
B00CKGB91G|4|Great skirt, great price.
B00J3N7KNU|5|Love it!
B004CO0SKM|5|They are comfortable and fit well.
B00719ZJ5O|3|I bought these thinking they would be good for running shorts. They are way too big for that. I just use them for basketball now.
B00GC547YC|5|I work in a retail setting and am required to have black or khaki slacks as part of my uniform.  I tend to have trouble finding pants that fit me, but these were a godsend.  The waistband can be rolled up or down (I'm pretty short, so I keep it rolled down so it doesn't go halfway to my chest) and is elastic inside a soft, stretchy band of fabric.  There are strings that can be tied for an adjustable fit, but if you roll the waistband down you can tuck the strings inside and no one will notice.  The black ones look like normal pants with a cargo pocket on the side (the pocket doesn't stick out so it's not obvious unless you stuff things inside it- which I do).<br /><br />One note- if you're required to wear a belt, this particular style is not a good option, as there are no belt-loops.
B00FMO4MKS|5|Fit perfect love it
B00D7UX1YM|4|Very nice wallet, but sort of large.
B00HYU0PKO|5|I bought this for a gift. I liked it. The material looks good.
B00LITTZPI|5|I was expecting a cheap, fabric feel, but this wallet really feels nice. Very well put together. I really love Senketsu, too, so it's nice to show off to my friends.
B007QHTTY8|5|SUPER CUTE!!!  This dress is adorable!  My little girl loves it.
B004WPHMJQ|5|I was really shocked that this costume was exactly as pictured. So many times Ive ordered costumes and they looked nothing like they were pictured to. The costume fits very good and is great quality.
B00D4KHB3C|5|It's really pretty and well made. When I bought it it was only around $20 so the price was great! My 3 year old daughter loves it and it fits her perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a black leotard that wants something other than just plain black.
B00939U0P4|4|They look great but the material is thinner then a lot of my other dress socks/novelty socks.  Hopefully they still last.
B0058YQUCU|5|Nice fit, durable material.
B008EYH3X6|5|Nice sweater. Got 3rd place
B00PQFGS4Q|4|Siza was a tab bigger than expected.
B00LWAWSL6|2|The bag was a perfect size and it was water resistant.  The overall quality seemed quite good but the zipper on inner mesh pocket under the cover broke almost immediately.  The part of the zipper you pull kept right on going.  Too bad because otherwise the bag would have gotten a 5.
B00U6JTKUG|5|Love the shirt.  It's super soft. Made in the USA to boot!
B00H7H066W|5|Beautiful quality. Comfortable and the perfect length.
B0054HENRA|5|The hat fit my husband well and seems to well constructed.  It is not as warm as some of the wool styles though.
B00CMDLY8K|4|Wonderful Tie!!!!
B00I3H08RM|5|company is amazing.  great service and shirt is excellent quality and true color to the picture provided.
B002DM817W|5|heard alot of good things about this costume its as good as everyone says or better. and so cute on must have or n e time of year
B004M6UDF0|5|I really like this little bill fold - it serves my purpose perfectly.  The clip is strong and although the pockets are tight, I use those for seldom used but needed items.  There is a slot behind the money clip great for the oft used debit card.  Also my proof of insurance card fits in with drivers license.  Can't go wrong for price.
B00EICBXA2|5|i love this outfit and so does my son. its mickey that i love and think is great for kids but the picture is sophisticated enough to not be babyish.
B00PXY9BZS|5|Cute outfit love it.
B00WIS6CI6|5|Pants are comfortable and look good on.
B00KNQCE0A|4|I am 5'8, 117lbs. Very slim, C cup, barely there booty and a looooooong torso. It took some adjusting but I got the Medium to fit just fine. Stitching looks fine, material is right and so is the padding. Could fit a little better but it will work.
B00I1AH6GC|4|Good solid pants.
B00APEF0ZG|5|This is a excellent top. It is outstanding for its versatility as you can use on its own or combine it  with another style. Whichever you choose, you will be impressed with the results.  I love the Crossover look of these tops!
B00TF7FIMO|5|People go on and on about silk but it’s much more than just hype.  Nothing natural or synthetic is as silky and at the same time as strong as silk, while still fine and delicate.  I'm a woman who well knows what babies some guys are about fabrics that don't feel quite right to them - microfiber, just as one alternative, is super soft, but also inclined to catch on any little rough spot on the skin, which this robe does *not*. It breathes and is cool to the touch, but can also be worn well into cooler weather as silk is also a tremendous insulator. (For me, the bottom line is nothing better than silk has ever been invented, which is why a slightly &#34;holey&#34; favorite pair of long silk underwear is still in my winter rotation.)<br /><br />My sample is well sewn, with double rows of stitching where it counts like at the top of the pockets, seams that are folded over to expose no material at the collar and down the side fronts, and meticulously serged at side, armhole and shoulder seams. You'd think this kind of thing would go without saying for a garment at this price, but trust me, I've seen all kinds of sloppy.<br /><br />If you’re a woman who’s appropriated this menswear item for its comfort and its classic styling, here’s the skinny:  Before alterations, my fingers barely poked out of the sleeves, and this was actually a surprise as I've borrowed a lot of my spouse's robes over the years.  I can tell you that many manufacturers skimp on sleeve length.  The waist measurement for my “large” was kind of ridiculously ample (will accommodate the most pot-bellied size guy who’s still a “L” in the chest) -- but it ties up neatly/flat and it’s nice to be able to cinch a robe and know it won’t gradually slide open and gape, even without the inner tie that is common with womens’ often skimpy loungewear.<br /><br />Amazon is full of &#34;sexy&#34; apparel for guys and gals, just like the rest of retailing, but if you want to get him something truly special and sensual -- that he could even answer the door wearing! - and that will get a lot of use, this is it.y special and sensual -- that he could even answer the door wearing! - and that will get a lot of use, this is it.
B0009U6A6E|5|As expected.
B004W8PZJW|5|Fast on time delivery great product
B004KI108O|3|The belt is not what I was expecting ,is very hard plastic and smell weird.<br />I wore with my jeans and I didn't notice any difference ...my pants(waits ) still big
B005H3BBVW|4|There cute BUT the picture online makes them look tourquoise but they are actually royal blue. It's ok but a bit misleading. There tight on my calves. I have a athletic build. Over all there cute socks. I have no major gripes.
B00064S052|1|I bought this hat based on the picture shown on the web page - what I did not know is that they have sown in a label with the Volkl web address accross the yellow band at the edge of the brim - the label is white text on a black background, and it looks terrible - your eye is immediately drawn to it, as it stands out against the yellow piping (which is what they intended) - you cannot remove it withour really messing the hat up, so you are stuck with it - what a waste of money!
B00JWM7MP8|5|Awesome!
B007R72A7A|5|Good
B00GL2UYRK|2|I ordered these trying to find a cheaper alternative to mack weldon's, well, they are cheaper (quality and price) and not an alternative. Seems like they are good for being disposable. Giving them to thrift shop unworn, will not re-order. Shipping took a long time as they took almost 2 weeks before they even entered the US from China.
B0037Z7BIE|5|My wife ordered this for me, to replace my previous 10-yr-old wallet.  The configuration is just what I wanted, and the leather and stitching are top notch.
B00GCEMXXU|1|This green is NOT the color received. Instead a very drab ugly brownish black Olive, not the green Olive depicted here. Disappointed!
B0026P4666|2|Not the comfortable bra I was hoping for. Have only worn it once, regret the purchase.
B0064J5KGU|5|This dress was great I loved it and the way it feel's it is just great in every way<br />i'm pretty pickey person and I loved this dress you should try it!!!!
B006Z8G0H8|3|sleeves a little long...
B002SW3EUG|5|These are great. They fit my baby perfect and he no longer has to squint his eyes when the sun is out! Love them! Only wish this size had a greater selection of colors...
B003WXH0MI|1|Don't buy it trust me! This is the worst material used for T-shirt. Fitting is garbage, don't listen to anyone!!!!
B005W0LV7Y|1|This bra and it's tags did not say Bali anywhere. It looks similar to other Bali bras that I own, but feels alittle cheaper. My other bras say Bali right next to the product number, but this one just has a number, slightly different from the Balu bra number I ordered.
B00198JSQO|5|WANT TO ORDER MOR OF THE SAME, HOWEVER, I WAS INFORMED NO LONGER ON THE MARKET!  SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I AM IN, FINALLY FIND SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE AND IT GOES AWAY.
B00LX0I97M|5|perfect fit and good quality
B00B6EEKVO|5|got what I ordered plus three mediums that I didn't order (was not charged for the mediums?
B00EFGOEPW|5|MADD cool shirt!! Good quality material. Now that's up!!! 2 pac lives in my heart, mind and now shirts ;) ha
B00LPBRKBA|4|Thanks
B002J8RRWK|5|Apparently she loved it!  I haven't seen it, but it seems quite nice.  My daughter said that her friend really liked it.
B00J5ZHMQ6|5|Love this product . Such a simple idea that works perfectly to control wayward collars.
B00B76Y8HC|5|Very nice, Still runs small. I usually wear a small of a medium. I bought a large and it's still a bit too small for what I need.
B00CHI8960|3|Drying this completely changed the fit.
B00LO56XOW|5|Just as described and fits well.
B00EFVNA9S|4|He really loved it. I would definitely purchase more as the price was good for quality.
B00UUI9HAG|1|Says it has spandex, but it is all cotton and will shrink, sorry I purchased this, but won't send it back because of having to pay the shipping charges, will give it away to a friend, someone smaller than me because it was way too small.  Nothing was right with it and the ad is a lie.
B003VWFWLQ|2|Purchased this because my old wallet tore at the seams. I wait tables and constantly have a large number of small bills. Since there are usually so many, my wallet couldn't hold a large amount and eventually tore. I replaced it with this one and expect it would tear, but I am let down by this replacement. The brackets on the corners won't stay on. Two of them fell off the first day. Beneath the brackets lie sharp weaves which have already cut through 5 pants pockets. Aside from ruining both pockets on my work uniform khakis, this thing tore apart my debit card. If you value things that would go into or come in contact with a wallet, do no buy this one.
B008M10LK8|5|Very nice. I ordered a different one on Amazon, and it looks nothing like the one they pictured. So I ordered this one as a replacement, and am very happy with it! I bought it as a halloween costume, but it is so good I think I'll wear it all the time!
B00DHKRTF4|2|These feel like nice material. Width is good. The length, however, is kind of ridiculous. Sure, I'm only 5'2&#34;, but I could wear these as minidresses. They will be pj shirts, sadly.
B001G4VJU4|5|I love this socks, I take pictures at MTB races and always wear something fancy about bicycles!
B00AG3YTTE|5|Glad to have made this purchase I been wanting it for a while the reviews really helped me with my decision. I love this jacket it's my grab and go without all the weight of a big jacket
B00FL7JNSW|5|Had a pair of 33 x 34 Kings I purchased from a store that fit well.<br />So I purchased two pair through Amazon that fit almost identically.<br />Consistent fit and quality in both pairs.<br />Nice job Buffalo.
B004W19OQO|5|Have the regular Stormy Kromer but the extra protection from the Rancher is outstanding on windy days at low temperatures.
B00C1ENUUA|2|I ordered a medium but for some reason this item was like a kids size. I had to return the item
B002VWK6O0|5|Simple nice hoodie! Great quality!
B00EFAGNRU|5|exellent
B00IUOU3NC|3|I was disappointed at the thin fabric.Probably good for a hot day,but it's fairly sheer. Color is accurate.
B006ZOVPYA|2|Image shows a snapped pocket access but it does not exist on the pants received. Fabric looks like thin canvas, I was expecting more of a running pant look. Very ugly and itchy... They also did not come with zippers like some reviewers mentioned. I was able to put them on without taking my hiking boots off but seem near impossible with my winter hiking boots.  IDK you get what you pay for...
B000PQFSCY|5|This hat works well to keep the sun off my head and is light weight for use in the hot weather.
B00K5AFQ22|5|Favorite wallet ever. Wish there was a more obvious difference between the two sides so I didn't have to search for things.<br /><br />Disadvantage of this is that when you need anything out of this wallet, you have to expose everything!
B008BF5ECK|5|I purchased these gloves in an XL as an upgrade from my plain fleece gloves used for driving. This gloves are exceptionally warmer and more comfortable. The smartouch fingers work great on my smart phone. I would definitely recommend these to others!
B003LMHHIW|1|way too small, and I bought 3 sizes bigger!  It looked like a child&#34;s size.  I want to return it please send me a return label
B00U0XC8P2|5|I really love this shirt. It fits well and the material is super nice and feels nice. It flatters my (larger) figure and goes great with black leggings.
B00KBZRWSC|4|Smaller neck, than I expected, but great preshrunk fit over all.
B001304I22|5|Recently did a short film with an US Army element in it. On our shoestring budget, we needed to purchase props and uniforms that lent legitimacy to the project's storyline. This patch went a long way in achieving that, very happy with the quality.
B00CAA0J18|4|I goint to gave four stars because the color is more like gold more than green and the mask is uncomfortable. But fit me as i expected.
B00J215UF8|4|Not the best deals but I like the shape of those and the feeling.<br /><br />I agree that the color doesn't really match with the pictures (some colors like gray are actually a mix of dark gray and white fibers). But I am not that picky so.
B00CBAOKVC|5|Forget Under Armour. You want a warm base layer? Buy this.  You can get the tops and bottoms for the price of one piece from the more popular brands. I wore it for a week straight while elk hunting in Montana and it never let me down. Better than any other base layer I've owned.
B008I6V4IA|5|I transported these wings to Montreal and back, I even wove LED lights in between the feathers.  To cover the straps I made a white fur mantle to wear over my shoulders.  These are AWESOME.  I wore them over 6 hours one night and can't wait for the chance to wear them again.
B008MA1VWQ|4|I bought these socks for my elderly mother for summer use because they are thinner material and will be cooler for her than the other thick and fuzzy non skid socks she has been using during the winter.  They are one size fits all. She usually wears a 61/2-7 shoe, and these socks are a bit large. There is also quite a large seam across the toe, but since they fit big on her feet, she says it doesn't bother her. If someone with a larger foot were to wear these, it may be a problem for them. Also they seem to be quite snug at the ankle, but not too tight for her. Again, someone with a larger foot may have a tightness problem in this area too.  All in all for her, they seem to work, and she says she likes them. She especially likes that they are cooler for summer.
B00186ZKVO|5|fit perfectly
B00MGHCXYQ|4|Fits well love the graphic. Can't wait to wear it.
B00G9HN3W0|5|👍👍👍👍👍
B006NZPZ8I|4|On time, good product and well organized.  They make a difference in how my collars look and the are worth the price.
B00C3XMHNA|5|My grandson loves these shorts! We got him 2 pair, different colors & the first pair arrived a month before the 2nd pair so he had a chance to really see if he liked them. They are a great mid weight shorts that won't fall apart when washed. The weight is important when it gets into the upper 90's. Any heavier and it would be uncomfortable to wear them. They are cool & easy care.
B0094GB8Q6|5|I love this blouse, in fact I have it on right now....all of my friends like it and want one.
B00EM4TGNC|4|Really nice soft hoodie.  The one thing I hate is that the brand logo is un-removable -- HATE being a walking ad.  I have to wear this with a big scarf to cover up hte label.  Apart from that it's good.
B001618J7I|5|Its wonderful that someone out there still makes REAL denim jeans.  I hate that stretch crap they make these days that they are trying to pass off as denim.  I want REAL denim jeans that do not stretch.  Every other manufacturer out there has decided that ALL women need stretch jeans and that seems to be all they make for women these days.  I HATE STRETCH JEANS BUT I LOVE MY WRANGLERS!
B000QIUQPA|5|Worth the money.  Expected to last.  Quality material and construction.
B00655JF2S|4|it is very useful, just a little expensive in my opinion..
B00S2GFUS6|5|Prompt delivery. Great style.
B00IN8TV7Y|1|Medium, my foot. It's a small slim. Don't buy this one.
B00H2HC9J4|5|Love it
B002BM5ZS2|3|little hard to adjust on the side, but it works ok, thanks!!!
B00EJ0QHU4|1|Fell apart after the first wash.
B008DZU8LK|4|Upon opening the package and looking at the piece, I didn't think I would be able to get it on because of how tiny it is. After reading some other reviews, though, I knew this was expected so I tried it on anyway. While I got it on, it does not &#34;fit&#34;. Let me explain: I am size 16, 255lbs (I ordered a 2XL). I have a small waist and large hips/thighs with a booty. This piece looked great around my waist/stomach. Pinched in my waist even more giving me a good shape, and smoothed out my belly. The leg area was way too tight on me; I could never wear this with a dress or even pants because it created an obvious line where the piece ends. It has a large opening to use the bathroom, however it's too large and my booty and thighs were squished out of it. Another downside is the back area and the straps, way too loose almost as if the top and back of the piece was a 3XL. Overall, I think it's great for those who have the right body shape. I am not one of those people.
B00ACIGVIK|5|Excellent
B00YUTDP40|4|I love this top! It looks nice and has good material that helps to hide any extra pounds that you might have. However, the back is flush with the bottom of your bra line, so it's almost impossible to wear a bra with it without it showing. Other than that, great top!
B002RHLXKU|5|$5/each & were Perfect! I made truffula trees with them for my kids dr seuss bday and they did the job well. Thanks! Now my daughter added them to her dress up closet.
B00OV7FMEM|4|Love these and the way they fit. No sagging or bunching issues. However after one wear and not washed there is already a run. I will be able to cover. But it upsets me that a pair that fits so well and the quality doesn't stand up .
B004PSQHBY|2|This dress was cute enough to wear but I didn't like the material.  It's stiff and scratchy. I bought for a cruise but left it at home.
B002FKAEYK|3|It seemed to run large. You can't wear it with a backless.  The cups won't sit against your body without straps.
B00M0DHF62|5|I bought this as a gift for my uncle. He is a cardiologist and only wears shirts with pockets. It was had to find but it was priceless to see him wearing it on the same day he got. :)
B00K75WR9K|3|Some what large from the arms and the buttons are pretty cheap
B001J4N5HG|5|I bought this T shirt for my Father!! He was surprised at the detail of this shirt and said it brought back memories!! Now all his friends want one!! :-)
B003ZJIUZ0|5|THIS NEW CUT OF JEANS IS WHAT I HAVE LOOKING FOR. SLIGHT STRETCH IN THE WAIST AREA, NARROW LEGS FOR MY COWBOY BOOTS. LENTH IS PERFECT. BOY DO I LOOK GOOD.
B00K0DOHZ6|1|Very pretty, but way smaller than expected. Also has super long arms.
B00W6FTI3W|5|My son is about to turn five, so I got size 4-5 that's what size he is wearing..but these actually a bit too loose on him, but than again my son is kinda skinny...so I would say the sizing is true. The first thing I want to point out is that the stiching is great: there is no string hanging anywhere, the elastich is stiched very nicely, so these are well made for sure. You get 5 different colors: grey, white and red with black detailing, black with red detailing and navy with orange. These are 95% cotton and 5% spandex, the elastic is nice and strechy, so definitely will give room for growing. My son loves these althought these a bit too loose on him as I said, but he still wears these already and says these are comfy. On all of the underwears on the elastic there is a &#34;Happy Boy&#34; singnige all around the waist I thought it was kind of cool, espesially for smaller kids. I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbaised opion.
B001BXY13C|5|I bought this hat for my husband and I added my own twist to it in order to make it more Steampunk for his Halloween costume and he loves it. It fits perfectly and once I was done with it, it looks awesome.
B00I14JTLI|4|very nice quality shirt
B00EKQC0S0|5|Its a bit snug for a large. But i knew of this from the beginning because these things tend to stretch over time. You may want to consider going for a size up if you don't plan on using it regularly. Quicksilver surf shirts are my preferred brand.
B008VWS402|5|Beautiful tights...a bit lighter weight than Danskin so easier to wear in the warmer weather. They are comfortable and have long lasting wear. I dance several times a week and they are perfect. I love them!
B005OFLSR0|5|Excellent Product!
B00EV2LXIG|4|Thin material that clings to every surface. Sizes are accurate.  Great summer dress or layer w/thermal layer. Must have a slip under.
B00K1BFNDM|5|I Absolutely LOVE this Awesome tank top! It fits great, looks beautiful, carries a profound message, and I highly recommend it! My new tank top is a beautiful addition to my summer wear...a MUST Buy!!
B007MYBXNU|4|the xx small size fits my daughter  and inexpensive. quality is not as good as greys anatomy but good enough again to be worn by my daughter
B00E2Q5W9M|1|To start off, this looks exactly like its pictured. The material is good. The stitch work is horrible. All I did was take it out of the bag and the four buttons fell off. I'm going to have to sew it on later.<br />As for the size. I emailed the seller prior to purchase and asked them about how it runs. I was told the sizes are accurate. Given that, I decided to take into account all the reviews and I brought mines two sizes big, figuring I could give it to a relative if too big. I'm so glad I did! It barely fit, I should have gotten the 3X instead. It fits tightly and barely covers my breasts. One skip and ill be flying out!<br /><br />again I emailed the seller asking about the refund/exchange policy and was told that the sizes are accurate. Obviously not. Long story short NO REFUND/EXCHANGE. While ill keep this one, maybe pass it along, I most definitely will not he purchasing from this seller again.
B0083QLQG0|3|These do exactly what they are supposed to do, hold your bra straps in place.<br /><br />They are a little &#34;flimsy&#34;, and I have a wide back, I'm scared they will break sometimes. They haven't yet. They can also be a bit hard to put on by yourself too. I've managed a few times on my own, but having help is always good.<br /><br />I could live without these, but I'll use them until I find something a little more sturdy. If your bra straps are &#34;thicker&#34;...be prepared for it to not hold.
B00JF9XCLG|4|I thought this worked great. I wore it under my helmet on our Razor ride. It covers most of my ears, which I wanted. I do have a size small head. I liked the terry cloth band on it, that seems to hold it in place. I wish the fabric had a more stretch to it, but was very happy with it. I haven't washed it yet though.
B006ZOL2M0|4|The costume vest was a hit at the Mardi Gras party that we attended.  We added some great colored beads and it was perfect.
B00ACIGM9S|5|I decided to try these instead of the J.C. Penney briefs I had been wearing.  Found them much better cut and more comfortable.
B0039ZLJ7G|5|I got this for one of my daughter's little friends for her 2 year old birthday.  She loves Elmo and was thrilled with the shirt.  I haven't seen it on her, but I held it up, and it looks like it would fit nicely.  Good quality.  Very cute design.
B00B7O8A5A|5|Really pretty color and flattering but yes you have to be petite but in that case no worries! I love them!!
B00BN4MXCA|5|This underwear fits great and looks great. My only complaint is that the thighs are a bit tight on me (I have rather thick legs) causing them to ride up occasionally.
B002BZYWQU|5|I really loved these cushions- after having my daughter (I was already a &#34;big girl&#34; on top before I got pregnant!), every bra I had, even the well-fitting ones, dug into my shoulders, leaving ugly red lines. These are totally saving my shoulders. They do leave a little red mark, but it's not a painful one and it's probably more from heat being trapped under them than an injury or rubbing. I have no idea how they manage to come off (according to some other reviewers)- they stay firmly put for me!
B008VKDY3Q|5|We only used these for a weekend trip, but they worked well.  They fit my size 8 five year old perfectly, would definitely recommend.  They were wet after playing in the snow, but my daughter didn't complain about cold hands.
B00JMXV7HQ|4|I got this during Amazon's Prime Day. Just wanted to try this pull up jeans. At first it was difficult to pull it up ---  I may have a slightly bigger bottom. But once I was able to pull it all the way, it fits nicely and comfortably. For me, it sits a little lower than the model, but not super low like my 524s. It is fitted nicely on my thighs, and not too tight on my calves (unlike the skinny's). For reference I ordered a 6, and I'm 138lbs (5'4&#34;). The length is also a little long on me by an inch, but it's fine.
B00A88ZQ2G|3|This arrived and I was so excited because for the price, it was adorable!<br />I tried it on, and it fit perfectly! It even has pockets, which was an unexpected surprise, since I bought it for an upcoming dog show (you need a place to put the treats!). And, the length is perfect. I am 5.4&#34; and it fit right at the knees, exactly where I was hoping.<br /><br />Today I went to hand-wash the sweater, as per the instructions, and noticed a small hole near the tag.  I'm not sure if the tag was supposed to be sewn top and bottom, but there is a hole nonetheless.  It is about the size of a brad-head, so barely noticeable. And, I need it ASAP (hence ordering it last week, and will be leaving in a few days with it), and do not have time to send back/re-order.<br />Like I said, it is barely noticeable, but that is disappointing.
B00NL16P1S|3|Nice jacket. Thought it would be longer. But it suits my purpose.
B00BN102YE|5|Love them! And they came a day early 😃
B0029IQIRU|4|it was shipped promptly and arraved quickly.  I saw the hat briefly when I visited my granddaughter this weekend.  It looked nice, I liked the look.  It felt pretty flimsy and not sure how long it will laslt but likely as long as she will be itnerested in wearing it. I did not pay a lot for it so did not expect a lot from it.  I certainly woiuld not have paid the so called orig. price but the hat is fine for what I did pay.
B00F59HL9E|4|I ordered this for my almost six year old.  She wears a 6X, but based on the reviews I read that this runs small, I got her an 8-10 and it fits beautifully.  It appears to be well made, except that the zipper separates at the bottom and starts unzipping upward when it's zipped (there is probably a word for this),  It did not shrink when I washed it; nor did the colors run.<br />She loves, loves, loves it.  Her only complaint is that the wings make sitting in her high-back booster uncomfortable.  It's a little spendy, but the look on her face when she saw it was worth it.
B0059DWLNW|5|got this for my husband and he loved it.  keeps him warm and dry.  fits great, and looks good in almost any situation.
B00E6OXBKW|3|they keep my hands slightly warm (my hands just are always cold). Only 3 star because the touch screen fabric does not work very well and the fabric is fraying on both places in the thumb and pointer finger.
B003F1RW0W|1|My granddaughter is very petite and normally wears slims and petite sizes. Thought this would fit perfect but was definitely wrong.  She won't wear it because it is too small.
B008H4D7CE|4|My son loves this coat. It is a bit large around & I wish the arms & length were longer. He's 6'8&#34; broad and long but thinner built. We got larger so on purpose because of shrinkage in Carhartts. It has a drawstring that it a little difficult to use - stiff &hard to pull it to stop the wind from blowing up the jacket. With enough layers up drafts aren't a problem. We are still very happy with it.
B00GBT8QM8|3|Doesn't look or fit nearly as well as it does in the photo. It is definitely good quality and will keep you warm, but it fits rather funny and the ears are much larger than shown in the picture.
B003A8DE84|1|again, what i got does not look like this so don't buy if thats what you expect.  the intent to mislead must be rampant here as several items I bought look nothing like the picture. so what gives? Do they find an actual item - take a picture, and then try to copy it?  If so, they do a crap job.
B00VQTQ3MI|5|I love this sweater. I got a medium, which fits great over &#34;the girls&#34;. I think I'll have it dry cleaned, since the material doesn't seem like it would hold up super well to washing and I abhor hand washing things. The only thing I would change is that it has 3/4 sleeves and I always prefer full length because I'm constantly freezing.
B0019SBME0|4|This was a good fit (I ordered my usual size).  It has no lining, so it remains flexible enough to fold down when nursing or pumping.  Yes, the straps will probably slip off when the flap is down, but that's because when it's down, there's no weight in the cup to hold the strap in place.  When hooked, I never had a problem w/ the straps falling.  I did feel like it was a little pricey but it did the job I needed it to do and lasted the entire time I was nursing.  I even threw it in the dryer instead of line drying it like all my other bras.
B006CQTY80|2|The worst thing about it is the door and the zipper.  I liked the size and shape but a tent is no good when the zipper won't work on the door.  It is also a pain to get out of.  The door is up a little high and I tripped getting out several times which resulted in a tear in the screen's seam.  We used it 4 times and threw it away because the zipper kept getting stuck and gaping in the center.  Such a pain!
B00HWF7ZEU|5|I've always loved Champion and this one is no exception. Very comfortable, no &#34;getting used to&#34; period. Although it says high support, it is almost a max support. I wear a 36 band but like to be able to adjust the band as needed so I ordered a 38. The 38&#34; fit like it was a 36. Be wary that the band runs a bit small but the cup size is spot on. It is a quick dry so you can work out on the heavy side and not worry about discomfort. The piping on the outer cups accentuates the breast giving it a larger look for those who like to work out sans teeshirt :)
B00I4ZWIK8|2|Runs big
B00I9A3V72|1|Too thin of material and too small.  It would fit a small child as a large, but it may as well be a hoodie shirt.  If that is what your looking for then this is the product for you.  Unfortunately it was not what we were expecting at all.
B00C20EGTW|4|This was a good buy
B004Q3QDOO|3|Nice jacket.  Reversable (doubles the number of pockets), warm and great fit.  However the zip is a bit flakey.  If you do not slot it correctly, the zipper does not run properly - very frustrating.  Would like to see a more robust zip for next model.
B00JLDV8YY|5|Great costume
B000PVR58E|5|Delivery was prompt and the hat was as described and fit well
B00428N9R2|5|I have tried so many brands and so many shapers and unfortunately was always very unhappy with them.  I finally found one that I LOVE!  These are so comfortable, slim and smooth, and best of all don't cut off my circulation around my thighs and don't roll up!  Definitely stocking up on these!!
B00B6E9VVS|1|I own a pair of these already so I knew they would fit correctly.  However the watch pocket was only half sewn on and I didn't notice until I was already at work and they were dirty so I  didn't return them.  I spent a half hour sewing it up by hand.  Not very happy.
B00NOMTKW0|5|I am a Red Hatter and I have a big head and thick hair so hats are hard to find.  This fascinators is perfect and stylish for my winter outings.
B00UJO5R32|4|Very comfortable ... like them a lot
B00FQQ2HWW|4|tried it on. fits nicely
B00CKGBD8A|5|so comfortable!
B00XL3S2WG|5|nice clean belt
B00NSK60OY|5|This has been my absolutely favorite sweater all season long. I love it to death and expect to wear it for a long long time. Fantastic quality. Fantastic fit. Incredibly comfortable.
B0085N4Y9C|5|I received the skirt today and was a little sad that it is actually more brown than the picture suggests. However, it fits great.<br />I am 5'6&#34;, 125lbs (not very curvy) and I ordered a medium. It fits exactly the way the picture shows and I love that it came with a big belt.
B00J9UGSE4|5|I love the length, which keeps my belly covered during workouts.Very comfortable. Not clingy. Easy care and looks good. Like it so much, I bought another in silver. I throw it in the wash after workout every day and looks like new after 20+ washings.
B00369D0ZE|5|I have tried many nursing bras over my 8ish years of nursing and think Bravado has got it figured out. I really like all their bras. However, as I am pregnant now I found my dearly beloved Bravado tanks to not be supportive enough. I went back to the body silk one I had and it was a bit small and not as supportive as I needed. I found this new model and got excited about the prospect of being more shapely. I wasn't disappointed! Not only is it much more supportive than the body silk and the tanks, it is prettier and shapes better without showing nipples! That alone is worth the extra cost. And Bravado just washes better and lasts longer than other brands. You get what you pay for! Love it.
B0018OMPM8|3|For some reason these Levi's shrink to fit  pants fit to tght compared to the exact pants size I tried on in the store at a more money. Thanks to Amazons excellent customer service policy Ii return them for a larger size without any hassle .
B00IX138CK|4|The colors are gorgeous and fits perfect....well worth the price and fits great!
B00EVMQXNQ|3|Definitely, not what I expected. It has too much going on; a collar, a hood, suspender straps etc. The only way i can wear this, is as a costume. No wonder shipping is free. It definitely runs small.
B00M54YXR0|5|At first I ordered up one size. it was just to big on me.  So I sent it back and quickly got the smaller size. The pkg. was received so quickly I was shocked.Tthe reason I reordered again was the quality of the dress. It is very nice fabric and it is totally lined.  Amazing to find such a quality dress for such a good price.  It is definately a very conservative style, which is what I was looking for.  I felt like I could take the dress and not wear the jacket and replace it with a shrug sweater and make a whole new look. The dress is sleeveless and has a band at the waist. It looks great with the jacket or the sweater. You cannot go wrong.
B00H4WB9BG|4|ok
B007R1OLUK|4|I bought this for my son's birthday.  He loves it and wears it often.  Nice fabric and it washes and dries well.
B003C1QRFQ|5|Good buy. My toddler loves it. I have her wear it with dresses winter and early spring...Friends keeps asking where I got them from becos you can't find at any local store
B004W4TEP2|1|These looked cheap and were too large for my face. I would not recommend. Returned these the same day. Do not buy
B00MEZBZUS|5|love them! and the colors
B000WO0CO8|1|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my mom, but it's so tacky looking that I'm too embarrassed to give it to her.  I thought the silver on black velvet would have an elegant look appropriate for my 70+ year old mom, but she's a classy woman, and this purse hanger is really cheap looking.  Not only that, but I just received this in the mail yesterday, and when I opened the package, the hinge connecting the swivel arm to the silver on black velvet part is already tarnished!  Waster of money, there's got to be a better looking one.  I know I didn't spend a fortune on this purse hanger, but this was a complete waste of money.
B00J8B5RQY|5|Nice and cool.
B004T9XFAU|5|IM HAPPY
B0075D0X6Q|5|Spent a long time searching for something small like this so my husband could keep his ID and cards in.  Works perfect, just the right size!!
B009SDBMOI|5|Red logo more suttle which was great for me I was hoping it wasn't as  brilliant a red as shown. Pleased with quality and overall appearance , great buy.&#34;.real good looking tee.&#34;
B00P8D5H0W|5|OK, I've worn Genie bras for the past year and I can honestly say these bras are softer and more comfortable than Genie bras. The straps were a little loose at first but after the first wash they tightened up well enough to where they don't slip anymore. But I'm a 36A and I think the straps were designed to stretch a little for larger busted women. I LOVE these bras and highly recommend them!
B005NRPI7U|5|I bought several of these shirts for my son who is very tall. Store bought shirts are rarely long enough after the first wash. These shirts have quite a bit of length and after more than a half dozen washes they have not shrunk or lost their color. They are perfect t-shirt weight, not cheap see through material. A fantastic bargain for the price.
B002JC9SP0|5|Totally bad fit
B002NVA3YM|3|You know, cause every TV reporter has to have a leather vest.  I've never seen a TV reporter not have one.
B00064KB3Q|4|nicer and larger than i expected
B00LIB1JC8|4|I am typically a Size 8 (5'5&#34; and 123 lbs) and I ordered the size Large in 5 different colors and they were TOO SMALL!!! Way too tight. So now I have to return ALL of them and repurchase them in Extra Large! Sheesh, I never thought of myself as Extra Large. I think the chart is way off. If it weren't for the sizing mishap, I would give these 5 stars. I love the fact that they are all cotton. The material feels nice. They could be a tad shorter in the leg though, but they still look good, despite being too tight.
B00OV0UM7Q|4|item as described, nice soft fabric
B00I0DG490|5|Very comfy and flattering. Good length on torso and fit just as expected. Color wasn't easy to see on screen, but actually is a very nice dark teal. Well worth the price.
B00JQ197C6|5|came early, is very pretty, it is a bit long on me  but im only 5'2 would buy again though
B00BPLRU2O|3|It's ok.  I knew that I wasn't buying Ralph Lauren Polo clothing, but one person who I'd urged to buy the shirt was disappointed it was a knockoff.  It was just for a fun team thing so I didn't care, but don't expect RL quality for this price!
B00EVOGMYE|4|I gifted these to my fiance and he loves it...
B00K0PN1MO|4|Nice good looking shirt
B00CJYJHC2|4|excelent
B004ZZQU3C|5|This product is great and helps make my wedding dress look fabulous. This is a product that is great for its great price
B00LUG97BQ|3|Cute but the material is a little scratchy for my daughters taste so we put a soft shirt underneath.
B00KJGOILC|3|This product is good. Holds me in. However, its difficult to wear with jeans due to bulkiness around the hips.
B00F4CS5CE|4|I would say it looks more like a marigold color in real life; not too bright of a yellow and not too dull like in the product photo. It looked very nice and the material wasn't too thin. I gave it as a gift and she loved it. The head wrap has a button clasp. There are two buttons for two different sizes.
B00HRGRMS8|4|Fits well. Will give it a try on vacation this year.
B00VD2QBOI|5|Love this t-shirt, I get a lot of comments on it.
B004HVRA9C|5|This item not only arrived on the date it was estimated to be shipped by, but it also is very good quality and wound up looking better than i expected it to. i very much recommend buying this item
B00LW89MFS|5|Great item! My son loves it and it will fit next year as I had hoped.
B00840RSGM|5|This sleep and play has good quality fabric and is soft.  This will be a cozy outfit for my baby at Christmas.  :)
B00DY7WFT0|5|perfect for new walkers
B006N1KHDU|2|While customer service was off the charts (thank you again) the coat itself was a disappointment. I ordered a US XL. I'm 6'6'' but pretty skinny and the coat didn't fit my shoulders or back. I could barely move my arms and I had to unbutton/unzip my coat just to be able to move my arms while driving. The coat was long enough, except for the sleeves, but that may be a residual effect of the shoulders not fitting. My usual problem with a US XL is that the coats/shirts are too big, but this time it was way too small.<br /><br />Also I had a button fall off within the first 24 hours.
B00CXAD4X0|5|This is a great dress! Flattering silhouette, and the fabric has a nice weight for cool summer nights. I really love this dress, the pockets are a nice detail and is reasonably price, I only wish they had it in different colors.
B00JH2A70K|1|Was the same label as some I bought from buckle in the same size and style, but these way smaller.  I had to pay to return them and I understand there is a 25% restocking fee from the price I paid, which is is crazy.  I recommend saving your money and going to buckle.
B00KLKA58Q|5|Very nice top...
B00EKNN31G|5|Cute jacket for my daughter! It's lined and keeps her nice and warm. It's made very well and I like that it's black, so it doesn't show dirt and stains as easy.
B003LPPI8K|5|this shirt fits great, well made, not cheap material and great customer service!
B00DGM42NU|5|I LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />size fits as expected.<br />love the color. I bought the garnet color. Yet the color may bleed if you wash it. So beware.<br />Other  than that, i am very satisfied with my purchase - Price is good in comparable to the quality ($50)<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B001O9BEI8|5|Remember when premium underwear like Jockey used to fit, 10+ years ago? These still do. As the years have gone by those few extra pounds caused the waistbands on every brand I've tried to roll over... Hated that! You can count on these fitting like premium underwear used to. Also, the support is excellent.
B0073E589O|3|The belt was too small, so I'm going to have to add fabric too it.<br />Mask doesn't stay of the face very well....So I'll have to play around with that<br />I bought an XSmall, and it seemed somewhat big in the armpit to rib cage area, but its not too bad.<br />but the costume also felt long. I'm 5'4 and the torso area is a bit long. I just wish it was more skin tight.<br />But it isn't see through like other reviews were saying.<br />The gloves have really long fingers...and aren't opera length gloves, so when you put the costume on, your elbows are completely exposed. I ended up having to buy another pair of gloves.<br /> Pretty disappointed with how many things I need to change to make this costume work.<br />the only thing that I absolutely loved about the costume were the cat ears. They are pretty comfortable.
B00E6TZKVK|5|Awesome look
B007V9W81M|4|Super cute shirt!! It is a little on the short side though. Not meant for tall kids. My danighter is average and it fits a tiny bit short. I couldn't imagine if she were a little taller.
B00TRL8BB8|5|so cute, love these shorts!
B00773KZM6|5|Love this shirt and would buy one if it was a blue Great Dane. So please make one with a blue Great Dane because then I would buy several. Thnx
B00H4Y06WM|5|LOVE this backpack. Very sturdy, the color is just what I expected from the picture.
B00B0EA4VA|5|Shemagh exactly as described and shown in pictures. I´ve used it for a few weeks now and it has held up well to the outdoors. Will update in future if it does not. So far it seems to be an excellent deal.
B009X24PW0|5|Shipping was fast and product
B009GGOYVK|4|It's a great headband for those Gaara cosplayers, but the material of the metallic part is more of a bendable aluminum. It not super bendable, but with a enough force, it will. Also a perk of it is that there is this soft thing on the inside of the metallic part so it doesn't hurt your forehead after a prolonged wear.
B00TP5NJOU|4|They fit. Good so far.
B000J3ZM2Y|5|It fit me very well. However, it's very long. I'm 5 inches. It's very long. The color is not pure Khaki. Good deal, anyway.
B005W0LTO4|2|The sizing was correct,fits fine but because it does'nt have ajustable straps it keeps riding up on me. I will not order another.
B002LLMRD4|1|I choose this rate is because it really don't fit right on my stomach Too tight Need a big size
B00B7ETSTM|4|I actually really like this product! The only thing I needa' fix a bit are the strings, but other than that this top is really pretty.
B0091XDFVS|5|good stuff!
B006HFDYAK|3|Is  Nice just bigger than I thought it was
B00847V0R8|5|Wish I bought two! I love love this but it pills a lot. Sad because it's the best coat I ever bought:-(
B002ATUQQC|5|They are very cheap beads, both in construction and in price.  They are fine for St. Patty's day.
B007RGG8U6|4|Very comfortable however fabric is starting to pill after first wash.
B0044AZ2VO|4|Nice shirt.  At first seemed a little lighter than the company issue Bulwark but after wearing, it's just as hot.<br /><br />For the money,  buy the Bulwark. Less stylish but 20 bucks cheaper.  Just as hot.
B00HAQW096|5|Fits perfectly, and are very soft.
B0038195TK|1|Just received today. Not sure why product description states &#34;100% Polyester&#34; maybe the thin piece of lining? It is a cheap plastic. The handle is ready to fall off straight out of the package. The lining is detached / ripped away from the mask. Ill have to repair it or all of the lining will rip out and there will be no stick to hold onto! There are little reddish marks all over the mask. Like a marker maybe? The mask I received is close to what is pictured. But is black AND silver with silver trim.
B00A4VVCL6|4|Fits perfectly my 6 months old son, he looks absolutely adorable! The only thing I was not happy with... It will lose its color with every wash.
B00M35O12S|2|These are WAY too long (I'm 5'6&#34;) and shortening them ruins the print.
B00A4SDL4K|5|We LOVED this shirt! It is elegant and classy, fits well (Tom is 6' and 200lbs), is lightweight and perfect for any occasion that is dressy to casual. We took it on a cruise and received many compliments.
B00DG7F4FU|4|While the pants are comfortable, they do run small. I ordered the size I normally wear & they're too short in the legs. So when I sit, it looks like I'm wearing high waters.<br />But I don't regret buying them - just beware: if you wear longs (rather than medium or short length pants), these will not be long enough for you.
B007GBHOMI|3|Got this for my little sister cuz it fit her so well. It's very cute and the quality is good except the Studs.. They fell off within a few times of her wearing the belt.
B00GH0N9U0|5|These are beautiful leg warmers and look very sexy on my GF when she wears them. I bought them as a gift for her, one pair of each color. She hasn't worn them with boots yet, only barefoot like in the picture. (she knows I think they look sexy..lol) Seller was very quick to respond when I asked if she combined shipping and once order was placed they shipped immediately.
B003X26SBW|5|good quality, very satisfied.
B00AREIUJ2|5|I had ordered this shirt and washed it once I received it. I was happy to be putting it on when I looked into the mirror to discover a small tear in the material on the chest. Amazon replaced the shirt and I could not be more pleased
B007OWNJSC|5|Very comfortable.  Heavy enough cotton that is not see through.  I can hardy wait to get home and put on this comfortable gown.  Wonderful for the hot weather South California is having.  I even put it on in the daytime when I am home.  It's the coolest thing I own.
B00RL551KG|5|Previous reviewers are right- first- this bathing suit is the cutest EVER and second- the picture does not do it justice. This is the best most cutest bathing suit for a little girl ever. When I put it on my child, my voice went about 10 octaves higher- pretty sure only dogs could hear how cute this thing was on her.
B0007YVUVC|5|My wife really likes these.  She plans to order some more.
B00YNHZ1LY|5|Nice shirt. Wife loves it
B00PU5OQSC|5|Good fit.
B004KALH6C|5|I was really surprised by the quality of this shirt given the price and silk screened image on the front. Sometimes things like this can deteriorate significantly when you wash them but it is still going strong. The image is still as dark as the first day, the shirt is soft but sturdy (as is necessary for a little rough and tumble 18 month old), and has remained as nice as the day it was new. Really impressed!
B008Q0E61U|5|good quality
B00L8MWUNY|5|very good
B00VSOG65K|2|Waited two months for this to arrive (from China, naturally).  Although the description lists the bust as 41.5&#34;, which may be true if you stretch the blouse taut, the shoulders are WAY too small.  I'd estimate them to be 12&#34; across.  This blouse is for a very petite person.
B00OZ91YN4|5|My husband loves it!
B009NI9LMS|4|This shirt fits well and looks good. It's very slim fitted (although the description may not be explicit). I'd like it even more if it had a little stretch, but I like it all the same.
B006WHI02K|5|Nice jacket
B00N9OPMMU|5|Works great! Seems to fit everything I need. Hopefully, it's protecting my cards.
B004GBCK5W|5|I must admit that I was thrilled to find that the product fitted me perfectly. Before it had arrived, I was thinking that I should not have invested in buying a suit online. But to my astonishment, I was pleasantly surprised that my guess work actually matched my physique. As far as the product is concerned, well it is definitely value for money spent. The item description does justice to the product & am looking forward to wearing it again. Actually I have already worn it once for my office party recently & was able to raise a few eyebrows.
B003ZYE4W8|2|The bra fit nicely around the band and it stayed in place without a problem, but the cups didn't form with my breasts and instead left me looking like I had flat, square shaped boobs. The thick center jutted out any time I leaned forward.
B006Z8GTUG|3|The quality of the shirts is fine and they were delivered in a very reasonable time.  But I'm normally an M and these just fit.  We'lol have to be careful when washing not to let them shrink.
B00MPDQ27U|1|I bought this in the extra large and should have listened to the other reviewers.  This is a square piece of fabric with no shape at all.  Also on the back is a corset type tie like on the sleeves. You can't see it in the picture. Buyer beware!
B00S9NPW9O|5|Love them
B00L43OJHW|5|These fit like a charm and I feel good in them.
B00L3H0ES2|5|Love it and will buy again.. Will recommend!
B00HGH4SGW|1|I thoug it was better quality
B00N428WO2|5|Bought for my daughter,  she didn't like it because she is big busted and has to wear a bra and her bra straps showed when wearing this blouse.  Other than that, It was really cute
B00U43PZXA|5|My grandson loves them
B004114WAI|5|I suggested to my wife that she get these socks as she has bunions and problems with blisters. No problems since she started wearing them a week ago.
B00CI5KWZ8|5|Chevere!
B006QLBAU6|5|My hands are perpetually cold, and every glove I've tried, including a nice isotoner pair, only seems to insulate the cold instead of warming. These gloves, however, do the trick! They are incredibly warm and protect from cold wind and negative temperatures. Because of the multiple layers, they can be a little bulky for small tasks (like locking the door) but they are terrific for walking and driving in cold weather!
B0089MFCTK|4|i really like these shorts. they fit great and feel great. the only problem i had was that they were more of a bubble gum pink and not a hot pink
B007CFD9BI|5|These are truly great! have been battling an ear infection and with the cold windy days I needed something to protect my ears. they work better than I expected and are very comfortable too!
B000P50WEO|4|fit good
B00DJMDGAW|5|very nice looking jacket but a bit tight, smaller than other M-size clothes
B00BBSON7G|4|I really like this bra, but make sure to order a cup size up. It will make you look like whatever size you order, but there's about a cup-size worth of padding in it filling out the rest.
B005B5HKKW|5|This vest is very nice looking. My son wears it to school and out on the town. Nautica products are very good looking and we are pleased with the sweater.
B00A2KDE2O|5|TERRIFIC COSTUME!!! I'M 6'0 185 FITS ME PERFECT!! IT IS AWESOME!!! FAST SHIPPING TOO!!!! GREAT DEAL
B00GGE1P9E|2|Didn't like it. It didn't flatter my figure.
B00E0IKY2M|5|Love, love, love these pants for yoga.  They are super soft and comfortable.  I am coming back to buy another pair.
B00TIHA56K|2|Two stars because the colors are pretty however, I donated it to the Salvation Army without ever wearing it because the quality is poor. I am not a high maintenance individual at all, but stitches coming apart upon opening the item is just not acceptable. I guess you get what you pay for. Would not recommend buying.
B003ZW4V6Y|5|Love this bra!  This is my second one and plan to buy more.  And it is sooo pretty!  Only draw back is the straps are completely elastic, so we'll just have to see how long they \\"hold up\\" (ha, ha!)<br /><br />BTW -- Steve DID NOT buy this bra!  Rhonda did (we got a good laugh out of this)
B006LNUAXW|5|great warm cute perfect for the cold weather... true to size and still a lil stretchy... great buy great gift
B003N63ETM|4|It rides up sometimes.
B007BD79EO|5|I've recieved the wallet exactly at delivery date. The wallet is good , leather quality is good . I wanted a wallet with coin pocket and this item has a good size of coin pocket. The idea of simcard pocked is good but it doesn't feel secure to put any simcards over there. It would be good if you make the sim pockets a bit smaller or with somekinda sealing.<br /><br />Overall , it's a very good wallet , quality is superb and I am really happy with it.
B00KF7WGD2|5|Love it. I'm so glad I didn't buy the expensive one at express.  I'm 5'4 148lbs. Fits perfect!
B00BSCWPWA|3|I'm 6'2&#34; w/ athletic build - went with an XL as the shirt is described as slim fit.  Torso is overly large - very snug in the arms.  The stitching in the sleeves isn't great - it stops stretching before the fabric does creating a 'hard stop' that feels low quality.  Fabric is nice, logo looks cool, cut and stitching could be much better.
B004V9NVRA|5|Great scrubs - very comfortable...
B00KU5DK2A|5|Love it. It's not a cheap dollar store book bag. Its nicely stitched, good for 2nd-6th graders. Wont rip easily.
B00KLZ17GA|3|The picture makes the skirt look lined or made of a thicker material. It's not!! You can see through the material and it gives off a plastic shine. Overall not a bad pick as you can make it work but don't be fooled by the appearance of the picture on line.
B007O3R9SC|5|Fit as expected.  I am 5'3 and a true 14 and it fit very well. Since I am short, it was a tad long, but I just got the right platforms and it worked out perfect!! It was a real SHOW STOPPER!!! Everyone LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!! Would DEFINITELY recommend it!
B00J02CG5G|4|Size runs a little small but very good material and very solid looking. Get one size up
B005FIXPL8|2|These pants are not fleece. They are cotton sweatpant material. Fit is not good either. Length is much too long. Save your money and find something else!
B007AISF7K|4|Great suit for the price, but I wasn't pleased to see that there was a rip between the fingers on the left side.<br />I feel like that could have been avoided with some company inspection!<br /><br />Great suit though, I can manage to stitch that up.
B00P02F78I|2|PJ's have a great feel.  Nice color too. However, the Med top is huge. I didn't bother looking at the bottoms.  Interestingly, they're advertised as 100% silk, however they are 97% polyester & 3% spandex.  I contacted the company. They were quick to reply and apologized for the &#34;human error&#34;.  I thought they would have changed the description.
B00KSL5UHY|5|Great buy.  Works perfectly.
B002ZVV4S4|5|This is a great dress, I am 5'7\\" 125lbs size 5 jeans and the medium fits like a dream (when I wear my super padded bra ;) ) its super cute and flirty just the right length to be young but not trashy. I plan on wearing it to two weddings I have coming up. Cheap, but you cant tell! The pleats everyone talks about are fine on my dress and if they would have poofed out it would have been an easy fix. love love.
B00I0CTL46|4|I would've given 5 stars because this top is HOT! Not inappropriate - just right. But although I love the sweetheart cut I HAVE TO wear a bra with it because of my lack of chest (sadly) and my bra straps showed & had to be pinned because of the tops straps set further toward the armpit area for lack of better description. Also- its not a &#34;push up&#34; at all in my opinion. There's light bathing suit type &#34;padding&#34; which is nice but bra needed.
B00MGG0TFM|4|I love the color and it's combination. I just wish that it will fit a little fitted. I am 5'2 tall, and I wear small, but the jacket was somewhat loose around the waist and the sides. At the same time I believe an xsmall one would have been too small on me. Anyhow, I know I can wear a sweater under it! I had the jacket on a chair, and my son said \\"nice jacket mom\\"!  He was the one that told me, \\"you can wear a sweater under it when it gets colder\\"!
B00N5SQ3KK|4|I only wish it was a little longer. But it feels sexy and the zipper is good quality! Love this corset. I am a US size 16-18 and I could have even went with a 2x, but I'm used to wearing a corset
B000J2PGKI|5|This petticoat was the best one I have tried on by far. I ordered it three days ago and got it today with FREE SHIPPING. Would absolutely recommend this product to a family member or a friend. Excellent price.
B0089OI6Y6|4|Decent quality, but not a high bulk sock. They don't quite live up to what I was expecting in acrylic socks.  I'd give them a &#34;B&#34;.
B000YEFWZ0|5|I like the low scoop. I usually prefer v-necks, but the shape of this top is excellent. It's also nice and long and has smaller arm openings, so I don't feel as exposed. I plan on buying more in different colors
B00JJZ1PKQ|4|I'd read the reviews and saw it ran small so I ordered one size up (L instead of M) and it did work. Fits well and would have been too tight as a medium.
B008MA3K8O|5|I LOVE my skimmies. As a plus size lady thigh rubbing under dresses is the most terrible thing about dresses. These shorts don't add bulk and don't make me feel like I'm wearing panty hose, they feel light and perfect and I own 5 pairs. I wear a women's pant size 16-18 and like the way a 2X fits. I cannot say enough about these. Buy them, love them!
B004Z30X46|5|I love these shirts. They are the only ones i wear now. Well these and the colored version of the same shirts. Always fits like they should.
B00GY76P98|1|It fits to big a large usually fits good and this one fits to big
B004QGXOSY|5|I was pleasantly surprised by this bracelet! I'm usually skeptical about ordering jewelry online but I decided to buy this piece. First of all, it's heavier than I expected; but, that's a good thing. It seems well made. And I really do like the coloring of the bracelet.<br />All in all, an excellent piece of jewelry that I highly recommend.
B00EVI2TWE|5|I bought this dress for an upcoming cruise.  I don't usually order dresses on-line, but was surprised that it fits so well.  I can dress it up or down and wear it more than once and it won't take up much room in my suitcase!
B0013Z5ZDI|4|Not overly shiny, and loved the fact that its a solid neutral color to mix and match with different colored shirts. Great quality and price. Very pleased.
B00DP686GQ|2|The waist in these pants are no where near what is indicated on the size chart.  I like the feel of the fabric, I like the style, I like how the legs fit but there is no way these will fit my hips.  I am sad because they look so nice.
B0069JOBH4|5|My son's favorite pair of socks for skiing.
B00K8Q1BQ8|5|Awesome especially for the price!
B001JBH174|5|Best for the price you pay...
B008JHADGC|5|A great buy the product was better than I expected
B00M0ZL9O4|4|Kind of small but good quality, i like it
B00NI5Q012|4|Good quality and a good price.
B00OY4HWVS|5|It's ok that it is a little big. I can set it back on my head and that takes care of it. This is a beautiful hat...very classy!
B0044MK258|5|Shirt fits fine and it's a great shirt
B004868OW8|5|This is my second pair and I love them. The fit is good and since I have Parkinson's disease I need the silky to be able to turn over in bed. I don't like long sleeves or long pants so these are perfect. I must have washed my first pair at least 25 times nd they still look like new!
B0040ML8L4|2|Very cheap &#34;leather&#34;. It wears out easily...BUT, it looks great with a nice buckle.
B00P8F97TW|1|One wash and there was a hole in the socks.
B009AGCJRM|2|These shirts are not standardized. I received a shirt that said large in the neck and the label on the inside side said xl.<br />I was sent a replacement large and it was bigger than the one with the xl tag in the side. I do have to say Amazon tried to make it right with replacements. They really try.
B00FWNUZDC|4|it has a good quality but it runs too large so i think i had to get a smaller one
B0093SYECA|3|If you intend to be active in it, it will move around a bit. I got many compliments on it though. It's cute and worth the cost. Just be prepared to fidget with it a bit
B001OCPTDG|4|I bought this product specifically to wear with my deep v tube dress, which does work well with it. I like that you can remove the straps. I found that wearing it with the strap it does give some support, however it doesn't do much to lift your breast. I'm small in the chest area and I wish they had an A size for it. I have worn B sizes before though and this is just like my B size bras, it just fits enough. It does what it needs to do, cover the area and can be worn for your deep v plunge dress.
B00JHZSWQS|4|I received the product within 2-3 days....the company is located in Hong Kong, but they have some stock in US Amazon warehouses. The bikini is very cute! I normally buy small for bikini tops and medium for bottoms (I'm 34-27/28-35). I wish the pieces were sold separately. The top is a little big, the bottoms were almost just right. I probably could've gone with the small instead.
B00BHLF07E|5|Great  Item.!!
B00PC93J8Y|5|great shirt for thr price
B00D8SSMWY|4|My daughter likes it very much.  It's not the best quality, but OK for everyday wear.  We've machine washed it twice (in a bag, delicate cycle--cold) and it's held up very well.  Pretty colors and nice and light-weight with a cottony feel to it.
B0016LGG3C|5|My daughter loves these and I have a hard time finding pants that are skinny enough for her liking at the ankles.... these made the grade so if wondering if they will be skinny enough yes they hug all the way down!!
B00JAPCA9K|5|This belt is well made and it is super strong and highly durable. I hiked 8 miles in torrential rain on Saturday and this belt was soaking wet when I returned home but it retained its size and strength perfectly. I think the price is excellent and the quality is superior to anything I have ever owned in the belt department.
B00JM93FZ2|5|Great shirt, but I personally think that the fabric could be a little softer. But my boy loves it.
B00BWFW6P4|5|I was leery of the price with so many scarves, but they proved me wrong.  They are very light weight.  Make sure you wash them in cold water in a pillowcase or lingerie bag as they are delicate enough that you don't want them to get torn in a regular wash cycle.  I love the light weight and that they are thin enough that I can twist 2 colors together to wear.  Very happy with this product!
B00H4HGFJ2|5|Bought this for my hubby and he absolutely LOVES it!! It is his favorite so far. I predict I will have to purchase another within 6 months since he's going to wear this one out with constant wear.
B004E85BN0|4|AMAZON--PLEASE RE-STOCK: FOR THE 36 and 38 D's of the world! This is a gorgeous, comfy, well-made bra. I am a 36-38 D, and neither size I ordered (34D and 36DD) fit absolutely correctly...because I need my size. (I have been waiting weeks for them to show up in the selection, and nada.) It does fold over slightly in the middle/front portion...but if I had my correct size, this might not happen. Even if it did slightly, with proper strap adjustment, it's still a beautiful piece of lingerie for a nursing woman! The Womama (black bamboo style) and Sweet Mommy are the most comfy (and non-toxic, bamboo) nursing bras I have found, hands down. And I have tried them ALL. Everything else is scratchy, stiff, stinks like chemicals (yes--even the Bravado!) and feels like you're wearing a cumbersome medievil contraption. Not these.
B00HG0W3HK|5|perfect!
B00MHTQJ2U|3|Loved the material, but the largest size was still too small. Couldn't get the clasps closed even when loosening the back ties.
B003GCYYJC|5|Great product fits well, Legs are a little to long so I had to get them hemmed . but a great buy.
B00GLMZ1QY|3|The dress itself is really cute; I ordered the green and I love the color! I normally wear a size 14 and I ordered a size 14 but it fits a bit too big on me.
B00DZT2RXG|3|The image online makes the shirt appear to be form-fitting, made of a softer cotton. But when received it is very square and stiff. Also a strong odor, not sure if it's the ink?
B00IQG8872|5|I am super excited to wear it..........it fits perfectly :)
B00G97BAC0|1|The ears are not cat ears. They are on crooked and don't stand up. The sides are too tight and don't fit over my 7 year olds head and the inside is too big. The picture is not what you receive after you wait three weeks for it to ship. Worse part they refuse to refund your money.
B00D5RKUU0|2|Too smelly
B00NTZFRXI|5|I received many compliments...the  price was excellent.
B003EZTPBS|4|Good purchase
B00DY9DPIS|5|Fit perfectly
B00A3H60RC|3|I got this for my 3 year old Batman obsessed son for Christmas..The jacket was just what I was looking for not too heavy but not too light, perfect to keep him warm. It is also a nicely made jacket and doesn't look cheap or cheesy at all..My son just loves his Batman jacket..However he fell in mud earlier today and I washed it. I did exactly what the tag said to do and when I pulled it out of the washer the whole sticker on the back and completely peeled off leaving nothing but a blank surface..Batman is gone and my son is going to be so upset..This jacket was just awesome until it had to be washed and now sadly the only thing Batman on it is the logo on front but the big back piece of Batman is all gone..
B00E201VUM|5|The fit ,the style allows you to feel as though you have truly found a bargain and I plan to purchase more..
B002JC5X0E|2|The fit was okay ,back support was good but didn't do that much for breast support and the lace cups are itchy. After this purchase I'll just keep looking.
B003ILQ3PY|5|i adore these! a bit flashy but i wear black boots and black dresses with them to tone down the outfit. have gotten so many compliments! definitely my favorite leggings.
B00GWUN392|5|Top with a black tunic or shirt..Adds color and pattern without being overdone.<br />Nice coloration of leopard print .not cheap looking..good quality..
B009WB9YZK|5|I love these nursing bras and recommend me to all my mamas that don't want to feel frumpy just because you're a mama now! The other nursing bras out there are so high up that they showed under a lot of my blouses and tshirts, but these don't. And it's comfortable too!
B00U5T4EI0|4|It's a nice skirt, although I have not worn it yet. It fits a little on the small size, but the material is perfect for summer.
B00806Q30M|4|This is a good looking cap, but i was a little disappointed in the quality of the cap. I never could keep it tight on my head. It was constantly loosening. Normally, i will wear a cap for several years, but i trashed this one after just one year.
B005SN5I6A|5|These were a Christmas gift for my son-in-law and he was very please with them, very soft and washes very well.
B00GUISC56|4|don't wash as well as other makers
B00AJ338SY|5|my son love his fleece
B00AEW6ACQ|1|It is smaller than expected plus it was defective which was more upsetting
B002KJ5FNG|4|I think this was a prefect fit for my son.  He looked so cute and it was a great quality for the price.
B00ISGT44G|3|It's short but boxy. Should work fine. Not made of especially soft material, which is too bad. Would like it more if it was a softer blend.
B00ACIGNMY|5|Came as promised.  Great quality.  Would buy from again.
B001KJE9DY|4|I like it.  It's a decent wallet, just enough pockets, durable, and nice.  Most people are very amused and like it a lot, two girls have been pretentious to say \\"you paid for this?\\", and one person brought up the good point that if I ever lost it (oh, LOST!) then he said I might never get it back since it's very incognito.  It has two main pockets for money and receipts, two inner cutouts for ID and credit cards, and there are some accessible pockets on the ends (facing the outside of the wallet).  I'm not certain these were fully intended to be used as pockets but stuff falls out of those so those particular ones aren't very good.  It's minimalist and I don't like to carry thick wallets so it works for me, it's creative-looking (which I like), and you can write on it if you wanted (and it would like like part of the design).Overall, I enjoy it.
B0047HFAHU|5|Our grandson is sure to be an athelete. It's in his genes. Could there be any cuter outfit for a future star? Also I am having trouble finding clothes for cooler weather. This one fits the bill. Very good quality.
B00KQU2X0E|5|Very comfortable
B004GNHX8E|5|This was a gift and it made her very happy!  The perfect length she was looking for.  As an XL Girl she wasn't confortable shopping in stores for a short skirt and this was exactly what she was looking for!!
B00GO99KV6|4|this was a gift for my son. haven't heard any complaints.
B00PUHHYE8|5|Very cute and fashionable! It's well made and it looks adorable. I recommend this outfit.
B000LT04ZG|4|The shirts are a little on the small side, but will work just fine.  Besides, I need to lose a little weight.<br /><br />Joey
B003QMMDCM|3|Backpack looks great to me, but the I found it difficult to actually carry it around. I still think it's a great backpack if you don't have to carry a lot of heavy books.
B00CL0GNVM|5|Best tank tops I've bought - great length, good quality, great price and delivered. Nothing to complain about.  They're long enough to cover that spot on your lower back, and no elastic bra line to make you take it off before bed. I bought a bunch.
B00BXFFYFM|1|I thought this dress was super cute, until I touched it. The material J's really cheap and scratchy. Also there is volume at the waist which just plots out and makes you look ridiculous. Cute dress idea but anyone with curves cannot wear it.
B00UJO5M3W|5|great value, shipped quickly and fits as described
B00D6MLZPS|5|Picture does not do this dress justice! Beautiful flowing chiffon layers and the color is stunning! Bought for my daughter for my wedding and is perfect!
B00CI0IDVS|2|It is a suit by the size and a style it is good. But quality of tailoring - awful! Hundred sticking-out threads. I carry adult things of this brand and is sure that they can't do a kidswear so badly. Obvious fake.
B00K75FT04|5|Thank You!
B00IL4M3H0|4|Just as in the pics
B003CH2GIW|5|great quality & cool shirt
B000BP2YQC|5|This shirt is exactly as appears.  The shipping was extremely fast also.  I would buy from them again anytime!
B001AERQKM|5|This is a great hat<br />Holds it's shape well after Abuse<br />Color is close to Indys leather hat
B005ZMK8NC|2|I have no idea what other people who wrote reviews on this product were referring to, but the size chart is off by far.<br />I bought a L(US Medium) which is described as fit for ~5'9\\", 155 lbs(10.8 stones).<br />I am 6'0'', 165 pounds and the coat is very roomy on all parts of my torso other than the shoulders.<br />Looking at the photos of the item, I am assuming that this coat/jacket is designed to be worn on top of couple of light layers and is supposed to have slim fit?<br /><br />Also, two of the buttons fell off as soon as I tried to put this coat on for the first time.<br /><br />One good thing is that the shippment arrived very fast. It arrived in like 4 business days.<br />But since I will stick this somewhere in the back of my car and not wear it until I am on the verge of freezing to death, early shipment doesn't seem to make anything better.<br /><br />Although, I would have very much liked the coat if it had perfect fit.
B00B4TT3JK|5|My grandson was thrilled. He didn't want to take them off to get them washed. They washed well and were ready for him again. Thanks for having these available!
B00B2HUOJW|4|I like the color and it fits well,but Build Quality should be improved i think.
B00CWABWO4|5|Beautiful shirt thank you!
B00RY4CNKK|5|Great t-shirt,very good service
B003VVUW8K|3|This should be a 5 star review because the Hanes socks in the picture and that i ordered are the only socks that stay on our child. Unfortunately, what they sent were completely different. They were hanes but different color, different design and they are a little loose, like all other socks.
B00KXLWS10|2|The dress seemed to fit true to size if not a bit larger but the slit in the back comes up way too high for my liking and I was not even aware it had the slit when I bought it.
B0061Q3464|5|Fit big but I washed it and now it's s perfect fit!!! Thanks
B00R0FWJV6|3|I like the hat ok, the fabric is a little more sheer than I expected it would be.  Overall it is well constructed.  The value of the product is good.
B004ZZNYVI|5|The fit on this luscious robe is great-I'm 5'6&#34; and 145lbs;the small-medium is fine. The fabric is thick and absorbent.I washed it before my first wearing, and have had no problem with shedding.It washes well, with no shrinkage. We have an outdoor shower, and this is when I wear this robe-it's nice and cozy when there is a chill in the air.Very satisfied on Cape Cod.
B008DS0MOK|4|I like this dress. It is shorter than I thought it would be. I cannot wear it without tights but that doesn't bother me. I don't have a problem with the dress quality, it is only $13. You get what you pay for. Overall, I'm happy with and I have already purchased a couple more dresses.
B00EDTLTGS|4|Great for the price!  I am an hourglass shape and these fit perfectly!
B005PQPPUY|5|I bought this item reading reviews o f customers and i am very happy with the quality of it. It is on line withexpectations.
B00GRZRHXK|5|Affordable , and the bra feel good on, and still gives me support. I am so happy I now have place to go to for reordering .
B0058YQE80|5|Would be 5 Stras if the fabric was a bit heavier.  Other than that, super comfortable, great length, and a breeze to wear.<br /><br />July 10, 2016:  I now own 5 pairs in assorted colors and love them.  Easy to wear, wash, and enjoy everywhere.
B00QKB2W36|2|I got nothing but compliments on the party I wore it to. Despite of ordering the XXL one it fit amazingly. My arms were comfortable and covered all the time.  I did find a bummer they were not beige as the dress itself and it was way too short also it kept crawling up in the front. Back length is awesome though.  ***UPDATE***  I'm taking some of the stars off mostly just because it shrunk after the first wash; my arms can't go through anymore without looking like a badly packed sausage.
B007QS8CEK|5|My son loves them, and the fit is great! I also bought a pair another pair in graphite. Great deal!
B009DK4UYK|5|Purchased this hat as a gift. Very nice quality. Not like some of the cheap-o junk ones out there that fall apart after a week. My recipient was extremely happy.
B009G0OO7U|5|Very thick, the color is almost exactly the same as the picture. It's a bit bit frizzy but that's to be expected. It also arrived very fast. Over all great wig!
B0058XDC0Y|5|I bought them for my husband. He says they fit like a glove.
B00BYBZDBU|1|I ordered a pair of these with the metal clips and they sent me a pair with the weird rubber ends. They won't stay on my uniform shirt for even a minute. This product is trash don't buy...
B003GIS95G|1|too small
B00ACIFT5G|3|it is ok
B00GAOAED8|5|Good Sleeve Length & Long Tail Length.  Quality Materials.
B00F0PL3HO|3|Cute dress but if you have a mid section expect to have it shown off.
B0001YS7CI|4|This product was of good quality and what I expected but were too small for the person i bought them for.
B00XAVNXPU|3|I thought since I am 5'4&#34; tall that the robe would be knee length - but shorter & a little bit smaller than I expected.
B00PBB8YYM|5|I'm 5 9, 139. I ordered a medium and fits great!  I really like how it looks especially with high rise leggings. Definitely recommend it!
B0039X57VW|5|Love this top! Great service, fast shipping! I can't wait to order more! Thank you so much! I will definitely recommend Switchblade Stiletto to all of my friends!
B001MXM0CA|5|Just as described and shown in picture. These are quite thick, good for winter. Looks like it is made very well. I am 5'2'' and it hits my mid thigh perfectly.
B00866OL78|5|Got these for the summer. I took them to the cleaners to have them two I had them ironed and they look better them I first saw them.
B00746KPA8|5|Fast Delivery to Texas & the shirt is in perfect condition & beautiful. The color & design match the online picture. I love The Mountain shirts. They are great quality tees! The sizing is true although they seem a bit longer in length than most tees. There is hardly any shrinkage too!
B0012CRTE0|5|Looks like a car hart but a little heavier, now lets see about the wear. will let you know....
B001KNXUFI|5|This is a nice tie.  It is already tied, and is easily adjustable as can be seen in the picture.  If a bow tie is needed for an occasion,<br />this would be a good choice.
B00CV9F7DI|5|Gotta love Star Trek.  Now I can go to Comi-Con
B00D5VGQYA|3|Looked exactly like the picture, and even came early, but... was smaller than expected.  Bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Halloween, she usually wears a small in Juniors, and this was a medium.  I know Asian sizes are smaller, but I was expected it to run about a size small... she fit it, but barely.  She definitely won't be able to wear it again, hopefully she has a really skinny friend that would like to wear it.
B00AQNCFLI|2|the picture shown looks much more navy than the cerulean blue leggings i received.
B000A38JN2|5|bought for a growing young man and is made well and holds its shape after many washings. would recommend it highly.
B005OCH2U0|5|Good quality shirt.  Not too thick or too think.  Good fit and quality.
B00AMKNNNO|5|good quality
B00ND8L42Y|4|Quality made product.  Six cards max this thing out.  With six cards in it, the slot in the middle doesn't open very much to put money in it.  This is only the first day I've had it, so I'm sure it will loosen up over time.  Serves the purpose.  Better than carrying the typical huge tri fold wallet.  I would recommend.
B00C9XV3FW|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these pants! Comfortable, soft, durable. I wish I had considered these when I started landscaping and clearing brush 3 years ago!
B00BJ9ENKE|5|I bought this as a gift for my grandson so I bought it big on purpose. He wears it all the time and just loves it. Now he has room to grow.
B00EVOOA8Y|1|Crawl up, does not stay in place.  Very uncomfortable when it starts creeping up your stomach and back.
B0054SO0CC|5|WILL WEAR WITH LARGE SWEATER, GREAT JACKET THOUGH
B00QTVL44K|5|The picture is a tad misleading it looked more like a sweater but it's more of a book cover material. Not bad though, it's a crazy swag shirt. Delivery estimate was 1 1/2 month but got it in 2 weeks.
B00HD6R1U6|3|When I got the first one I ordered, one of the belt loops immediately broke off.  Then when I moved the belt so it was centered on me, the other one broke.......I thought it might be an anomaly so I ordered a replacement and told them it was because of the broken belt loops.  When the 2nd one came, I looked at it in the package and could see that one of the belt loops was already broken.  I therefore figured this was probably typical of their craftsmanship, so I took it to a nearby tailor who I've used to see what it would cost to fix it.  It was only 6 dollars and they did a good job, the belt loops actually stay intact when you move the belt.<br />The other issue is it's pretty thin, which is good for the summer, but I will have to get an under slip so my underwear isn't vaguely visible.........doing these things are worth it to me cuz I really like how it looks and it wasn't very expensive.
B008XOXNQI|5|Love these! But if your a large gal (I'm a large - XL) they will fit but its going to sit LOW! My only real complant is i got three colors and i did was the, which was fine, but i hung the over a shower to dry & one pair faded were it touched :(
B00PKTNHYW|5|I bought this shirt for my Husband and he was just excited to see that it had Japanese writing, but when I told him what it said he was the happiest guy in the world. Great product. Very well made. Will buy from you again.
B00AOK9138|5|I purchased these Bamboo fibre underwear for my husband and he loves them. They have become his favourite undies and I guess that says a lot. The fabric feels very soft to the touch and very stretchy. I do not know how well they last before they start to lose their shape as underwear usually does. So far, they have been worn and washed weekly and they have kept their shape and bright colours beautifully.
B004ZBLBBC|5|I have about 6 of these. They are comfortable, practical, and good looking. I wear them alone or under an open flannel shirt in brisk weather. Size up to allow for shrinkage on all 100% cotton garments.
B0001MVNKS|4|...good cold (wet) weather traveling hat...works well with cashmere/wool overcoats...    ...was actually able to fold mine into a suitcase when i returned to singapore from milan...
B000G35AHE|1|These shirts fit well width wise but aren't cut for tall men. They don't even go over your belly button. Wound up giving them to a friend.
B006RJN7OO|2|I purchased a medium and received what seemed to be an XL. These pants are HUGE!!!!!!!!!! Wouldn't purchase them again.
B000LPFH98|3|The material is nice and comfortable even in sweaty conditions.  CONS: The tag at the back itches and of course no pockets.
B004YZO5GW|5|💋
B005EJKGFQ|5|try and love
B000XUGRC2|5|Good product for good price. Colors are bold and the material is soft. Just a good old fashioned sweatband. Would recommend this seller and their products. Shipping was fast too.

B0003DKVE4|3|These suspenders work great, but they are big. They kind of say, &#34;Hay, look at me!&#34; but it is hard to match the navy blue color of these suspenders with many shirts. And you can't really hide these suspenders under your shirt because then it looks kind of like you have some enormous nipple piercings, because that's where the plastic adjusters are located. Next time I'm going to buy a more low profile set of suspenders.
B00P85XZMM|4|Nice fit, looks neat.  Navy color looks exactly like black if you don't have a reference to compare the color with.  My mistake, bought both Navey and black and they look identical.
B000T30T3G|5|I was relieved to receive it and find it was *exactly* like the one I have at home - at HALF the price.  There is not a bra in the world that is comfortable for me but, so far, this comes closest.  {*_*}  The underwire is *not* uncomfortable and it's a beautiful bra.
B00AY2G3PA|5|He likes unique shirts and asked me to order this one for his birthday. It's pretty cool and people have stopped him at work and on the street to ask him where he got it from. The fit is great and he wore it with a long sleeve tee under it in November! One of his favorites.
B00541T7L8|4|very nice checkbook cover.  Was a little bulky for my purse but serves the purpose of why I ordered this one.  Love purple.
B00V1G6PUG|5|Exactly what we wanted for the baby.
B0058NU716|5|I've had so many compliments when I wear these jeans. I love Jr. sizes, they fit nicely in the waist, no gaps like with womens sizes. These fit like they were made for me. Levis, gotta love 'em!
B000N8X0N8|5|perfect fit
B00BJOTR6O|5|It looked very small when I pulled it out the package, but it stretches out nicely. We were quite pleased.
B00I5V4VJM|5|GOOD
B00HTCF2N2|5|Fit perfect. And very sensual
B00RCTAAQQ|5|I love this hat, it's really really warm. It's quilted and has fur in it. I am a women who is 5ft 6 ins and it fit me perfectly.I wish you could snap the face mask out of the way when your not using it so it's not just hanging. Highly recommend this hat to anyone who is looking for a very warm and nice looking hat. Very good quality hat for the price. Thinking of buying the black one.
