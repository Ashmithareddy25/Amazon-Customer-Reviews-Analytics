B001FKEXV6|1|Wrong size studs and only 3 nuts were in the box
B000SKV4U2|5|Just what I needed for my MB.
B00GHUEU58|5|Well made and easy to work with. Installation is a breeze when using the right installation method. I highly suggest you visit the 1060graphics.com website to watch there installation video if you've never installed any type of stripes or graphics before. If you've ever installed stripes or large graphics before, this item will be very easy to install with the same methods and techniques.
B003CG9QFY|5|This Molle system is great. You can customize it to suit your needs. Yes, you do need to attach your tailgate bracket atop it but that only helps secure the back panel of the system...
B000C55LAM|4|These are wonderful shocks they fit my 87 Dodge W150 wonderfully, the only bad thing I have to say about them is the fact that I ordered them and it took 9 days for them to get here with 2 day shipping
B004AIHCOU|5|Prompt shipping  and delivery. Product fits and works perfect.
B00D97G2CG|2|The antenna has a lot shorter coaxial cable than the one I took out of my 1994 Honda Civic. It barely went further than the pillar into the fuse block area. The stereo is mounted in the center of the dash. The plug end fell off easily too. I bought a wireless antenna and left the new one installed as the old one was mangled. At least it looks authentic.
B007HRKCG6|5|Nice ball, got it to fit with the equalizer WD hitch. A bit over priced, but seems like a good hitch ball.
B00O7XYRQO|4|Just as advertised!
B00ELHNK64|5|The best oil motor for my Subaru Impreza turbo since 2002!!!!
B00CFCI3D2|5|Look great in new SUV
B0095S5I3W|5|Did the trick, easy to install.
B000BOALF4|1|These did not work for me. Driving at 3am the deer just stand there and look at me funny. One has already fallen off and is lost.
B00KTHYDA2|5|Great product! Works well and is easy to program!
B0011FLODA|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00FYX2BBE|5|Fits great in my 06 f150. Looks great and you can tell it's not made of cheap rubber. Not a perfect fit but still looks good and does it's job.
B00G9A31SS|5|LOVE IT!!!
B00BI4U96W|5|Excellent fit & finish
B002Q7SGHO|5|these are great
B00KB13XDE|5|worked as advertised, have a connector diagram ready for the harness and the ecu, there are no instructions provided
B000RXNLK6|5|this stuff works really good!
B006LAC9SO|5|Good product...
B000VUATNC|5|Great price,  great mat.  Heavy duty
B00AXOSL5E|5|It was awesome. Just what he needed for our 68 Chevelle.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Just LOVE THESE (: ! work perfect for my Prius windows and now baby girl  isn't  getting sun on her
B0002UQAM0|4|Before I say anything else let me start by saying that I've been hand detailing my car for 5 years now- and have had my share of good times and bad, as well as good products and bad ones.<br /><br />Tonight was bad....I mean BAD.<br /><br />After going through my usual routine of washing and claying the car I marked some spots I wanted to buff out for scratches with painter's tape. I grabbed my new second bottle of turtle wax rubbing compound and got to buffing (by hand). I worked for a good 10 minutes on 1 spot to no avail- actually, it made it worse! It added a whole new pattern of scratches around the one scratch. Killed me inside a little bit, seriously I was ready to throw in the towel and call it a night. Never had a buffing session resulted in WORSE scratches than before. I was devastated.<br /><br />But I wanted to try one more thing- I grabbed this polish I had on hand and got out a polishing pad and applied as directed to the new scratches- after spending a good 5 minutes trying to buff this stuff off I was able to see the beautiful results. I nearly cried from relief- the paint was back to its former self- granted with a bit more wear, but the shine was still deep. Those crappy little scratches were gone!!<br />If I had taken a picture I would have posted it- but I honestly had no idea that the polish would knock out those scratches.-didn't expect it to. It's just a polish- not meant to be abrasive. Yet, it still got rid of those scratches caused by the compound.<br />I wouldn't say you could use it for scratches- but I'll test it next time I have some paint on my car from a neighborly ding to see just how abrasive it is (if at all).<br /><br />P.S. Thank you to the person who recommended using a polishing pad! The first time I used this polish I used a microfiber cloth and ended up exhausted with only the hood done- so I never finished the car and the polish ended up staying on my car shelf for a good 6 months after. This time around the polishing pad made application incredibly quick- BUT removing it is a whole different story. I had to go over it with a large soft towel to pick up the polish, a softer medium towel to pick up left overs, and a microfiber towel to finish buffing out the glaze and to remove waves. Pain in the rear removal.<br /><br />If anyone has any tips on how to better remove this polish I'd use it more often and I'd be a lot happier haha<br />Thanks!<br /><br />**please note that the pictures I provided are with my car washed with conditioning soap, clayed, and polished- no wax was applied or finishing spray. That's how shiny my car is now- I think I may blind people if I waxed it hahas a whole different story.

B00I9H3JCM|5|Looks great.  Tight fit.  Some may not want to cut the core out of their grill.
B0072W6ERC|5|excellant light output very happy with product
B00L7XDI6M|4|Item exactly as described. Seems ro be a quality product.
B006AX3UXA|1|Ordered a &#34;proud to serve&#34; and received a different saying
B00446YIYK|5|I got this for my husband who is a truck driver and he absolutely loves it. Small enough to store out of the way and easy enough to use even he can make a cup. It is great for those times when he isn't around an open store and wants a cup of coffee.
B0009JKGJ2|5|Excellent did a great job on my car
B00ONDJMJ0|5|Fits like OEM great looking chrome replacement
B000SL0R9K|5|While we didn't need to use this on our trip to Mexico, I felt better knowing it was there. Compact size and a semi-hard clamshell case is perfect for Travel and has a good amount of bandages and other first aid supplies that seem to be of a decent quality. Highly recommend.
B00KLSZ632|1|received these in the mail for my Honda Civic, suppose to fit 3457 and it did. My mechanic who professionally installed them with resistors for me noticed it kept blowing a bunch of different fuses like my music, dome lights and regular headlights. After trial and error trying to find our problem, and it completely shorted my tai lights too. Just bought a different pair of led switch back lights and they work perfectly. Way better than these lights..
B000X20CHQ|5|Fits vehicle well, evens out to fit without boils or bumps. Good texture and seems durable.
B000VKTUG4|5|works great on my 2004 pontiac gt1
B000GTV7SY|4|Great product!
B003AKLGTG|5|They will fit a 426 as long as its a wedge engine . Great buy!
B005J6SMO6|5|These mufflers sound absolutely amazing on my car - morphing the gentle stock purr into a monstrous cackle as I drive down the road. Everyone knows when I arrive. ;)
B005BNP7SQ|2|After only !0 days the lower section of lights on the &#34;G&#34; burnt out, I am returning it however now the price went UP to purchase another one !
B00QRG47SW|2|To be totally honest they look much better online, rather in hand. I wear an 11.5 to 12 and ordered a size 13 to leave room for thick boot socks and shin guards. These boots run a size + smaller then printed. I was planning on using them for an extended adventure ride 7k or more on my 990.<br />I had to use my old SIDI boots.  The final kicker was that i was charged a 20% restock fee for returning the boots after my trip.<br />Yes it took more than 30days to return the boots(i was on the bike ride for a while).However the boots were not correctly sized and were returned first this whenI returned home.
B004J0V3Z8|4|Not bad has a smaller core width then the original engine still runs at an perfect range was a direct replacement no rigging nothin which was a plus.
B002YL5364|5|Exactly as advertised.
B00BFDFP60|5|Plain. Simple. Easy to install. Simply satisfied.
B00SYTB2WE|5|Great product and great deal.
B00199LQNQ|5|GREAT PRODUCT, WORKED PERFECT
B00F6BBGSI|1|These headrest covers were to small for my Siena van.
B002R8HMAY|5|Just like factory OEM
B000LG9AXQ|5|grate
B000O1C396|5|Quality Item - very robust tool.
B00E8415HQ|4|I love it... Easy to install if you are good with your hands. However i wish the red light didnt reach through the turn signal. Can barely see the turn signal at night and in the day time it's like nothing is their. Other then that brake light is super bright.
B00ROS4PCU|5|Good materials...snap right on
B00KHZBPCU|4|the grille does a nice job of filling in the strange hole ford left. looks very OEM and puts the final touch on my truck. come with the hardware and rubber grommets for a tight fit, highly recommend
B007DKQGQC|5|I LOVE this sticker and everything about it. I'm not one to usually put bumper stickers on my car, but this one I just had to. I've already had some comments, mostly from liberals who can't agree with anything that makes sense,but my conservative friends and family love the sticker.
B00CD2RSG2|4|I have a 2005 silverado These are just as advertised fits good looks great great price would of gave 5 star but not a dan of the hardware we will see how it holds up
B00TQ0S7QE|4|It worked as advertised at a price lower than anyplace else I could find.
B00U1OFYWE|1|very small chairs cheaply made
B006ZBOECS|5|Incredible, should've bought these a long time ago.
B000JFHNQA|5|Very nice tool. Sturdy high quality feel and function flawlessly after initial charge.
B001DKM32Y|5|item as described - thanks!!!
B0015DQER4|5|well  made
B000B6CW3Q|5|Fits, works and got here quickly...
B000C59V3A|5|This product fit our truck perfectly. The part is very well made, and seems very durable. Moog has a great reputation, and I can see why. I would highly recommend this part.
B0091I1LGE|5|Looks good love it
B006EGAIII|5|Construction is sound. Product allows me to get to ride up on with my commercial lawn mower for blade removal and sharping safely.
B000CODH0E|3|They do their job
B000NOO798|1|I followed the directions to a T but the product didn't work.
B00CASDZKC|4|Very nice mats, and they were delivered quickly!
B0024GW2XQ|5|Helmet is fine. I hate half helmets though...
B0063GKHPI|5|great price showed up fast.
B006N91C2M|5|Very good.
B00GXLUP1Y|5|Works about 80% of the time, but a lot of people don't even drive with rearview mirrors. If I'm honest, try something a little politer, because people may feel the need to take their anger out on you enforcing a law.<br /><br />Quality and ease of installation is all top knotch
B00RS0NI5Y|1|These don't work very well in either of my Mercedes E class or SL class cars.  I was hoping they would catch the stuff constantly falling between the seat and center console, but they don't fit right and are more of a problem than the problem they solve.
B004LWTHP2|2|Did not worked in my case, it says, fully charge drained battery, well I have a second vehicle, which i use occationally and the battery was dead, it has been 6 weks since i use it last, and I brought this charger hoping to charge that battery, but this charger could not charge it, it will start charging and after 20 minutes or so, all the lights will go off, i repeat the process 4 times and the same result. I am sending this back.
B00OZFFI9E|5|Fast delivery, awesome product!
B001P24JWW|5|excellent product  upgrade for any vehicle.good quality and fast shipping!
B00O4C14IM|5|It looked and fit like the original part.
B001C97ZVA|4|Works really well save money by changing it out myself
B000BKJDKM|5|Good extension cord......just what I needed.
B00QRANHI4|5|No more kitchen cooking oders!  , and right now we have lots of fires around us.seems to be helping with the smokey air. I purchased one for my mother 92 years old for her home, to help with all the smoke in the air. I have one in my car, oders  bother me, lots. Also, two in my house, one next to the chair I sit in and one in the kitchen. No more orders. Great! Thank you.
B004P1V30Q|5|Works great to help me into our F250 truck.
B000BQYH6Q|3|I have not purchased this wheel block yet. I would like to find a wheel block that has an alarm attached , that way when the midnight bandit decides to help himself, the minute he budges that wheel block ... a loud alarm sounds. I wonder if they have anything like this yet ?
B004FMYD48|5|Same as the generic branded one, but in the VW box. Fit my 2006 2.5 Jetta fine
B00BLPUHVA|2|Helmet clear screen broke 2 days after got it
B00LPNA5WY|4|Works great !!
B007V3FJY6|5|Perfect fit & durable.
B0041CA48G|3|Ok
B00PT18QAQ|5|very quick deliver and seems to be solidly built
B00CD2RBWS|4|I didn't use weather strip.  They give you exactly enough hardware SO DON'T LOSE ANY IN YARD. I live in north we get feet of packed snow. I drilled 7 holes in each rear fender flares after I installed them. I put stainless steel nuts n bolts n washers because where I live the plastic hardware came with these wouldn't lasted long.  Only reason why I gave 4 stars is because weather strip kept falling off and finally decided not to use it after all its a truck not a Cadillac.
B005F3G91G|5|A+
B0014HN6J0|5|Good fit, and they worked.
B004IP8FSW|5|Fantastic meter. Easy to use. Received promptly. Highly recommend.
B0073WGOLC|5|This fit the Polaris 4-wheeler perfectly.  My husband was amazed because he didnt believe me when I told him I could get a better price online and it would fit.  This came and it went right on without any problems!  We are very pleased with the product and the durability as well.  It is not cheaply made and looks just like one you buy right from an auto parts store!  Thanks!
B001ECT3BK|3|good quality but too soft of a ride.
B000B8GAKK|3|Just OK.  Nowhere near the quality of the original on my 02 Miata.  It fits and it works, but not nearly as thick or solid as the original oil cap.  It is slightly thin, but hey, for the price it is OK.
B004V3QBS2|1|Solenoid failed after one outing. Had to replace it
B0033MEHEC|4|Good Jack Mount but VERY challenging install on my 2014 Jeep JK Unlimited.  The instructions are not very helpful, relied mainly on the explosive parts photo.  The challenge is attaching the cradle and base plates through the vinyl caps with all the hardware stacked and aligned.  The tailgate interior nut plate moves and causes lots of frustration.  The trick, after many attempts is to only attach the base plates and secure them first, than remove one right side bolt at a time while the plate is under pressure and attach the jack cradle.  I did use a clamp to help apply pressure on the lower plate while I removed the right side bolt and attached the cradle.  The upper plate did not require a clamp as the plate pressure kept the interior nut plate in place for cradle attachment.  One last point, be sure and cut oval shaped holes through the vinyl hinge caps as you need to be able to slide the caps in place after aligning the hardware and threading the bolts.  This info should save considerable time and frustration in your install, good luck.
B007HRSXDK|5|Exactly what I needed. Replaced original equipment. Easy to install. Shipped fast.
B000IYNTYC|5|Worked great
B0009IBJE4|5|Great size, and works perfectly for slow charging!  I've used it on my car and lawn mower.  It helped greatly as I was having alternator trouble.  Easy trickle charge and diagnostic readings, and can put back in the box and on a shelf for storage.  Love this little thing.  Great value
B00JIDX386|5|Love it
B00AGLO8PQ|4|Very prompt exactly what was listed
B007TN15EG|5|Works well
B007PT3LGY|2|They say there lights are bright but when you put them on your truck you can barely see them in the day time and are not brighter than your headlights at night.
B0009IQY3U|5|I love this product, I'm a boat detailer so I'm always using this oxidation remover. The final result I get on my projects are awesome and our customers are always happy and always call back.
B004TVMMV6|5|Installed on my '06 Jeep CRD.  They have an aluminum oil pan that strips easily, so to minimize chances of that happening, I installed one of these.  I change my oil/filter every 6,500 miles and this thing makes it super easy!
B00BTLEJXI|2|They sent me 2 back seat bottoms and not a cover for the seat back. Looks ok, it works, quality is what you would expect at this price.
B005MVB3OY|5|Always wanted one....works great and love it. Its a good investment for working on your vehicle.
B000EDOSKG|4|These used to come with a hose clamp. Not anymore. You need a hose clamp as many campgrounds water pressure is too high to use this without one.
B000FZZRS0|5|This was hands down the easiest thing I have installed on my car in a long time. mind you I watched the correct YouTube video before hand
B005ESTA1S|1|Recieved both mirrors today, 8/19/2015, and the driver side flasher signal light was broken... the amber light casing was cracked and the pieces that hold the casing in place were broken, which does not allow to be reattached to the mirror....👎👎
B00144B2LW|3|Overpriced. Doesn't do anything that Brite Boy does for a lot less. I'm a big 3M product fan, but this is a letdown.
B000CIY0U6|3|It is a very heavy nice mat.  Wish it would have matched the bed mat that I ordered at the same time.  There was more trimming than I had anticipated.  It can be done with a straight edge as previously stated.  Just a little harder to do the rounded edges and make them look finished.  For half the price of the whole bed mat I guess I expected a little more.  The bed mat fit perfectly and looks good.
B00E6V8CRW|1|PLASTIC HOUSING BROKE AS SOON AS I STARTED TO INSTALL IT. VERY CHEAP!
B000CMHVGM|4|this did not work for me at all. May be just me, but I could not make it work
B00O2KWCRS|5|Great  product!
B0007PHD0S|4|WORKS AS DESCRIBED
B0016LFZ6Q|5|Product as advertised
B00W8LQHBU|2|No installation instruction sheet, very confusing but finally I figured out myself !
B000LG8GI6|5|It works well.
B0010E3JUI|5|Nice air filter and fit perfectly! I'm happy I finally changed it out and the AC is not running at a reduced air flow anymore!
B000BQQWKA|4|as described
B0035R0S3E|5|Just what I needed and received quickly
B00XJ0WAN8|4|They look cool,  but one of them is backwards.
B00KJLKZHS|4|Worked perfectly but they only included 2 clips - one on each support when I needed 4. These supports are for fiberglass hoods as they are lighter. With the stock lift supports, the hood would shoot up too far.
B00391FVMY|5|Perfect fit. Easy installation with screwdriver and 10mm socket with short extension.
B00S4PL3UY|5|works like a champ!
B00P8ZAR6E|5|It was very much what we wanted. It is great we love it
B0067UDANQ|4|Not as heavy duty as original but worthy of a four star score for fit and cost.
B00SISD8VY|5|Awesome light
B005JU5W54|5|WOW! These are absolutely quiet and amazing on my Nissan Murano. No streaks, pretty much zero sound. Installation was a bit tricky because of the arms on my car, but otherwise should be very easy.
B00FS2TLAU|4|Okay
B0066SFRY4|5|Very good work good
B000CNBQ12|5|Great products and a great price. They fit well and give the pickup a great look with a very good ride.
B006K8W9RS|5|excellent product - fits the bill
B00CQBFRDQ|4|They fit perfectly and were easy to install, and good braking performance
B00OM7WQQI|5|Great product! Exactly like the picture.
B003PJRKJM|5|No problem with install
B00ZS9RWZE|5|as advertised!  trump 2016!
B0084UJMRK|3|It is ok if you don't move the seats to load passengers.  But if you don't do that I don't think you would need these.<br />I know it is tough to design a product like this but this information should be disclosed.  I was not happy to find out that the second row seats would mess up the mat every time I loaded third row passengers.😤
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|A jump starter is one product that every car must have handy. Its very useful for those rare occasions where your car might fail to start. I faced a lot of issues during winter last year when my car needed to jump start thrice and I had to call the tow company and wait for 30 mins for them to arrive.<br /><br />This jump starter is great. Its so compact and portable. The size is small and can be easily stored in your car trunk in one corner. The device works great. You just need to keep the steps in mind of how to use this.<br />You must connect the  clamps to the car's battery terminals in the format that red is attached to red and black to black. then plug the other end of the clamp cable into the batter pack. Turn on the power and start the car. Once the car has started you can turn off the power and detach and you are good to go.<br /><br />This is one great product in a small size. Totally recommended.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.
B00HS0H6W0|1|I disliked it
B00BITIMIO|5|Very happy with this product.  Shipped quickly with protective packaging.  Great replacement part.
B0035RZ280|5|This scanner works. The quality is within and it shows. It was not that expensive but it get the job done. It not always the p[rice or the size as long as it works.
B008C9JMLY|1|Really, $60 for a $15 manifold?????
B00A4NCB5K|5|did the job
B005VWYZKI|5|Great replacement for 07 accord drivers side actuator. New one is quieter then the old one. Take your time and you can do it by yourself. At least one will go bad in the life of your gen 7 accord or tsx
B00196NGO6|4|Good
B00F9LPJ8S|5|works
B000VL3S0C|1|O2 sensor fitting is rotated about 30 degrees toward oil pan, making it impossible to install O2 sensor without deforming the oil pan. Why? No good reason except lousy quality control. Returned for refund.
B01291FVAQ|5|Was looking for a high quality 3 inch gasket for my exhaust. I bought this and was really surprised at the quality of the gasket. It fit perfectly and really helped my exhaust leak. This is one of the few gaskets that I have seen that is made from multi layers of steel, while most look like paper. This thing is awesome and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality exhaust gasket.
B0022ZFRM2|5|worked great and delivered quickly.
B00180JELC|5|SAME AS MINE
B00NAGO8BS|4|Quality plug but did not work in my scooter. Had to stick with the stock plug.
B00B7MZ3ZM|2|I wish they had scratch coating<br />You need to have really small glasses for these to fit comfortably
B00G8S07FQ|5|I always see the Subarus around town with the COEXIST sticker on them and it makes my PUKE, so here is one that I can put on my Subaru.
B00P1N8QU2|5|I got these for cheap work out sweat towel and they work great for that. Not too big, not too small just about right for a good treadmill run. Once they were washed we don't get much fuzzys and they are soft enough for clearing sweat from your face. Have held up to multiple washing with no sign of seams coming loose or anything like that. Works for us!
B011P10EQW|5|SKUR carbon fiber products are the best out there. Hands down. I would recommend them to anybody looking for triple tree/ gauge covers.
B000CIPAWS|5|Real nice set up to go with the longtube headers !!
B00CPYFOW8|5|I have a 2008 Ford Focus SE, and the mechanism inside the driver's side door handle was broken. The Dorman replacement handle was a bit too difficult to install myself, but a local body shop did it for a reasonable price. The handle itself seems sturdy, and I can now open my door without going through the passenger side! Overall I'm very pleased with this product, and I would recommend it to any owner of the same car model as my own.
B000N37FIY|5|works great and vey pleased with purchase!!!
B00CHI8ACI|4|Good quality. Easy to replace your old won out key.
B00D9FSN8E|5|Fits, easy to install. Give it a couple of days for it  to smooth out.
B00NS283CE|4|Tried these out on my 2011 KLR650 for my (75 mile) ride this morning.  Really limits the low frequency &#34;drumming&#34; wind noise.<br />Not completely gone, but reduced a lot.<br />One major complaint...  Removing them is almost impossible unless you have fingernails like a hi-fashion model, or a pair of tweezers.<br />I have to find a more efficient method of removing them.
B000F5JM0O|5|Very good tool must have one
B00BWEDS4I|2|I ordered a total of 4. Only one dodnt break during installation...feel apart just by a simple push when putting them in! Don't buy this junk!
B001T6JL86|5|Great product. As described
B00LI1LK90|5|Fits my Honda Civic 2012. Didn't have to cut anything
B00KXHGTAK|5|Loved it fit perfectly. Great product
B002I03ZIE|5|Fits as expected. Be sure you don't have it upside down, yes there's a certain way it sits so it's flush in the grille.
B00804HWOU|5|Save time and does a good Job.
B009S7ID0U|5|Nice product installed easy
B00LFL7RJ0|1|I was upset the part didn't fit but I was told it would
B0073X3R5M|5|We have a 2014 Chevy Traverse. The antenna had somehow got broken, whether at a car wash or? When I saw this at Amazon, I read the reviews and liked what I read. For one it is shorter and doesn't stick up as far and I liked that. Plus it said it would not break going through a car wash. I get good reception and actually I like the looks of it better than the one that came out on the car
B00B2FWJZ6|4|It's a little thick but fits okay. Color was exactly what you see online
B00829L1ZE|3|The quality of the arm rest is good but this is definitely not for an A3. It is too long for the arm rest and hangs over the cup holder. By all means it would be great if I had an A4, but the description needs to be changed because it doesn't match.
B00M3NEBMK|2|I gave this two stars simply because it did not live up to the sun protection I was hoping to get from it. I  work out in the water and need to be covered and protected from the sun, so I bought this in the hopes it would do the trick. Unfortunately, I was left with a mild sunburn the first time I used it and I even used sunblock under it and wore a wide brimmed hat for added protection.  I think its main problem is it is porous, so when I stretch it over my head I was left with little holes all over, letting in the sun. I had high hopes for this product. I think it is a fine product otherwise and would probably work well for others who are not in the water. I will try again to find something else, maybe a cotton one would work better for my needs.
B0083LHN7Q|3|Loved the color and everything about it.  BUT when it arrived and we opened the box, carefully laid it out,  we see that it already had 6 snags that were completely loose from the weave.  We planned a trip across the US in late September in our new rv with this mat.  But  sadly we feel the mat won't hold up with any use due to the snags.  Anything on or close to the snags may cause more damage.  We're taking it and keeping our fingers crossed.
B00L3ZZYSY|1|The ballasts already quit workin I've had them in 8 days
B00J65IHT6|5|Good
B00OZNAVJ8|1|These did not fit our speakers as we were told need to return them
B00L3FL690|5|Surprised at how tough this little thing is
B00J14F8TO|5|Love it !!!!
B00MHJUM1Y|5|This sets off my steering wheel making it look good. I had no problem getting it around the steering wheel. Fit snug as I love it. Good price, Good quality.

B004BH76V4|5|Excellent product.  Fits perfectly.
B003YMTJ9O|5|great product fits jeep xj 98. PERFECT and great fit.
B00LHB08C6|5|worth for money and its simply superb.
B0000WZLPM|3|I wanted to give this a higher rating, but for now, this is all I can give. I'm a little disappointed with the fit. Tho it says it fits my truck, it will only work if pressed against the bed rails, and not the actual inside of the bed. There aren't really any instructions, or even a one-pager with a decent picture. The only picture is on the cardboard around it, but it doesn't show the sides, so it wasn't much help. Also, there are some feet in a bag that seemed easy enough to figure out, but again, a little picture would have gone a long way. The other thing I noticed, is that since there isn't any tension on the bottom of the gate, it can easily pivot on the top bar, and get crooked. The rubber 'feet' don't seem to do much to stop it from sliding at the bottom. I'll try it for a bit, but will continue to look for something better, and maybe return this one.
B004AI9SZG|5|Exactly fit for my car. Thanks a lot!
B00GS2CZG6|5|First off, I ordered the wrong size cover for my Ford F-350 duel lay, which came surprisingly quickly. Once I realized it was the wrong one, EmpireCovers replaced it, no questions asked. Again, I was amazed at how fast they turned the order around and I received my new, correct cover. The cover fits great, and seems like a very high quality cover. Overall experience was great.
B004K684DA|3|I can tell no difference what so ever!
B001LQMXNO|5|Great
B00FOX5HKG|5|Working good so far
B00HZBE44A|2|I love this when I first applied it to my vehicle. Unfortunately, I have discovered that in the warmer summer weather, the paint on the decal is running and it is a huge mess on my window. I will have to remove, so am not happy. Looked great, but in the end, not so much.
B00AN6KHOK|3|It does what it's suppose too. Nothing fancy. Didn't help the ride of my Jeep at all.
B004HII1G6|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B003TY4HQ2|5|Use this as my main lanyard.
B0010GG7YG|4|Once this old man got the cover off, it was easy to remove and easier to install.  Working good.  Thanks
B00ODFO9HI|5|This product is insanely overbuilt ! I love it !Much better than I expected !
B00Y2CJ5CQ|5|Good
B00LATB2IE|1|Both bulbs began flickering after only 4 months of very little use.  Most of the LED's went dark.  The remaining ones flickered.  Probably no more than 50 hours total.  I wouldn't recommend these at all.
B000E4AFM0|5|Super fast delivery and easy to install.
B000BYB2XE|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 Altima. Same or better quality than OEM  part. Bosch is a well known brand.
B00BTGSIA8|4|Great product !!
B005FUU7EY|5|Awesome LEDs, really gives the car a nice modern look, however keep in mind the visor mirror lights are not included.
B000ALJ4MY|1|It was not the correct product
B00008RW9U|5|LOVE this duster!! We live down a dirty gravel road.  NO matter how slow I go, my black 2015 Mustang gets dusty as soon as I use the driveway.  A client told me about this duster and I would of paid $100.00 for it.  Leaves NO scratches and I love it.  I just dust my car off nightly and I can go 1 to 2 weeks before washing (without rain).  Make sure to leave face down on newspaper like the directions state and you will not get any wax smears!  Awesome duster
B008DL2D1W|5|Simple plug and play on Acura mdx, 2003.<br />Changed high and low beams as well
B000YQQZCW|1|This is the second one of these I have purchased. The first one lasted for several years, then failed. The second one was bad right out of the box, which I didn't open until the return period had expired. Oh well.
B00B42VYQC|3|Theybwork, but they hey don't fit very  well.
B002GOEHN4|5|It's a no brainer. Works exactly as advertised. Simple to install. Has endured all the abuse we've put it through without a hiccup. Just make sure you order the correct one for your vehicle and you're good to go.
B001IH8Q0A|5|Fit perfectly.
B001NYYSLY|1|Horribly loud. Don't cheap out on this you will regret it; go with a full size fantastic fan instead.
B00BAZCFOS|5|Fits my lexus factory holder, it was hard to pop out the pin but that's just lexus.. Good color also more blue then the factory but good enough for me. Buy it!!
B004GZL0Q8|5|Easy directions and product was nicely built shipping was quick
B0016HPX4O|3|worked okay
B001DCL3FA|5|Went on easy, working great =) Happy to have a hood that doesn't shut on me.<br /><br />Used on a 2006 Chrysler 300 3.5l v6, all you need is something to prop up the hood and a flat head screwdriver.
B005GK23SQ|3|The first try getting ultra classic was bad, the wheels moved to right and the ride tipped over.....was not expecting the wheels to roll.  The dolly itself is fine with the exxceotion of the lifts at each end.  Have not solved the problem yet
B00F66X8YS|5|good price quality oem part
B00UL3DYNQ|5|Fast delivery well packaged nice looking product, good price.
B001C6LG3Q|2|The high pressure gage lost pressure when I disconnected it from the line. FJC said it was normal. turns out it had a leak at QD fitting and it cause me to loose R134 a . Also no instructions how to use the yellow hose it has a schrader valve in it and the manifold does also. FJC said it does not matter how you connect. Turns out it does matter . With gage valves closed R134a vented out the yellow hose after charging.
B005IZ4B1G|5|Perfect
B0084DYYIO|5|Excellent product
B000B8GAPK|5|I bought this locking cap for my Nissan Frontier truck after the leash to the OEM cap broke and I decided I wanted to secure the cap because there's no latch on my fuel door. If this cap also had a leash or another way to secure it while filling the tank it would be even better, but when I leave my keys in the cap while filling, I'm not going to forget it when I drive off.<br /><br />UPDATE after several years of use: The keyhole is a bit &#34;fiddly&#34; so sometimes I have trouble getting the key to insert. It has never failed to operate once I get the key in, however. I'm tempted to lower the number of stars a tiny amount, but I think for the price it's still quite good. I'm sure the lock isn't exactly &#34;high security,&#34; but I've never tried to pick it or force it so I can't tell you from direct experience. If you want a better lock, look for a more expensive cap. But this one so far has worked as well as I could expect for the price I paid so I'm keeping the 5 star rating.
B00PBODJ44|4|good
B00FOWSPPG|5|Perfect
B00JIEX722|5|These lights are top notch! I get asked all the time what kind of LEDs I have because they've &#34;never seen any so bright.&#34;
B00684TAYY|5|It works so wonderfully well that I am going to buy another one.  You have to read and comprehend the instructions, and also get over the shock that your car has a Konami code.<br /><br />Tastes great, less filling.
B005G50QWQ|5|Bolted right on with the supplied hardware on my 2000 honda shadow ACE. 1/2 the price pf competitors & looks great.
B00YE5Q132|5|NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and requested that I write a review.<br /><br />As far back as I can remember, I've always carried a set of jumper cables in every car I've had. And on those rare occasions when I needed to use them, I've inevitably sat there for several minutes trying to maneuver the two vehicles close enough to each other to use the cables and several more minutes trying to figure out how to hook them up. That's not counting the time it took to find someone willing to give me a jump, assuming that my car was in a position where the other car could reach it. So, when the seller asked me to try out the DBPOWER DJS20 Jump Starter, it didn't take much convincing. Now that I've tried them, I'm just sorry they weren't around 30 years ago.<br /><br />The DJS20 is billed as a jump starter, but in reality, it's a very versatile emergency device that can recharge lots of other types of batteries. The unit itself is about 6.5\\" x 3\\" x 1.25\\" and weighs about a pound. The unit and all the accessories can be stored in the supplied zippered fabric case (which has a foam depression for the charger to sit securely in). The case measures about 9\\" x 5\\" x 4\\" and weighs, with the unit and all the accessories, less than two pounds. The case can easily fit in a car trunk or back seat, or possibly in the glove compartment.<br /><br />The unit comes with all the accessories needed. It has a 110 wall socket input and a car cigarette lighter input to charge it. According to the instructions, it should take about four hourse to charge, but my unit seemed pretty much fully charged out of the box (and I doubt most people would want to let it run down). The jumper cables themselves come attached as a pair and are short, less than a foot long each, and color coded and labeled red (+) and black (-). Because the unit is so small and lightweight though, it's easy to place the jump starter right next to the battery. The jumper cable plugins are differently shaped so it is impossible to plug them into the jump starter unit the \\"wrong\\" way. Jump starting the car takes less than a minute from the time you open the hood.<br /><br />I have to admit here that I didn't actually charge a car battery using the jump starter because I wasn't about to let my battery drain just to test this or wait months or even years until I actually needed it. But, based on the way it charged other equipment (see below), I feel reasonably confident. And what really impressed me was the fact that the DBPOWER Jump Starter is an extremely versatile device that does a lot more than just jump start a car battery. The unit also has a USB-mini USB cable that successfully recharged my Amazon Kindle and a phone adapter with eight different size plugs to charge cell phones, laptops and similar devices. I successfully charged a laptop using this charger as well.<br /><br />The unit has an on-off switch on the front to conserve power and a power button that serves as a control switch. This button turns on an LED flashlight on the front of the unit. It's small, about 1/2\\" in diameter, but it provided enough light to allow me to distinguish objects in the dark at least 15 feet away. The flashlight can also function as a strobe light, depending on how you push the control button. In addition, on the top of the unit is an alternating red and blue emergency flare light that runs nearly the entire length of the unit. The control button also turns the flare light on and off. The jump starter unit also has a power indicator that shows how much power is left (the manufacturer recommends not trying to jump a car battery if there's less than half power left). I intend to make sure the unit stays fully charged as much as possible.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the versatility and the number of features and accessories the DBPOWER jump starter has. In addition to allowing you to jump start a car anywhere at any time, it can recharge various electronic devices in the event of a power failure or on camping trips or similar outings in which there are no power supplies. The unit itself seems fairly ruggedly built, and if it's stored inside the carrying case, it should stand up to dropping it or hitting against something.  The seller has two models available, the 12000mAh model I tested and a more powerful (and more expensive) 16500mAh model. However, based on the specifications inside the carrying case, the lower end model should easily charge all but the largest eight cylinder vehicles.<br /><br />Like fire extinguishers, life jackets, and other safety equipment, the DBPOWER Jump Starter is something that most people hope they'll never have to use. However, especially now that I and especially my wife are getting older, I feel a lot better going out at night or on the road knowing this in the car if we'll ever need it.ng trips or similar outings in which there are no power supplies.

B00979NOWQ|3|the gloves are okay, but a little to long for me on the risk area.
B006G14FK8|5|I used this on a Walmart battery that was already on a used ZTR mower I bought few years ago. Previously the battery would only hold a charge for a couple of weeks and then I had to use my old school charger on it. Every 2 weeks or so I had to recharge the dang thing. I had it tested at a local car parts place and there were no bad/dead cells etc. Now, after having this beauty do it's full-monty of test, desulfate and regenerate, I have yet to have to recharge the battery and it's been 3 months now!<br /> I LOVE it!
B00TPI88YS|5|Every thing was great
B00NRLDATC|5|Awesome upgrade
B001810SHA|1|I bought this in hopes that at best it would fix my daughters A/C in her car, but if not then at least help me find the problem.  Unfortunately it did neither.  Normally I would just dismiss this as a fact that my daughter has an old car that is for a teenager and some things can't be fixed with something as easy as this and move on.  I would OK with her driving with the windows down as the temperature sored to 105 degrees because that's what I had to do as a teenager.  However my wife insisted that I try one more route.  So I picked up a sealer from A/C Pro.  The difference is night and day.  Now I understand why this product did not work.  First of all the hose is much to small.  There is no way to follow the directions exactly because there isn't an engine out there that will allow you to put the container down inside the engine and turn it back and forth.  (while it is running.)  Just not enough room.  It needs a longer hose.  Next, I didn't realize the gauge was not working at all.  Again, I thought is was the junky car.  And last, the only way to get any fluid to come out was to tip it upside down, which is probably why it worked for one night and the next day the air was once again hot coming out.  I really did think it was all because of an aged old teenage car, but the product I tried 2 weeks ago with a longer hose and a gauge that works is still blowing wonderful cold air.
B00G4Q6U4O|4|Fit for 2006 Ford Escape 2.3L I4 XLS Philippines i bought 2 of this for me and my sis' too despite noticing the product dimensions (measurements) being so misleading received as expected and in very good condition
B001EP0GQS|2|So okay
B000NVW1LM|5|Great stuff works first time around
B00LNM831W|5|They arrive two days afther I order and they fit perfect
B004ME11FS|5|AAAAA+++++
B00IFPA4AI|5|Thanks, very good seller. Fast shipping.<br />Yesterday install it, it take 5 min.<br />Pair phone, add address book, work very good.
B002MOAWL4|4|Great product!
B01196JAI6|5|This was a gift for my moms car , although it just sits in her trunk not being used I think it`s super cute and HANDY ! It beats used plastic grocery bags on the backseat floor .
B004I14HMO|4|Fits, but different style from the original headlight for our 2006 trailblazer.  Worked to get it inspected so I guess that is all that counts!
B001RPRTNI|5|work real good!!!
B00684TAYY|5|great remotes and fast delivery
B000F259UO|3|Good overall constructions, and nice feel.  Could be a little stiffer.<br /><br />The description stated that there would be grommets to secure the mat if they were OEM.  My car had the OEM grommets, and they were not included, which means the driver's mat slides when I get in an out of the car.  It's a bit irritating to have to reposition it regularly.  I
B00HG76A9A|5|Thank you! Great product
B00CR1RGIO|3|This product appears to be very high quality.  The problem is this, and they seller warns of it, if you are not experienced in applying vinyl you will not be able to install this properly.  It is hard to do.  Best to have a professional do it or you'll be throwing it away.
B000W0KTKY|5|Works great
B00IP7C328|4|ok
B010BWQNJS|4|We love the headlight but Oleep that sells this headlight is not honest about the fit. I emailed and ask if it would fit and he assured me it would and did not mention any additional parts.  We also had to purchase a mounting ring $50+ to make this headlight fit in a 2012 Harley Davidson Street Glide.
B0009TPWZK|1|These will not work with the standard 2.25 inch RV legs.  The ad should state this!  I guess they want to sell their legs which are almost 3 times the amount of most other RV legs.
B004V5YR68|2|This seems to be made of mostly plastic so I don't think I will be using it.
B00P92THOE|5|works good
B00513G82U|3|Fit and finish is good,but is kinda flimsy plastic,and NONE of the hardware was right, I used 1 or 2 bolts it came with and the bracket are pretty cheap too. The back rest sits a lot lower than the sissy bar back rest did, so I put a block of wood between the luggage rack and trunk to bring it up higher for my girl to be comfortable. Also the key doesn't fit lock well, but it works.
B00898LAJ0|5|excellent and works just fine
B002XLBMZQ|5|This hitch is great. Fantastic finish, solid construction and ease of adjustability. Used the Trimax aluminum adapter for a 2.5 hitch and together they worked out great.
B00O53PARG|5|Fast service, inexpensive, and high quality parts.
B00MG07R80|5|Great quality and great look. Love it!
B00CTTUU6Y|5|Works well
B00THRMSCA|4|Is good
B009LNK34A|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Perfect fit for my 1997 SeaDoo three seater.
B00G533S5U|5|the right part on time,good job
B007OSL3DY|4|Does not fit on 2015 GMC Sierra
B00FH8P1DG|3|its an ok light bar, not as bright as i expected but ok
B0024NWW9I|5|Arrived earlier than expected and very easy to replace to old yellowed/hazed light covers from 2003.
B002AUE0MC|5|I am happy with the product, they arrived early and are even better than described.  Thank you.
B005C2ASRQ|5|Works well so far. Very sturdy.
B000HBGL14|5|It works fine but took a long time to dry. I think it works best it you apply it to each thread and let it dry before assembly.
B007RVQVBC|5|easy to install. great quality.  be careful when removing old supports / door is very heavy and will slam down quick and hard.
B001445IZ8|4|The tube will not fit an '07-'12 GM 5.3L V8.  The dipstick tube is large enough for the suction tube to fit but turns sharply at the bottom of the engine block that the suction tube cannot accommodate.  I tried many times to make the turn but it just wouldn't.  Other than that particular fitment issue, the vacuum worked as advertised and assembly was easy and fast.<br /><br />Make sure the dipstick tube is at least 3/8&#34; inside diameter and there are no sharp turns, be wary of exceedingly long dipsticks.
B0083W18IU|5|Works great.
B002WRRNFO|5|Bought this for a trip to Mexico because we read reviews of hotels where stuff was stolen out of the hotel safe. This personal safe did the job perfect. We were able to fit 2 smart phones ( Samsung Galaxy S5 & Note 4) and 2 wallets in it, so perfect size, it also fit nicely in the hotel safe. I love the idea of the cable as an alternative to putting it in the safe, but we didn't use that. Definitely gave us a better sense of security that our money and electronics were safe when we went out. It's a good size and not too heavy, but strong and sturdy. I'll never travel again without this personal vault.
B006P2FOJ4|1|Not at all fog lights for 2001 x5
B000EPZJRK|5|Perfect replacement for my 04 Colorado's 2.8 engine. It engages at the correct temperature and does it's job. These are getting harder to find they only are used on the 04-06 Colorado after that they had a design change. I work in auto parts and could not find one in stock at any of the 10 warehouse's I have access to. If your fan clutch is failing this is a high quality Hayden unit and you most likely wont find one this inexpensive any where.
B005MWZR1S|3|Cloths are of decent quality. They're fairly absorbent, don't leave behind lint, and so far have not deteriorated when going through the wash. Unfortunately, the ones I bought in August 2015 were made in China.
B008Y3O44S|5|I  really like the starter iT is a good starter
B00SLYYJKY|5|Fit my Chevy Malibu very well;. I love the metal rings and the different levels you can put them on so they can fit tightly. I would buy these again.
B005IJIYOM|5|very nice fit great
B00HZB82G6|3|You could see the printed lines.
B00VA1F1TS|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Well made. easy to set up, and store.  Great that it comes with the hard case.  Will be in my pick up truck when towing my travel trailer.
B000AM4ZOU|5|Excellent
B008VLVDII|2|I bought this cover because I have a toddler and she is in a car seat and keep in mind you cannot you seatbelts with this cover! The quality of the cover itself seems to be good but since you can't use seatbelts this is useless to me and I have to return it. You may somehow be able to figure out how to use the side seat belts, but you absolutely cannot use the middle seat belt and that is where I have my daughter's car seat.
B007P72SRE|4|Seems to be working fine, my mechanic said it did not include a tensioner.
B0049E8XVG|1|Came in broken
B0083A5CGQ|2|To dim I returned item.
B001HZKRGE|3|not heavy duty enough for me.
B005EOMPFK|5|Was exactly what I wanted, looks good works well.
B004ZF3A94|4|Really bright, well recommended
B00EDSTV00|4|Not bad for the price. It fits well and definitely keeps my tush cooler in this AZ heat :-). It could be a bit bigger (don't read anything into that).
B00J2G5H06|5|My granddaughter loved it
B00SZ5Y57Q|5|where would we be without River...
B000BQR100|5|I love these! I got the kind thats two pieces because I thought it would be easier to store, and it definitely it. You can twist or curl it up into any shape and it will always bounce right back.<br />The only thing is, in that picture there is no rearview mirror stuck to the windshield, so the shades cover it completely. My car (prius) has that mirror protruding in the middle, so coverage is never FULLY complete, but its enough to make me satisfied with the purchase.<br />And the car definitely stays cooler with these shades on!
B00KAT2WDE|5|Looks really nice in the car.
B004BTOP3E|5|works great<br /><br />twist the old one off, disconnect the plug, twist the new one on, connect the plug, no tools needed (maybe a flat head screw driver for helping to remove the plug)<br /><br />this went on a 2001 jeep wrangler
B00LHUI4XM|5|Easy to install, looks very classy, and great customer service!
B00062YUXU|4|really good
B004IX5YDS|5|fast shipping, exactly what you describe (just might want to let someone know that they need to buy the bolt kit separately).
B00WO1P4N6|4|For the price.. it's perfect!!
B00HFAHYDY|5|Great stickers! Wide variety and high quality!
B0023VOYAG|1|Not happy . Not good fit. Didn't plug right in. Had to have mechanic mess with wiring to fit it.
B00480J4I2|5|excellent fit n work great
B00BFDHZCM|4|fit perfectly, works well. Honda door issues a PAIN in the rear. Shame on Honda for not standing behind their products.<br />This is a nightmare to get too, but it did fit and is working now.
B00DCJ6MJO|4|starter works good, easy install
B00K889FCI|1|didn't really clean my headlight and after two washes the little difference i had noticed had faded away
B000PSMVTA|5|Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
B00BR3YY4C|4|Like
B006N9FE26|5|looks good, we will see the quality during this time
B007TD1WIK|4|takes awhile but they work decently - okay purchase
B009B15XJW|3|as expensive as they are one would expect the back mats to snap in the manufacturer's snaps
B007RVQUZE|5|Fast shipping, good price, accurate part, easy assembly!
B00192JG9O|4|For the price, this is a good pole.. You won;t have the tallest one out there, and you will have to take the flag down when the wind picks up, but for the cost, you get a solid easy to use set up. I put the foot mount beneath the trailer tongue jack.
B00ALLUJ7W|5|Great after summer tennis. Fits perfectly on my Lexus 350 SUV front seats and does a great job of absorbing sweat.
B00CWKMAZO|5|These seat covers fit exactly as stated! They are beautiful to look at and so comfortable for a long ride.
B000C9TD66|5|great product, worked well
B0041TOPY8|5|Perfect fit for my 2007 Taurus. I just watched a youtube video and installed it myself! No problemo!
B000AMW0LK|5|Correct size, quality, and fit perfectly.
B00MKBAQTC|5|Very well made and good quality.  Am happy with boots.
B008SEBQ2G|5|Works perfectly. Make car washes so much easier. Apply blue Loctite to ensure it stays tight and makes it harder to steal.
B005BNP7YU|5|A gift that keeps on giving.
B00076FM0U|5|I like the helment very much. Great  price. Shipping was on time, al couple days early.
B001G4ALBW|5|Fit with no issues on my brother's wife's H3, OEM is the way to go.
B004A6PLZ4|5|It's working great. So glad I bought this filter and installed it myself rather than pay the dealer $100 to do a 5 minute job.
B00CFPGTQW|4|Nothing special here, does exactly what they need to at a cheap price.
B00B5PIQLE|2|Does not fit my 2000 Honda Accord. There is simply not enough room in the brake assembly to install these devices.
B0056OFWVM|5|Fantastic and no fumbling. Wish I had know about these a long time ago. Highly recommend.
B002MNQZBQ|4|cool very cool
B004ZF4NOK|5|Product was what I was hoping for. The color wad spot on!
B00B1PNIO8|5|Perfect fit for my Mini Cooper sport
B00HM9V9TI|5|Good roduct
B0006H9346|5|perfit fit
B0006307WW|4|So far no real improvement in gas mileage.  Little more responsive on the throttle.
B000FW7V50|5|MY gas mileage went from 12 MPG to 17 MPG after about 3 tanks.
B0084L0YR6|5|Worked perfectly
B00BFDFP60|5|Perfect fit
B0024E6W02|4|Good value. worked well
B0023VBRLU|5|Good
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I love my purse pouch, so do my sister and mom!  It holds my variety of purses, most of the time I just lay my purse onto the netting and use the pouch for smaller items like travel Kleenex and my phone charger.  I have a few more to buy for this upcoming Christmas season!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Works well. Exactly what I wanted and much needed where I live.
B003ZJQ56Q|1|As stated by others, the metal is thin compared to OEM. Lost after only 3 weeks !
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Ordered these for my new Mazda Cx-5. They were a snug fit in the socket and it is quite difficult to securely tighten them in because there is no point of leverage. Halogen bulbs have the right-angle plug that will almost always face down when twisted in. WIth these bulbs, and most other kits, you have to fiddle it in there and try to twist until you feel its secured. At one point I thought I might break the head of the bulb, but just then it clicked in. After about 3 weeks I had a flicker issue with one balast. Some times it would not ignite and I would have to try again, and on some other occasions it would flicker and flash then go out when driving. I actually was pulled over because it had gone out. Stepped out with the officer and gave it a jiggle and back on it came. Cables were all secure. Emailed customer service and they sent a new balast in 2 days no questions. Its been working 100% ever since. Lamps are bright and work perfect in my mazda.
B00L4FP2Q2|5|I've used it all and this is the best. A little goes a long way. Works on tires and plastics.
B000KEZ3AS|5|Worried that my refrigerant detector may be losing accuracy, I tried a new tip. Not sure if it made any difference, but it seems to work ok.
B00PTR3PVU|5|First, Great customer service.  I ordered this shade but didn't receive it.  They reshipped it and it works great.  I have no air conditioning in my car so I use the shade across the rear window on the 90 and 100 degree days with a front window shade.  Before I had to wait with the doors of the car open to cool down enough inside so that I could drive without worrying about getting burns from the seat.  now I can just retract the shade and drive away
B00318JTCS|5|I bought to sets and the looks badass on my Subaru Crosstrek
B00B5X68NY|3|fits somewhat tight
B009FREAGO|4|Great trash bag but can be a little difficult to open.
B0007LZXEK|5|I like these better than the &#34;pin through the middle&#34; types.  Works as expected.
B000182F0Y|4|good quality, just remember you only have one chance to get them on right. the adhesive will not let go after it touches paint. good product just be careful when installing
B012HZKEYW|4|UPDATE:<br />I left my motorcycle outside overnight during a rainstorm.  I came back to my bike in the morning and noticed that the clock is not water resistant and was full of water.  Furthermore, the hands on the clock rusted and stopped moving.  This is sad because I really liked this clock.  Note: the angle that my clock was mounted might have something to do with it.  I mounted the clock at about a 15 degree angle (almost horizontal).  Meanwhile, I mounted the thermometer at about a 65 degree angle (more vertical).  I guess the rain was more easily able to run off the surface of the thermometer and thus not penetrate it, because the thermometer did not get damaged in the rain.<br />See photo of damaged clock attached.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Quality product at a great price! To fit a 7/8 inch handlebar, they include a rubber insert that rests under the mount.  For a 1 inch handlebar, you simply discard that rubber insert.  Also you might need to force it onto the 1 inch handlebar because its a tight fit.  The mount also comes with a screw to make it extra secure, but it fits so snug on the handlebar that you really don't need to use the screw. The gauges purposefully separate from the mounts so that you can rotate them as desired, and you can change the clock battery in the future.  The clock comes with a battery inside already. The gauges have clear rubber bands around them so that they fit snugly into the mount and stay there.  You just have to forcefully press the gauge into the mount at the desired rotation.  It fits nicely.  It fits so snugly that to remove the gauge again, I had to gently wedge a flat head screw driver in there to pop it out again.  To set the time on the clock, temporarily remove the rubber band from the perimeter of the clock and remove the shipping plastic tab that is behind the clock dial.  Just turn the dial to the correct time, then push the dial in and the clock will start ticking.  Also the clock glows in the dark!<br />It was quick delivery considering it's coming from China.  Only took 8 days to get to me in California.  Product was very well packaged.ing it's coming from China.  Only took 8 days to get to me in California.  Product was very well packaged.
B001F85OUM|5|Exactly what I wanted, easy to install and works great.  Helps keep the tailgaters off you tail..........
B005SB6S3Y|4|Works just fine and is cheap. What else do you want? I didn't install the anti-sway, so I can;t speak for that. The only pain is getting the arms in and out, but that has been the case for all the cheap hitches I have used. You just have to remember to pound furiously until it snaps into place.
B00VAU2W5K|4|Not the best quality but it does the job.
B008BQR1IY|5|Fit my 95 civic hatchback with some slight modifications to the side panel but fit like a glove.
B00MB0DU5O|3|already starting to frey
B00HSTIZQW|5|Says it all.
B00996DXAU|5|This belt is awesome!
B007SPLVDK|5|Well machined, looks amazing and performance is definitely noticeable.  If you're running higher boost than stock and get a &#34;sticking&#34;  feeling, contact Accufab and they'll get you straight.
B00D8LA0SK|5|great sturdy product, looks great, built tough.
B0006IX7V0|5|they were perfect
B00BYWXMSA|4|Runs better and fuel economy is better !!!
B00GUA0CU2|5|This fit my 2000 Oldsmobile Alero just fine.
B004WO9S5I|5|Best shocks I've used
B00NEL6HK4|5|I had so many questions nervous to order. We own a 2014 coupe and sedan. We tried on both. First off something K&N Clearly avoided answering for me via email was does this flow higher than stock cabin filters similarly to your engine air filters. What they refused to answer and I will answer for you is YES!!! Air is stronger which is great for me I really wanted that. Second this leads me to believe the ac compressor wont have to work as hard another plus. Next Fitment I have no idea why BUT IN MY COUPE SLID RIGHT IN NO PROBLEMS WITH SEDAN WE HAD TO WIGGLE FIDDLE AND FIGHT TO GET IT INSIDE AND THE DOOR WAS HARD TO CLIP BACK ON ITS ON BUT WITH FORCE.Inside the box comes with filter pre oiled and sealed in plastic wrap, two stickers one for warning and other just company logo and instructions. The instructions say you might have to bend clips more I can tell you with certainty you will not have to adjust or modify anything FOR THE COUPE. To me this is a no brainier for anyone why spend $13-20 every 6 months when this will last the life of your car for a one time fee of $38-$40. Trust me a stranger this is no reason not to get this it fits IN COUPE AND SEDAN(SEDAN WITH WORK) its extremely to use it comes with instructions and it saves you money and remember it makes your air stronger. SERIOUSLY BUY THIS TODAY YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I PROMISE. YOU CAN USE FOR COUPE OR SEDAN MY GUESS IS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR CAR WAS MADE MAYBE THE FITMENT WILL BE SLIGHTLY OFF DEPENDING ON WHAT PARTS HONDA USED TO BUILD CAR BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AND I STILL BELIEVE ITS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!!
B00J52R3AE|4|Only used is one time to date. Worked fine. Only problem I had. I didn't know the dish receiver (new) that it had to be programmed to the GM2000. Now that I have done that, I should not have to do that again as I am using that receiver only with the GM 2000.
B0002L77SA|5|fits perfect, keeps the car dramatically cooler than without sunshade. Must buy for all z owners living in the south!!
B009OBVXDO|2|Wow! I didn't realize this polish came in such a small little bottle. It works well but the price for the size is crazy
B00LL6PK2K|4|Works great.  Seems a bit light-duty for hard use but it seems accurate.
B00E90P1VU|5|Good quality and take a beating I had a accident with my bike and these just had scratches not bent or anything and installing is super easy
B008Y94LUE|5|Factory
B00WH1ZC80|4|Great hooks, the strongest ones I have found yet.
B007TMCD0W|5|Great cover fits perfectly
B000N2XOHQ|4|as advertised
B00W31VMYC|5|Works just as described.  Downloaded the app and started reading and clearing codes on my BMW.  Worth every penny
B005CLN2LG|5|....and fit good, works good and dirt cheap too- what more could you want?
B00KTHY91K|5|Easy to program, works like a dream, saved me a lot of money versus replacement by the dealer.
B00JXS3BXI|5|works flawlessly everytime! the versatile mounting was perfect for my low profile mounting needs. pulls my scout with ease. the remote connector does look a little light duty but I just make sure to plug it in carefully and have had no problems yet.
B00KWK0CCO|1|Not what I expected, just an empty case.
B008CLNYPC|5|sturdy and fit great- the upright braces were just right for license plate mounting on my 4x4
B008Z5E8SW|5|It did exactly what I wanted to do, it sticks perfectly on my car
B00JHWIE5K|5|very good colour nice and bright red
B009V4FKRE|3|Great sounding exhaust for the price! But expect fitment issues, had to swap the inside exhaust bracket. Also the tips do not sit level.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Came fully charged and working perfectly.  Currently using this to run my metal marine 12v aerator and no problems in keeping it running for the while day.
B007KOC1MO|2|I'm not sure what to say.  The product probably works exactly as advertised, but no matter how hard I pressed and how soupy or solid I made the cerium oxide paste I had absolutely no impact on the very mild surface scratches on my windshield.  After an hour of polishing, all manner of calcium deposits were cleared and the glass felt great but the scratches were unaffected.  Probably with a bigger buffer with higher speed and a little more pressure I could have accomplished something, but I am now just hoping for a big rock to fracture the glass so I have a real excuse to replace it.
B003E2WQE4|5|Just went on a 230 mile drive with this hauler. I have a 2000 tacoma prerunner and this was perfect. I hauled a ex500 kawasaki ninja about ~400lbs and it was perfect. I strapped the front and the back down as well as the whole hauler to my bumper to keep it from wobbling. Great price for a great hauler! I should've took more photos but here is one.
B00008RW9U|5|Bought this for my brand new Audi Q3. Had one years ago for one of my first cars. Works great. I have to park my car outside and it gets super dusty. The more you use this duster, the better it works. Highly recommend it.
B000GBBOWQ|5|Perfect replacement for my 2001 QX4<br /><br />Definitely 'stronger' than my old one.
B00T8ZNBTA|5|Nice
B00LDP7AWC|5|Price is right
B0002Q80RW|5|+++++  USE THESE ALL THE TIME FOR VARIOUS CONNECTIONS.  PERFECT FOR MOST JOBS.  VERY GOOD QUALITY.  THANK YOU  +++++
B013EIBC3S|5|I love these stickers! They haven't been affected by rain. I have one on my car. #feelthebern
B000QV2ENO|1|Did not fit my Zephyr, i used the year/make lookup and it dud not match up
B001GAGZR0|5|Fits the Lexus RX350 window perfectly. Keeps most of the heat out of the car. Definitely lowers the temps!
B00CLFZSGS|5|I have only had this sticker for 2 weeks now but I am very happy with it. It looks great, is made very well and is staying where I put it after washing even though only the 4 corners of the sticker are making contact with my bike.  I get compliments everywhere I go.
B0034NKDKC|5|Great, working as expected.
B00O3QB67S|5|Made such a HUGE difference! I have a hatchback and this mirror give me the ability to see the entire back all the way
B006RL090C|5|Great Product
B00UCITKUQ|5|Works fine~
B001DRLPOY|5|Great Product
B001V8RYTA|5|ty
B003G9DD8S|4|easy install and it worked.
B00IDHUQWY|4|I used this to replace the struts on my BMW X3 and BMW 325CiC.  It is sturdy and easy to use.  I had some difficulty getting the struts positioned in so I could place the strut in properly so I gave it four stars.  However it is safe and easy to use.
B00EQMHRO0|3|Parts where acceptable and arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but ended up not needing the rotors. Went to ship them back (at my expense), but cost ...price I paid for them.  I now own rotors that I don't need.  Order carefully as they are expensive to ship!
B004C24L5M|5|Very comprehensive set, storage case works well, ratchet is as expected(other mechanics made fun of it). This kit is a better value than what is available at the parts stores.
B001542MA6|5|Just got what I wanted.
B009PHKPI6|5|I used this to save car memory settings while I change the main battery. Worked like a charm.
B000AA4RWM|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B002ESEMXC|4|Good product. Fits my 95 Yj pedals, take a bit of finagling to get a perfect fit, but they look like stock. Made in China
B004GCPBU2|5|Great
B000E2CVIS|1|This was the second one of these to purchase, so it was the first time I was removing the old one.  That little knob that is basically glued on top is a worthless piece of crap.  The filter itself may be fine but you won't be able to remove it easily like they suggest.  The slightest torque just strips the nut like plastic.  I will not be buying another one of these.
B00029WVJW|3|Didn't know it would be hard to attach.  Should have looked at it more closely.
B0050SFVO2|3|There are better checker out there this one is not the best and is hard to use.
B00JBJJDQ8|5|Michael
B004NTGN8C|5|Good
B001PY0PZK|1|doesnt fit right at all
B00BTSFN54|4|Excellent system.  The volume is great for the phone, but the intercom mode makes for a lower volume.
B003RIRWI0|1|After one year the red color is terribly faded.  For the price it is extremely disappointing.  If the color held up these would be amazing!  Material seems to be high quality neoprene.
B005JU5VUK|5|Found my new preferred wiper.  I will use these on all my vehicles now.
B006K8YQYW|5|Works like the OEM remote
B00FYXF9X6|4|This model is better with BT 3.0 comparing to its predecessor model. Since it has a lot more feature, you will need to read the instruction carefully. Since my helmet has two carved out holes for the speakers, I don't have any problem with the speakers at all.  If your helmet doesn't have these holes, I won't recommend it because both speakers will take up about 3/4 of an inch on the inner sides of the helmet.  Its battery lasted a long time.  I travelled about 10 hours round trip and the battery was still good.  I never got disconnected when riding about 75mph.  The sound is clear, if your phone has hearing impair warning, you need to ignore and increase the volume all the way on your phone.  The volume on this device doesn't control the volume on your phone.  I haven't got a chance to test the intercom, but the phone works great.  Just need to speak up because road noise.  Giving 4 stars because its radio receiver seems to be short in range. Lots of static on stations 103.5, 97.1 when riding on 286 in Chantilly, VA.  The round button is not a good idea.  When bag the helmet, the fabric will push the button and turn the device on.  If this version is a &#34;clone&#34; of Sena intercom, I would say you get a good bargain here.
B00471QLME|5|Very nice quality!
B00CVVUQ50|1|After three days they all change color from silver to gold looks like s***....
B00H208IOQ|5|I love this sticker but, I should have looked closer to the size. A large sticker great for a skateboard.
B001KNYQ9W|5|With a low seat, these is no noise or buffeting. With a standard seat if you are tall, it is 1000x better than stock, but there is some noise.
B000IZ2B0O|5|Great fit for my car. Good price
B010MEMJ8E|2|DID NOT SMELL LIKE BUBBLE GUM
B004QHPA9O|2|As far as lug nuts, these seem like good lug nuts. The blue is a nice shade, but, as stated in other reviews, the paint flakes off so easy. I tried the plastic baggy trick someone mentioned, but the paint still flaked.
B0045V1SHE|5|I was really impressed on the build quality for the price. I would easily buy these over the much more costly other brands. The tricos are now on my list for wipers in the future.
B010JRGYEE|5|They were easy to install, fit perfectly and look great.
B004XX479U|5|Performed the task needed. No problems.
B00388I4H2|5|Fits awesome really good product
B00AY7N0LA|3|Exllent.
B00167TYHQ|4|Functional unit though has no place to store cords so wrapped them around handle.
B00LUS7RKW|5|WAS A PERFECT FIT AND A LOT CHEAPER THAN AT THE GM DEALER !!!
B00U1U642W|5|Sticker says it all
B004I0TH0W|4|Looks great and delivery was ok .Slight timing issue.( Resolved)There were red marker marks all over the light board you plug into, I was concerned that it may have been used . It also could have been a tester part. I wish I new. I would have to say I am very Happy, just a few minor concerns. Installed very easy, works fine. Great value.
B0086ZNFNA|5|This is brilliant.  Takes about 2 days to get used to but you can see so much more.  No more blind spots, I can see out the back passenger window at a glance.  It's stylish as well.  The only downside could be when the front passenger pulls their visor down it will catch on the mirror because of its size - who cares, not me.
B008G2B1KM|5|Looks great.  Bulbs included.  Very satisfied.
B0009IQXCC|5|Excellent product. Works as advertised. Delivery was drama free. Restored the fine lines of my dash. Works well.
B00R244KYY|1|It a different color completely than what the picture shows.
B00267PZUK|5|This tool is a life saver.  Thanks to Lisle and thanks to the seller for offering this great price.
B0087LCQUQ|4|Great but wish it was a little longer since our beach tent does not fit in it
B00KVH7LI6|5|Came within 3 days of ordering and is a good quality keychain,
B000C2SBM0|5|Gates hose was super high quality and it fit like OEM.  I tried the Dayco hose for upper position on 2.2 liter engine but Dayco was not shaped correctly and would have had to have been 'forced' into position.  In contrast, this Gates hose fit just right!!!
B008216AGC|5|Works great for my BMW g650 gs 2014!
B007ZDFEG0|3|had this type of tire cap in the past when kids were stealing the reg. ones.  had the same prob recently again.  except now somebody stole one of these anti theft ones now!!!  I guess there ok,  maybe somebody has the tool to get em off.
B005GN1TPG|5|These plugs work good.  Happy with the power and performance.
B002P8D5E8|5|Works perfectly! Arrived on time and in flawless condition. Thank you.
B00Q3CKT4G|5|Got this set for my 1999 Jeep Cherokee.  It's slightly baggy, but I understand that it's meant to be universal, so of course its not tailored exact to my vehicle.  Otherwise, perfect.  Looks awesome, feels smooth.  The seatbelts in the backseat aren't affected.  The dragon is a good size and very bright.  I'm happy with this product.  The owner before me was a smoker, my seats are covered in holes!  These seat covers help bring youth and life back to my jeep :)
B00U5UBREI|4|I used to isolate the power cable on my winch from a possible short when not in use. works great and is sturdy.
B000OUXUI0|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B00GG4OA3W|1|I received it and it was only 23in
B004A6NB1U|1|Part was listed to Fit my Elantra and it is far from the correct part.
B00JR6LPFW|1|Did not meet my expectations, the photo shows wires and what I received did not have wires so I could not use it.
B00OP45PL6|5|Perfect sticker, love how it's on a background of white and not clear so you can see the letters better!
B00X43E02Y|5|Great filters for an even greater price, works well in applications as required
B000C9WK20|5|I buy these every year and they work wonderfully
B00BLI46QE|4|Delightful
B008KPYDD2|5|Good quality material, great fit on my 2012 Polaris Ranger 500 EFI. The two tie-down straps are use full.
B00PUR0II2|5|Good very good
B005JU5ZKG|1|did not fit into the bracket of my model year 2012 audi q5
B009PQGQ62|5|nice
B0071HE2SQ|5|Hands down best intercom / Bluetooth headset for the money. Instillation and updating firmware is super easy. As soon as you get the speakers positioned correctly it is more than loud enough when cruising at 75+ on the freeway (don't even need full volume). When I receive a call  I can hear the other person clearly and they can also hear you clearly. Worth the money!
B0006MWPZU|1|The gel filled Lumbar Massage dots were empty and a few had dried up lumps in them making it uncomfortable to sit and lean back on.  I only ordered them to keep my seats clean on my new Fiat.
B00C2S7G9G|5|Great product. Although I thought it was two holders. Based on the advert
B00JDX246I|5|Looks Amazing hard to find nice looking dress up stuff that's not chrome this is a nice clean look without the bling!
B002Y2MKKU|5|THANK YOU.
B000SL0R9K|5|I am taking this on my next trip.  Compact and complete!
B000KL74P8|5|Great product as expected
B000BUQODG|5|Awesome! We have gotten a ton of rain this camping season and I have all our roof vents open!
B002T4SEZI|5|great product easy to install,priced right ...
B00GBVHQB8|1|Cheap quality tears and hoes already in it don't like it at all product again
B006ZOWDFU|1|Bad product
B00CFALFXY|5|These are well made and work great. These microfiber cloths are every bit as useful and effective as the more expensive cloths.Love the different colors, assigned to different chores. Very fast service and well packaged.
B00T36HLYU|5|An excellent inexpensive towing mirror that super easy to install. I've owned a set of these for 3 different tow vehicles. Highly recommended
B00DP3WBT2|1|Took it to the dealership to get programmed...NOTHING, they cant even get this thing to work.  Don't waste your money!
B00M48NACQ|5|This was the wrong part. It was not Amazon's fault I ordered the wrong part, but it looked like high quality. And matched exactly what was on my vehicle. It was just on the wrong side of my vehicle. I needed the other side.
B009IFIGIG|5|Perfect fit<br />Although the Arrow did not match the 2010 model
B0002Z9KE0|4|Works like it should
B000FPYDN0|2|The quality is top-notch and it would be fantastic but unfortunately it doesn't fit and can not be modified for install.
B0040M31OG|5|look good.<br /><br />fits toyota license plate holder.<br /><br />con: losing the special wrench.
B0010GFW88|5|Nice
B005HFX42Y|5|Large sheet of vinyl tape used to decorate painted area
B00XPL88NC|5|does what a good gauge should do
B000CG8YPK|4|Great product at half the cost of what other vendors charge. Almost a perfect fit but was short by about 2 inches of meeting up with exhaust pipe. Had to go to my local auto parts store and buy an adapter to get the pieces to fit as they should. Overall, well worth the extra time and money spent to make things work as they should.
B00ID7FKK2|5|it was easy thanks
B00VXQLBKS|4|good product,timely shipping.
B0041CDPQO|5|Nice to be able to use the Battery Tender connector when the bike is in use rather than just when it is parked.  Works well.
B002UD0GGS|5|Best scratch removing polish we have found. If you own a beautiful guitar and you want to keep it that way, order this scratch remover.
B000CPJMY8|5|Sta-Lube's been around a long time and it stays that way in the bearings and axles. Resists wash-away, but that's r-e-s-i-s-t-s, you will still have to repack periodically ... just not so often.
B00DYOVXZ0|4|Sometimes it has a problem connecting but I like it.
B000O80AZS|5|Perfect for getting brake calipers out of the way. No more wasting Zip Ties or hunting for a wire coat hanger.
B00T36C3AM|5|Well made. the description  was accurate. Very pleased with product.  Plan to order more for camper.  These were for boat trailer.
B007XZK2US|5|With a slight adjustment of the bar it fit like a glove on my 95 honda civic hatchback hahaha!
B002FBNL44|5|Great  product at a great price
B0010EYAX8|2|I have had this unit for a while, got it as a holiday gift to replace my old one. I will say it is lighter, more compact, and generally does the same job as my old unit...just somewhat slower. Thankfully I have not lately been in situation were it has been needed, but it is a comfort it can/should do the job. The jumper generally work like any other box, but get it started in the first or second try as the charger is not long standing. Not to compare to the gas station air pumps, but I will also say that the inflate function does take its sweet time getting your tires to there prescribed levels. It may not be outstanding but it does what's need, just don't ask it for much more.
B00B1G8G8A|5|This is a birthday gift for my youngest son...I know he'll love them.
B0085F7FEQ|5|Great
B000ALBYYA|3|Small lock link and cheap lock but a great price and it works for my application.
B000VKOD9S|5|I'm not scientist enough to tell the difference in quality between different filters but this can give me enough level of quality that I can satisfy.<br />at least it's delivered on time and it's fitting to my cabin filer chamber, it's looks clean (doesn't look like second handed one at all).<br />so I'm happy with product and service at this price. what would I ask for more than this?
B000BGM7QS|5|The part was shipped in a timely manner and worked as advertised.
B00144D77E|5|This thing fit just fine and works great. Take a picture of the old one first or rewire it one post at a time. Also, if the starter keeps spinning when you have it in the &#34;on&#34; position, switch your &#34;M&#34; connections. Installed on an Evinrude 88 SPL.
B001J0WF08|2|Disappointed.  The flag was of a very lightweight material and the color was not very bold (faded).  I  ended up not even using it.  It wasn't worth the effort and cost to return it, so I just bought another one from a different company.
B0049E8VYK|5|Works as described
B00YIBGZRY|5|This cover replaced a Noah 4 ply cover that served me well. This 5 ply cover has a substantial quality feel to it. A good product to protect my toy. This product is well made
B00IO4EYMY|5|Great price. No problems.  Completely satisfied.
B007ZS99RU|5|Wow , you have got to buy these !!<br />I was so surprised at the quality of these seat covers.<br />Awesome !!
B0010E00T6|5|Fits well my 2010 Honda CRV
B0006IX8CI|5|thank you
B00XULVDHK|5|These work much better than I thought they might.  They cling to the window without suction cups which is what I wanted.  I have removed and replaced many times as I need for sun protections.
B000630IHQ|4|Nice gear drive for the price I highly recommend this if your building on a budget not super noisy but you can defiantly hear it<br />does need a little modification to stock timing cover for clearance but all in all good purchase!
B007BLMVP8|5|Worked perfectly out of the box.
B002US3ZE8|3|Not bad. It does the job. I can see the elastic part breaking soon.
B00M9IX1N4|3|Hard as hell to see out of when in the open position.
B00681BE2S|5|Worked great and easy to program!
B00MSC3HIK|5|I purchased this headlight for my Harley 48. It's incredible. Very very bright compared it to a friend of mine he had the daymaker I believe ? the Harley 400$ alternative and this is brighter will last forever and is quarter of the price. Ended having to order another for my buddy and everyone wants to get one for their bike. Only thing is it only has one setting no high beam but I don't care.
B00QMVKIEO|5|worked well..easy to apply
B00E4D3XZ8|5|bought these as gifts for my girlfriend and 2 daughter they all love them, dark and tight fitting and great shape and look
B008BC8EW0|5|Drivers side manual bottom mirror could tip up more, but I'm tall,6'3&#34;. Great price, ordered switch too. Total install time 30 minutes!
B0049LWJ1O|2|Very flimsy, cheap filter. There is no cardboard frame which makes install very difficult.
B002SINBRQ|4|GOOD BOOSTER CABLES, I HOPE THAT I NEVER NEED TO USE THEM.
B00KTHZUJU|5|Works great on a 2010 jeep commander. Had to pay 60 bucks to pragram 2 new keys. These saved me 286 dollars not buying them from the dealer. Worth it. Buy them 2 at a time.
B0097SUMAY|5|Great product
B010G0QTC6|5|Being a secret car enthusiast I love to keep my cars looking nice, clean and showroom shiny.  I've always heard about orbital polishers, but I've been afraid to try them because if they are not used properly, they can destroy the paint finish on a vehicle. I had the awesome opportunity to try this orbital polisher at a deeply discounted rate, so I figured why not! This is the perfect time to try one out.  I received the 6 inch variable speed orbit random orbital polisher from TCP global and they sent me six different polishing pads which are normally sold separate so that was a major bonus!<br /><br />Waxing cars is one of the least favorite chores when it comes to car care but it has to be done in order to protect the finish of the vehicle.  I try to do it at least once a year and the random orbit polisher is going to make this easier than ever!<br /><br />I love that the pads are Velcro based so you don't have to worry about using any kind of screws, nuts ,chucks or bonnets.  Most buffer heads are elastic that you pull onto the polisher and tighten with the string but even this one applies with the Velcro backing and the backing is very strong.<br /><br />Following the instructions not to use any pressure while applying wax or buffing the wax off, I applied 2 tablespoons of wax to the pad.  I installed the side handle as opposed to the included D handle, simply to make it easier for a beginner such as myself.  I did have to go online to TCPGlobal.com to find out which pads are actually used for which process which did not take too much time, but it would've been great if the instructions were included within the box.  Honestly I'm still not sure if I used the right pads but they worked for me so I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />This random orbit polisher has a 6 inch head and it also has six different opm settings from 2000 to 6800 OPM - labeled 1 to 6.  It is suggested when applying wax and polishing to use any setting between one and three.  The on switch is located by your right hand thumb which makes it easy to turn on. The on switch can also be placed in the locked position which prevents thumb fatigue.<br /><br />I found the polisher very easy to use and it really did a great job of applying the wax which took about two-thirds less time than it would if I applied it by hand.  There is a slight learning curve for me, figuring out which head is best for which application, and which speed works best to bring the car to a high luster shine,  but I can say my first time out it was very successful.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Ease of use<br />Velcro backed pads for easy removal and replacement<br />No extra tools needed<br />Side and D-style handles included<br /><br />CONS:<br />Directions not detailed for pad usage.<br />Pads not included<br />Overall I would recommend this product.<br /><br />* I received this product deeply discounted in exchange for an honest review.*<br />If you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.

B004KNIEVU|5|Good quality, needs a backing plate (I made my own as it was a much cheaper option)!  Low profile and easy to use, holds up well to abuse and a heavy load.
B00HZBPTZI|1|not good quality
B001YJNCLA|4|for my gran babies nice.
B00O8RWI6K|5|work great!
B000A8MWL2|1|Crap, leaked at threads then broke
B000CJ44U6|5|Fit perfectly matches the old broken one.
B0091OE6K6|4|Originally got these for my son in a booster seat, but they did not seem as safe as the diono surefit seatbelt positioner. However, I am pretty short and put one of them on my seatbelt and it works great to keep the shoulder strap off my neck!
B000C6ZRDW|5|fits 1998 jeep xj perfect. bolts and everything is included. PERFECT FIT. I had stuck caliper one day and I bought this the same day. I know have great brakes and no more sticky calipers.
B00GBRG4TC|5|Perfect replacement for a 2015 Nissan Altima SL 2.5.  After 11,500 miles, the stock filter in my car was indeed very dirty.  If you live in a high pollen area, it's recommended to change once a year or 12,000 miles.  Save yourself at least 50 bucks over dealer pricing.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Good!
B000Q0VU6C|2|Everything but the 2 head gaskets were in the package.  Most important thing I needed.
B00RV417XM|5|I've had these for at least 6 months and they are still super bright!
B005XGZ9KM|1|Received<br />But one not a slogan<br />jeep<br /><br />Upset
B001CF3IRY|1|This is NOT Stainless Steel.  It is steel coated with Zinc plating.  The Description title is wrong.
B00DM2SK50|5|I was initially skeptical of ordering a light such as this from a company I had not heard of before, but I was pleasantly surprised! This light is high-quality, functions superbly and throws out a lot of light! If you are looking for a good quality, low-profile light bar, this is the one. I have it mounted to my Jeep from bumper and use it frequently.
B001MQPQQ4|1|I am a little rough on Tension Bars and have a tendency to bend and twist them so I was in the market for a sturdier &#34;Tension Wrench&#34;.  What ever it is...it is NOT a &#34;Tension Wrench&#34; as used by any Lock Smith that I know. Why this is classified as a Lock Picking accessorie has me buffaloed. Usually, I would call the seller and ask for my money back, but in this case the $7.20 that I spent is not worth the time. I did not bother to read the reviews when I saw &#34;4 Stars&#34;. Bad mistake. I sure would like to know what the &#34;5 Star&#34; reviewers were reviewing.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with a Lock Picking &#34;Tension Wrench&#34;. If you need a sturdy set of black industrial Tweezers then this might fit the bill.
B00B2HHDH8|4|swapped out my cars smaller interior lights for these and so far so good after a couple months.
B000CSSBOC|5|A plus part and service
B00HB9K2E2|5|Made my 2011 Mustang look even more bad a$$. Follow directions and you won't have a problem. Make sure the template is centered on hood. Requires you to drill 9 holes in your hood.
B00CQUW8J8|1|Failed after 4 months.  Most of the LED's were dark.  The remaining ones flickered badly.  No more than 50 hours total use.
B00XNWDUH2|5|Just what i ordered very happy!
B009T54A3K|5|perfect fit and easy install
B00130G3PW|5|Saved money and came on time.  Will use again.
B000C9C8EK|5|Awesome price
B00R8QDMOA|1|Ordered H 8's and got H11's they don't fit. good luck trying to return them
B005J3L35O|3|When I tip this forward, it leaks all over the place. Also, I have a Trojan battery with an irrigation system, and apparently I need some sort of attachment to use this watering can. I won't give it 1-2 stars because it's not their fault that it's incompatible with what I have, but I also can't give it more than 3 stars because when I tipped it to pour out, water was leaking all out of the Cao and sides of the spout, even though everything was well tightened.
B0028GPVAS|5|LOVE IT
B00B7APX2M|5|That's what the dart needed !!!
B00A3F4IQE|5|Fits 09 Yamaha Vstar 650 Classic. Perfectly!
B006B376WK|5|Girlfriend keeps one in her Grandma Cherokee. Figured....why not? Bought one for my truck. Use it on my bike, too. Hit it with my air compressor to clean it. Works great.
B00L2PJ2WY|5|Love them!!
B00OP97Z6E|5|super cool
B00OVZZ4QA|3|The glue inside the trim does not stick well, so I'll have to find some other glue to lock it in place
B0017OALKM|5|Perfect! Fits perfect, bright, and hope they last!
B000A6TID4|5|Fit just perfect.
B005N53C9I|5|vary nice and made my jeep look good.
B004D6N6GM|1|Poor quality
B000GU7I4A|5|i love it fits perfect im a happy happy costumer thank u
B003G0K9MA|5|Perfect fit for an 08 Altima. Looks great. Can’t beat the price. Thick rubber and raised edge in the event anything spills. This is a good one.
B00GD6SZIO|5|I've never been there, But they tell me SHE'S AWESOME the lady in black. Too Tough to Tame!!!!!
B008BTLIYY|5|great
B00405056A|5|Great. Was better than expected
B000BUTD9S|3|It's ok, surprised it is still on. Ties are that all that rugged.
B0060LTPM2|4|Received these in 2 days. Very well packaged. There is a small scratch that is noticeable inside the housing but nothing major. I didn't notice it until they were completely installed and I didn't want to have to take it back off and return it.  I agree with the other reviews on the wiring harness. It's a pretty solid harness but the blinker bulbs do not fit properly and seem to come loose.  I used the factory harness and it worked just fine.  These look MUCH better than the factory headlamps. Hopefully they don't allow any moisture.  I will try to update after a few months. Overall a good a great product for the price !
B0002KNZ8C|5|Great tool!
B0107UFZ7A|5|Great better then I thought.
B004PL4H0O|5|Good product
B0081O5XFO|5|Excellent mirrors, had to just unbolt mine and bolt these in, heaters and electric just like my stock ones but needed flip out for camper, work great
B00I3F38OY|5|Great Product
B006FL1WWS|4|As  advertised, I  elected  not to permanently install, now  I can  pop it  in or  out.<br />Con&#62;  Dosent  leave much room  for a  BIG  cup in 2nd  spot.<br />Good  buy  ..
B00KX9MIS0|5|looks and fits really nice on my b series valve cover. ALOT better than those OEM plastic spark plug covers.
B00LAEYVKK|5|Great product
B001NYQRUY|5|Perfect fit.  Took care of the rattle.
B00HHGSMZU|5|Perfect fit for my 98' Dakota, thanks!
B0012POWVU|5|Work well
B00NWGVF7Q|4|I measured these at just under 32mm long, a tight fit when replacing a DE3175 size bulb.  The color is warm white, only slightly cooler than the stock incandescent.  Without looking at them side by side I couldn't tell the difference.  Great lights for the price.
B003PIAQR6|5|great hitch, not too bad to install! hides nice on the back of my 2007 audi a3
B00C8E91CE|5|Great shipped quick, easy install
B000E4IGKI|5|Exact replacement and installed easily.  Price very reasona and shipped quickly.
B00NS6WBJQ|1|Lowest quality of shock I have ever seen. The lower bushing is of a low quality rubber that is instantly collapsed when first installed. I estimate the shock lower bushing will fail extremely fast and then cause the shock to break causing a safety concern, possibly causing the loss of steering control.
B0030GDLTI|5|I put this on my old snow thrower last winter here in Vermont, and it never let me one time (even on the coldest days). Installation didn't take half an hour with basic homeowner tools.
B00FF1K7BQ|1|I brought this for my mom new car & she did not like the smell at all? As me yeah the smell is a no go?
B003NU0EM8|1|I purchased this mini puller despite the negative reviews thinking to myself 'it only has to work once'. This would not even create suction on first try on a flat surface. The cup simply tears from the foot. Not even a one shot tool, a complete waste of shipping and materials. The whole inventory should be disposed of. Don't bother.
B0082OYG3I|3|These are quite large compared to other ones I've seen/used. It was not what I was expecting. There's nothing wrong with them
B00MU51ASE|2|It's not really what I was looking for and sort of pricey for $8.00 :/ wouldn't buy again.
B009AQS5H0|4|I have had this for a little over a year on my Lexus, but I cannot screw the bottom portion of the plate holder on my car - no holes (only top ones) and I cannot stand the way it rattles when I shut my trunk. I think I will move it to the front and get something else for the back. It is beautiful and has held up nicely. Wish it didn't rattle nor have the look of two holes without something to put there!
B003CJQR3A|5|These grips are awesome. You you love a smooth feeling grip that will not hurt your hands. Look no further. They look great on my kx250f. Everyone who rides with me will have these grips by next week. They are that good
B0030DISUI|5|Works just like the one you get at the dealer, except, a lot cheaper.
B0007TQWME|1|Worst gloves ever. Tear easily, replaced 4 pairs within an hour and a half. You have to do more replacing then actual work with these gloves<br /><br />Kyle
B000BNQTIS|5|These mat are great. You will not be sorry if you purchase them.
B007VHBGIU|5|Front of truck looks brand new
B0081STB7Q|5|solved all my weak battery problems, great price, fast shipping
B00S7ONHH4|5|I'm glad I got it. I've kept it ever since in my car trunk just in case. Has helped me fix quite a few problems with my old x5. Simple to use, and good accuracy diagnosing faults.
B004YTOJ78|5|was the right fit for my light
B000M3V95U|5|Works great. A must for vehicles because it has no ammonia. Much cheaper at Home Depot.
B00JS5XL1S|5|This stuff just plain works. Smoother ride and added peace-of-mind for not getting a flat in the middle of Nowheresville.
B00QG5S9UG|5|These are very useful, and work well in my Honda. I've tried others that connect on both sides of the headrest, and those are not nearly as stable.
B005HAYDR4|5|Handle's like a handle...
B000KL19SQ|4|Pricey but when you insert the factory hooks in the hole it stays in place pretty well.  The passenger side could use something to grab the carpet beneath.
B00C7S9K8Q|1|Ordered July 6 and didn't receive it until August 11 doesnt look like light bar in the picture i ordered for the look of the little screws around the lense and doesnt have those it rained for about 5 minutes and already has condensation in the light. Ive got 2 pods 2x2 and they are brighter than this light bar.  The light also makes a hissing noise when turned on dont waste your money
B005SGZT4S|5|Funny!
B0064QQIT6|5|Check engine light kept coming on saying I had a fuel leak (after I ran the codes) so I decided to start cheap then if that didn't fix it I would keep trying to find a leak. Put this cap on and sure enough half a tank later the light turned off!
B000AP1N06|1|I bought mine a year ago and all seemed well...until I began towing my 25' RV. Going down the highway in &#34;tow&#34; mode the intake is very loud and annoying as it shifts down. I just changed back to my stock K&N filter and will be posting this one on Craig's list.
B004UR1B7K|4|Perfect item. No instructions and box thrown away before installed. Husband figured it out.
B002IV8I80|3|Simple to attach, but bends fairly easily.  I came off a curb slowly and the tire hit the curbing and bent it back quite easily
B004GDH6VS|5|Had some front end damage after an encounter with the back end of a larger truck, this replacement part fit my truck perfectly and after I painted it to match, my truck looks even better than before.
B009FIBXGS|2|They're cute, but I really do not like the fact that the screws are a separate piece from the top with the paw decal. The decal fell right off and the screw almost got stuck in the hole.
B00QFT92YA|3|Honestly could not get this stuff to stick to my Chevy sign. Wasted all of it without being able to do it at All. Would buy again to try again but its a pain
B000NCOKZQ|5|A must have for any motorcyclist who has any type of battery tender as it's just soooo much easier to connect. Simply plug and use. So easy a caveman's baby can use it.
B000CQOIR8|1|Very poor weak and doesn't fit please send me return infr please
B007BXCLN8|5|So far, the oil (0W20 Mobil 1 Extended Performance) has looked very clean after 2000 miles of driving when using this oil filter on my 2011 Odyssey.  I'm hoping I can go 7K miles with this combination & I'm pretty sure I should be able to do that with the Purolator Synthetic oil filter that I purchased from Amazon.  (BTW, I rec'd the order less than 1 week with standard shipping)
B00UX8D7YK|5|I like it it so bright
B0068G1MXY|1|Doesn't last long. Not worth the money in my opinion.
B003IS3HV0|5|Excellent product! I have reviewed this product 4 times, I am not sure why it says I still need to review.  We love it! We will definitely buy again.
B00KCQSM9S|2|I have a 2015 Toyota Corolla. When I was looking for the seat covers I included the year and make in the search. The search advised that this particular seat cover would fit. The seat covers for the front seats are okay. The only issue is that the back of the front seats have pockets. The seat cover don't have any opening to allow for the use of the back pockets. The back seat cover is the real problem. The back rest of the back seat has a drop down drink holder in the middle. The back seat cover is one piece. I therefore cannot use it. Also the head rest pieces are waay too big *sigh*. On a brighter note, they do look good for the price, just wrong for my car.
B009B7JZJ0|5|Fits very well it takes a little work to get it in place but it does cover the windshield.
B009D3HM8I|5|I bought this to match 2008 Lexus ISF rims. The color is spot on. Great for fixing small chips and bruises.
B000OKTFL6|4|as advertised. fit in w/o problems. No leaks.
B00080QHMM|5|These are the best digital tire gauges made. I have one in each vehicle, and two or three in my garage. Not many digital tire gauges will measure from 5 psi all the way to 150 psi. This means you can use them on a truck tire, as well as a dirt bike tire.
B007J7E4XG|5|Mats are very nice, top quality
B005GXQDHU|5|Perfecct
B00BD5GYWO|5|Satisfied customer
B00O1LLZ62|5|Great product!  Easy to install! On time shipping!
B003IT4YAM|5|Love it. It's the perfect car seat for my one year old. It's very comfortable and great on long drives. :)
B001HATY36|5|Best price anywhere
B000JZFT6G|4|Easy install, great compliment to Gibson catback exhaust. Added a slightly deeper tone and slightly better throttle response.  I previously had the stock air box silencer removed and a K&N drop in filter, so this intake was just a mild improvement. Truck feels less restricted overall.  Most noticeable change is accelerating for lane changes at highway speeds, I don't feel the need to downshift as often.  Overall, I'm happy with it.
B00T6IY3XW|5|Easy to install and great light
B00PJPHEBO|5|great!
B00LUOXFBG|2|Rust came back within a week!!
B001GMAJP2|5|My bike runs after I put in, what else should I say? Worked for 2012 Suzuki V-Strom DL1000
B0072W6GAC|3|Fit Well, not as bright as expected.
B00G49DVGG|3|works temporarily but smoke smell returns
B00LQHR9GE|5|It's great I love it!
B00TO3Y96K|5|works great for guys 250lb and up
B001GN6YTG|5|Husband liked it, happy with the price. ..and does the job.
B001CEG90I|5|Oh, my air is much nicer now. Actually, its a good air filter from the experts in air filters. I don't notice a difference but I trust Fram.
B001KO713O|5|Fits nice and tight, won't fall off
B0067UMDFM|5|Easy to put in. Blinkers are working great again. Great price! Amazon shipped it within 2 days.
B004VLCZQQ|5|installed it few weeks ago on Infiniti g35 and so far ride quality is great and no more clunking.
B000FW7V50|5|Great stuff and Amazon has the best price. Great for your gas and it's better than Stabil. Buy some today and your car will say &#34;thank you.&#34;
B00GRV800S|4|Works really well.  It sticks a bit once in a while, but it enables me to bleed the brakes by myself.  Can't beat that.
B00843V6KI|5|Loved the helmet !!
B00BNR84WA|1|have not used product yet though machine work looks good can't  say much about it.
B00H9L7QYQ|5|Very cool and happy
B00KGIDVG6|5|Worked great, great price!
B00NQ198LC|5|VerY good product  :)
B000N32110|5|did what it was supposed to, lifted a 300lb. Austin Healey engine.
B001Q7VRVM|5|This product is the best, it smells like new leather every time I use it. Great product for indoor furniture as well as auto!!
B00AC6Y9S6|5|Perfect for overnight trips on my new Ducati Scrambler.  Good value for the money.
B00A00IIJU|4|Fits into place perfectly, sticks to the plastic clips almost too well. Has almost torn the clip off the floor.
B005M2UMU4|5|fit perfect.  Looks as advertised
B00JRYHG70|5|Nice
B01015G0UW|4|THEY LOOK NICE ON MY SILVERADO MORE FRESH  THAN THE ORIGINAL LIGHTS !!
B00MJ44YH0|5|Excellent product. Fits like a glove
B00KRHPDR6|5|These are so cool.
B00KNPRQAO|5|Great product. Received early.
B001HKZHIW|5|passed my expectations. Make the task a whole lot easier to do. best money I ever spent on a product
B009XIRZ9O|5|Love them!
B00R0S2D2S|4|It worked I thought the magnets would be more heavy duty.
B00P8XAGLW|5|Excellent
B00HT2B77W|1|I put these lights in my truck and they suck terribly. I can't see a thing. Might as well drive with the lights off. I'm not sure why. I rated them a 1 because I can't go lower than that.
B000MNN4WQ|5|Great product
B00BDVI2QO|5|It works great. It fixed my problem.
B00AZ4SF6M|2|After completing several questions at purchase to ensure it was the right one to fit our car (make, model, year, LT, etc), it didn't end up fitting.  Had to return it at our expense...
B00WZXACIA|1|DO NOT buy these they are the biggest pieces of junk on the Internet.<br />The tabs that are supposed to hold the metal ring snap off with almost no force, I wasn't even able to put these on my car.<br />I repeat do NOT buy these.
B008B5U0S8|5|Works just like the one the dealer sells, but for a third of the price.
B000GD5FMY|4|Fit good. A small gap that let's in a little air, no big deal.
B0002JN2EU|5|I have actually noticed a different after just one tank/can. I added full can to half a tank of gas and then filled the tank the rest of the way. Car is less sluggish and seems to have a little more horsepower. Will bye again.
B00X4VY59O|5|Perfect fit shipping was on time
B00RZVL1TG|5|Excellent service by Louis Powersports, fast and secure, 100% recommended
B000QFVJ5O|5|does the job good quality
B0033YFEQA|1|Bought this for my 2002 explorer sportrac. Took 30 minutes. Works like a charm. Follow the YouTube video. Fyi you do not have remove the door lock. You do have to remove the window Trac and drill out the rivet holding the actuator, then replace the rivet with a small screw. Update....died after a few months. Buyer beware!!!
B002GJQ1ZG|3|Did not work so well on my tractor tire .
B004FSRGZA|2|Incorrect oil filter was shipped.  I wanted the old filter, part number 5JW-13440-00-00 as was listed in the item description.  I received the new updated part number 5GH-13440-50-00 which I did not want.  Item will be returned.  Edit:  I made two orders.  The order I received from Derby Cycles was the correct item.  The incorrect item I described above was from Motorcycle Parts Network.
B00EDWLIK2|5|Works great!  My speedometer was indicating a higher speed than actually traveling.  After numerous comparisons I found that to travel at 50mph the speedometer had to read 60mph, 65mph = 78mph, 75mph = 90mph, etc.  Indicating that the speedometer reading is 20% high - meaning that it is spinning 20% too fast.  To slow it down we need to add 20% more teeth to the gear.  I removed the speedometer gear to see how many teeth it has (30) and added 20% more teeth (30 x 1.20 = 36) to bring the speedometer reading down to an accurate representation of the speed of travel.<br />I ordered this gear with 36 teeth, received it in good time, installed it, and tested it by going past a few different semi-permanent roadside radar &#34;your speed&#34; machines.<br />Woo-Hoo!  Now the speedo is right on.
B00DOZC69Q|5|Use for biking and very happy with them.  Fit good and comfortable and stay put while riding.
B000CMIYE0|5|Just nice chrome caps. Have shown no signs of deterioration after many months.
B00C7Z0AV0|4|Quality cover. Fits scooter fine. Shipping good.
B00G8S07FQ|5|this thing is awsome
B008B5X5GC|5|Works just as well as the gm sold ones but at a much lower cost and in my opionion better quality. The metal ones repeatedly had broke valve stems and would loose air. This ones rubber so no broke stems and walmart installed for 5 dollars.
B008ZE1GPG|5|Very Good tool must have!!!
B00G6DOEYS|5|looks great
B000F2HH54|5|I wanted black because the factory gray dashboard reflected up in the long windshield, making it hard to see the road clearly in certain sunlight conditions.  This dash cover seems to sparkle somewhat, so it looks classy from the seats, but you do not see anything in the windshield, except the road outside.  Fit was very good (I used a metal spatula for installation near the glass).  Plenty of Velcro tape is supplied.  Cut and press pieces of Velcro tape where you want them on the back of the cover, then peel the plastic backing and stick the cover down to the dashboard.  The cover comes with a good set of instructions.
B00NLU7SJW|5|I absolutely love the bars. Everything fit properly and the product came before estimated delivery date.
B00164ZCYI|3|i was thinking I was getting front and rear pads. confusing
B00YMHDGBC|5|Excellent product. Easy install
B00BGH0EAC|3|This product was a pain in the butt to update, for anyone receiving the request failed when trying to run the updater, you may need to disable your antivirus or/and firewall, this is the only way I could get the updater to work, seems to be fine now.
B0076CBAGI|4|thanx
B00NF1Q3EI|4|As it should be.
B0089XEBFU|5|Thanks!
B007XWSH0S|1|Cargo light did not work after installing this in my 2005 GMC 2500HD
B003MRMPZQ|1|A lot smaller than I expected,also scrape way too fast. Waste of money !
B00LOZBACM|5|Well made and good wuslity
B00080QHMM|5|Excellent item, thanks.
B00ABMYXD2|5|I'm 1/2 Hungarian, so how could I NOT love this?!!!!! Sent others to relatives...so lots of bumpers out there declaring their nationality. I think there are other stickers out there from other countries. So check out the buyer.
B00LTX81B2|5|Does the trick!
B000O0BPH8|4|Good part, wasn't an exact fit but it worked and a lot cheaper then buying one from the ford house.
B00CGTVCIC|2|It definitely not odourless. It stinks with some synthetic smell. Also after driving, lint starts coming from the white threads. Overall its not worthy for whats shown.
B000BZJ7DU|5|Fixed issue w check engine light and easy to install.
B00ZWUP7OC|5|It was delivered on time and is working great.
B006N94OYK|5|Awesome price ! and it works well
B0001L0DFA|5|excellent
B001DUFVA0|3|I returned them
B001ABPKUS|5|These mirrors worked better than I expected. I was a little concerned when I read a review that mentioned that they shook to much to make out images. I found this to not be true at all. The mirrors were steady and clear and very easy to install and remove. I am very happy with this product.
B009HQ6JT4|4|The insert trim worked fine. Only problem the color is not white, it cream color, doesn't match
B0009H51MG|5|Fit my Nissan Altima, Great price, good quality and will buy again.
B00ZS8ES0W|5|Worked great.
B0017R95DI|4|I liked it, it did the job.
B000BLNTQU|4|good
B00EG40JWK|3|not bad!!!
B0049GE9TE|5|Fet my 03 element works great 1-2 month no problem so far
B00GHQGN1G|4|Got these for an 09 Sonata. Looks just like the OEM and finish is better than what is shown in pics here. Bit pricey for what they are but overall I'm satisfied.
B001TCXOTW|4|good
B0002SPCAS|3|Dont' see what all the fuss is about. Leather looks the same. Tried it on old and new stuff.
B00192JF9U|5|Installed very easily! Have put about 800 miles on the trailer and it sits right where I installed it. So glad I don't have to worry about flying insects, chipmunks and mice getting into my furnace!
B005BNYV2Y|1|Sounded like a good product, but does not stick well to surfaces
B00IIOJK60|5|I'm 6'2 and 150lbs and wasn't sure on if it would fit, and I ended up getting a large and it fit perfectly! It would also fit someone a little larger so if you're close in size to me then go for a large. Jacket has great protection and pretty good ventilation.
B00N2ZFNU2|5|It screws in and tells the level! I used this on a John Deere 318 that was given to me by my dad.  The lawn mower has some sentimental value so I wanted to keep it in good condition.  This cap helped me do that.
B0011FJXOM|5|Perfect, works as expected. Great price!
B00KYZ4DRM|5|This is the way to update a 2004 Mustang for just a little amount of money!
B000FUNZF2|4|Works really well but the spray is too much. I ordered the Royal Purple 02514 in the bottle. It works better.
B000JZEXBI|1|Wouldn't fit. A real waste of time and labor money to find out it want fit
B00CXNK95I|5|they look good on my bike
B002C7DSIK|1|The sticky things do not stick.  No way to hang it through it out
B00D1CQVIY|4|Nice
B007V2BO0A|4|Finally got the right one. And PERFECT FIT!!  Only wish is that it came in grey like my other one. Hence, why I gave 4 stars. But this blue will do. Once I got this product for my other vehicle, I will never go back to another sun shield again.  Yes it's large, but super sturdy!!!  Which is why I like it.
B00KN2ITS0|5|I bought these about a year ago and they still look brand new after I rinse all of the dirt and what not off of them. They are so durable and definitely worth buying them! I expect them to last many years from now. The ford logo is still clearly visible no sign of wear or tear. They fit perfectly for a ford ranger. Whenever the floor mats get muddy/dirty, I just remove them from the truck and wash them with a hose and they look brand new again! Great product!
B004QEF970|5|Great fit. Cleaned up the rear very nice.
B0000CBIK5|5|Nice
B00BQS6VDK|3|Thank you will do the job
B009B49ZQQ|4|So far so good. It cleared out the dreaded OBD code associated with the valve and the check engine light has yet to come back on. Hope this stays this way for a long time!  Also, this was at least 50% less than at the dealer and fit perfectly.
B002M310HU|3|Fair quality. Be really careful with plugs. They are extremely hard to remove and not destroy fan side of plug once in. Not like OEM, but it'll work.
B005LDATGG|5|nice
B00ENOUV4Y|5|This is nice for the price.  Doesn't make your Tiregard receiver waterproof, but it probably makes it water-resistant?  Fits on easily.  Stays put. Doesn't block the screen.  Buttons still easy to push.
B000C933ZI|5|Excellent. Fit my 2010 Chrysler 5.7 hemi awd perfectly.
B006H7BQCG|5|Hubby loved it! Proudly displayed on his desk at work.
B00RLUG3SU|2|There are four sensors in selling pictures but the wiring as shown in the photo,<br /><br />​please send only one came back just as fast as the rest of the sensor with the same address
B00XECQNP2|2|Not bad  but chrome around edges was not intact where it latch to the quick connect
B00CWKT552|5|Worked as advertised.  Easy to use and pleased with performance.
B006CPYN96|5|great
B000VHZI8G|4|Good tool, but it does have a short handle.  The description is correct.
B00R5Y8IOO|4|Pros: Easy to attach, ratcheting for easy tightening, stable once installed<br />Cons: the large mirror vibrates at an annoying level (smaller mirror stays steady)<br /><br />I've used these on exactly one trip, 3 hours each way, while towing a 22' travel trailer behind a 2015 Explorer.  The fit to the mirrors was a bit awkward due to the shape of the back of the mirrors not due to the product design.  I found that I used the tiny mirror on the outside edge frequently as I had them adjusted to allow me to view the lanes for a ways back.  I was not able to adjust the larger mirror with it's magnification to a position that I liked during this trip and will continue to tweak the adjustments on future uses.<br /><br />As a side note, my brother bought the same mirrors and they fit much simpler onto his F150 mirrors since they are flat on the back.
B0031HQK6C|4|good
B00CSWMQH8|5|Amazing
B00075OSDS|5|Very good product
B006FTAQS6|5|Bought this for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Delivered on time. Had plenty of compliments on it. Would recommend this to anybody.
B00B6QEY04|5|This trunk spoiler beats any other spoiler in the market. The color matches exactly like car factory color and I am really please with this purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />and mostly the 'Spoiler and Wing King' customer service is outstanding. They cleared all my questions via email without any delay.
B0114L8OUG|5|Worked as advertised.I downloaded Torque from the google play store on my phone and was able to diagnose my 07 jetta.
B0018E6T0M|5|Mats are very nice, top quality
B00AM207JU|5|Still new so time has not had a chance to affect it but it certainly operates much smoother than any other new strap I have ever used.
B00KTIR1ZU|5|Worked great for my 2010
B000CO87ZE|5|Nice wrench!
B004A2IFII|5|OEM parts for a right price.
B00X9GSIVA|3|Looks good, and it does seem to fit thinner people, should make the Velcro part longer,
B003UM7B98|5|This is the best money I've spent on autotive tools ever. This service jack is fantastic. After years of working with cheapo smaller sized jacks that can barely life the car 10&#34; I decided to do an upgrade to this one. Best purchase I've made in a while and it's worth every penny.  Smooth lifting, great lift height, very solid build and its light enough for easy maneuverability. I did lots of research before I bought this one but the rest of the reviews helped and I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
B0009JKI8G|5|bought this as a replacement to my worn out wiper blade and I'm really surprised on its performance! the wiper blade can easily wipe out the raindrops on my windshield. fits all types of cars!
B001EAQTRI|5|Got it to remove noise made by my phone in my car when plugged into both the audio input and charger. No more noise! Slight dip in volume, but can definitely still blast music in my car. Love it.
B00GRISB78|4|Havent had them installed for long, so seeing how they do in weather and such will take a while. Install was simple
B008IEFA0U|5|Very very nice ready to order some more
B00JIIZCM6|5|I cleaned my two sofas and several leather chairs.  Works great on leather handbags too.  Very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean their leather items.  I used the conditioner and restorer from Leather Nova too.
B003TPEQ9E|5|I rebuilt my 31 spline explorer 8.8 limited slip using this kit, because the carbon kit wasn't available.  It tightened the diff LS up considerably and definitely was worth the cost and work.
B004I0ZGIY|5|Just as expected. Fit perfectly in our 2004 Toyota Highlander. Thank you!
B000AMKUCQ|1|I returned this item to Amazon. Could not remove the club from my steering wheel on my new car. Tried using all suggestions to remove it located on Club website and had to finally call in a locksmith to remove it so I could use the car ($110). Returned this particular club to Amazon and received a refund. I still had the club I used on my previous car (vintage year 2000) and it continues to work flawlessly.
B00HHCBHX8|1|bought this ball for my trailer, tried to follow the directions and torque to 450 pounds,  but how am I supposed to do that when there are no flat spots on the top part of the ball to put another wrench and stop it from spinning. I got it to 350 and then it just wants to spin. Useless if I can't install it as the mfg says to.
B0027XEKQ8|4|This Heng's vent is superior to the 14&#34; X 14&#34; vent that was originally installed in my utility trailer.
B00D6GWTPY|5|I love this thing!! It will make my key fob last for years to come! Even at the dealership the service department compliments me on it.
B0048J01RG|5|great much faster than the other one i installed. now have to replace my passenger side that i replaced last year
B00RBQ6HS0|5|Great
B00I2ZRRR4|5|Very quick shipping and good pricing!
B000NK791K|5|Saves you money on the long run! Highly recommend!
B007TD1WIK|1|These are horrible! For 20 mins I sat out trying to jump my car until I finally gave up. A friend finally pulled up and took out his cables and within 60seconds of hooking them up my car started. You GET what you pay for. Spend a few bucks more and you'll be happy you did.
B00BCRMBGQ|4|So I got this in the mail, shipped in the time frame that it was supposed to. Everything was in there as was advertised. There is a link of some sort at the top of the page when you are looking at this product to see if these covers will fit your car. I have a Chevy Impala, these covers fit alright, thought I wasn't able to hook anything. I read reviews and it had decent reviews. In some reviews I saw complaints about a weird smell. When I opened this product it did have a smell but nothing too bad. To me it just smelled new.<br />  The complaints I have about this product is that 1) The directions weren't that clear (though it is pretty self explanatory) and 2) I was not able to hook anything so I basically just tucked everything in, in hopes that the covers will do their job and keep my seats from getting too damaged. I got what I paid for, so basically I am happy with the product because it covers the seats good and looks pretty neat.<br />  The two front seats were easy enough to put in (like I said, I didn't hook any straps just tucked them into crevices). The back seat covers were a little harder to put in since my back seat doesn't lift up or down so I had to just tuck in the crevices there too. But overall it looks neat.<br />  Buyers make sure, if you want these to fit properly in your car, that 1) your seat belts aren't connected to the seats (otherwise you'll have to cut holes in the fabric to put the seat belts through), 2) your rear seats can lift up or down to be able to attach the hooks to the straps in back, 3) your front seats have space in the crevices to put straps through to connect to bottom of seat. If you are like me and don't care about attaching hooks and straps then you'll have no problem with this product. One other little problem is that the cloth and plastic of steering wheel cover did split while I was putting it on, it was too tight a fit but I didn't mind because I wasn't really planning to put it on anyways. But just beware of this as well.<br />  Overall, I gave this product 4 stars because even though I wasn't able to properly put these in, they are still cheaper than ones I would get in store somewhere. And it was a good deal for the whole set vs just two front seat covers. If you are looking for cheap covers that do the primary and basic function its meant for, then this is a good product. These also come in different colors so there is more to choose from.
B00JOY6U7U|5|The clamps on this product very strong and well made unlike some others. The socket also seems heavy duty.
B0038D7NN8|5|perfect buy
B0036QZ8VQ|5|Got my order on time. Easy assembly. These are must have stands. Makes life so much easier all the way from lubing your chain, to doing other work on bike. They feel very durable. Love the diversity of both stands. You can adjust them to hhlwever big or small that you need them to be. Supper simple.  Got these stands for my 2008 Kawasaki Ninja 250R , and it fit Perfect. Would definitely buy again!!!!
B00APOA344|5|Service was great , fast. Product was even better than I thought it would be.
B003JF1JQM|5|Fit perfectly in my 2007 Prius. Everything has been running great, so I'll assume the filter is doing its thing. So much cheaper to replace it yourself rather than going to the dealer.
B007GRGTZA|1|I called Progressive's Tech Dept prior to purchase and was told my 04 FLHR took a 13&#34; rear shock. I made my Amazon purchase and after installation found the shocks had raised my bike. I tried to make an exchange and even contacted Progressive for smaller shocks. No Deal! Once they are on they are not returnable so apparently they expect me to pay again for another set. HaHa, I'm getting rid of them and returning the front end system I also bought to get another brand. Good shocks, bad service.
B00H8LIJUM|5|Got around 100 hours on this one and it's still going. Friggin bright. I just wish you could take the scoop off.
B00ZUIG3CG|3|I really like the idea of the grip lock, but there is a problem with the black plastic inserts that protect your handlebar from the sharp plastic edges of the lock. Over the course of one month, the inserts that fit my bike have started to melt and stick all over my motorcycle's handlebar grip. Keep in mind that anytime I park my bike and lock it, I keep it covered with a Dowco cover.<br /><br />Overtime, the pressure of the handlebar against the grip lock causes the inserts flatten out. I believe this has compromised their UV resistance, and is why they have started to melt and leave a sticky residue on my handlebars.<br /><br />Now that the inserts that fit my bike's grip are worn out and melty, I don't have anything to replace them with. I don't think the manufacturer sells replacement inserts, and I'm not sure what good that would do if they would also melt within a month. Pretty disappointing.
B00HE67TS4|5|great color match
B000NJ4DN8|5|Delivered on time, product as described. Good Value!
B009OBVRY4|5|Fantastic product at a low price. Meguiar's have hit a home run here. This product works attaches to your home drill and makes the task of waxing your car an easy one. The only drawback is the smaller size of the pad itself, but hey I can live with that!!!! Buy the product, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B001W100OW|4|It is everything it said it was. Light is not very bright though. Would be cool if it was a laser pointer!
B00AK1G6S4|5|Great product. It's working perfectly and only cost 1/3 of what they want at a parts store!
B00MIA1DFG|4|these things fit with no trouble.  they look good just as described. my only complaint would have to be mounting location. not that the mounting location changes the appearance. They are just a little soft when you step on them but I'm a very big guy my step dad is normal size and said he did not feel anything.
B001UKOGLS|4|Good product overall.<br />Not as specific to my vehicle as I would have liked, came with adjustable pieces, but the price was affordable comparable to other items I viewed.
B00KLKH2TQ|5|Crisp, precise feel. Just like NEW!
B0042XORMI|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B0066QV6KU|5|Looks and fits just like the original part from BMW.
B00SLKYWFA|4|Looks awesome....once i figured out how to install it.  The instructions didn't match up with any of the hardware given.
B00F9LPL5E|5|2012 Wideglide has cranked slow from day 1 this was the final part of a fix that included a voltage regulator under warranty and this makes battery #3 in the replacements. Bike still cranked slow after the dealer finally replaced the voltage regulator which helped greatly but by then had toasted batteries 1 and 2. HD factory battery is around 315CCA and is underpowered and small in size. Always left you wondering.  the 480CCA Battery Tender Fits well using the stick on padded spacers. Loses about 7 lbs. Over stock AGI mat battery. Cranks well every time on the v-twin now.Hot or cold but it is summer in Oklahoma so... Have to see how cold weather performance is but doesn't get really cold here for long at a time so should be ok using a pre warm-up on the battery.
B00BZAGQ0M|5|great price!
B00N7C2O6G|5|Work good so far
B00EOX6TTK|4|Easy to program change  settings and comfortable to wear...
B00C7I4N60|2|um, there are SHARP POINTS in each holder area to &#34;suspend&#34; the eggs...  had to clip each one to not puncture the shell.  I know other makers put the tabs in there put they are larger and DEFINITELY not SHARP POINTED tabs.  for the price/hassle, i didn't bother returning it.
B0049IZSS8|4|As advertised - good product for price
B00CUREA5C|5|Best towel so far I have used to drying off my black car. Leaves no residue!
B0000CBIK2|5|yes it was a nice pump..
B0065SJ4NA|5|Plate looks good on my wrangler.........arrrrrrr
B00UIUME2Y|5|Got the chance to install them today and they came out great! Now I need to order a pair for the fog lights!
B00LM4OQMG|5|Awesome addition to my bike!  It fits all different size bottles.
B00K7X8QQU|5|took a while to put on.  You have to heat it first before putting on steering wheel.  We finally put in microwave (I know<br />sounds funny)  Put in for 30 seconds twice. Ran to car and put on wheel.  We also used a screw driver to push on (I used<br />a towel over driver so not to scratch wheel).  Whatever - as much as this sounds funny - it worked and we are loving it.<br />It is wonderful especially in these very hot days.
B00JA3BMDW|4|Perfect for monitoring my koi ponds temperature. Quick. I'm satisfied.
B00I53G8A0|5|These fit great and really made the interior of my car look so much newer.
B00AC6Y9S6|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B003H6HYJY|5|Fits my 2002 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer edition, easy to install.
B003UEBQYC|5|It was easy to install and works as it is suppose to
B007TKOUS2|5|The items I ordered are perfect. My fiance will love them. They even included an extra decal at no charge. This is my 2nd order from this company and I highly recommend them.
B0068ODC1Q|5|The keyless remote was easy to program and works perfectly!
B00JVX5LME|5|I changed the tabs around for my cabover and it works very good. It was thinner than my 4 core witch gave me more room for the 55 grill! Thank You!
B00HUAH6K0|5|Wife says they are the best wipers she has ever had. Easy install.
B000AP1MPC|4|My car had a second vacuum hose that if using the tube that came with it would have ended up being on top of the clamp that went onto the maf sensor. But i just reused the old tube and hooked the filter onto the maf sensor as its supposed to be and it works great. The engine sounds a lot better but the power gain is to small to really notice but its definantly an improvement.
B00BQ0XUYG|5|LOVE IT !!!! Best purchase ever !!!!!!
B0055QOKC8|4|Works but slips a little on sport bikes
B009F59HR8|5|Great item, it took me couple hours to installed it by myself. it have some help would have take me ahlf the time.
B00HLK77YO|5|This is the locking tailgate latch that should have come on the Tacoma as standard equipment.  The quality of the PL5400 is at least equal to the factory latch.  I watched the you tube installation video a couple of times before starting my install.  The installation was very easy and the results were as expected - works fine!  I did use some white lithium grease on all moving, visible parts - locking mechanism, handle lever, actuator rods, etc.  This should be one of a Tacoma owners earliest  mods.
B007RHX1QO|5|The only door clips that stay in, hold tight, don't break, and don't rattle. The 50 piece bag was a waste because I replaced them all since they didn't hold the panels tight and they broke and rattled so much and were not worth the extra effort whatsoever. Don't be a cheapo, buy these because they work well and you won't find it cheaper elsewhere.
B00B51X8WU|5|Super nice and fast shipping
B00T6S94R2|5|Great kit, plenty of length to wire up on my 2008 Jeep Wrangler 2 door. For all the people that complain about the wire burning up bought the $15 cheaper wiring kit that really isn't made for a light bar, only the Heavy Duty wiring kit should be used on a light bar, the cheaper light duty kit should only be used for light pods or spot lights. It's a great kit and works perfectly, but if I had to complain about one thing it would be that the switch is a lot bigger than I thought, but that's just my opinion. Took about 45-60 minutes to install nice and stealth like. Would definitely buy again.
B00XX63IAW|5|It's a great product, but don't fit my nissan sunny 2003
B0055DOC60|5|Clamps were delivered on scheduled time. Great quality I highly recommend.
B00CHD4S56|5|Nice part, fits OEM worked perfect. CarPartsDepot always delivers.
B000CGRR4O|4|This Plews & Edelmann power steering hose is made/distributed by Parts Master as it would appear on the packaging. I replaced the original hose on my 1997 Jetta GL after 200,000 miles here in Portland Oregon. This aftermarket hose replacement does not appear to have the same quality as the OE hose. The hose did not have the braiding which appears to be stronger and allows for longer life. Also the end going into the rack was not crimped which holds the provided O-ring as well as the OE hose but does work fine if you are careful when installing. In addition it is required to thoroughly review the hose connecting ends because mine had a metal burr still attached inside that could have easily come loose and then would have been flushing through in my power steering system. Overall the bend perfect matched up to the OE hose and should provide a decent life of service. Note the (2) copper washers are required on the pump connection but only on (1) of the (3) rubber O-rings is needed for the rack connection. An 18mm open wrench is required for the rack connection and on the 1997 Jetta a 23mm wrench box end (15/16 is what I used) is needed for the pump connection. Hope this helps.
B00FQ0RH8W|5|it fit and my car started working properly after installation.
B00BM9JKO0|3|Looks good but had to cut to fit
B0006302M2|1|I've been buying this for a long time but im very disappointed in the handling of this order. It arrived leaking out of an envelope! What a joke!  Love this stuff, I use it on my couches several times a week. I was always forgetting to buy it so I was happy to see it on the subscribe and save options. NOw it comes to me just when I need it.
B009OQ4ZQQ|5|Just what I expected
B0013FW66C|3|Finally got one that worked!
B0039YWTLM|4|I bought these because my JBL 6x9s (powered by an Alpine amplifier) in my front had too much bass causing issues with speaker pop. This helped to correct some of the issue. I still get the pop, but now it is at a higher volume.<br /><br />I noticed a more robust sound quality from my door speakers after installing these. The sound blended well and I had much less distortion from the echoing into the door cavity.
B00JMAPWGG|5|My 2010 Mini Cooper non S runs great on this oil! I also use the Pentosin coolant.
B00HHGSEEE|5|great value and an easy way to replace the rear wheel bearings
B00EVQHGSI|5|A bit small for a wallet.
B004DS0CQ2|3|Well, to tell the truth, I love these lamps but there were defects in both of them. It look like cat scraching marks on the inside of both lights. The company wanted me to send pictures but I'm not that good with my computer in doing that so, I installed them. I will not bad mouth the company because it's my fault that I cant send a picture on my computer. So I will live with them. The company mean well and Amazon also . I will learn one day how to attach pictures to emails.
B001EYFN2Q|5|Great unit, had it installed with the in hull transducer. the Faria unit replaced a Lowrance unit which did not work well. Also this unit matches all the other gauges on our boat. great company with outstanding customer support.
B00757KJTI|2|It does not do a good job as an antenna but it looks good on the car
B0042FVQA2|1|It was not what I expected.
B00MF5FRV0|1|The battery on my motorcycle died so I used this to jump it off. It worked........ Once. Died down the road so I jumped it again and the box almost caught on fire and won't turn back on.
B00KBINF7G|1|I first used this to charge cell phones, etc. and it worked fine, but when I tried to jump start a car the first time, while the car started fine, when I removed the cables, I found the battery unit split open from the battery swelling up. A couple hours later, the battery must have shrunk and I could snap the case closed again, but I am now afraid to use it or even carry it around given the defective battery. Unfortunately, my first high-power use came after the Amazon warranty expired, so I guess I am just out the $$$. Back to gel-cells.
B0031IBSJ0|5|The right part, very fast shipping. Solve the problem instantly after been installed.
B00LNDQ930|5|Easy to install, the amount light is great.  They have a warm look but brighter than the 921 fixtures.
B008BVS3OA|5|Great

B00IAHIAYS|4|Exact fit
B005FK8BYM|5|good fit
B00OS9IAJW|5|Love  these floor mats. .  Just bought the new 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  I needed something other then the carpet mats that came with the Jeep..  Dresses the interior up and they fit really well.  Price is right!! n  Now I am looking for the Cargo Liner
B007P6R78A|5|It's really nice, thank you guys :)
B00MWIS8K2|5|Fit great!! Would definitely buy again
B00AERMVYC|1|Merchandise Returned due to taking long or to slow to check tire TPMS, about 15 to 20 minutes for 2004 Toyota 4Runner, sometimes it will read it sometimes it won't.
B007ND4P0S|3|I was hoping it would be brighter.  Replaced a bad bulb on my car and found that this one is way less bright than the other one currently on the opposite side of the car.  Now it looks funny at night.  Definitely go with a brighter one if you can find a good option.
B000EDUTRW|5|This is so much better quality than the on the self store bought ones. Last twice as long. It stands up better with the wind and travel vibrations. This is the replacement for my second roof top vent and the first one has been there for two years.
B000IYILDG|5|worked as I expected
B00DDVU6EI|5|Nothing changed. Im sure that it must have cleaned something.
B000C3BB2Q|5|At fit for Cherokee limited '95

B002JHDKK4|1|Bought both these and within a year they were both leaking and needed a complete rebuild locally
B00HD9TI7M|4|Worked great as a replacement passenger side mirror on my 2004 Honda CRV EX
B00KY8E734|5|Works great, sturdy not cheaply made, will order again if I need another replacement for my remote control
B0053ZAIYU|5|great product! i will re order more!
B00FBKUCH0|4|They make it so easy to order.  With the pics of the bulbs and the color of bulb you what your orderin .
B000ONZT5E|5|they put sugar In everything even that would Not think has sugar No wonder American People are so fat, so I was thinking the reason they use paper Air filters Is to make cars use more gasoline so I decided to build a Foam Air filter. For a 14 Inch filter You will need 3 filters and I used Rabbit floor pen wire for the frame and wired It together and used duct tape to hold the filter to the frame.
B007Q1MLOO|5|Good product.  Easy to install.  Fit perfectly.
B0009XT7NY|5|works great!  both fittings (R12 and R234) work fine.  great price
B00IK5CYQ0|5|They were excellent. Product arrived ahead of schedule. Everything i needed was there and installation instructions were simple and easy to follow. I would do business with them again and recommend them to friends and family
B00ZBCWAQ4|5|Excellent quality, heavy duty, adorable, and works great at keeping my car cooler!
B003WJ14QK|5|Making a wreath with this for OU.
B004JN57MU|1|It was VERY disappointing after opening my package that I was so excited to receive. I found a small note on the package saying &#34;simulated&#34;  They are fake. You stick them on your hood for looks. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
B009E2YX9E|4|The enclosed instructions were not for the style II stool. This part is for 3 different models and instruction for only 2. Fortunately I was able to find them on line and able to complete the job. The parts arrived very fast and were correct.
B001AGMHQS|4|Looks like it will do the job
B000EDQQD8|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00QGI2UIU|5|Allowed me to add disc brakes to front without having to change wheels

B0009OMY9M|4|worked fine as expected
B000C9E1KE|5|Works as it should. Plugs in pretty easily.
B004SB2L2W|5|Great product, that changes MY standard Dodge charger to a Mopar Charger
B002T47PEY|5|My 04 4runner rides like new again.
B001QQY00I|1|these letters were to big for my bumper 1997 Cobra convert.
B0042AJFPK|2|Small
B000EIZ6SY|3|First time using this product ,,, so far good
B0031BJ1PK|1|the one i tried got so hot it melted
B0026CH6FC|4|I just installed this on my 2010 Honda Pilot. There are 4 installation points which all line up with existing holes in the Pilot's hood so drilling is not necessary The two center square holes attached fine with the plastic inserts, screws and washers provided. The outer two holes, the little plastic screws provided would not 'grab' as I tightened them up into the plastic inserts, so I had to use my own small steel screws, which grabbed the plastic insert just fine. It looks good and seems to deflect well. Definitely worth the $44.60 and free shipping I paid for it.
B00SX5RSA4|5|Great quality and heavy duty, worked well.
B00U0FRC4W|5|Worked just fine. Just loosen the bolts and slide it in. The hardest part, which is not entirely necessary, was re-routing the coolant hose that normally runs from the heater core to the EGR. I was afraid of a leak in the EGR, so I bought a new hose and bypassed the EGR, going from the heater core to the thermostat housing. A serious PITA. If you have a CA emissions truck you are also going to need to wire in a &#34;finger stick&#34; which modifies the signal coming from the mass air flow sensor based on the position of the EGR valve. This clears the MIL light. I performed this mod while troubleshooting missing coolant, which turned out to be the head gasket. I have not noticed any change in performance good or bad.
B00HJ6Q9RG|5|On the driver side, so relatively easy to install.  After letting the system calibrate, it fixed my A/C issue.  Probably saved $$ versus repair shop.
B0091U2HZ6|5|A+
B001A6GQ7Y|5|real good value
B000NU87PM|5|This is the only type and manufacturers Synthetic blend of Engine Oil 5w20 I use for my both FORD cars I own. Now that Amazon seems to have matched local Walmart prices why do you have to waste gasoline and drive to Walmart stand in the line at the checkout counter? Just click and if you are 'Amazon Prime' member the ordered product arrives at your doorstep two days later on the clock. Cannot beat that convenience!<br /><br />The OEM Motorcraft's Synthetic blend of Engine Oil 5w20 is good product!  Recommended purchase!
B00332GMS6|2|terrible fit /will not stay down/don't match factory bed rail covers.
B004X973EA|5|Top of the line oil...
B000C2UHNG|5|High quality part replaced failed OEM.
B002HGFS3O|5|Excellent charger/maintainer...
B008841PKE|4|I just installed this on my Mazdaspeed 3 using ROLA part number 59833 cross bars.  Installation was super easy, just two bolts and two nuts, a bit difficult to sufficiently tighten the bolts because there isn't much clearance between the roof and the bolt, so I had to be careful not to swing the assembly wrench into the roof of the car, and they had to be tightened quite a bit to prevent the rack from sliding back and forth on the cross bars.  Before installing a bike on it I drove it to work today with the rack installed and I have no complaints about any squeaking or loud wind noise.<br /><br />I installed my bike on the rack today, it might take some getting used to lifting the bike up onto the roof and aligning the fork onto the pin.  I think there are better (easier to use) designs for fork mount axles out there, but this gets the job done.  It essentially replicates the axle on your front wheel, with the thumb lever for easy tightening.  The tray and strap has plenty of size margin, works great for my 2.25&#34; tires.<br /><br />I will update this review after I've used the rack a few more times.  For now, it's everything I wanted with the exception that it has no built-in locking features.  I will have to buy a cable lock or something if I want anti-theft.<br />UPDATE ~20 days later: Still working fine. One comment: it's a bit difficult to fit my mountain bike fork onto the pin, it's a tight fit, needs to be aligned just right for it to slide on.  Added photo.
B00U5UBQE4|5|100% Satisfied
B0025NDK7U|4|Comes in a nice boxed case with full instructions. Wish I had known about this system earlier I would still be driving my Lincoln
B00UYQU1J0|5|You can't go wrong with this. High quality, has weight to it, and a nice size. It feels like it is twice as expensive! Do yourself a favor and get this product.
B00T0WZHSO|4|Good
B00TG8C8PW|5|Fits perfect on my Hyundai Elantra. Doesn't cover my CA plates and looks very minimal. Just to my liking, thanks!
B00KCQSM9S|5|I love it make my car looks new again thank
B004LLGZEO|1|DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM WITHOUT A CHARGE CONTROLLER! This device killed two batteries in two different cars before I realized it was the cause! While it is supposed to be fine without a charge controller, my two batteries make it clear that it is not. I live in sunny CA so maybe that is the worst case, but batteries cost much more than this thing. Don't do it!
B003IS3HV0|3|I ordered this product a couple weeks ago after reading what seemed like hundreds of reviews - both good and bad. I decided to order both the Leather Honey cleaner and conditioner mainly because of the large amount of positive reviews. Now its my turn to review the products.<br /><br />First off, both products arrived over a week before the estimated delivery time. Good job Amazon! Looking at both bottles, they are a simplistic design - almost antique looking, not showy but not bland, i actually quite like the look myself. The instructions are fairly basic, but easy to follow and make perfect sense.<br /><br />Leather Honey cleaner:<br />I bought the 8oz bottle which comes concentrated, so i used a spray bottle and filled it with the recommend amount of water and Leather Honey Cleaner written on the back of the bottle, shook it up and it was ready to go. The bottle states that you put 2 tablespoons of cleaner to one cup of water, i found that i needed to put 3 tablespoons of cleaner to a cup of water because i couldn't get the cleaner to actually get in the leather and lift the dirt and grim - not until i put in the 3rd tablespoon. I used a brush to clean my leather car seats just because the brush can help get into the leather easier and bring up the dirt and grime. You will need to use a fair bit of elbow-grease for the product to work, but it does work. My leather is 24 years old - not ripping/tearing or anything, but is old, and the cleaner was nice and gentle on the leather, no harsh chemicals are used in the cleaner (as far as i am aware.) But the product does work.<br /><br />Leather Honey Conditioner:<br />Now the conditioner. As the name suggest, it is thick like honey, almost unpleasantly thick. Many people said you don't need to use gloves when applying the conditioner, but i would recommend using them as the conditioner is thick, it leaves a thin layer over your hands. When washing your hands it takes longer than it should as it is almost like cleaning oil or butter off of your hands, takes a while as the conditioner seems to repel the water. I used a rag to apply the conditioner as it was easier rather than a brush. The conditioner goes on pretty tough, so you will need to use some elbow-grease to spread it evenly over the leather. Some of the lower starred reviews, they stated that light coloured leather (like mine - cream colour) gets stained a darker colour than the original colour, and the company is aware of this too as they state on the back that some leathers may change colour, but over time will return back to the original colour. I didnt have this problem, so i'm not sure about the colour changing. The bottle also states that you leave the conditioner on the seats over night and wipe off the excess the next day, so thats what i did. The excess does wipe of, but it is tough because of the thick consistency. I found that it didn't leave a sticky feel, and it also leaves a nice shine. I sort of have a love/hate thought on this product because, yes it does condition the seats (made mine nice and soft and almost brought the life back to them) but it is thick and hard to evenly spread across the leather.<br /><br />Final opinion:<br />The leather cleaner is a non harsh chemical product that helps to clean seats, and yes it does clean the seats, but you have to use some elbow grease, and i found i needed to add more concentrated cleaner per cup of water to have the product have some more effect to the leather. Like i said earlier, my car seats are 24 years old, and being sitting in the Australian sun its whole life, they were very dry, so the cleaner helped clean and bring moisture back to the seats. The conditioner, would i use it again, yes, but would i use it on a ferrari... probably not. The thick, almost unpleasant consistency makes it difficult to spread evenly over the seats, but it also does its job, conditions and brings life back to the seats, and thats what a leather conditioner is meant to do.il or butter off of your hands, takes a while as the conditioner seems to repel the water.

B000IYSHY4|1|Bought this mirror.  Looks like it would fit but when I went to install it it didn't fit. Was very disappointed.
B004J5KY5S|5|a little tweaking with mixture screw but worked great!
B003IS3HV0|5|Good product
B003SZWYEE|5|This product has been working well on car for the past 5 months. I have no issues with it.
B00CFH9L88|5|Very good lock for the price. Fits Glock 17. Will  purchase again.
B00HE6CI58|1|Yes, these are well made, and yes they are bright, but they do not replace a 3022 bulb.  They are physically longer and don't fit my application which used 3022 bulbs.  If they had not claimed it would have replaced a 3022 i would have given it 5 stars.
B00MN92QI0|5|easy hook up and works great
B00II5YADC|5|A great tool for water removal saves on towel drying time.
B00YOC99HU|5|These are the perfect size for my friends car! I bought them as a gift, since she has a new little one (well, she's six months old) and she doesn't have much money so I saw how good of a deal this was and knew I couldn't pass it up! It's great for keeping her little six month old out of the sun on the long car rides around town, especially if they're out all day.<br /><br />This two pack of sun shades for kids definitely help keep the sun off her baby. They're really nice, durable, easy to use and side on the windows of her car, and really help on those bright, hot, sunny days! She absolutely loves it and I'm so SO Happy about the quality of these little sun shades! They work so well! Love it! Highly recommended!!! Perfect for ANY parent looking to keep their kids a bit cooler in long car rides or on days that are especially bright and hot!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.
B00K31MI5G|5|I was completely satisfied with the speedy service, quality, and workmanship of the license plate for my Grandaughter. Plus, both my Daughter and Son in Law are big into arts and crafts and they were very impressed as well. I enjoyed the color usage very much, and the lettering on the plate is perfect. When the opportunity arises, I will definitely order again!
B00DL1ZOMY|5|Great product
B004RJE32Q|5|Nice product easy install,looks great
B00BJNUWPK|5|Excelent genuine parts 100% recomended
B008YIQDVU|5|The mount is easy to install and works great
B00KTIR5UG|4|Good quality. Easy to replace your old worn out key.
B00I0FP7EQ|5|Works great. Happy with product.
B00KLIWMCU|5|Great product. Easy to secure and open! Everyone should have these!
B005O2ZUDQ|4|This visor perfectly matches my Hj09 Cl-16 green helmet. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the quality of the Visor. The color starts to slowly fade & leaves little dents in it over the smallest things. It is possible to wear this visor at night as long as you're not in a country area.
B00KH9PW3E|5|Is fantastic.
B004A6OG1Y|5|Awesome Radiator, fit perfect, Fixed all my over heating issues, arrived very fast as well. Thank You
B002KYLO2M|5|Super Mats!!!
B00HB8SVO6|5|Nice and bright. No problems with installations, wires are identified. As for the folks cracking the plastic on installation, remember its plastic, no need to tighten until cracked, just snug the screws and they won't crack.  I will order several more of these and put them on my utility trailers.
B00062ZDCW|5|A+++
B007HRSG3W|5|Love it. Got for the hatch for the cuddy on boat.  Works great.  Ordered 2 more for the engine hatch.  Made it so easy my wife and son can open it easily and that is a pretty heavy piece of fiberglass.  Best $ spent on boat accessories yet, Mark
B001445IZ8|5|Great Product
B00DM8N7R0|5|Looks great on my steering wheel. Perfect fit.  Thanks
B001A1MZ74|4|perfect fit. you can't tell it is not oem but price was very reasonable. I would get another one or set to get the shake out of the older oems
B00CUN607W|3|Fits good but slips off to mush
B00LEBLI82|5|Cool, and I mean it. I replaced all of my RV incandescent lights with these and couldn't be happier. Good light and it won't burn out the plastic covers.
B000C44CSA|5|Put them on my Safari GMC van replacing some standard big name shocks and the difference was marvy. Well worth the price difference from run of mill replacement shocks for vans and small trucks. Smooth and tough at the same time
B012I6ET5U|5|Good quality, easy install, fast delivery.
B006NZTZLQ|5|This thing is down right AWESOME! I have a 2005 Chrysler 300 that was showing a check engine light, the electronic throttle error light, and ABS light. This scanner was able to read the codes no problem and we were able to fix a problem that most other OBD II scanners would have a hard time finding. Definitely recommend this to any and everyone who needs an OBD II scanner.
B001DIECCK|5|works much better than the cheap type in the auto store.  The cheap ones have dilators that are very difficult to use, this set works great.
B00HEPH26O|4|good stuff,but a bit pricey
B000C2Y3MM|5|Fit perfectly. Seems like a robust hose. Installs pretty easily.
B00S8PJK3W|5|I love it! I get lots of great comments from people saying they want one too
B001O1TQ5E|5|Arrived fast, great color, work perfectly, love it
B0006JLW5C|4|ok
B00REQVA34|5|I've tried several without any that worked even close to this one.  I highly recommend this one, it met and exceeded my expectations !!!!
B000PAM9PO|5|ok
B003D27XD4|5|I purchased this radiator for a custom project I am doing. Quality was very high and the radiator/fan combo arrived quickly and with no damage. Be aware this is a custom install piece and does require modification to use. This is a VERY well made radiator and looks as good as it works.
B001LXMHL0|5|Great size and works out of the box. Purchase two compasses
B008KPSD60|4|It would be 5 stars if it was metal like I thought instead of plastic.
B00UTTCYD8|5|great deal !!!!
B003X3PQN2|5|cleared my clog,  will buy again
B001898WRA|3|Love the concept but the fit and function may make them not worth the purchase price. They don't fit without gaping and are impossible to get adjusted to where they do. When driving 50+ mph they flap like a tarp that only has 1 tie down. I've owned jeeps since the early 80's and as crude as those doors were, I think they were better then than now.
B001TK7CYM|2|These said that they work over glasses, but when I tried to use them they pushed against my glasses which made it uncomfortable to use.
B00T0WRZW0|5|fits great
B0053RXO94|5|Perfect fit...fast ship...happy..happy..happy
B00SBZAG5U|3|great product, for under ten buckaroos at fleeeebay!
B003ZWLWL6|5|Arrived promptly and fit perfect!  Great value for a DIY part changer.
B00635H4JG|5|the sticker says it all.
B00USRF8M0|5|I love the way it looks on my Camry.
B006DYFW4G|5|High quality replacement part.
B00I7ESKN0|5|Awesome products for half the price of competitors
B00AM3GJDC|4|Fit great! Connectors are just right for my 98 chevy prism. Took me 5 mins to install
B004GCGWV4|1|Did not for properly on mu Car
B00GOW6VAQ|4|perfect
B000BYB2IO|5|all good
B00FO3B2CS|5|works great and easy to install
B00MVMRS6O|5|These are the coolest! I have an older riding lawnmower that used the single element light automotive light bulbs that weren't very bright and got worse as the lenses began to yellow. I purchased these thinking that I would need to install all of them on some type of light bar or something to get the desired amount of light but boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />These little lights are BRIGHT! I easily drilled eight holes in the plastic grille across the front of the riding mower and mounted them using the nuts and washers that came on the lights. I then connected them to the wiring harness where it used to attach to the old lights and flipped on the switch.<br /><br />They give off LOTS of light and the light angle is pretty wide so you can see off to the left and right if where you're cutting as well. They don't have a very good spotlight effect but as slow as a riding mower is you can see plenty far ahead in case something or someone is in the way.<br /><br />Still have four left that I'm trying to figure out what to put on!
B00FFAUV7M|1|They don't give all the sizes that maybe needed
B004OULOHK|5|Ok so first off this grill looks great and its definitely stylish. It may not fit all models but it did fit my 2008 300 touring perfectly. It is a bit of labor to put on i suggest having someone else present at least to put your bumper back on but none the less about an hour or so of self labor and lots of money saved as opposed to a body shop. I notice alot of people complain about instructions which as EVERYONE HOPEFULLY KNOWS THERE ARE A MILLION VIDEOS ONLINE FOR EVERYTHING INCLUDING INSTALLING THIS. It may not show you a 2005 to 2010 model but generally car makers keep the same overall design in bolt placement. You will run into 2 things you may not like. 1# it does stick out a bit further than most would like and 2# the 2 top screw sockets may have to be fitted with longer house screws or whatever you can find which would explain the not fitting some models i guess. Other than that you will love it i hope.
B000IYR55G|5|Direct replacement for a 94 civic dx and it works awesome
B005WK7VW8|1|It's not fitting my 2006 Porsche Cayenne very well , the tag say Front-1 part number 34035. The Box was opened when I revived my package, I was supposed to receive a &#34; Budge Max SUV Cover Fits Medium SUVs up to 186 inches, UMX-1 - (Endura Plus, Gray)&#34;
B001DKT0DO|5|Makes it easier to fly through traffic at night and during the day. Especially during rush hours plus on the other hand you will not be cutting people off!
B00YB47CBG|5|Perfect
B0081S95FE|1|Had to switch gear, was too big to engage flywheel.  Then second start, it sparked and is no longer working.  Has a short to to ground case internally, now returning at my cost.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Told me what was wrong with my car and was correct..
B00BD4SLV2|4|They fit good on my 2003 jeep liberty.
B00UK55QA4|5|Looks Great
B007LACU6O|5|The color matches exactly for my Acura!<br />Extremely nice and genuine product!
B000DZHFR8|1|They blew after three month of having them
B00BCRM9RM|5|Love this in my car amazing
B002ZTNVTG|5|fit great and arrived in two days thanks
B00VVUWE4S|5|Problem solved.
B005JU5W54|5|easy to install
B002GP87NO|4|I like it very cool
B00ECTRBHA|5|Easy to put on your car. :)
B000FFY8VC|3|In extreme heat or cold, this will fall off your windshield.
B00429NKWK|5|Worked as advertised. Beats the $150 quote from a dealer and detailer.
B000NVW1LM|5|This really works!!
B007Y2SIGK|5|Did exactly as it purported to, and said it would.
B004I0HHXG|5|Great product. Tight, bright, and even came with a brand new bulb. Quality standards are the same as OEM. This is for a 03-05 4runner WITHOUT daytime running lights. The above user didn't realize that. If you have daytime running lights your bulb sizes are much bigger and this won't work for that.
B00GHT709W|5|Fits perfectly on my 09 Maxima SV and was a snap to install.  I could not believe the difference in steering performance.  I did end up getting some camber bolts as my camber was .05% out of specs, but that was a minimal task as well.  So far I have put about 10,000 miles on these (I replaced left and right at the same time) and could not be more pleased.
B0023040IS|5|Item as described, nice price, fast shipping
B000X3DEL6|5|No dust great stopping.
B004B68XGC|5|Ordered Sunday, arrived on Tuesday, used it today. Works fantastic! Easily got all of my 5th wheel tires to 80 psi. I typically run my F450 tires at 90 psi when not planning to tow for awhile (they are E rated / 110 psi) and decided to add 10 lbs just to see how it would go. Got up to 100 with no problem at all and much quicker than I would have thought. I don't have any doubt that this unit is up to the task of handling high pressure RV tires.<br /><br />Pump is heavy duty in design and all of the components work very well. Not cheap but there is a premium to pay for quality. Buy it.
