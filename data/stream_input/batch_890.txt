B00006F7IM|5.0|Hilarious take on major league baseball. Type of movie you can't turn off once it begins. Hard to fault this movie. Only comment is that the yanks aren't in Cleveland's division but any excuse to see NY go down is a good one!! Commentary of Bob Ucker is definitely a highlight. Worth the price of admission on its own.

0743290127|1.0|This book was horrible! It had as much substance as a soap bubble. That is what I get for buying the book because I loved Devil Wears Prada without checking the reviews. I will not go into depth because it has all been said but I hope that if enough one-star reviews are left someone might get the hint that having nasty, selfish characters that the reader hates and a pointless plotless story will turn off loyal readers. Writers these days need to take time to develop their books instead of churning out drivel so they can make lots of money while their name is hot! Maybe if it was quality writing (unlike this effort,) readers might stick around. I am done venting:)

B0026UV77C|5.0|Placebo has always been one of those bands that looks interesting in the way they like to make music or the way they come up with their lyrics. On \\"Battle for the sun\\" it caught my attention the fact that Brian Molko seems to be angry at something or someone or just desperate to say something to someone else and the way he reflected that in these songs is quite awesome. The songs have tons of attitude and the structure of them is well done. Also, it's obvious how the band decided to turn up the volume on the amplifiers to let the guitars do the work again! (a fact that had been put aside in a way on their last two albums: \\"Sleeping with ghosts (2003) and \\"Meds\\" (2006). Songs like \\"Ashtray heart\\" and \\"The never ending why\\" have the porpuse to rock out loud and the greatest thing is that they reach that goal with honors. \\"Battle for the sun\\" on the other hand is a progressive tune that it starts pretty lame but then, the band just explodes! Also, there are other tunes that are just meant to be liked a la \\"Placebo\\" way: \\"Bright lights\\" (an 80's touch on this one because of the tunes with the keyboards) and \\"Happy you're gone\\" (a ballad that we all expect from Placebo... not better than the awesome \\"Follow the cops back home\\"/Meds-2006). \\"Jullien\\" is the only track here that reminds us to what they had done on their last albums with electronic touches that just last for some minutes before they build up the song into something noisy with guitars again. \\"King of medicine\\" is just a great tune as well. An awesome intention from the band to sound bigger and greater than anything we could imagine. Strings, trumphets and some keyboards are the special guests on this song.<br /><br />It's so good to know that I was wrong when I listened to the single \\"For what it's worth\\" (the weakest song on the record by far... but not a bad one though) and thought that maybe Placebo would come up with just another decent record. This might be one of the best albums of 2009 and I even dare to say that this one beats U2's \\"No line on the horizon\\".that this one beats U2's \\"No line on the horizon\\".

0545091020|5.0|This is a YA book that a parent, teacher or any adult can also love. The plot can be traced to the story of Theseus in classical mythology, an Athenian youth offered as a tribute along with thirteen other young people to go into the labyrinth and be killed by the Minotaur.  Like Theseus, the heroine Katniss represents the best and brightest of young people in her district, and she offers herself in a fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games.      While this might seem like a strange choice to recommend for YA readers, the violence does not dwell on gore or pathological murderers.  My 7th grade students have been obsessed with vampire stories this year, and I believe The Hunger Games has a much more meaningful theme and purpose than those popular novels.  Even during the fighting, Collins' message to the reader is that the \\"games\\" are wrong; that they bring out the worst in some people, and compassion and teamwork in others.    Great characters, suspense, sensory details and all the action and romantic tension you could hope for.      In the upcoming sequel, _Catching Fire_, I hope to see Katniss making friends in District 11.  I think there may be more to the story about her father's death in the mine, too.

0143038583|5.0|Fifty years ago our family farm in Alcester, SD, had row crops, an orchard, cows, chickens, horses, pastures, woods and a cycle of rotation that preserved the land without chemicals. Today it has only corn and soy. There are no animals, no orchard, no pasture. The land is farmed from fence row to fence row with the fields no longer bordered in trees. It has gone from a pastoral to an industrial farm with \\"inputs\\" of fertilizer and pesticides and \\"outputs\\" that are inputs for other industrial farming processes such as cattle feeding. We rent the farm house to a man who works in a nearby slaughter house. The barn stores cars he rebuilds. This book explains how these not uncommon changes came about and how the fundamental changes in the food chain leave us vulnerable to disease, crop failure and taxpayer subsidized food.

B0026OE2O8|5.0|The Amazon Short Trailor is a very good introduction to the great work of Yann Arthus-Bertrand; decades already famous as aerial photographer, he has found now the best form of media: the FILM; breathtakingly beautiful, aesthetically, the feelings of moving, the viewpoint, even the background music - but most important is the core of that bold political statement: We can all point to our own nose when it comes to focus on thoughtless spoiling the finite resources of our planet! Fortunately, Europe faces many clever inventions in the field of renewable energies - much educational work is surely yet to make in Africa, Asia, India - and in the USA. There is Yann Arthus-Bertrand incidentally now pursued by the law: He was not allowed to film a million-Cattle-Farm from the air, legal trouble is in the house. The oppression of thought by the judiciary: a never ending theme? In Paris however Yann Arthus-Bertrand is incidentally celebrated as a hero, like a Robin Hood of the 21 Century! In fact, there are remarks in the film as the comment: \\"The property of money is in the hands of 2% of the people.\\" Oooh, my God, that hurts (whom?)! Here a daring aerial photographer is perfecting the genre of the movies leaving \\"art by art\\" and dares to bring some results of thinking it over to the public! My dearest wish is, that he would be supported instead of being criticized ...

B000UJ48WC|5.0|Okay, I must say. The Shining is an amazing film, it's suspenseful and scary. I will say that the way the atmosphere and and cinematography was really brought up on the Blu Ray transfer. It added more to Kubrick's horror masterpiece. It also has a lot of bonus material to keep the viewer happy. Not only that, it also has a play back option so when you take the disc out and put it back in the movie will play back where you left off which is convenient. The picture could not be any better/ clear. If you want to get the shining, get it on Blu Ray!
B001RIY4WE|2.0|The image and sound quality on this new Blu-Ray edition are fine according to my eyes and ears, so I'm rating it two stars despite the temptation to drop to one because of the irritation I experience whenever I put the disc into my player.<br /><br />Basically, this T2 release is a perfect example of how a Blu-Ray disc's UI can be badly designed and authored. I'm not even talking about the menus themselves (though they are sluggish and some of the interactivity options are confusingly presented); I'm talking about the amount of time one has to wait before even getting to the menus.<br /><br />On my player (Panasonic DMP-BD50K with the v1.9 firmware from 10 June 2009 - the most recent version at time of writing), here's how the schedule goes when this disc is inserted, with times given in minutes and seconds:<br /><br />0:00 - Press \\"Play\\".<br />0:44 - Player's front panel shows its first timestamp (0:00).<br />1:21 - Player starts a network connection.<br />1:45 - First appearance of any graphic on screen (a progress meter for the network connection).<br />4:16 - The \\"Skynet\\" UI comes up and shows me my zip code and the fricking *weather* in my area (because I apparently need to be informed of these things in order to watch the film) and then waits for me to press \\"Continue\\" before it'll do anything else.<br />5:16 - The first of several studio logos plays.<br />5:59 - \\"Skynet mainframe accessing\\" message appears on screen, telling me that because my player is BD-Live 2.0 compliant, the disc is downloading data for the menus (the full-motion clips, maybe?).<br />7:00 - The main menu finally appears and is accessible.<br /><br />Seven minutes of startup time. And this was a good run, too; I'd started timing a previous run in the week of the disc's release, but gave up after *twenty-five* minutes of staring at the \\"Skynet\\" graphic and waiting for the network download to complete.<br /><br />Now, my network connection isn't bad - I get firmware updates for my player without any difficulties. But even if it were that, this stinker of a UI violates two principles which I think are important for Blu-Ray authors:<br /><br />(1) It wastes time and bandwidth downloading useless and peripheral information, with no chance for the user to opt out short of disabling the network connection on the player ahead of time. When I put a disc in my player, it's because I want to watch the film on that disc, as hard as that may be for the T2 disc author to believe. If I want to find my zip code, I'll remember it (or look it up on my mail or the USPS web site); if I want to know what the current weather is like in my region, I'll poke my head outside. This is unforgivable.<br /><br />(2) It won't finish loading on its own: unless I press \\"Continue\\" after the \\"Skynet\\" zip-code/weather screen, it'll just stay there. (And disabling the network on the player in advance, while it does save some start-up time, leaves me with the same problem: in this case, the UI notes that no connection is available and then waits for me to confirm.) It's bad enough that the disc takes so long to load, but making me spend that time waiting at the player to click a confirmation button - as opposed to letting me go and use the time elsewhere - strikes me as very poor design. Discs should load all the way to the main menu before requiring user interaction.<br /><br />This is the first time I've been tempted to write to a studio (Lionsgate) and ask them to re-author a disc with features omitted. As noted above, I'm very happy with the presentation of the film: I just wish I could extract it from this awful, irritating disc UI and save myself some time and frustration.UI violates two principles which I think are important for Blu-Ray authors:    (1) It wastes time and bandwidth downloading useless and peripheral information, with no chance for the user to opt out short of disabling the network connection on the player ahead of time.

0312427646|4.0|I bought a few books in London this week and while packing for the flight back home I put The Uncommon Reader in my bag simply because it is a slim book. I was holding the book while walking down the aisle to my seat, and this man smiled widely at me from his seat, pointed to the book, and said (in Hebrew): \\"This is the funniest book in the world\\". I told him I haven't started reading it yet, and he said: \\"lucky you!\\". So when I sat down in my spacious EL AL economy-class seat and opened the book, expectations were high.<br /><br /> Alan Bennett is the author of known West End plays, most recently \\"The History Boys\\". In this book he weaves an exquisitely lovely and quintessentially British story about Queen Elizabeth II becoming an avid reader in her old age. Chasing her dogs on a walk through the palace grounds, she stumbles upon a travelling library van, where she meets Norman, who works in the royal kitchens. The young boy introduces Her Majesty to the world of books and becomes her confidante in the matter of reading, after the Queen promotes him from the kitchen to become her personal assistant. She struggles through the first book - which she borrowed from the library van only out of her \\"sense of duty\\" - but quickly enough she starts devouring books at a brisk rate.<br /><br />Reading eventually interferes with her duties as Queen and people around her conspire to return things to normal. She embarrasses the Prime Minister and other dignitaries by asking them about their literary preferences, only to discover most of them do not read. The book builds to a crescendo when the Queen decides to dabble in writing herself and takes the necessary (and logical) step to allow her to do so.<br /><br />This book is a love poem for reading, so any reader will love it. The humour is good and I did laugh out loud a couple of times (to the consternation of my fellow travellers). Even though I wouldn't necessarily label it as \\"the funniest book in the world\\", it is a book I recommend with all my heart.art.

B001TODCII|3.0|I thought Luc Besson directed this, but it turns out he is the producer (and a writer). I do like some of Besson's movies, particularly Femme Nikita and The Professional. Likewise, I've always felt Liam Neeson's films had a certain level of class.     Taken is written at a surface level. The characters are not developed very deeply, and the movie is mostly about intrigue and action -- a bit of the former, but mostly the latter. Action is of the Jason Bourne type -- walk into a roomful of bad guys and render them all helpless in 15 seconds. A little unrealistic for a man of any age, let alone Neeson's. Think Indiana Jones in revenge mode.     As a pure action movie, it is competent and exciting, if a bit formulaic. I'm afraid that I've seen enough of these types of films that the sheer kinetic energy of some of the scenes is not enough for me. I think a quieter, more sleuth-like sniffing out the trail leading to the hero's kidnapped daughter would have been more dramatic, even if it induced less adrenalin. And a lower body count, with slower kills of the really really bad guys might actually have been more cathartic.     The ending seemed a bit abrupt. For example, there's no exposition on how the French authorities cleaned up the messes our hero exposes and leaves behind, and how they deal with the corruption in their midst. I wanted to see that resolved.     And while the cause seems just, I'm still just a bit uncomfortable with the special forces-style vigilantism that is glorified here.     If you don't want to think too hard, and watch a lot of nameless sinister folk get quickly shot or pummelled into submission, Taken will occupy you for an evening.

B001KVZ6F2|2.0|I waited and waited for this movie to premire on Blu-ray because I thought that I was going to see Eastwood in a revised character of SFPD. I was so totally disappointed with the fact that a man this old used his money to be able to re-live his American life by drudging up all the nasty names ever used by people in this nation to show their hatefulness and disrespect for other Americans. This was a total waste of my money. I could have tuned in to the Fox Talkshows or listened to Rush Limbaugh for this experience. Once again, there must be real hatred in the heart of Clint Eastwood because time has taken away his prized America that won't allow him the luxury of feeling superior and legal permission to stand out in the streets and spew his disdain for fellow Americans. I hope this film gave his the outlet that he so desparately seems to need to show minority Americans how he really feels about them all. It equaled his speech at the Oscar awards many years ago. To me, this film was an insult to be stowed away like BIRTH OF A NATION.

0061854549|5.0|To be able to make a case that much of our thinking is irrational (not based as much upon facts as we think) would be incredible enough. To do it in such an entertaining manner makes this book well worth the money.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but I felt that his writing set up the story that was going to happen for you instead of just letting the story happen.  He seemed a little too literal in his explanations of things, which in turn made it very obvious what was going to happen in the book.  I think there was only one thing that I didn't already know in advance was going to happen, where I thought one thing was and then another did, and that was only at the very end.  (So I won't share what it was here), so I was a bit disappointed in the suspense aspect of this book.  However, having said that, I did not want to put it down.  Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still wanted to read it.  So that is a good thing.  I am glad I made it through because his second book in the series is much better on not laying everything out for you before it happens.  So it has been a much more enjoyable read.  This is a decent sized book at about 5800 kindle locations.    Rachel

B001DDBCV4|5.0|I have to tell you I was a little skeptical (ok a lot skeptical) when I heard they were making a Sex and the City movie. Even when I found out that all the same actors were going to be in the film, I just didn't really believe that they could take the nature of the series and turn it into a storyline that would wrap in the length of a film and still be true to the series.  I was so wrong.  They really did an outstanding job.  I loved the fact that Mr. Big became more of a real person in the movie, something I always found lacking in the series (especially since I was definitely in the Big camp versus the Aidan camp.)  I smiled a LOT at the dialog and felt my heart almost literally break at one point (which I won't spoil.)  I am only sorry that I did not realize, and therefore did not wait, for the extended version, because, of course, I HAD to have it.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry.  I also feel that you CAN watch this movie if you did not see the series.  The background us die hard series fans will have does certainly enhance the movie experience, but the movie is enough of a story in its own that you can understand and enjoy it independantly from the series.
0061854549|2.0|Dan is asking very interesting and important questions in this book. He comes with sometimes valuable insights as well. My problem is with methodology of his experiments and trustworthiness of his conclusions. The results variations are often very insignificant and, since size of groups is not disclosed, it is hard to imagine them to be statistically representative. I have expected more.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|For those of us who saw this movie as one star rating quality, I have come up with an alternate interpretation that may be of some comfort.  The movie was not really about Indiana Jones at all.  It was about the Ukrainian spy woman, who was the driving force behind the movie.  It was her story, told from her viewpoint.    She used her mind control on Lucas and Spielberg to think they were making it about Indiana Jones.  But look.... Here she is, a super-smart person interested in knowing it all.  How else is she going to learn these secrets except to pretend to be working for the Russians?  How else is she going to fund her trips, and insure her safety?  With her accent would the Americans fund her?    From her elevated-intellect point of view the Russians are mental androids, and Indy and his companions not much better.  Look how quickly the kid establishes mental rapport with monkeys!    In her quest she gets one of Indy's buddies to keep dropping tracking devices, having planted the mind control suggestion that he is doing this for the treasure, and she persists in her search until she finds the aliens who know what she has been searching for.    Although her intellect is less than the aliens, he/they see that she has been diligent in seeking the learning they possess, and so they help her achieve her goal of enlightenment, and this enlightenment enables her to transcend the physical body, and follow the aliens into higher consciousness.    However, she does make a short trip back to earth to get Lucas and Spielberg to film her story, before she returns to her new aliens friends.    It's not much comfort perhaps, but the movie was so awful otherwise, that this alternate view might work.

Then I picked up this book, but was disappointed because it seemed like it was going back and forth about the same thing.  I liked the fact though that I learned some Ukrainian history and the struggles with aging fathers who start dating much younger women.  It shed some light on aging and family relationships as well.  It was not funny though.  There were some times where I was chuckling a little bit, but this was not a comedy to me.  I really don't know why some of the critics described it as a comedy.

One reason I listen to music it to help me FORGET about them. She should save this stuff for rallies where people can go get revved up for their cause or whatever.

B001UREJWM|5.0|This studio recording is just like the other Sabbath and Dio CD's, powerful. The heavy guitar licks, pounding bass riffs and solid drum beats make this CD a joy to listen to. Ronnie James Dio's vocals soar over the music tracks that the music trio lay down. As always, the subject matter is on the dark side. \\"Bible Black\\" tells a story that resonates with many people. The combination of the music and the lyric content make this CD a must for all Sabbath and Dio fans to have. This recording re-states the metal still rocks the world.

0312370849|5.0|This book reveals clearly part of history that good manners have caused us to cover less thoroughly and with less emotion.  The dual-plot approach used allows us both the objectivity of current times and the emotions of the past--while there is nothing we an do to reverse the past, understanding it more clearly at the level the author uses when writing about it allows us to more clearly examine the many motivations involved that caused this to happen.  For example, at a personal level, what did the French police experience, and why did they not rebel against the orders to take French citizens prisoner?  Another example:  why did the neighbors who the French Jews had befriended stand by and allow the evaccuation?  Finally:  why did the neighborhoods surrounding the camps in France not erupt with French protestors standing for the rights of the evacuees?      An excellent book not only on this piece of history, but on human behavior in general.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I don't like everything Disney (or Pixar) ever did, but Up is in a class with Ratatouille and Wall-E. You've no doubt seen the spoilers and know about the protagonists and plot by now by now, so this is just to add to what others have said. I'm 52; my 16 year old son and I went to see \\"Up\\" together, and we both truly enjoyed it and plan to buy the DVD. We saw the 3D version just because the time was convenient, and it was fun, but I don't think you need the 3D to appreciate the movie.     Like some other reviewers, I think the story of Carl and Ellie is done gracefully. I got teary when Ellie died (and found myself wondering how I could be crying over a fictional animated character, especially since I had read the plot and knew it was coming). Yes, there is a certain amount of Disney-villain formula and some stock characters, but that's been happening at least since commedia dell'arte in the 15th century (smile).     Once one suspends disbelief enough to accept the stylized animation, and that a house could be lifted by a giant clump of balloons, it seems silly to quibble over how many balloons there are, how they got inflated overnight (and the strings got down the chimney...) etc. It's a charming movie, and very pretty.

B000E6EGXM|5.0|Britten's premiere recording of his masterpiece, the War Requiem, is an acknowledged classic, but in the 47 years since we've had quite  lot of choice among other recordings. Here's a rundown of the versions I know. I think they are all the major ones:<br /><br />The greatest enthusiastic is deserved for Richard Hickox's 1991 War Requiem on Chandos, the best studio version in the decades after the composer's recording. The conducting is powerful and heartfelt, the chorus exemplary, the soloists -- Philip Langridge, John Shirley-Quirk, and Heahter Harper -- all distinguished Britten performers who were closely associated with him; I'm extremely glad they got the chance to set down their performances, which run second only to the Decca soloists'.<br /><br />Turning briefly to other competitors, John Eliot Gardiner's set on DG, recorded with a German orchestra and his own Monteverdi Choir, has ugly, shrill sonics and soloists not well attuned to the pathos of Owen's poetry. Simon Rattle on EMI is much better but feels underplayed to me, despite excellent forces all around. Robert Tear and Thomas Allen are outstanding vocalists, and they enunciate the poetry better than anyone else, but Rattle's gentle, elegiac tone makes for little drama. I suppose he eschewed outright anguish on purpose.<br /><br />Kurt Masur with the NY Phil. (Teldec) is much too cautious, despite the excellent duo of Thomas Hampson and Jerry Hadley in the male solo parts. A budget issue from Naxos recorded at a summer festival in Scotland, directed by Martyn Brabbins, is quite powerful and direct, with particularly excellent choral work but too-literal soloists. A live reading under Giulini on BBC Legends finds Peter Pears singing with even mire passion than on the premiere recording -- it's a nearly great performance despite so-so broadcast sonics. Finally, 2008 saw a German performance under the veteran but ordinary Helmut Rilling (Haenssler), who can't quite rise to the occasion. Even so, his male soloists, Christian Gerhaher and James Taylor, are attractive, one of the most lyrical pairings on disc. Tayor's light tenor manages to be quite poignant at times. Also worth noting are the excellent chorus and vivid SACD sound. No rival version can compete sonically.  If only Rilling were more menacing and less tame in places.<br /><br />This narrows the choice down to Britten and Hickox, both with the London Sym. Both also have excellent sonics, though Chandos's digital engineering is more close-up and impactful. It adds to the forceful drama of Hickox's interpretation, contrasted with the more mournful tone of Britten's. If you want maximum excitement, this is the recording to get. In the solo parts, I recognize the unique position Peter Pears occupied in Britten's music, but for beauty of voice, he's bettered by Langridge for Hickox, who's nearly as sensitive and poetic.<br /><br />Between the two baritones, I have no hesitation preferring Shirley-Quirk over Fischer-Dieskau. Britten was making a pacifist point by picking a singer from Germany in the post-Nazi era, but F-D's command of English can't compare to Shirley-Quirk's, who also blessedly lacks F-D's bark. Neither soprano is ideal, Vishnevskaya being too piercing (as Slavic sopranos tend to be) and Heather Harper, although graceful and sincere, past her prime.<br /><br />On both sets the LSO plays magnificently, and the various choirs, adult and children's, are exemplary--but again, Hickox's dramatic thrust and the closer miking from Chandos give more visceral impact to the choruses in his recording. I've tried to impartially summarize each version, and overall I am glad to own both. If you wanted only one? My choice would be the Hickox, for the reasons already stated.<br /><br />P.S. 2013 _ Last year's fiftieth anniversary of the War Requiem occasioned two notable recordings, one Dutch, the other English. The Dutch one, under Jaap van Zweden is musically appealing but has middling good vocal soloists. The English one, under the opera veteran Gianandrea Noseda, is perhaps the most dramatic ever recorded, with exceptionally clear delivery of the poetry from tenor Ian Bostridge and baritone Simon Keenlyside. I've posted a complete review, but thinking in terms of the whole field, the Noseda rivals Hickox and even Britten himself.he English one, under the opera veteran Gianandrea Noseda, is perhaps the most dramatic ever recorded, with exceptionally clear delivery of the poetry from tenor Ian Bostridge and baritone Simon Keenlyside.

B00003CXRM|1.0|I was in Miami with my wife at the moment in which this movie premiered on theaters at the U.S.A.; and knowing that it has been directed by the talented Coen brothers, rushed to the cinema to see it at once, thinking that we were going to find something close to \\"FARGO\\" or \\"THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE\\".<br />Unluckely, 20 or 25 minutes after the beginning of the film, we found ourselves looking at each other, and thinking something like \\"When will the usually original and funny Coen movie's plot begin?\\". Well, It never did...<br />We waited for 10 or 15 fifteen minutes more, and as nothing interesting was yet happening on the big screen, took the decision of leaving the theater, and drove back to our hotel... Perhaps, we still had the chance to catch another movie -anyone would be better than this- on our room's pay per view TV.<br />By the way, anyone who intends to understand why the Coen brothers gained their fame of being part of today's great American filmakers (like Clint Eastwood, Martin Scosese, Francis Ford Coppola or Aaron Aranofsky), should see (i) the excellent \\"FARGO\\" (with Frances Mc Dormand and Willian H, Macy), (ii) the very good \\"THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE\\" (with Frances Mc Dormand, Billy Bob Thornton and James Gandolfini) and \\"BURN AFTER READING\\" (with Frances Mc Dormand, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich), or (iii) the good \\"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN\\" (with Javier Bardem -winner of the best supporting actor's Oscar for this performance-, and Tommy Lee Jones), who won the 2007 best film Oscar, although it should have gone, instead, to Paul Thomas Anderson's much better \\"THERE WILL BE BLOOD\\"; absolutely avoiding \\"BARTON FINK\\" or this one (\\"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?\\").

1400082773|4.0|In the introduction to the 2004 version, President Obama says he would cut the book by 50 pages today.  I would really like to read THAT version of this book.  I also felt it went on too long at times (especially the part when he was in Africa, he went into extensive detail about some of his experiences there that were just not that interesting to me).      But it is very fascinating to read about his early life, knowing as much as we know about him today.  His upbringing was not privileged, and fractured in some ways, but to me that makes him really normal and American.  I found his description of his work as a community organizer in Chicago to be of significant interest, and the best part of the book, because it is obvious that that experience taught him how to listen to people, to take their words to heart, and champion their causes as if they were his own.  I am very pleased that the President of the United States has that kind of empathy, and I think we would all do well to develop that in ourselves.    Overall, it's an extradordinary book about an extraordinary person, and I think we are lucky to have it as a way to understand our President's story.

0143036556|3.0|Diamond is probably best known for his book GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES, which dissected the reasons that certain societies thrive while others sputter and die out. And it's hard not to compare this book to that one, as both cover similar territory. But while GUNS continually introduces new principles contributing to the fate of societies throughout the book, Collapse seemed to just introduce new cases to illustrate the same principles repeatedly. And for that reason, it started to lose my interest about midway through.<br /><br />To be sure, there are interesting stories. I was fascinated by the Easter Island section, in which it seems that those giant statues for which the islanders became so famous were most likely the greatest cause of their demise; so many resources were burned through as different groups on the island competed to build larger monuments that before too long, there were no trees and the environment was in shambles.<br /><br />The answer of this book's central question (Why do societies collapse?) is that they use up their natural resources. And perhaps that's why it felt monotonous to me at parts. There is no mystery, as the title of the book suggests. It's resource management. And we see this again and again. The way it happens varies from case to case, and Diamond outlines several factors that can create, or combine to create, natural catastrophe. He also uses varied cases, both in time and place--Pacific Islanders, Anasazi, Vikings, Mayans, modern Rwanda and Australia and his home state of Montana, where the current struggle for land management is critical. But with all these varied examples, it's the same story over and over.<br /><br />Diamond does not take a tree-hugger's perspective to the issue of environmentalism, and there is nothing obviously political in his approach. It's a cautionary tale, for certain, but he both criticizes and applauds modern efforts by governments, organizations and corporations for their roles in resource management. Because, as the cases illustrate, environmentalism is not a political matter. It's not about being able to go camping. It's a matter of survival. When a society depletes its resources, through mismanagement or war, or because its population grows so large that its natural resources cannot support it, collapse is eminent.management.

B00005ONMP|5.0|I have owned the original double jewel case in a slipbox version of these recordings from the time of their release, and the original rave review from The Gramophone. They were not an inexpensive purchase for me in my younger years - the original cost of the set was $60 (!). Listening through the set at that time, I had no regrets about my purchase. I am pleased to say that these discs continue to get pulled from my library shelves and listened to with some regularity.<br /><br />I have always found Abbado's approach lithe and refreshing. The Lobgesang, Symphony 2, remains a powerful, thrilling and, yes, Romantic (note the capitol \\"R\\") performance. The remaining symphonies are played with robustness, and verve. I really do not understand the Classical:Romantic divide opined in other reviews. Mendelssohn is right on the line. The important thing is that Abbado brings a real lyrical and rhythmic sweep to these performances that makes them both timeless and profound.<br /><br />This set seems to be selling for under $20 on amazon now. The sound remains full, and the contents have been augmented by some of Abbado's other Mendelssohn recordings (the Octet for example. At this price its a MUST HAVE addition to your classical music library.<br /><br />This is a set that will provide a lifetime of enjoyment.

The recordings will last as a tribute to Porcupine Tree and their 70's style alternate rock.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|First, let me preface this opinion by writing that this is my favorite animated pictures of all time. I never thought that I would say that after Wall*E. Pixar has brought to us a perfect film as well as a gift. This film has everything, including tenderness, laughs, and the message we sometimes forget: always follow your dreams.    The ten minute, wordless sequence within the first 15 minutes is one of the most tender, sad and beautiful ever memorialized, in its simplicity, wordlessness, background music, and its universality. My wife, my son, most of the theater, and I'm not embarassed to say, me, were in tears.    The rest of the film is filled with outright laughs, your archetypal villain, a rare bird named Kevin, talking dogs reminiscent of the Wicked Witch's Monkey Battalion in Oz,and an eight year old scout, Russell, that is attemping to obtain his helpng the elderly badge who eventually takes the nominal place of Carl's wife in the adventure that Carl's wife was never able to realize, but who is always present in spirit.    Ellie's ever-present spirit is always a counterpoint to the great action in the film, and the underlying sadness and devotion never leaves the viewer.    The ending brings us full circle in the relationship between Carl and Russell, which is reminiscent of Carl and Ellie's relationship. especially when Carl gives his most prized possession to Russell. I must state that the film trailers do not do justice to the finished product, similar to the Adam Sandler vehicle \\"Click\\", which was completely mismarketed and which was similar to the themes in \\"Up\\".    No one's description of this film can do justice to its excellence.    I give it the highest rating.

You fall deeply in love the characters and the ending just about broke my heart in to pieces.     I know it's marketed to young adults and honestly, I would probably allow my pre teen child to read this, but we would have to discuss it all the way through just because it is so emotionally intense. I do think this book is a good way to introduce the subject of WWII and the Holocaust that isn't strictly from the point of view of the persecuted people.
B00092ZL80|1.0|The portion of this concert that features Earth, Wind and Fire is great.  Unfortunately the Chicago set is drab.  Without Peter Cetera Chicago looks like an old bunch of guys that can't really sing all that well.      What's even worse the first copy I received of this concert got through to the third song of the Chicago set and blitzed out and then froze on the screen.  I sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new copy that did the same thing.  I tried again to send it back but couldn't get Amazon to take it back a second time.      If all you are going to listen to is the EWF set you will probably like this disc.  The rest of it is crappy in quality of the disc and the performers.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie is absolutely precious.<br /><br />Here's the basic concept: Sometime in the future, humans' greedy consumerist ways and blatant disregard for the environment catches up to them. The human race is forced to abandon Earth to live on giant floating spacecraft. However, they leave an army of \\"cleaning\\" robots, called WALL-Es, behind to clean up the planet. The idea is that, once the robots finish their work, the humans can return to a nice, shiny planet.<br /><br />We quickly see, however, that even hundreds of years later, the planet isn't really clean. Towers of neatly compacted garbage are everywhere, and most of the WALL-Es have broken down, save one, the hero of our tale. Little WALL-E still gets up every morning and compacts garbage all day long, but he also sifts through the refuse for items of interest, which he takes back to the little home he's made for himself. WALL-E loves show tunes. But most of all, WALL-E is lonely.<br /><br />Everything changes for our little metallic friend when EVE, a drone robot from one of the floating spacecraft, returns to Earth to see if the planet can once again support life. (Allowing humans to return and repopulate the Earth.) It's pretty much love at first sight for WALL-E, and things get even more complicated when Eva does, indeed, find evidence that it's time for a wayward race to return home.<br /><br />Even though the concept of the movie is a little preachy, the story is brilliantly executed. For a film in which there's hardly any dialogue until more than halfway through, you feel amazingly connected to and vested in the robotic characters, primarily because they seem to exhibit more humanity than some of the flesh and blood folks. Kids would love it, but parents will really enjoy it, too. Truly a film appropriate for the whole family.

B001EVPBY4|5.0|... that is to say, an acquired taste. French Baroque opera is distinctly different from Italian -- including that most famous of Italians, il Caro Sassone, resident in London -- or German. Being an ardent fan of Handel or Hasse will not guarantee that you'll 'cotton' to Jean-Baptiste Lully. The Italian opera structure of recitativo > da capo aria never dominated French opera. Thus the vocal acrobatics associated with the great castrati are NOT to be heard in Lully or his successors in Paris. Librettists in Lully's France had reason to write proudly, since clear, expressive articulation of the WORDS was the paramount virtue; thus there were few melismata, but many strophic repetitions. If you speak French, you can't NOT understand. The music involves very little counterpoint; in comparison with Handel or Scarlatti, French Baroque will inevitably sound fluffy, mannered, shallow... and yet it has its beauties.<br /><br />If you know the operas of Monteverdi, perhaps you'll recognize the derivation of the French style from the \\"ritornelli\\" of that supreme composer and his contemporaries. I wonder if the usual historical perception of Lully -- that he adopted the French taste -- has any logic. Listening to Cadmus et Hermione, I'm inclined to think Lully outright invented the French taste based on his curiously provincial musical education and his inclination toward the musical manner of an earlier generation of Italian composers. I've combed the French repertoire of the first half of the 17th Century, and found very little there that prepared the world for Lully. Love him or hate him, he was a major innovator.<br /><br />Here's a brief biography of Lully, culled from another source: \\"Lully was born in Florence, Italy. Lully had little education, musical or otherwise, but he had a very natural talent to play the guitar and violin and to dance. In 1646, he was discovered by Roger de Lorraine, the chevalier de Guise, and taken to France, where he entered the services of Mademoiselle de Montpensier (la Grande Mademoiselle) as a scullery-boy and Italian-language teacher. With the help of this princess, his musical talents were cultivated. He studied the theory of music under Nicolas M&eacute;tru. It has been said that a scurrilous song on his patroness (the doggerel he set to music refers to a \\"sigh\\" she produced while at stool) resulted in his dismissal. It is far more likely that he did not want to moulder out in the provinces with the exiled princess. He came into Louis XIV's service in late 1652, early 1653 as a dancer. He composed some music for the Ballet de la Nuit, which pleased the king immensely. He was appointed as the composer of instrumental music to the king and conducted the royal string orchestra of the French court, Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi  or the Grande Bande. He tired of the lack of discipline of the Grande Bande and, with the King's permission, formed his own Petits Violons. Lully composed many ballets for the King during the 1650s and 1660s, in which the King and Lully himself danced. He also had tremendous success composing the music for the comedies of Moli&egrave;re, including Le Mariage Forc&eacute; (1664), L'Amour M&eacute;decin (1665), and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme (1670). It was when he met Moli&egrave;re that together they created the Com&eacute;die-Ballet. Louis XIV's interest in ballet waned as he aged, and his dancing ability declined (his last performance was in 1670) and so Lully pursued opera. He bought the privilege for opera from Pierre Perrin and, with the backing of Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the king, created a new privilege which essentially gave Lully complete control of all music performed in France until his death.<br />He was known to be a libertine.  Although his life is full of meteoric heights, his love affairs with men and women also brought him down in scandal several times at the great displeasure of Louis XIV. Despite these scandals, he always managed to get back into the good graces of Louis XIV, who found Lully essential for his musical entertainments and who thought of Lully as one of his few true friends. On January 8, 1687, Lully was conducting a Te Deum in honor of Louis XIV's recent recovery from illness. He was beating time by banging a long staff (a precursor to the bâton) against the floor, as was the common practice at the time, when he struck his toe, creating an abscess. The wound turned gangrenous, but Lully refused to have his toe amputated and the gangrene spread, resulting in his death on 22 March.\\"<br /><br />Just as Monteverdi's operas always began with a 'philosophical' prologue, featuring divine personages, Lully's Cadmus et Hermione commences with a fulsome tribute in music and dance to Apollo, the Sun God, rather obviously alluding to Louis XIV, the Sun King. There's nothing subtle about the flattery here, but the music is deliciously coy and sensual.<br /><br />Although C&H is announced to be a \\"tr&aacute;gedie lyrique\\", no modern audience will detect anything tragic in it. It's a heroic love story with a happy ending, enlivened by comic scenes of cowardice, indelicate boasting, and bizarre stage-business. The 'harmony' achieved between the mortal lovers is paralleled on Olympus by the reconciliation of the immortals Jupiter, Juno, Mars, and Pallas, all of whom have appeared on or above stage, tampering with human affairs as usual. Such Harmony is, I think, the philosophical 'burden' of all the musical frivolity.<br /><br />This production by the French company Le Po&eacute;me Harmonique represents the apotheosis of historical authenticity. All the sets, the stage machinery, the costumes, and even the lighting are as authentic as the 'original' instruments of the orchestra. Lit only by candles, yet filmed digitally! What a strange, cognitively disparate concept! It takes a while for one's eyes to accept the warm yellow tinge that suffuses the 42-inch LCD screen, but it's certainly worth the effort. In the end, the visual splendors and the ingenuity of the stage machinery and 'flat' sets turn out to be a testimonial to the artistry of pre-modern times.<br /><br />To be effective in such a production, both singing and acting styles must be as 'authentic' and deliberate as the staging. No singer can just let her/his voice carry the role; every facial expression, ever hand gesture, every posture must also be theatrical, Baroque, stylish. The Comedie Française has perpetuated this highly codified, mannered technique of acting, in its productions of Moliere and Corneille; if you've seen such productions, you'll recognize that Le Po&eacute;me Harmonique has learned its lessons there. The 'aesthetic' of this French opera-theater is in fact a total Harmony of the elements of words, music, and stagecraft.<br /><br />Obviously, as in any kind of opera of any era, the production is only as good as the singing. On this DVD, the singing is spectacular, within the canon of French Baroque taste, bien entendu! Above all, Claire Lefilliâtre sings the role of Hermione with technical control of her ornamentation and musical diction that sets a new standard of perfection for other singers. Ornamentation is the soul of French Baroque. It's not ad libitum. It was precisely notated. It has to sound effortlessly elegant, without overwhelming the melodic rhetoric. It has, in effect, to enhance the words, not obfuscate them. Claire Lefilliâtre achieves exactly that. Andr&eacute; Morsch delivers the role of Cadmus with lush timbres, but the stage-stealing male star of this production is Arnaud Marzorati, in the comic roles of Pan and Arbas, the boastful cowardly subaltern of Cadmus. As Pan in the prologue, Marzorati sings, dances, and plays the bagpipes.<br /><br />Ballet was another central ingredient in the French 'taste' established by Lully, himself a superb dancer. In this production there are proficient dancers galore, but the singers must also dance. Sing, act, dance! Quite a challenge, n'estpas?<br /><br />The orchestra pit is visible on screen at times, a mere foot or two from the stage candles. You'll see 36 musicians down there. The strings include both the violin family and gambas. There are oboes, recorders, bagpipes, bassoons, theorbos, harpsichords, percussion, and a rare delight, the \\"trompette\\", which is not what you may think. You'll hear its peculiar timbre in the climactic scenes of Act V. I'll let you guess what the \\"trompette\\" might look like.<br /><br />This is a glorious production in every detail. It's not the only way to bring French opera to a modern audience; there are also radically modern multi-media productions of Lully and Rameau operas that I find very satisfying. All I can give you by way of advice is that you'll either love or loathe this DVD; if you loathe it, you can easily resell it.testimonial to the artistry of pre-modern times.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I've seen this movie twice now, and honestly I believe this movie is already one of the top movies of all time.<br /><br />The basic story is based upon the comic book version of Batman as the original creators of the character envisioned him back in the days before World War II. If you're looking for a movie based on the Adam West or 1990s movie version of Batman, this is not it. This movie is faithful to the original creation and it's much better.<br /><br />Batman, played wonderfully by Christian Bale, of course is the protector of Gothmam City, a fictional version of New York City. In this movie, the Joker, played amazingly by Heath Ledger, is asked by the city's underworld to help them reclaim the city after gains against them by Batman and Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent.<br /><br />The action and fighting scenes are very well done. But this movie, to me, isn't about the action, it's about the story. In essence this movie is sort of a morality play under guise of an action flick. It's extremely enjoyable, but it's also a very thoughtful movie, which is why I think it'll stand up as one of the best of all time. Director Christopher Nolan is trying to tell the audience that Batman isn't a totally good hero, nor is he bad, it's all shades of gray. This undertone of thoughtfulness is what makes this movie absolutely engaging and amazing in my opinion.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the DVD, and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is the complete lack of special features. There is no director's commentary or anything else we've become accustomed to on major DVD releases. I've also seen this movie on Blu Ray and I'd recommend the Blu Ray version by miles, it's a great reason to get a Blu Ray player if you don't already own one.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This is a remake of the Jules Verne classic. The special effects are much more vivid and realistic. Brendan Fraser brings the epic tale to life with his talent. The movie has it's moments with colorful sets and some bloody sci-fi violence which earned it the PG-13 rating. All in all it is a good family movie.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Though The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is long (we watched half of it one night, the other half on another night), I think it's rich with fantasy, amazing production qualities (the film is gorgeous to look at, from start to finish), and some really good performances.<br /><br />The plot: Benjamin Button (played by Brad Pitt) is born at the end of World War I to a wealthy New Orleans family. His mother dies in childbirth. When Benjamin's father sees his new son, he is horrified. The baby appears unnaturally aged/sick, with wrinkled skin. The shocked, unprepared new father leaves the infant on a doorstep.<br /><br />Luckily, that doorstep belongs to an old folks' home managed by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson, in an inspired performance). Heartsick Queenie is unable to have children of her own, and she takes the unfortunate little one in. As a child, Benjamin has the appearance and physical ability of a 70-year-old man and the mental capabilities of a child. The older Benjamin gets, however, the more apparent it becomes - he's aging backwards.<br /><br />It's at the home that Benjamin meets Daisy (Cate Blanchett). The two feel an instant connection.<br /><br />As Benjamin hits his teenaged years, he takes a job on a tugboat, travels the world, and begins to live his life. The rest of the movie follows he and Daisy (who grows up to be a prima ballerina) as the two find love, find one another, and experience the inevitable loss that is characteristic of the human experience.<br /><br />Cast-wise, I think the star is clearly Blanchett, followed at a close second by Henson. Though Pitt does an admirable job, his Benjamin is a man of few words, which doesn't do much for the acting fireworks.<br /><br />Effects/makeup were wonderful, though I did feel that dim lighting in many scenes affected my full appreciation of the technology used to both age characters and \\"turn back the clock.\\" (It was almost as if they were trying to hide Pitt in some scenes, maybe for a bigger reveal later? At any rate, I didn't like it. Just tell the story.)<br /><br />There was alot of symbolism in this movie, a lot of imagery related to time/mortality throughout the film, and many themes dealing with \\"other\\" types. If you're thinking that the film will bear any resemblance to the F. Scott Fitzgerald story it's based on, think again. The movie uses the basic premise of the story, nothing more.l the story.)

0553374842|5.0|This book, the \\"Illustrated Star Wars Universe\\", is one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It is full of pictures of different aspects of several of the important worlds in the Star Wars universe - such as Hoth, Coruscant, Tatooine, Alderaan, Endor - that, when complemented by the text, make this an easily readable and pleasant book.    The text that accompanies the artwork is top-notch in most cases. Although Kevin J.Anderson's work is considered to be of mixed quality by many Star Wars fans, in this book he does an excellent job of writing each planet's account \\"in-universe\\", from the perspective of different indviduals (such as a former poet and political activist from Alderaan, a rebel engineer on Hoth, and so forth).     The only weakness in this book is the description of Alderaan. It is described as a world largely composed of flowing grasslands with small seas, contradicting the blue image seen in the movies. This has a relatively harmless origin, dating back to a picture of Yavin 4 misplaced as a photo of Alderaan, and expanded upon in this text.    Regardless of the above, this is an excellent purchase choice for anyone interested in the Star Wars universe, or even just in some beautiful Star Wars artwork.

B000YABYLA|4.0|I thought Juno was a sweet film. The movie tells the story of Juno (played exquisitely by Ellen Page), a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant. At first, Juno tries to arrange a \\"hasty abortion,\\" but she finds that she can't go through with it. Then, deciding to give the baby up for adoption, she looks through a local Penny Saver and finds the perfect couple in search of a baby - Vanessa (Jennifer Garner in a pitch-perfect, heartbreaking turn) and Mark (Jason Bateman, dead-on as always).<br /><br />Juno meets with the couple and makes all the necessary plans to have them adopt the baby. She feels secure in the knowledge that these two people will give her baby the perfect life.<br /><br />But when Juno begins to notice the cracks in her dream of perfection, she begins doubting everything - love, the ability of a couple of stay together, her choice to give her baby up, and her own feelings for Bleeker (Micheal Cera), the baby's father.<br /><br />I honestly think there are NO bad performances in this movie. Even the small parts are rendered with reality and depth of thought. J.K. Simmons is wonderful as Juno's dad, and ditto for Alison Janney as her stepmom. It's really an ensemble piece, with the four principles - Page, Garner, Bateman, and Cera - doing most of the heavy lifting. Page shines, delivering the types of lines you've never heard ANYONE really say with amazing credibility.<br /><br />And, a note - in most movies, scenes that are the least bit tense are far overblown for \\"dramatic\\" value. Chracters cry, scream, storm off, do a bunch of stupid stuff. And I don't doubt that there are some people who handle stressful situations that way. But there are plenty of us who try to maintain some shred of self-control and attempt to make the best of the hand we are dealt. This movie is about people like that.<br /><br />When Juno tells her parents she's pregnant, there's no histrionic fall-out. Sure, they are disappointed. Sure, they let her know that. She's disappointed in herself. But she's also made a decision, and she has a responsible plan to deal with the result of her irresponsibility. It's characters like this that make you want to keep going to see movies. I applaud Diablo Cody (the screenwriter) for reminding us that everyone is not a weak, sniveling idiot.cision, and she has a responsible plan to deal with the result of her irresponsibility.

B001CTDH76|4.0|Is The Mentalist a rip-off of PSYCH?   To those who believe it is, I am sorry, but there is little that these two series have in common.  PSYCH is a comedy with serious moments, but the Mentalist is a serious drama with moments of humor.  Both are great series.    The cast is excellent.  Let's focus on the supporting players-Tim Kang is a riot as Kimball Cho.  He is so dead serious.    His partner, Wayne Rigsby played by Owain Yeoman, is the comic relief, especially when plays off Tim Kang's Cho.  Of course, Rigsby has a mad crush on Grace Van Pelt played by the red headed beauty Amanda Righetti.  She seems too beautiful to be a cop, but she is as about as serious as Kimball Cho and is a good officer.    One comment, because of space limitation, has to be made about the Boss of the group-Virgil Minelli played by the wonderful Gregory Itzin.  He played President Charles Logan on 24 which gave the US presidency its first czar.  Let's hope he is more prominent in Season Two.    Of course, Simon Barker as Patrick Jane and Robin Tunney as Teresa Lisbon are a delight to watch.  The chemistry between them is electrifying.    Patrick Jane does have an air of sadness about him.  The menacing Red John serial killer is always in the shadows.    The season finale is one of the best written finales that I have seen.  The twists and turns in the finale is like a tango performed by two dancers who know how to shock and awe the watcher with such moves that are beyond technique-it is pure artistry.    It is a great freshman series.  Hope the writing can keep up for season two.

0451196716|5.0|To be correct, it TECHNICALLY is a Richard Bachman novel. However, since Bachman suffered an unfortunate death (wink!), King has so graciously agreed to allow it to be published under his name.    \\"The Long Walk\\" describes a brutal, dangerous competition in an alternate, possibly fascist America. 100 boys are picked from thousands who apply to do the race. Their goal? To start walking from the Maine-Canada border, along a marked route southward, for as long as they can continue without any type of rest or true stop. The prize for the last boy standing is anything he desires in the form of what is implied to be a vast prize of money. However, should any boy drop below four miles per hour as registered by the military guards constantly accompanying them along the sidelines in speed, he receives three warnings before getting what is euphemistically called a \\"ticket\\" and dropping out of the race.    King does an excellent job in characterizing the boys participating, as well as the mental and psychological toll that the race begins to exert on them as they endlessly continue their walk southward. When one of the characters finally falls to receive his \\"ticket\\", it is gut-wrenching.    The main weakness of the story (and it isn't too bad) is the length. After a while, the story drags a bit, as you wait for the boys to finally start breaking down until only one is left standing. Nonetheless, it is still a very vivid image, one of King's finest.

It started as friendly conversation in the elevator to Lisa trying to make out with him at the office Christmas party.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|While certainly not among the best movies I've seen, The Other Boleyn Girl does have a nice build to it, as well as the stunning costumes (and the jewelry, oh the jewelry!) you'd expect from such a period piece.<br /><br />In the film, Boleyn sisters Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and Ann (Natalie Portman) are raised in the country. The two girls are unfortunate enough to have an ambitious father and uncle, who plot to advance the family's fortune and position. To achieve such a lofty goal, the two men decide to use Mary and Ann as bait for the frustrated King of England (Eric Bana), whose current wife has failed to bear a male heir to the throne.<br /><br />The King is initially captivated by Mary's innocence and sweetness. However, conniving Ann turns the King's affections towards herself, despite the fact that Mary bears the King an illegitimate son. Unsatisfied with simply being a mistress, Ann convinces the King to divorce his wife and break with the Catholic church, merely to possess her. As England, and the Boleyn family, is ripped in twain by the King's actions, Ann and Mary cling to one another.<br /><br />I thought that all performances were solid, but the movie suffered from a talk-y plot and too much meandering, too much readiness to cast blame upon characters rather than just present the action. Also, it is unfortunate that Johansson's beauty, one of her greatest assets on screen, was basically washed-out in this film. Very little makeup, lots of drab colors. I understand she was presented as an opposite of the vibrant Ann, but such choices did the actress a disservice.<br /><br />Bana did an admirable job, as did Kristin Scott Thomas (who played mother to the two girls). David Morissey, as the calculating Duke of Norfolk, was delightfully seedy.<br /><br />Overall, the film is not necessarily something I'd rush right out and rent, but it did have its moments.

0143034901|4.0|Barcelona, Spain, 1945-1966.  A visit to The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is a privilege and not a right.  Daniel Sepere, a bookseller's son, is ten years old when he visits this fascinating place.  His father takes him there after Daniel wakes up in tears from a nightmare.  He is to pick a book, any book, and care for it throughout his life.  So Daniel picks up The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax.  He's never heard of this author before.  In fact, few people have heard of Carax.  His books sold very few copies, and they had been published in France.  It turns out that this book, like all of Carax's books, is very much sought after by book collectors and used book dealers all over Spain and France.  Julian Carax is an elusive, mysterious character.  Who is he?  Is he dead or alive?  And is it true that all of his book copies have been burned by a shadowed figure that's now stalking Daniel?  Daniel spends almost his entire life uncovering the author's secrets.  And as he continues his search, he meets a series of eccentric and sometimes spooky characters.  How the mystery unfolds Daniel knows not, but he has a feeling that the revelation will be stranger and more complex than all of the fiction he has ever read, including those of Julian Carax.<br /><br />\\"There wasn't a soul in the streets, and the darkness of the blackout spread with a fetid smell that rose from the sewers.  The night became opaque, impenetrable, as the rain folded the city in its shroud.\\"<br /><br />It doesn't take a genius to notice the gothic elements in the above quote.  And that is what The Shadow of the Wind (translation by Lucia Graves) is -- a gothic story with eerie elements and spookiness galore.  But it is much more than that.  It is also a historical novel with a heavy backdrop of post-Civil War Spain. Barcelona sounds beautiful.  The author does a wonderful job describing the city.  (And the pictures in the last pages of the book are quite nice as well.)  I wish I could go there sometime.  The novel is also a detective thriller of sorts.  It contains some dark humor and even some romantic elements.  Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is compared to Spanish-language giants like Gabriel Garcia M&aacute;rquez, Jorge Luis Borges and Arturo Perez-Reverte.  But he is also compared to Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens, A.S. Byatt, Paul Auster, and others.  Dude has been compared to all and sundry.  Name-dropping is rampant in the back cover blurbs and reviews.  But Zaf&oacute;n is a talent in his own right, and even though this novel is a little too melodramatic and formulaic at times (the creaking doors, the locked room with all the crucifixes, the creepy man lurking in the shadows, etc.), it is nevertheless a fascinating read.  What's better is that it's a book about books, kind of like Diane Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.  (Oops!  Another comparison for ya.)  So, if you like huge books full of suspense, tragedy and gothic elements mixed with fascinating European history, then do not miss The Shadow of the Wind.  A definite summer must-read.time.

0060557818|4.0|This is the story of Richard Mayhew, set in our reality's London (London Above) and also London Below, the magical place known only to those who are part of it. By helping a woman named Door, he is unknowingly transferred to London Below, and the story is about Richard trying to help Door but also make it back to his old life in London Above.<br /><br />This is a great story, a quick and easy read that gives you a great taste of urban fantasy. There's action, adventure, and some great original characters. Gaiman also throws in some twists for good measure.
1847879071|5.0|This book was recommended by the instructor. It's a lot of book, and at times difficult to find the exact information you need. There were a lot of long-winded explanations that sometimes confused. The author is Welsh, so there are a lot of references to that culture that Americans might not understand.  On the other hand, it was helpful for correlation and regression analysis.   I bought the SPSS Survival Manual by Julie Pallant also. I ended up using it more often, as I could get to the information I needed for a particular task faster.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I almost busted a gut laughing during Tropic Thunder. Time was when I avoided \\"guy movies\\" like the plague, but over the past few years, I have found an odd joy in discovering a few (amongst the piles and piles of worthless dreck) that I like. Tropic Thunder, though I guess not technically a \\"guy movie,\\" falls into that category.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the plot, here's the skinny: a group of spoiled movie stars is making an action film (based on a \\"true\\" story) set during the Vietnam War. When the fed-up director decides to drop the whiny cast off in the jungle and film the project guerilla-style, he accidentally steps on an old land mine, stranding the celebrities in the middle of some very real danger.<br /><br />What makes the movie hilarious is that the people involved in this project weren't afraid to poke fun at the insanity that is Hollywood. We have Tug Speedman (Ben Stiller), the washed-up action star; Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), the eccentric, critically-acclaimed method actor; Jack Portnoy (Jack Black), the scatological comedian; Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson), the rapper trying to crossover into film; and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel), the smart Jewish newcomer. If this core cast wasn't enough, the film features inspired supporting appearances and cameos by everyone from Tom Cruise to Nick Nolte to Danny McBride to Matthew McConaughey to Jennifer Love Hewitt to Tobey McGuire.<br /><br />If you enjoy films that take snarky aim at their own industry, you must see this. If you like to laugh, you must see this. If you have always wondered what Robert Downey Jr. would look like with blue eyes, you must see this.<br /><br />SEE THIS!!
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is on my short list of favorite movies. Reno and Portman are perfect in the two lead roles. I agree with what others have said that the scenes in the international version of them actually doing some jobs are important. Don't get the US version which lacks this part.
0762434279|3.0|I'm not pleased with my purchase.  I essentially got what I paid for, but I thought I was buying a standard version of Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  I think the product should have been more clearly labeled as an ABRIDGED version, since that is not what I searched for.  The product arrived quickly, in new condition, but I was very disappointed when I received a tiny 2 inch tall book instead of the standard one.
B000M341QE|3.0|I was very excited to see this movie and had to wait a week before renting it because the video store was sold out.  After seeing it I was dissapointed with it.  The movie keeps your interest with a great cast and a story about an investigation into an Irish mobster in Boston.      Performances by Nicholson, Sheen and DiCaprio are great.  However Wahlberg did not deserve an Oscar nomination and the female lead generates no chemistry with Damon or DiCaprio.  The storyline keeps the movie moving well enough, but there are too many cliches in it.  And seriously, how could Nicholson's character not figure out who the rat in his crew is when the police investigation doesn't seem to gain any ground until after DiCaprio starts working for him?  Even The Simpsons made fun of that.    Overall the movie is entertaining to see once or twice, but did not deserve Best Picture.
B001VKSPVE|3.0|The zoot suit riots didn't actually take place until 1942,<br />but there actually was a little hysteria about fear the Japanese would attack California next with no US Navy to protect them.<br />The B 17 bomber in the movie is also a little early probably.<br />The comedy about the army, the General, shooting at friendly planes,<br />is almost as funny as the Japanese in a German U-boat off Los Angeles.<br />In 1942 they rounded up California Japanese and sent them to camps,<br />so the fear was real.<br />John Belushi as the fighter pilot is kind of a classic now.<br />I liked the movie, but it kind of distorts history.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's been one of the better movies produced by Pixar, although it was a little slow and confusing for me at first when I watched it for the first time.  The characters are charming and the message was incredibly profound in Pixar's usual unassuming and un-pushy way.  Some of the imagery (like when Wall-E was flying through the universe and observing the beauty of the cosmos) was just breathtaking.<br /><br />But I was on the floor with laughter at the bonus features.  My toddler likes to watch the shorts again and again.  I don't usually purchase movies (I watch them on Netflix and then move on), but this was a keeper for us.
B001TODCII|4.0|Leem Neeson is fantastic.  He's the entire film and it's worth your time.  I kept thinking of Charles Bronson, with class and an accent.  This film could have been 1979 with me and my friends at our hometown drive-in cheering on Neeson dispensing justice as he searches for his daughter.  It's also a throwback to those older films because it's virtually devoid of gore.  It's violent as all heck, but it spares the viewer the typical modern producer's fascination with super slow-mo, buckets of blood, flesh specks and mini-cams strapped to bullets.  It leaves that aspect to our imagination and thanks to other films, imagination is quite enough to drive home what he's doing.  Human trafficking is a horrendous crime that's taking place every day all over the world.  It was a real pleasure to see Leem Neeson taking several dozen of them out.  Cheers!

B001SO69IY|5.0|Method Man and Redman have gathered plenty of well-deserved hype over this new album, probably their coolest party mix ever.<br /><br />However, I would even go so far to say that \\"Blackout! 2\\" might be one of the best rap albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />Rap stations in Los Angeles have played numerous tracks from \\"Blackout! 2\\" over the radio, because this album features some of the best collaborative tracks between Method Man and Redman. Whereas the first \\"Blackout!\\" excelled in b-ball breakbeats and cutting edge rhymes, the sequel excels in a saucy Southern downbeat style.<br /><br />This album features some of the tastiest tracks from such DJs as Pete Rock from Pete Rock & CL Smooth and DJ Scratch from EPMD. Awesome songs such as \\"A-Yo\\" feature Method Man and Redman rapping phat rhymes over a snazzy funky guitar strum sample with trumpets. There's nothing hotter than hearing Redman rap \\"Watch me! She like, 'Red's so cool, any n***a after him is a deja vu.\\"<br /><br />Other tracks make for awesome dance tracks which rap fans desperately hungered for after Missy Elliott's \\"Miss E...So Addictive\\" album. Songs such as \\"Errbody Scream\\" features a plodding, thumping bass drum, with Method Man and Redman chanting \\"West Coast n***as love gettin' it started/Down south n***as love gettin' it started/West Coast n***as love gettin' it started, but when we on the mic, s**t get retarded!\\" It's a bizarre, nonsensical rap, but when the beat eventually kicks into a fast tempo, Redman and Method kick their hardcore rhymes into top gear with edgy raps. Even Keith Murray from the Def Squad rips a dope one, shouting \\"If you looking for beef, you know you gon' get it/Got ya'll n***as yellin' \\"Call the cops, get the paramedics!\\"<br /><br />More importantly, Method and Red blended together an incredibly wide variety of rap songs, from party songs to funk songs to Motown-styled soul. For example, \\"Mrs. International\\" is a smooth and surprisingly clean rap song dedicated to Method Man and Redman's love for all the women in the world, no matter what shape, size or race they are.<br /><br />However, probably the best track is \\"Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers,\\" a beautiful ode to Method Man and Redman's love for marijuana. Certainly everyone already knew that Method Man uses drugs, but Method Man and Redman use this song as an opportunity to flip the bird against anti-marijuana groups, who have criminalized the use of marijuana. It's a very blunt rap, but Method Man gives a striking testimonial, saying, \\"I'm a pothead. Everyone look and point ya fingers at the bad guy with the cotton mouth and glass eyes/Hunh, f*** it, I'm that high.\\"<br /><br />Songs such as \\"Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers\\" prove that Method Man and Redman are at the top of their game.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|This true story opens in San Francisco in the eighties, where salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is barely able to make ends meet.  His wife (Thandie Newton) gets fed up and leaves, and Chris must juggle a non-paying internship with a brokerage firm with caring for his five-year old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). With no income, Chris and Christopher go from cheap apartment to cheaper motel and eventually become homeless.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this movie because I thought it would be sugary-sweet and corny, but it's not; it's realistic and scary, heartwarming, and inspiring.  Smith portrays Chris as an intelligent, hardworking, and extremely likeable man who sees his world crumble around him.  He gives a truly memorable performance.  His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.<br /><br />This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Recommended.

Took a chance on the rest of the record and found it to be excellent.  If you liked their last record, you'll enjoy this one.  A good mix of club jams with more \\"ballad\\" stuff.

It's still the old rule. Use it or lose it. If you don't run you won't be able to run...     The chia seeds are the best! Filling, hunger-killing, affordable, nutritious...Many thanks to the author. It's a great story, too.
0385512058|4.0|This book certainly has good points about networking/building relationships, but it is very hard in a lot of cases to get past the self praising. Obviously Keith has done well for himself and knows a lot of people, but I guess he has to establish his networking credibility somehow.<br /><br />I've reread this book a couple times and found certain sections to be more applicable as I get older. Hosting dinner parties might not be as relevant for a high schooler as for a twenty-something, etc.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I have been searching for this movie for at least 10 years or more.  It is a fun theme and the music is wonderful. I have told many people about it and they have also done searches to no avail.  This is the first time I have found anything at all on it.  It is the type of movie that one never forgets in spite of the fact that it is wholesome and just plain fun.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|The 80's was an interesting time in the horror genre. It came packed with some of the worst ever made along with many loved classics like The Shining, Creepshow, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, The Thing, and tonight's feature Return of the Living Dead Part II. Depending on the viewer either you love this one or hate it. As far as Sid goes we give it the green light since it supplies the right amount of horror & laughs to provide a great late night viewing experience.<br /><br />The story begins with some curious kids who happen to come across a mysterious barrel. This barrel was used in some type of military experiment and obviously wasn't meant to be found. As the kids pry they finally get the lid opened and unleash a strange green gas that spreads over the local cemetary. As the gas seeps into the ground some 80's punk rocker type kids are welcomed by the sight of the walking dead. Unfortunately for them these zombies are not the type that can barely walk. The seem to have all the movement abilities as a live person which makes things more interesting. They round up as many people as possible who are still living to try and put an end to the zombie infestation.<br /><br />This one may not have been as successful as the first Return of the Living Dead, but was still a fun watch. It's pretty much the exact same premise as the first with a few changes sprinkled in. Sure it's not Night of the Living Dead and nor should you look at it in that light. It's really like a take off with more gore and more humor 80's style. If you are a fan of the genre then you should enjoy this. We will recommend this one by saying it IS one we would have enjoyed back in the glory days.
1592402038|5.0|A bit behind on my reading list, I finally got around to reading Eats, Shoots and Leaves (2003) by Lynne Truss. Truss, a UK writer, manages to combine the emotive aspect of punctuation with a historical perspective resulting in a British bestseller. I didn't even know people got emotional about punctuation.  Personally, I thought any country that could get so worked up about commas and exclamation points had to be a little daft to start with. However, my own sentimental attachment to the lowly, unappreciated semicolon kept me reading. I found myself thrown in with the likes of Virginia Woolf and George Barnard Shaw; not too shabby.  Truss takes us down a pathway filled with humor, history and histrionics. Along the way, we learn a lot about punctuation, its origins and its purpose. One of the most important aspects is that the function of punctuation is to meet the needs of contemporary communication. Who knew? I thought that it was just an excuse for my high school English teacher to torture me. This is important because changes are occurring as I write. It has only been a moment since the typewriter was void of the exclamation point (remember back-spacing the apostrophe?). Now text-speak has impacted communication in the 21st century as much as Morse code did in the 20th.  There is still a place for the die-hard grammaphiles who can't even accept the use of a \\"Yob's comma\\" for breath, but serves absolutely no grammatical function; and for those of us who can't bring ourselves to sprinkle our writing with asterisks. However, I like the smiley :) and the not so smiley faces :( I use in e-mail. It flows so much better that its counterpart \\"you suck\\" does.  The author even reminds us that the age of computers has removed those double spaces after a full stop (periods to you and me). Remember, it is a British reference book; make no mistake. Some of the subtleties are lost on cro magnon Americans. But, I say, ugg, go for it.

0743298039|3.0|Typically, I finish a book before reviewing it, but in this case, I feel compelled to write a review based on the pace of this book. I am finally more than half-way through the story, and it's been a bit of a chore to get as far as I have. I love books that are difficult to put down, that keep me intersted and entertained, to the point that I'm sometimes saddened to reach the end; not the case with The Thirteend Tale. I want to reach the end and be done with it. The begining is slow, but it eventually picks up, offering promise of a great book. That promise doesn't last, as it reverts to a slow boring read in which I can only get through a couple chapters at a time. A couple of chapters are ok, a couple chapters are dull. Ok, dull, ok, dull, and it goes on like that. Still, I carry on reading and haven't given up. I purchased the book because I've enjoyed many stories set in England. One such book is The Crimson Petal and the White, which I enjoyed immensley. I also noted the numerous good reviews by customers here at Amazon. I'm giving the book three stars for average, because I'm certain I've read the best part somewhere in the beginning when Isabelle and Charlie are introduced, and I don't forsee the next 30% of reading to suddenly shine.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|In Season III, the human side of Dexter gets more play than ever. It gets a huge boost in the endearing (and comical) struggle that emerges as Dexter contemplates true commitment--the forever kind, to not one but two other human beings--his Madonna lover Rita, and a surprise other one (who you'll learn about when you watch). He's also struggles to TRUST, and to let himself give in to his longing for a real friend, one he can be honest with, who wont bolt from him when Dex bares his soul.<br />  On the other side--the EVIL. In this Season, Dexter is at the top of his game in murder, and also more sure of himself and of the justice of his executioner role. In fact he is so now so efficient in his evil, that some of the suspense that I felt in I and II--the holding of my breath whenever he was in the middle of a kill mission, has faded. In Season III, the guy's so good, and the risk of his bumbling and exposure so low, that I got a little complacent. Maybe this is a flaw in one sense, plot-wise in this Season. On the other hand, not to disappoint viewers, the killing stories display a long set of new skills by Dex, as he sets up more and novel clever traps, and improvises tirelessly in his damage control stunts, when bad luck threatens his missions.<br />  But as Dex becomes more sure-footed in his evil deeds, he becomes much more troubled as he tries valliantly to learn how to behave like a good guy in the growing set of \\"good\\" guy roles he takes on. For me, this made for a much more interesting Dex, as it presented a growing contrast between the loyal, loving, generous, child-adoring man, who's earnest and vulnerable (but very funny), as he treads in unfamiliar feminine fiefdoms (like Yoga classes for couples, led by misleadingly gentle-voiced women), and the dispassionate and less guilt-ridden killer Dexter, the one that is even more eerily calm as he garrotes and injects his prey, and forces him to face a candlelit shrine of his victims' photos, while gagged and saran-wrapped, in a final Judgment Day, before he saws, bags and dumps him. One of the best scenes has Dexter facing a nasty serial wife-killer and chuckling with him about the best ways to evade a girlfriend--golf and boats it turns out--all while getting just the right facts to send the guy off on his last jaunt at sea.<br />  So this new Dex--more good yet more \\"bad\\", makes this season cool and novel.  And, as many reviewers noted, the playing out of that remarkable and dark friendship with Miguel, the centerpiece of Season III--captured me...maybe even more than the Skinner guy lurking around and flaying people all Season did!  See this season, enjoy it, and decide for yourselves.saran-wrapped, in a final Judgment Day, before he saws, bags and dumps him.

B000005RS0|5.0|Wow, this CD has really withstood the test of time.  Even after 25 years and hundreds of listens later, almost every track here still holds up remarkably well.  Every Tina fan knows this album was hastily put together after Tina hit the Top 20 in late 1983 with the remake of Al Green classic \\"Let's Stay Together\\".  Capitol Records wanted an album put together in less than 2 months and Tina and Company DELIVERED !!    It's nothing short of a miracle listening to this CD and experience the quality of songwriting, production, and of course Tina's powerful sand-blasted vocals on every track.  This CD does not sound or feel like it was rushed in the studio.  Its musicality and cohesion is nothing short of AMAZING!  The 2000 remastered extended version is even better with not only improved sound, restoring all the tracks that were left off the original 1984 release, and adding some club tracks of \\"What's Love....\\".  What more could the Tina Fan ask for?  It's too good to be true.    The cards were certainly stacked in Tina's favor with some outstanding songwriting contributions from Tina's \\"famous\\" British friends like Mark Knofler (Dire Straits), David Bowie, plus a remake of the Beatles classic \\"Help\\".  Tina sings with renewed vigor and has never sounded better.  Most listeners will agree that her vocals certainly improved with age.  Her vocals during the Ike years cannot touch the one here on \\"Private Dancer\\".  Her phrasing cuts like a knife on every track.  You can understand what she's saying, and more important, FEEL what she's feeling.      Of course it's no mere coincidence the songs have an autobiographical context (perhaps the songwriters intended it that way).  Just look at the song titles:  \\"Better Be Good To Me\\" (to Ike), \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\" (if her career had not taken a bad detour after putting up with Ike for over 15 years) \\"Show Some Respect\\" (yes, Ike, that's meant for YOU!) and \\"Help\\" (need I say more on this one?).  Just like the opening lines on\\"I Might Have Been Queen\\".......\\"I'm a soul survivor\\".    An amazing album from start to finish.  I don't think the quality of songwriting or production ever quite scaled these heights again after \\"Private Dancer\\", though Tina's singing remained consistent during her Capitol years.  What's amazing about Tina's singing here and on her other subsequent releases is that she never succumbs to sappiness, but still manages to invoke her songs with FEELING.    Sadly, and I still cannot understand to this day and maybe someone could clue me in how Lionel Richie's CD \\"All Night Long\\" beat out Tina's \\"Private Dancer\\", Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\", the Boss's \\"Dancing in the Dark\\", and Cyndi Lauper's \\"Girls Wanna Have Fun\\" CD's for \\"Album of the Year\\" honors at the Grammys that year...???  HUH??  Can somebody explain how THAT happened??

0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals highlights a previously under appreciated aspect of Lincoln's greatness--how his masterful blend and use of empathy and toughness in personal diplomacy, enabled him to establish his truly unique \\"Team of Rivals\\" cabinet. Biographies have focused on his beating all the other odds stacked against him: against his ever being elected to the Presidency, and against the chances that one man could inspire our nation's disparate interests and people to rise to the occasion to  save not only the Union, but the greatest ideal that inspired this Union's creation--that all men are created equal. He beat the odds against the chances that a poor boy, destined for illiteracy and manual labor, could become a self-educated lawyer, and that an obscure one-term Congressman, (the only one of the four 1860 presidential rivals who was without privilege and was not backed by rich and connected power brokers), could not only be elected, but become the most eloquent, inspiring President our country has had. A President who would meld enemies and power hungry rivals into a brilliant Cabinet team of loyal allies, all very smart and savvy, tireless, and efficient, and all growing more deferential over time, and yielding to him the final say in the end, through every crisis that threatened their Cabinet's cohesiveness.<br />  Team of Rivals is unique in this focus on how Lincoln masterfully commandeered his former opponents into a powerful Executive that helped him navigate the biggest crisis our nation ever faced.<br /> This book thus deepened the understanding of how a man who is without ego, humble, compassionate, and gifted with the eloquence and spirit to communicate to a melting pot of countrymen, can move men on the personal, the group, and the grand national scale alike, to believe that that which united them all, was worth dying for and saving; that this common ground must trump the differences between them. Thus he managed to lead generals and soldiers, wealthy and poor, new immigrants and sixth generation American aristocrats alike, to fight side by side, and die in thousands, to hold the country together.<br />  Goodwin expands her focus beautifully in this book, to recount how Lincoln's ultimate marshaling all these forces enabled him to reach his crowning achievement against all odds: uniting former bigots, myopic Copperheads, and men of warring ideologies, to agree first that free Negroes would make great soldiers, and then that as such, they must then be forever free.  He did this in part by simultaneously holding off the fanatic abolitionists on the other side who inflamed division and who without his influence, had been unable to see that timing, and patience were paramount in getting opponents of emancipation to come to their views.  Lincoln actually openly admonished the firebrand Abolitionists who formed the vocal leadership. He warned them that their public brandishing of a \\"superior\\" Christian creed as giving them the license to force its moral views down the throats of all men of \\"lesser\\" faith, was backfiring. Lincoln had long studied the history of what he framed as the greatest paradox of America--that this nation which was first to successfully fight for liberty, was the only Western nation that still enslaved its inhabitants. Goodwin accounts how Lincoln slowly developed a strategy that could win over the millions of Americans, both Northern and Southern (in the border states), who were taught for generations what the slave-owning liberators of white men--Washington and Jefferson--believed: that slavery was just in their God's eyes, because \\"someday\\", inexorably, it would die a natural death, because...well because this was America with its great Manifest Destiny, authored by Divine Will. Lincoln made the fanatics patient enough to wait, and the cynics tolerant enough to see that freeing Negroes was not a frightening specter, but a practical and just end.  Thus, under Lincoln, America's creed changed from \\"All men are created equal and are endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator---BUT--SOME MEN ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS\\" to ALL men are created equal.<br />  Lincoln did this all by his inspirational leadership, in four short but dizzying years--before he became one more of those who died for this cause.  This book on Lincoln, thus manages to offer something new and illuminating to the reader, and more than earns its place within the longstanding formidable body of scholarship on Lincoln.men are created equal and are endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator---BUT--SOME MEN ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS\\" to ALL men are created equal.

B001R4MEYI|4.0|Well, well, well.  Mastodon came out with a new album, which is fantastic!  I am a true Mastodon fan, particularly of their older material.  I want to bring up a point that may be strong to true Mastodon fans: their music is more melodic now.  When you listen to all the albums in order, from Lifesblood to Crack the Skye, they get A LOT more mellow.  It was in an interview that Brent Hinds said that this is what he wanted Mastodon to be from the beginning, but I find that harder to believe.  For example, listen to Hail To Fire(Lifesblood/Call of the Mastodon), then Ghosts of Karelia(Crack the Skye).  They harmonize and focus on melody a lot more with the latter.      However, that's not bad.  What they focus on is how their array of talents can go from fast thrash metal to prog-metal epics/opuses.  My first impression when I picked it up was, \\"Wow, I can actually comprehend some of the words that they are singing!\\".  So, in conclusion, I still like Remission and Lifesblood more, but their latest shows how they can play music that is somewhat appealing to the mainstream. (PS: Mainstream music will never catch on to metal.  We are all WAY ahead of them).
B000SINT52|5.0|Michael Moore does a great job of exposing problems. I don't see the representation of the subject equally on his film, but I think it's no worse than the other side that covers up the facts to hide their social crimes.  Please watch as a citizen of America; then cast your vote on election days to change our lives by empowering us 'the people', and not those who profit from us.
B000IOM0WO|4.0|I've found that it's the concerts on video that I most often watch nowadays. Always enjoyed this disk on DVD and naturally wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray. If you have a killer sound system that supports DTS audio you're going to love the improvment. Can't say the video is much improved since this was shot way back in 1988. I'm watching on a 60\\" Pioneer Plasma and don't see all that much difference. Go for the sound if you have the equipment for it.

B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neesen is terrific as a retired agent who becomes a one-man wrecking crew when his daughter is snatched.  Great action and a fine low-key performance by the ever beautiful Famke Janssen.  Highly recommended.  A keeper.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|This disk immediately became my favorite to show off my JBL professional sound system and Pioneer 60\\" plasma. People remark that it appears they are looking at it through a window. The photography is right up close and crystal clear. All the variety of skin tones, textures and colors of the instruments are breathtaking. The Orchestra plays the tight and complacated music with great energy and they seem to be absolutely having a blast. You're not going to believe the beauty of the hall in Reggio Emilia, Italy. It would be a delight to watch even with the sound turned off. The sound recording is a full surround but you still get the crisp edge of the instruments as if you were right on stage. Buy this one. The better your equipment the better your experience. Think you Mr Bach.

B00008WT5M|5.0|I love this album.  Certainly better than FLY ON THE WALL and BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO.  This album conveys all the great things about AC and don't forget the, \\"DC.\\"  Without AC/DC, I really don't think I would have gotten into rock music because I was into Billy Joel back then and I started listening to coutry/Pop...  Until AC/DC came along with BLACK ICE.      This album feachure two AC/DC hits that you will hear often on the radio, \\"Money Talks,\\" and \\"Thunderstruck!\\"  These songs don't show any weakness, in fact these songs show AC/DC's best.  This is AC/DC's second best album since Back in Black.      I just love this album as a whole.  I don't know you, but I prefer listening to album's as wholes, instead of 1/3's, 1/4's or 1/5's.  This album is surprisingly rock-solid.  There's not a song on here that I don't like.  I mean compared this to BALL BREAKER, because that album is a fan-based album.  That album (Ball Breaker) is not amiable.  Ball Breaker isn't deceiving, probably because of Brian's nasty vocials.      Good album.  I rate it 9/10!
B001ECQ75A|1.0|The cgi film genre has really gone above and beyond anything we have come to expect. Since the release of the classic Toy Story in 1995, the computer animated film has been taken up by all the major studios and even introduces digital 3-D technology. Still, with this breakthrough art film taboo at this point I feel that now business is taking over and it's up to the cooporate people to just get the movie to the big screen so people can spend their money just because it looks cool.<br /><br />That brings me to Kung Fu Panda. Now, I unfortunatly missed this movie in its theatrical release, but I had heard good things about the film and that it was even up for the Oscar. I saw it and wondered what the academy was smoking and why they weren't willing to share. Did I seriously miss something with this movie? First of all the movie was not funny. I don't about the movie going masses, but Jack Black needed to try and learn how to diversify is acting. I really thought that after his role in King Kong he would have gone on to do some great work. Instead we him doing the exact same thing in every movie he makes. My other problem was the cast. You would have guessed that Jackie Chan was in this movie? Maybe if they would have given him or any of the other supporting members of the Furious Five more than 2 lines you would have?<br /><br />Personally I don't even want to keep talking about this disgrace of a film. Besides the maginificent work on putting together the fight scenes this movie was pretty horrible. I once thought that Disney had finally gotten knocked off the pedistil as the number one maker of animated films. Nowadays I realize I may be wrong. You have to see who wants to bring a good film to the masses and who just wants to make the big bucks. It really is a numbers game when it comes down to it.<br />First Pixar Toy Story 1995 First DreamWorks Antz 1997<br />Pixar: 10 soon to be 11 with Toy Story 3  Dreamworks: 15 Soon to be 17 with How To Train Your Dragon and Oobermind<br />How many won oscars? so far it's Disney 4 and Dreamworks 2<br /><br />I guess Disney still has the magic and for the record Up was amazing!oscars? so far it's Disney 4 and Dreamworks 2    I guess Disney still has the magic and for the record Up was amazing!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I went into this one with low expectations but walked out glad I spent the time. Entertaining, basically a good summer popcorn film.  Sure you have to suspend your disbelief at the door -- but really, any movie of this type requires that.  A better film than X-MEN 3.  True, it doesn't have Famke Janssen but there is something equally beautiful, the very alluring Lynn Collins.  If you like comic movies a good one to have.
B000022TSW|1.0|This movie was left behind by a tenant that moved out.  I am glad I did not pay anything for it.  It is a sad state of affairs that people find this stuff worthy of spending their time and money on it.  I will not even donate it to the thrift shop.  It is going in the garbage where it belongs.
B001LYD2K4|4.0|A great follow up to a masterpiece of a debut album a year earlier.  This album is just as good as the first. However the remaster seems a bit weak.  Sonically this does not jump out of my speakers unless the volume is higher (especially that of the recently remastered debut).  However all that doesn't seem to matter as soon as the 6 bonus live tracks come on.  Any fan of the One Night in Budakon your jaws will drop when you hear how on fire and intense this band is just touring their debut album.  Pick this up.
B001SMC91M|4.0|This disc is almost schizophrenic, there's the half that is channeling James Brown and the other half that is outstanding blues.<br /><br />The half I love, the Blues. This is good solid blues, good stuff, the kind Muddy Waters or so many artists play in Chicago. Master Sold My Baby; Boogie Blue; Gunpowder; and Big Booty Woman - crying guitar, smoky voice, a touch of organ, sweet drum beat. These are three tracks to download if you are a blues fan.<br /><br />The other half, the whole James Brown channeling. These songs are a bit better produced, or actually more produced with more instruments and bigger sound. Fortunately there isn't as much screaming as James does, so these songs are a bit easier on the ear. The best of those tracks, Bobby Boshay; and I'm Broke - the yelling is subtle and these songs are further on the funk side. I'm Broke in particular sounded like John Shaft met James Brown and they did a song, pretty good song. Humpin' and Get yo sh_t were just OK. The latter was the music with story telling mold. The stinkers of the disc, Sugarfoot and Please pt. two were just too much like listening to James Brown, all the squealing, yelling, and big band.<br /><br />Overall this is a good disc. On the first few listens, it actually sounded great. After more listens, Sugarfood and Please Pt. Two got on my nerves. With those two edited out of the mix, this is a pleasant enjoyable disc. The group captures blues and the 60's funk movement rather well.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Basically I liked the workout.  It was quick and intense.  She fits a lot into the short amount of time.  I liked that she combined a lot of the moves.  My only concern and reason I will not be using this DVD anymore is its a killer on the shoulders! A few years ago I was diagnosed with rotator cuff syndrome and with some therapy and a lot of time to heal I have not felt the intense pain of that injury...until doing this DVD :-(     I have fairly good upper-body strength (my job requires a lot of carrying over-head etc) so its not like I don't work my shoulders daily.  But it might just be the pace and sequence of moves that brought back that pain.  So, as anyone who has suffered a shoulder injury will know, I would rather switch to a different DVD than go through that all over again.      But if you have no shoulder issues then it is a fairly good workout!

0887307280|1.0|I have no idea why this book is so highly rated. Like most of the folks who rated it two or less, I encountered a few a snippets of wisdom, but the book is mostly fluff. Removing the superfluous content may yield an interesting pamphlet.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|Here is Superman II, the direct sequel to the 1978 classic superhero movie in the series. When Superman (Christopher Reeve) tosses a hydrogen bomb into outer space to save France, he accidentally frees a trio of Kryptonian villans, General Zod (Terrance Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) from the Phantom Zone. When Clark Kent and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) go on an assingment in Niagra Falls, Lois becomes suspitious of Clark's secret identity as Superman. After a failed attempt to pretend to fall off a rail and wait for Superman, she ultimately discovers this when Clark tripped and his hand got in the fireplace and didn't burn. The two return to the Fortress of Solitude while General Zod, Ursa, and Non form an alliance with Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) and the four plot to take over Earth, at first, thinking it was Planet Huston (Ha! Ha! Ha!) Superman decides to become normal to be with Lois, but restores his powers after realizing what went wrong and the villanous gang's plot and goes to save the day. Despite that this is a worthy sequel, its predecesor was a little bit better. The visual effects were still top-notch, a lot of main actors from the first returned, and it helped advance the storyline further. A downside is that it was a little bit more lighthearted, while the original was a bit more serious. I felt bad for the director of the first, Richard Donner, when the crew treated him badly and replaced him with Richard Lester. Even the main actors felt bad. This is still a good entry in the Superman franchise nonetheless.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout! Although I'm  not following a diet after 1 week I can tell that I am getting more muscle definiton!! I also had knee surgery 4 months back and didn't think I was going to be able to complete some of the lunges, but I pushed through (although my surgeon would not be pleased) I think it is building muscle around my injured knee. I am still on level 1 getting ready to move to level 2...I highly recommend this, just be ready to work!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|After reading the Sookie Stackhouse series, I could not wait to get the True Blood series. I ordered it from Amazon, and it was delivered a couple of days after it was realeased. Can't wait until the second series is released. I will definitely order it.
B000M4RG42|1.0|What a stinker!  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I did not enjoy \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" because I really disliked the nasty, brutish and too long \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" and it was supposed to be the better film. But hey--I just couldn't imagine that Eastwood could make TWO boring films about Iwo Jima.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />I need to explain that I'm a military history buff and so my credibility with some people is going to be marginal.  After all, anybody who actually studies military tactics who isn't in the military probably has other strange hobbies.  So, that being said, I want to make it clear that Sgt. Stryker (the John Wayne character from \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\") would really, really hate \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"  He'd hate it not because of the blatant sentimentalism or the washed-out looking color (CGI has a way to go, eh?) or the incoherent story.  He'd just be appalled by the fact that the Marines can't keep their heads down. They can't hit the dirt and dig in.  They just walk around on the beach, looking serious, and get shot.<br /><br />Stryker would stand up in the theater (or home theater) and yell \\"Get down!  Ya wanna get your head blown off!\\"  Yeah, THAT'S what he'd do...<br /><br />Seriously, folks, I'm tired of seeing these so-called \\"war movies\\" like \\"We Were Soldiers\\" and \\"Blackhawk Down\\" where troops just diddly-bop around in a hot environment and ask to get shot.  It's dumb.<br /><br />I repeat, no sane person walks around in broad daylight with live ammo flying around in the air.<br /><br />\\"But...but... HOW DO THEY MOVE?\\" you may ask. \\"How do they win the battle?\\"  \\"How do they do heroic stuff and take the island and defeat the Nazi's or whatever?\\"<br /><br />I'll answer that.  They do it SLOWLY and CAREFULLY so as not to get their binkus shot off.  They are \\"pinned down\\" by enemy fire until they can figure out a way to eliminate the threat.  What made Iwo Jima so terrible was that, for about a day, the entire invading force was \\"pinned down\\" and could not dig into the sand, so they just lay there, hoping and praying not to get blown up by the artillery and mortar rounds that were slowly killing the Marines on the beach.<br /><br />That would have made an interesting \\"realistic\\" movie.  THAT would have been a realistic movie.<br /><br />But that's not this movie.the sand, so they just lay there, hoping and praying not to get blown up by the artillery and mortar rounds that were slowly killing the Marines on the beach.

B001TZMRCE|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's novella was published in 1886.  Was it about the duality of human nature, Victorian society, or Western culture?  Regardless, the book was entitled by the author \\"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  Grammatically incorrect, even the peculiar title set the tone for an unusual tale.  Within 15 years, the book had sold over 250,000 copies world wide.  It as been reprinted numerous times, adapted for stage and screen.    This book above removes \\"Strange Case of\\" from the title and misspells Dr. Jekyll's name!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|My wife and I love GOOD music. We see as many musicals as we can afford. We are not critics, but know music. Critics are just that.....born to criticize. We go to enjoy the performances of the actors and the songs they sing.    Le Mis is one of our favorites, that's why we bought this CD. The fact that there was a \\"crash\\" of something backstage during one song shows that things do happen in live performances. Did I hear it? Yes I did, but it in no way demeans the performance or my enjoyment of the music. In fact, I only heard it because I read the review of a critic. Normally, I never read those things.    Was this product good? No it was really good, enjoyable and worth the purchase. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music and Le Mis.
0143038419|5.0|I loved it and find it hard to believe so many people didn't.  I feel like the author has an incredible sense of humor and I found her light hearted approach to life's biggest challenges refreshing given all the boring self help books on the market. What we all really need is to take ourselves a little less seriously and have a good laugh from time to time.  Life is so short .  . . eat, pray, love.

B00000DGXN|3.0|This is an extremely solid album and an album that anyone could love--and maybe that's why I'm left with the feeling that it falls short of what it might have been. These guys are some of the best--and each of them has released plenty of cutting edge stuff, but this album has them all solidly within their comfort zone. They've created a superlative performance, but not a particularly moving one.    This is an album that almost anyone can feel good about--and if you're anything like me, for music to really shake your world, it needs to be more personal than that. This will never be my favorite album, and it probably won't become yours either, but listen to it anyways, and learn the tunes if you're so inclined.     The album comes off as a tasteful jam session. Nothing wrong with that, but these guys have all created much more exciting stuff.
B001FB55HG|5.0|This is a great flick.  I love it.  I like the way how this movie move away from the first 3 movies and the tv show.  I like how John Connor finally become a real man away from the punk in T2 and T3. It is also interesting to see that John Connor become a prophet in this movie.  This movie is more story-driven with great action and visual.  The story is deeper and darker than the previous movies.  The visual is awesome!  It looks so real.  5 stars from me.
0061537934|5.0|Yes, telling a story from a dog's perspective may seem like a gimmick, but it's one that works. Telling a story from a dog's perspective let's us gain perspective on our basic, quirky humanness.     I don't need to reiterate the plot summary that others have adequately described. Yes, I am a dog lover and was perhaps initially attracted to the book because of that. Rest assured that you needn't be a dog lover to be drawn in; I just suggested the book to my significant other (albeit a non-dog-lover) who is now fully and deliciously absorbed in the novel.    This is a very easy, absorbing read -- I completed it in less than 24 hours.    If you are a bit of a mush like me, consider yourself warned: I had trouble reading the last 5-6 pages, because my eyes were filled with tears.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I don't typically take the time to write bad reviews, but having just finished the first season, I felt compelled to discuss how awful this show is.<br /><br />However I appreciated the talent of Jeremy Northam and Sam Neill, the rest of the cast was so unsuitable. Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII? I was skeptical about that when purchasing, but thought it might be interesting anyway. This show is filled with typically attractive but untalented actors, magnified by the fact that none of them carry the presence of the characters they are supposed to portray: attitude, appearance, actions. It is all wrong. There is so little historically accurate sequencing in this show that I could not help but feel like I was watching a TV version of a poorly researched \\"historical\\" romance novel.<br /><br />If you shelve the notion that you actually wanted this show to be an accurate historical drama, there are so many other flaws that make it a poor piece of fiction as well. Dozens of misplaced and unnecessary sex scenes (though I should have expected that from Showtime) detract from what incredulous shreds of a story are present, and a complete lack of development left me wondering why many of the characters were included in the story. However much I want to believe that the scripting style was intentional to give it's characters a more relatable and humanistic persona, I can't convince myself that it was profound in any way. The writers seemed fueled by shock value and ratings, but completely missed the era they were attempting to depict.<br /><br />I recently succumbed to a piqued interest in Tudor history, taking notice of Alison Weir's books and various movies and documentaries on the topic, but this show contributed absolutely nothing to my attention and curiosity. Even aside from my disappointment in accuracy, it was a disappointment in entertainment value. A waste of time and money, I would not recommend it to anyone.

B0016OOM7Q|5.0|Maddonna is singing \\"You always love me more miles away. I hear it in your voice when you are miles away. you're not afraid to tell me miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So for away.\\" This is love song of a pair of lovers living saparated each other. And I think very good dance music. Remix record is good too. In Japan this song made use of theme song of Japanese TV drama. It is a success story that one day a teacher teaching in the country suddenly become the Prime Minister of Japan. And \\"Hard Candy\\" is so luxurious LP record set. Because this set has 2LP and one bonus LP,this is remix of \\"4 minutes\\", and one CD same as 2 LP. You should buy \\"Hard Candy\\". And let's aid her!  Madonna buckles on the belt of  M.DOLLR and she says \\"Give it to me!\\" on this record jacket,doesn't she?  But tonight I tried to listen \\"like a virgin\\" again. After all I think I wonder it's my favorite! And I listened \\"MUSIC\\" and \\"AMERICAN LIFE\\" too. Do you know \\"AMERICAN PIE\\" was sang by Don Mclean on 1972? I know so well. Because I had his single record. In my boyhood I used to save my money and go to record shop to look for records of pops and rock music I want. The stars and Stripes was drawn on his sum. It's \\"American Pie Part 1 & 2\\". And its price was printed 400 yen by small figures on its record jacket.  By the way,for me,I am a fun of Miles Davis, the words of \\"Miles Away\\" makes me be conscious of Miles Davis. It may be sutupid thing. Whenever she is singing \\"Miles Away!\\", I feel like that she is singing \\"Miles has gone!\\" and I remember that day the king of jazz had gone and I was crying just like a woman so I feel so sad.  And still now I miss him.
B001SMC91M|4.0|I am a sucker for a great horn section, I've always enjoyed Tower of Power and great Motown horn sections. This album especially the first 4 tracks has some of the best soul horn-driven tracks I have heard in a long time. Given Austin's vibrant music scene it was a very smart move to involve Grupo Fantasma's horns on this album. But it is not only the horns, the instruments all around are the highlight of this album. Very good bass playing, again reminscient of Motown's best. The bass is so good on some tracks that it is carrying the track along. Very enjoyable guitar work throughout the tracks as well. Some good organ work as well especially on track 9 and track 2.<br /><br />The first 4 tracks have a James Brown meets Tower of Power feel and I really enjoyed them. Track 6 I also quite enjoyed, has a really cool Memphis Blues, Muddy Waters feel to it.<br /><br />Two main reasons for a 4 instead of a 5. One the vocals are ok to good but not why I would go see the band live (which I am going to do, living in Austin is great). I will go for the instruments, and the driven band sound. And also it is a little short at only 10 tracks. Could have used at least another couple of tracks. However for fans of great-band driven soul with some honest vocals and some fantastic horn playing, this is a great album.
B00009P1O0|5.0|ON THE BEACH is yet another underrated example of how Neil Young overcame three challenges (epilepsy, diabetes, polio) to virtually turn music on its head. In fact, the fact that Young's disabilities haven't stopped him from controlling his own career is part of why this album was unavailable on CD for so long. Digging his way out of the despair of TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT (recorded earlier but released a year later), Young creates a strange hybrid of hippie folk-rockers Buffalo Springfield and pro-law-enforcement hard rockers Montrose, which seemed to foretell what he would do for much of the second half of the 70s. This CD has a line on the first song, \\"Sooner or later, it all gets real\\", which inspired me to hang up pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to excessive self-indulgence. This CD is great and deserves much higher regard than it's gotten over the years.

B001VLBDD0|5.0|Terminator 2 is very suspenseful with a lot of action. I like seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger on the good side. The movie also has funny parts. I like all the Terminator movies and I bought them because my son wanted to watch them after seeing Terminator 2, 3D at Universal Orlando. The cyborgs can do cool stuff and the bad one is made of liquid metal.
B0000256KE|2.0|Origially I heard a song in a movie,\\"Wonderland\\" about John Holmes after the fame was over and he was a base head, or smoked cocaine. I thought the movie was a 5 star and I kept hearing exerpts of a song that sounded cool. Research revealed that song to be \\"In Every Dream Home, a Heartache\\" by Roxy Music, their second album. As usual I went to Amazon dot com to find out more and then to buy it. I try them first as its generally the best place with the best deal. I ordered it and got it. I put it in and played it. the entirity of it was different than the song I liked; sounding like Devo on bad dope. I just stored the good tune and put away the cd, adding to my collection of goodies on my C drive to load wherever i wanted it. We had a band back in college that was better than the rest of it. But hey, I got it \\"used like new\\" for very little and wasnt feeling ripped off or anything rash.  Maybe this is why , in 37 yrs of being a musician, i never heard of Roxy Music. lol<br /><br />Harold Ewing II jun 2009
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|\\"Gran Torino\\" is a gem of a movie that once again affirms Clint Eastwood's brilliant abilities. From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.<br /><br />Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.<br /><br />The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of \\"gooks\\" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.<br /><br />There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.<br /><br />The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.ese myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking.

B0010DRYRI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. Although not necessarily true, the story is a good one and the production is done well. The acting is good.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Although its been more than twenty years since I've seen this flick, I still have fond memories of it!  An excellent music score and a quirky lover's triangle between a guy, a girl and a jealous computer make this one a fav.  Since apparently this movie has already made it to DVD in Region 2, it would be nice to see it hit the shelves as a Region 1 in the US.
B00009N83Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and Madeline Kahn outdo themselves with witty, well-written dialogue.  This movie is full of everything you love about Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds.  Plenty of action and comedy.  A must see for any Clint Eastwood or Burt Reynolds fan.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|This book put a smile on my face.  The thoughts he records here are all things I wish I could have thought of.  The brilliant simplicity of syle was refreshing and thought provoking.  Highly recommended.  No problems with the Kindle version.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Some spoilers follow...    I really expected a bad movie considering it was \\"Charlie's Angels\\" McG at the helm, but it actually had the same \\"B\\" movie feeling the other three had...he could use a little help in the story editing department (the flow was a little clunky here and there...almost like stuff was missing), but the script seemed solid enough to me. Like most movies these days, I'm sure there is a great deal of footage on the floor so to speak, that could end up being an extended version of this that could possibly clarify things a bit.    The production was outstanding...this will a great demo disc on BR, especially with the sound design...very layered and intense. The special effects were great and everything from sets to make-up to costumes and photography was a step up from the earlier films, giving it an epic feel. It has a gritty look to the action that suits the setting and story perfectly. The physical action were really well done...again, adding an intense realism to the movie without being over the top.  Stand-outs include the sensational \\"Harvester\\" chase scene and both times Conner is in a chopper...watch out!     Another surprise here is the choice of Danny Elfman, and his score sounds quite good...a little too reminiscent of his work on Marky Mark's Ape flick maybe, but it still works none the less....he gives the music a more traditional orchestral sound opposed to the over-use of synthesizers that many action films rely on these days. It was cool to hear Fidel's main motif pop in once in a while at just the right times. There's an interesting recurring motif for the Marcus character that reminds me of Ron Grainer's work on \\"The Omega Man\\", further adding to that cool `70's apocalyptic vibe that parts of this movie has.    Now the cast...as mentioned by many other reviews, this is definitely Sam Worthington's show...the story invests a lot of time in Marcus' journey through the film an it helps that Worthington does a really good job with hisphysical performance (especially with those little nods to Arnold's \\"stillness\\" along the way) and he comes across well acting-wise too. I found his struggle with what he really was provided the most poignant moments in the movie...a man trapped in a new existence as a Terminator, fighting to stay connected with his flawed humanity and looking for some kind of redemption for his own past and ending up providing a \\"salvation\\" for the resistance and it's new leader....cool stuff and an interesting twist on the whole \\"Terminator\\" story.    Bale was almost a supporting actor in this thing...he was competent, but not outstanding. Again, his role could have been sabotaged by the script and the editing as much as anything... Compared to Marcus, Bale's John Conner seemed a little one-note with his performance throughout the film. Could be considered the nature of his character here but... There were some cool moments with him though, like when he pops on that GnR tune before capturing the MotoTerminator that brought back memories of the Connor character's motorbike stunts in T2. I also liked that it was pretty clear that not everyone in the resistance (most notably the higher-ups) though he was \\"all that\\", but the grunts in the trenches did...gave him an everyman appeal that was pretty cool.    Another show-stealer was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese...this young man is proving to be quite the chameleon as an actor this summer, first in \\"Star Trek\\" as the precocious boy-genius Chekov and now here he is almost literally channeling Michael Biehn (right down to talking through clenched teeth) as the young resistance fighter Reese.    Both of the female characters are a little short-shifted here, but both Howard and Bloodgood do a good job in the brief scenes they have.    Like the recent \\"Star Trek\\" picture, this one had a lot of visual nods (and some obvious lines) to the earlier films, from the cool opening credits looking similar to the ones the first film to a lot of physicalgags from other movies as well, especially with Marcus. The action sequences were well-staged and packed some punch. And yes, the Arnold cameo featured some excellent work from ILM...very well integrated both visually and in the story....very cool. The ending? Well, I'll just leave it at...I like what the film presented way better than the \\"leaked\\" one....yeah, maybe it seemed a little sappy to some, but I though it fit well.    The main thing that really shines though in this movie for me is that it really looks like an effort by folks that really cared about the Terminator saga and wanted to do a great job. As with any of these \\"franchise\\" movies, there are always fans who disagree with the approach taken with the film or story elements or casting choices or whatever. But it works great for me...I hope this movie finds a big, receptive audience on DVD and Blu-Ray...    But...if this ends up being the end of the line for the Terminator saga (and the slowing domestic BO suggests it might be)...it's a good one, but I'm game for more...
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Wow, as someone who was actually at Woodstock (the one true one), I am totally thrilled by this box set.<br /><br />First, the film looks and sounds better than ever, with a crystal-clear picture and awesome surround sound.<br /><br />Second, the film is the longer Director's Cut, featuring classic performances that didn't appear in the original theatrical version, most notably Janis and I think more Jimi.  Both are mind-blowing.<br /><br />Third, most of the performances on the \\"extras\\" disc -- never before seen -- are as good as the performances in the film!!!<br /><br />I had occasion to watch Monterey Pop again recently, and now that I've seen Woodstock including the bonus footage -- Woodstock hands-down had the greatest performances, by the greatest performers, at the peak of their powers!!!<br /><br />Really, if you're a fan of Woodstock or the music of the period, the \\"extras\\" disc is worth the price of admission here itself.  Amazing performances by Joan Baez, Canned Heat, the Who, Joe Cocker, and Santana, plus festival performers not seen in the original film, notably Creedence, the Dead, and Johnny Winter.<br /><br />The extras disc also has some interesting interviews with many festival participants and attendees, including then-cameraman Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />If you buy the set from Amazon, you also get a Bonus disc, with some additional numbers including the Dead doing \\"Mama Tried\\" and the Airplane doing \\"Volunteers\\".<br /><br />Finally, I agree with other reviewers' comments about the difficulty of removing the discs from the cardboard sleeves without scuffing them.  WB just loves these dopey cheapo cardboard packs.<br /><br />Otherwise, however, the leather fringe vest in which the box is dressed, along with the embroidered WS patch, repro concert tickets, lucite paperweight with lenticular multi-scene pictures, and mini version of the Life WS special issue are all cool in my book.  (I still have my un-taken tix and Life issue somewhere in the house!)<br /><br />About the only negative I can think of is the inevitable \\"Half-Century Deluxe Ultimate\\" box set which will undoubtedly come in ten years, hopefully with more unseen performances.<br /><br />Until then, this box pays fit and proper tribute to one of the great events of the sixties and one of the greatest events I have ever been fortunate to witness.<br /><br />HIGHly recommended (inhaling can be a good thing)!-Century Deluxe Ultimate\\" box set which will undoubtedly come in ten years, hopefully with more unseen performances.

These songs are definitely something you can cruse to as well as chill with a glass of that special tonic while relaxing at the crib. The production was pretty excellent here as well. This cd is quite exotic. Welcome back Ms. Williams.

0765342294|5.0|Ender's Game<br /><br />By Orson Scott Card<br /><br />Review by David White<br /><br />Is Ender's Game a classic, is it mainstream fiction, or perhaps just an above average sci-fi novel? Such classifications lead to the realization that a book like Ender's Game is all three. Ender's Game started its journey to the acclaim that it enjoys today as a short story about brilliant children learning to fight and win a near hopeless war against an alien enemy by playing sophisticated games. When it made its transformation into a book in 1985, however, many things changed. Ender and company still prepare to fight the Buggers while battling one another, but what becomes more important in the novel is Ender himself.<br /><br />The book begins with Ender's life as a \\"third\\" or an illegal third child granted existence by the government for his potential in government service. Ender is an outcast who is tormented by his schoolmates but gives himself no choice but victory over them. His defeat of the gang leader, Stilson, in the opening pages is all that Col. Graff, the commander of the Battle School, needs to see to know that their commissioning this third was warranted.<br /><br />Ender is, from the moment of his introduction at the Battle School, surrounded by enemies. It is, in effect, a story coping with this peculiar way of life. A telling fact of the book is that it is the teachers, primarily Graff, who has engineered these series of contests even to the end. Even after everything Ender is forced to endure, he is able to defeat the Buggers, without and because of the fact that he didn't know he was fighting them. This victory was only attained, however, by giving up playing the game when winning; he realizes it is not worth the cost. The moment of victory for all mankind is a moment of defeat for Ender.<br /><br />As Ender was learning to fight and overcome his enemies, his former foe, his brother Peter is, with the help of his sister Valentine, establishing himself as the heir-apparent to the hegemony of earth. When the war ends Peter decrees that Ender will not be allowed to return to earth, and is essentially banished to the colonies opened up by the end of the war. Ender will spend the rest of his life traveling to these colonies with Valentine working to undo the damage his defeat of the Buggers, who Ender had destroyed, by giving back their place in the galaxy.<br /><br />Ender's Game began life as a sci-fi short story, but in novel form it establishes itself as a model for all SF which ought to work to show, through the use of spectacular plot and setting, the strength and weakness of the human character. Ender's story is the story of the growth of character throughout life, not just childhood. Even as Graff thinks, and accepts, that he is responsible for the terrible actions Ender was forced to take in his training, Ender puts the weight of the destruction of the Buggers on himself. Ender showed that, although life is not fair and balanced, and surely ignorance of the implications of one's actions does not exempt one from them, each person must take up his burden.When the war ends Peter decrees that Ender will not be allowed to return to earth, and is essentially banished to the colonies opened up by the end of the war.

1595141979|5.0|[[ASIN:1595141979 Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy, Book 3)]] This was one of the best books I ever read. I could not put it down. I have a tendency to feel what the characters are feeling... and this book makes you feel. By the end I had felt happy, angry, full of love, and full of sorrow. The story captures you in and doesn't let go.    I do believe the author had a tendency to repeat alot. For example, being as this is the third book the reader already know what a Strigoi, a Moroi, and a Dhampir is. Other then that, it was a really well written book.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I luv Star Trek - all of them! So, when I saw this complete set I couldn't resist. The whole family now watches with me! I like that one side of the DVD is the \\"remastered\\" side & the other is the the original untouched version. I also like the extra features on each DVD.

B001TODCII|5.0|I typically dislike action movies because they can get ridiculous and repetitive, but I really enjoyed this movie. I would also recommend it to anyone who enjoys thriller movies since it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Ok I just recieved the boxed set, within 5 days from ordering from Amazon. The packaging is good and a neat litle hologram on the box. Annoyingly the proof of purchase token is on the removable shiny paper backing, well I threw it out, hopefully I'll never need it.     To the meat. Ok so I was excited when this arrived. I'm running this on a fully firmware updated PS3 on a 52\\" 1080 Samsung LCD with surround sound.     I watched BD \\"The Wrath of Khan\\". The sound is really good. Picture, well ok it's clearly HD but not the leap I was expecting. It's not \\"Batman Returns\\", of course people will say hey it's old. Well I also watched the first Sean Connery BD Bond, \\"Dr No\\", it looked terrific plus I have both the HD and BD Star Trek Original Series (1) which looks amazing but the HD version had some sound issues.      I then popped in a regular Star Trek DVD for comparison. Honestly maybe I'm missing something it's (the BD version) is just not as good picture wise as I'd expected.    I rely a lot on Amazon reviews, maybe my expectations where too high? But I suspect that with Toshiba paying for the restoration of The Original Series and I guess someone doing the same for Bond, I expected that standard here and it's absent so far. I'll update this as I watch the others. I have no axe to grind and I'm very glad I paid only the $60 or so on Amazon rather than full price. Just a heads up I don't know about some of the reviews, I imagine people want to like this product more, hey I would too.
0385736002|2.0|I was intrigued by the premise of this book and really looking forward to a story revolving around Nicholas Flamel, a person from history with a good deal of mystery swirling around him. The Alchemyst simply did not deliver.<br /><br />The lack of characterization was, for me, the book's biggest flaw. Not only was Flamel himself dull but, with the exception of Perenelle Flamel (who didn't appear often enough to satisfy me), the other characters struck me as flat and uninteresting. And because I wasn't involved with them, I found myself unable to care about the dangers they faced.<br /><br />Aside from wondering why on earth Josh and Sophie would agree to the 'Awakening' when they were told it was highly dangerous, even potentially deadly and cringing each time Scathach was refered to as \\"Scatty\\", I found myself, fairly early on, distracted by plot issues. Why, I wondered, when there was an explosion that shook an entire building and blew out some windows in a retail area of a large U.S. city, did no cops show up? I know the main characters chose not to call them, but wouldn't someone else? Could we have, at least, heard approaching sirens? Why was there a fire extinguisher in the car? Do lots of people carry these behind the front seat? Were the twins really born only 28 seconds apart? Was it a c-section? When Yggdrasill - which was \\"the height and circumference of a large skyscraper\\" - \\"shattered and came crashing down on the ice statue of Hekate, crushing it to dust\\" why weren't Dee, Morrigan and Bastet, who were close enough to see Hekate's eyes, buried or struck by any rumble? And if Hekate was crushed to dust  - and under something that huge - how was Dee finding pieces of her to work his spell on?<br /><br />Okay, okay, I'll admit this sounds nitpicky. But once my mind starts asking these kinds of questions, I am totally pulled out of the story. And unfortunately, The Alchemyst never managed to pull me back in.<br /><br />I had waited to read The Alchemyst until a couple more books in the series were available, planning to make a weekend out of it. Instead, The Magician and The Sorceress will be going back. A disappointment all around.ries were available, planning to make a weekend out of it.

0743290127|2.0|I won't say that this is one of the worst books I've ever read, but I will say that I was very disappointed.  I loved Devil Wears Prada and liked Everyone Worth Knowing so I went into this one with high expectations. Expectations that were not, unfortunately, met.  I did not like any of the characters and didn't much care how they got themselves out of trouble.  I hope Weisberger's next effort is better.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Walt Kowalski is a Korean war vet and a retired auto worker. He has lost his wife and has seen his neighborhood deteriorate. He lashes out with hatred and contempt at everyone around him. Underneath all of this though is a man with high morals and a real sense of what's right and wrong. This is easily the most powerful acting performance of Clint Eastwood's career. He was snubbed for the Oscars, but no matter. This is the performance of a lifetime, even outdistancing his role in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Eastwood also produces and directs this drama that takes us deep inside Walt Kowalski's soul. The ending is an absolute shocker too. Rumor has it that this is Eastwood's final film as an actor. If this is so, then he has saved his best for last. It is the partial ending (hopefully he will continue to produce and direct) of the career of one of America's greatest film makers.

B001W63DX2|5.0|What a feat, pulling off what might be the most complex tour in rock history, Flight 666 captures the energy of the crowds while giving a behind-the-scenes look at the kind of work and intense planning that made the tour possible.  Maiden has not only proven themselves to be one of the most popular and enduring Metal acts of all time, but have also displayed how over the years they have built an organization that pulled off a logistics nightmare the many of the Fortune 500 could not have.    Hopefully this is not the end of the road for Maiden, but if it is, what a great way to sign-off.
0156030209|5.0|I just finished Life Of Pi, and I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I just read. In a very literal sense, it's a fantastic story of survival, while on the other hand seems an impossible parable. It takes the time to explain exactly how everything that is happening is happening, but looking back on it you can't help but feel it is too surreal and impossible to have ever occurred, though you don't doubt it's real for a moment while it's happening. It's quite an extraordinary accomplishment. One wouldn't think a strange story about a boy stranded at sea with a bengal tiger would give you a great deal to contemplate, but this does. It's more than just a simple \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" meets \\"The Jungle Book\\". There's a depth, a richness to this book that would have made both Hemingway and Kipling proud.    I know I'll be reading this book again. There is a great deal to take in. The way Martel has connected religion, zoology and survival is remarkable, and not something you can read through quickly or just once.
0887307280|5.0|This book came to me in great shape in a timely manner.  It was a discarded copy from a library, but hey, who cares?  It was perfectly readable, that's why I purchased it! I recommend this seller.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I absolutely love Clive Cussler novels. I love that Dirk Pitt runs around saving everyone in the world, getting out of tight spots with only a screwdriver and always gets the woman. It sounds very James Bondish or MacGiverish when described this way. In realty Dirk is a combo of the two- sexy, drives nice cars when he can, takes care of the woman around him and yet able to get out of tight spots with nothing but his wits and a few odds and ends.<br /><br />This movie lived up to my expectations of great fun.<br /><br />Others have reviewed and covered the plot far more deeply than I can. Needless to say, the hero saved the day, saved the girl, saved the world and saved his best friend. He got a cool car out of the deal and a kiss from the girl and had fun doing it.<br /><br />This movie has moments that made me laugh.<br /><br />It was a fun movie. Enjoy. Worth the money.

First i would like to say that is a little weird and out there but when people go as far as to say that every kid will be scared and have nightmares thats just plain sterotyping(get the pun its sterotyping and i am typing this ha ha ha!!!)Well as i was saying it is perfect! The mom is really so evil but is so good at being nice to coraline in the beggining and then she turns into a giant praying mantis( i never saw that coming but i saw it in the previews!!!) i defintly think that every one across the nation should have coraline in their homes!!!

0307278255|3.0|Yes, I am an Indian-American, and yes, when I read \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and then \\"The Namesake\\", I was one of the many who had that wonderful reaction elicited by so much of great literature - \\"This is my life story\\". I was amazed at Jhumpa Lahiri's pinpoint, heartbreaking characterization of \\"generational divides\\", the difficulty of making a way in the world all one's own, the clash and commingling of cultures. I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but I literally cried during the entire movie adaptation of \\"The Namesake\\", it was that good.     I've grown older over the past decade, and so has Lahiri, but here we are in 2009 (well the book was published in 2008), and she is still cranking out much of the same writing workshop-perfect depictions of first and second generation immigrants - the small cracks present in the facade of everyday life, small victories, small defeats. She has stated numerous times in interviews that she deliberately stays within this realm of Bengali-American immigrants, and that's her prerogative as a human being and an artist; indeed there is a rich tradition of writers who've always written within their narrow social milieu. But here's the thing - three books into her career, Lahiri's writing for whatever reason is just not that interesting, and honestly seems largely recycled from her previous work.      Perhaps it's just me - and I probably will get a lot of negative ratings for this - but increasingly, I find this sort of small, micro-scale, little domestic conflicts kind of writing boring and largely irrelevant to our times. Our economy is failing, we are in numerous wars across the globe, many are struggling with what it means to be an American, health care is broken, century-old companies are going out of business, oil is running out, and here we have another little story about an upper class woman and her alcoholic brother, and alright, we get it you are Indian, well-off, second-generation, and you don't know which way to turn in your adult life, etc., etc. It's not all bad, the title story was well-crafted and pretty enjoyable, but Lahiri is too good of a writer to settle for \\"well-crafted and pretty enjoyable.\\" Let's see more writing about big things, big issues, life and death, moral obligations, how to live as an American in trying times, what is really important. She gets at this in a lot of her stories, but again, all of it is just so muted, rehashed, and unoriginal - buildup, conflict, anticlimactic non-conclusions. Let's have big and bold and passionate instead of twee and small and fractured, and that goes for all art, not just fiction or Jhumpa Lahiri.     (For example, say what you will about Dave Eggers' often \\"too cute\\" website and early meta-experiments, I think he's started to understand the need for art that tangles with bigger issues, and you need look no further than What is the What? or the direction McSweeney's has taken in recent years for gorgeous, heartening evidence. Also, huge props to Ben Fountain and his engaged collection of short stories.)    Yes, there will always be a place and a market for this subject matter, and perhaps it's just a limitation of a pretty limited form, but in these times, unless a \\"domestic life\\" short story is incredibly well written and/or innovative (i.e. Charles D'Ambrosio), it's just, well, dull. I hate to criticize a writer who I love so much (and that's why I stayed with 3 stars), but I'm beginning to think she's one of those artists who burst onto the scene fully-developed and then go no-where. I hope she proves me wrong.
B000053ZRR|4.0|Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan perhaps said it best Bon Jovi is the ultimate bar band. No special effects, no computer generated sounds just rock and roll. In late August 2000, Bon Jovi took his Crush Tour to a sold out stadium in Zurich, Switzerland and on that rainy night he did what he does best he made pure American rock.    The show features what appears to be a slightly edited version of the concert played that night and it runs just over two hours. The band works its way through twenty songs (featuring seven from the Crush album) with plenty of energy and emotion to spare. This isn't a night for the mellow, it's a night of rock and roll power anthems. There is plenty of arm waving and singing along and it is a fun way to spend the night. It hardly matters that many of the songs sound the same.    The standard definition disc does a nice job with the visual quality but the 5.1 sound comes across as a little thin at times but this is hardly a problem. The disc features two videoes from Crush, an interesting and well made \\"On Tour\\" documentary, a slide show type photo gallery, and an up to 2000 current discography.    Well worth it.
1905654294|2.0|I had enjoyed Eclipse so much, I could not wait to get my hands on this one, and not having read any reviews of Breaking Dawn, expected a LOT.    I was disappointed with the way the story went for most of the book, though in saying this, I couldn't really put the book down (maybe I was hoping that the story would redeem itself, somehow).    I wanted to read about Edward & Bella as they start their new married life, and Bella's eventual transformation (we all know it had to be coming soon) and all the stories that could be attached to that particular event!!! (relationships with friends, family, going to college etc, what would go wrong and what would go right with her vampire life).    But instead we get this complicated and unnecessary story about the birth of a freaky child and the characters that we seemed to get to know so well previously, fade away in the story to allow this child dominate every part of the book (to its detriment).    I know the author probably wanted to wrap up the series (why, I don't understand; its a money spinner) with a nice little ending, but the Cullen family (and Jacob and friends) that were once so interesting, now seemed like supporting characters to a bizarre 6 month old child.       Good news in the story:  once Bella is a vampire, she seems a lot more likeable and doesn't seem as annoying but on the downside, her new life and her adjustment to it, is just a little too perfect.   All the angst, loss of friends/family and all the newborn vampire problems that books 1-3 had covered in depth, were just dismissed.       It was disappointing to see the series end so poorly.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I listened to the album wearing grooves in the grooves in college.<br />It brightened dingy walls with falling plaster and watermarked stains that held a kid that wanted to be an \\"artist.\\" One who lost, turned into a teacher that seems a perpetual student. Stevie Wonder gave a set of songs that I can put on in times I'm utterly soundless to solutions and exhausted, waiting to get through, or slip by, and find myself inspired.<br />The songs are filled with love, \\"Wonder,\\" I think the sheer appreciation for life, take a song like \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" it's such a statement on life for a child in a ghetto-how really has it changed? Tell me. I went to work in those ghettos.

I think not.<br />I don't find you here.<br /><br />Maybe \\"I Wish\\" is my favorite...hummm...maybe. The rhythm. Or Knocks me Off My Feet. it really is hard to pick.<br />But for me the album opens with Sir Duke. That's when I got kicked. It's just a feeling of the power of the music, its ability to bring you joy. What a tribute to his relationship to music.<br />Kids, let me assure you, like the music. Not all but some of my favorite Wonder years tunes are here. Joyful.<br />I just bought it again to replace the vinyl that skips and jumps. And wobbles like the owner.<br />And I hear records are returning. I hope they are.<br /><br />I loved setting up my turntable with this one late nights painting.<br />Like the sound still.<br />Small review, insignificant reviewer, mighty musician.

0140158766|4.0|\\"Chickenhawk:Back in the World's\\" picks up exactly where Mason's first book left off. Briefly, Mason starts off relating that upon his return from his 1 year tour of Vietnam as a chopper pilot (Sept. 1965 to Aug. 1966) he became a helicopter instructor pilot. [[ASIN:0143035711 Chickenhawk]] This ends quickly after Mason is tormented by severe P.T.S.D symptoms, hallucinations, panic attacks, depression and insomnia.  As a result of this, he quit his position and left the military. In the backdrop of authoring his best selling book, Mason slipped into drug and alcohol addiction as well as adultery. [[ASIN:1892220075 Recovering from the War: A Guide for All Veterans, Family Members, Friends and Therapists]] His wife, aptly named \\"Patience\\" stayed with him and eventually authored her own book about surviving the demons of P.T.S.D., from the viewpoint of a spouse.<br /><br />Mason takes on one failing job venture after another, ending with a financial fiasco creating a company manufacturing mirrors. Doubting that his book will ever sell and on the verge of financial ruin, Mason meets two misfits that con him into coming with them on a small ocean vessel called the \\"Nemaste\\", bound for the Colombian Coast to pick up 3,500 lbs. of marijuana to smuggle back to the U.S.  Graphically recounting the Caribbean voyage, Mason and his crew picked up the dope and upon reentering U.S. waters were busted by the waiting U.S. Coast Guard. Mason received 2 years at Eglin, a minimum security prison in Florida. [[ASIN:1550227831 Smuggler's Blues: The Saga of a Marijuana Importer]] It is in Eglin that Mason learned that \\"Chickenhawk\\" was a best seller. \\"Back in the World\\" ends with some major revelations of Mason's feelings about the Vietnam War, his thoughts of what the causes of P.T.S.D. are and the announcement of a fictional book he penned.<br /><br />Mason has some very unusual stories and anecdotes in \\"Back in the World\\". He writes how the U.S. government in his opinion manufacturers crime. Mason gives us proof of this by telling a story of a man he met in jail named \\"Danny\\", a pilot. Mason is told by Danny that he was approached by 2 guys that offered him $10,000 to simply test drive a new DC-6. [[ASIN:0440207819 Once a Hero]] If Danny liked the plane, they will pay him another $90,000 to fly in contraband from South America. Danny test drove the plane, accepted the 10K from the 2 men, and went home to discuss the story with his wife. The next day, he returned the $10,000 to the 2 men and told them \\"no deal\\" (something Mason points out he wished he did in his ill-fated boat ride to Colombia). [[ASIN:1557733090 Weapon]] A year later, Danny was arrested and convicted of conspiracy. He received 5 years. The 2 men were D.E.A. agents and Danny's crime was that he failed to inform the authorities about the offer the 2 men made.<br /><br />Finally, there is the bone chilling story Mason tells of \\"Johnson\\" the Navy Seal and professional assassin, who wouldn't say why he was at Eglin, but tells Mason that he almost strangled his wife to death, has no friends, likes to kill, and that his \\"employer\\" (the U.S. Government) will be getting him out any day, because there is a \\"job\\" coming up. [[ASIN:0595133665 TDY]] Mason listens to Johnson's stories of personal assassinations in Vietnam  that he carried out as part of the infamous \\"Phoenix Program\\". This was a program the U.S. Government undertook in conjunction with the Navy Seal Team and plotted in the U.S. by the \\"Rand Corporation\\". Communist Viet Cong elders, teachers or leaders were kidnapped, interrogated for intelligence and ultimately murdered. [[ASIN:0312929412 Cleared Hot!: A Marine Combat Pilot's Vietnam Diary (Special Warfare Series)]] Mason relates how Johnson claimed that the Government was going to get him out in 2 days so he can \\"execute\\" a job that has come up. Sure enough, 2 days later, Johnson was out! Scary! There are many stories like this and I found this book very enjoyable to read! An excellent sequel to his first book!n excellent sequel to his first book!
0307266303|5.0|I'm a marathon runner and I LOVE running. I have read quite a few running books but this is definitely by far the BEST and most inspirational book on this amazing sport. It told me that there is people with the same mindset and passion at the other end of the world - and that we're all one big family as we're all decedents of the skinny, fruit eating homo sapiens!
1423101472|5.0|I have loved the Percy Jackson series, and I feel that this book really ended the series on a good note!    This book continues the story of the Half-bloods fight to stop Kronos from killing the gods and taking over. Percy finally gets to hear the prophecy, that has been mentioned from the beginning of the series and try to understand what it means to him. Battles ensue and in the end there is only one side that wins(You probably can guess!)     This book was action packed from the beginning and full of twists and turns. There are moments that make you laugh, that make you sad, and even some that make you a little angry. But, that is what a good book should do, and this is a great book!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.    Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, \\"Dad's still living in the '50s.\\"    Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.    This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.    The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's \\"get off my lawn\\" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.    The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.    There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.    The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.    This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.    Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word. You may not agree that it is the single best film of 2008 but you'll be hard-pressed to find a film that will make you laugh and cry equally as hard in a span of less than 2 hours.    GRADE: A-
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I Really Like it on Blu-Ray ...  I watched it in DVD then i said i should but it on Blu-Ray ...  It will Make a BIG diffrence
B0025X4P56|4.0|Good album, no doubt.  It's not on the level of their better days, but good.  It's quite easy as easy is the desire.  Love the lyrics.  Better than Shootenanny and Souljacker.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I was awestruck by PlayingforChange. This work is really what the world needs now AND it is reeally good on the ears. A-mazing & In-Spiring. Cannot give a better review. If you are a audio download type person you can get it as mp3s through their website too. This is one item worth the buy- no doubt and you know your $$ isn't going into the pocket of some millionaire jerk or his record company. ;)
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This is a visually jaw-dropping movie, but for non-FFVII people, the fun ends there, especially if you already sat through regular FF VII: AC.  But if you liked the regular version, then you'll love this!  Some of the changes/additions made simply explain/develop characters more completely, and some of the changes/additions make the action more believable (adding dirt smudges to characters' faces, adding blood, adding more realistic sound effects, etc.)
B0015KO52S|5.0|We've listened to it all the way through about 50 times.  Great lyrics and mixing of styles.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I'm so disapointed in this movie.I'm glad I waited for \\"The Dark Knight\\"to come on HBO instead of paying for the DVD.  Heath Ledger is great,He really is the Joker,but TOO much Tongue.A couple of times is alright,but every scene !  Christian Bale is horrible.He sounds like Puddy on Seinfield.I can't believe he was cast to play Batman.  \\"The Dark Knight\\"is not a film I want to watch again.
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|Romantic comedy junkies are in for a treat. As a Bullock fan I couldn't resist the sneak preview of The Proposal. Even after the first five minutes of the film were soundless due to technical issues in my theater, I have to say it's one of the best films romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds doesn't need words to act, his eyes and facial expressions make his thoughts loud and clear. Are there more expressive eyes in Hollywood? And sarcasm, oh, there is plenty of sarcasm from both main characters. Nobody does psycho/prickly/vulnerable like Sandra Bullock. Anyone who loved While You Were Sleeping and Two Weeks Notice is going to find similar flavors of fun and fire in The Proposal.<br /><br />The story is quirky and odd enough that I smirked through much of the plot as it unfolded. You can't have romantic comedy without some predictability, but it was a joy to watch. Oscar Nunez (The Office) played multiple scenes and one left me laughing until I squirmed. If you can't stomach the thought of Oscar dancing in a Speedo, you might want to wait for the DVD version so you can skip it. A semi-nude scene with Bullock and Reynolds, along with the Speedo dance make it iffy for kids, as does a smattering of off-color comments and a bit of language. The semi-nude scene runs in the previews I've seen, but there are a few prolonged moments with Bullock covering up but showing lots of skin and a side view of a collision that make it longer in the movie. Betty White looks great and plays a grandma with a special connection to Mother Earth. The scenery is breathtaking.<br /><br />Overall, though not perfect, this is a movie worth the few hours and the full-price movie ticket investment. A charming, fun, summer evening movie.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Absolute train wreck. Too long, too little plot, too much swearing,  noisy, painful to watch. One pointless explosion after another. I couldn't wait for it to end.    And to top it all off it's a movie about making a movie.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Spectacular! Best Sci-fi movie I've ever seen, and best action movie I've ever seen. The only other movie I've seen more than once at a theater was 1 Million B.C. with Raquel Welch back in 1966, and that was ONLY because of Raquel Welch. I've seen Star Trek four times already. Even the ending credits were great. I never thought I'd see anything supplant Braveheart as my all time favorite film. I'm not a Trekkie by a long shot but I loved this movie.

B000O599WG|5.0|John Wayne being John Wayne with Dean, Ricky and \\"Old Stumpy\\" Walter Brennan. A must for all real western fans.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|I will not be long winded on this review.  This package deal outstrips purchasing the movies separately.  The added material (video and physical) along with supreme quality renditions makes this a no-brainer.  You don't even have to ask yourself, \\"Do I feel lucky?\\"  You will not be disappointed.
B000O599ZS|5.0|John Wayne and John Ford at their greatest. Wayne should have won the Oscar for \\"Ethan\\" before he won as \\"Rooster\\".
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is a great story with a lot of themes.  It contains racism, bitterness, accountability, kindness, heroism, and redemption.  And that is just in the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood).<br /><br />Walt is a cantankerous Korean War vet who is a recent widower.  His next door neighbors are a Hmong extended family.  A teenage boy in the clan, Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured heavily to join a street gang to which his cousin belongs.  He is resistant, but eventually succumbs.  As an initiation rite he is required to steal Kowalski's prize possession, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino.<br /><br />In typical Eastwood fashion, he is a heroic tough guy even at 78 years old.  He stops Thao from stealing the car.  Eventually he takes the lad under his wing.  The story of inter-generational friendship between them is strong and very well done.<br /><br />This is really a great show.  The language and racial slurs are a bit rough so it is not a good one for younger viewers, but it is a very good one for the adults.
B001E18C68|5.0|I love the bonus concert best mainly because Restless and Jane Doe just amazing and also she looks so amazing in that chair and with that hair.
B0024F08RO|4.0|As with the previous seasons of 'Prison Break', this one is full of non-stop action.  No one will be bored viewing this.<br /><br />I think that it is probably a must see for anyone who has seen the first three years of the series.  Although the action is in a different setting, there is still plenty to keep viewers entertained.<br /><br />In this one, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and gang are hot on the heels of 'the company' and are trying desperately to destroy that evil group and reclaim their lives.  There are countless obstacles in their path.<br /><br />The twists and turns in this season are continuous.  Some of them are a bit goofy (particularly involving one family member of the two main characters).  I will refrain from saying any more about that to avoid spoiling it.  Suffice it to say, the writers strained their credibility at times.  Although some of these plot elements are silly, I still thoroughly enjoyed this season (the final one).  I am a bit disgusted at the portrayal of the UN as some great honorable organization.  That element went beyond silly directly to absurd.  Had that tripe not been included, I would have rated this with five stars.<br /><br />In spite of that, this is highly entertaining.  It is probably the second best television show that I have ever seen (after 24 of course).
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This is a great collection to have if you are a FRIENDS fan and who isn't?! It comes with a book that allows you to preview what episode you want to watch. And if you're in the middle of a season and don't know what ep[isode you're up to, you can figure it out by reading the synopsis in the book.
B0028N729O|4.0|I finished this book a couple of days ago, but I took some time after reading it to digest & think about it.  I liked this book a lot, although it wasn't a particularly pleasant or uplifting read.<br /><br />There are a couple of stereotypes that I loathe.  One is that the world would be a better place if women were in charge because we're all consensus driven peacemakers who would bake cookies together instead of starting wars.  The other is that all children are little containers of angelic innocence & light.  Right.  That girlfriend that stabbed you in the back in high school by setting you up for public humiliation wasn't really a woman & that kid from your kindergarten that held you down on the playground & ground dirt into your face wasn't really a kid.  You imagined all of that.<br /><br />I loathe those stereotypes because they're just another way for us to avoid actually thinking about real people & allowing for & adjusting for differences of all kinds.  They're a way of providing neat little boxes to stuff people into & to refer to when punishing those who refuse to conform.  Women & children are, of course, sometimes peacemakers & sometimes innocent little angels.  They are more frequently, however, many other things.  In its own way this book makes that point.<br /><br />It's not often that you read a thriller with villains who are female & complex - that one of the villains in this book is also 13 & pretty is a bonus.  Add to this myth explosion the obsessive compulsive cutter who is the narrator & this book offers many different views of what women & children - people, that is - can be like.<br /><br />Flynn is good at making the reader squirm & good at making you want to turn the pages.  I absolutely knew what had actually happened within the first third or so of this book, but continued reading feverishly to the inevitable & gut wrenching conclusion with the perverse delight of someone watching a train wreck.  You don't want to watch, but somehow you just can't look away until the images are seared into your brain.<br /><br />As a thriller this book definitely succeeds, but I think it should more aptly be categorized as horror - if only for the creeping sense of dread it instills in its reader.images are seared into your brain.

0307266303|5.0|This book is fun.  This book is fast.  This book most of all is important.  As a physical therapist I work daily with injury to all parts of the human frame.  I have been perscribing shoes and orthotics for years, it was how I was trained, Born to run, pulled the rug firmly and completly out.  Besides opening my eyes, Born is a fantastic story, with some crazy characters, you never want it to stop [...] for pictures, stories, results, and of course the rematch).  The writing style itself takes about 20 pages to get a handle on.  There is lots of motion from between time periods, history, and characters.  But keep reading, the book hits stide and then the learning begins.    spoiler: running doesn't have to hurt!
B001V9LRV0|3.0|Well the film Woodstock is there, the director's cut. I'd give it a five for historical value alone. And then there is a scad of extras, half of which are outtakes, half of which are documentaries. The problem with the documentaries and the Woodstock doc business in general is that largely they celebrate the event without a critical perspective. Of course these were made with the blessing of the original Woodstock folks Lang, Wadleigh, etc. so I'm not quibbling too much. Someday though someone should dissect this romantic counterculture and give it the decent burial it deserves, a noble experiment that failed. (See Altamont Rock Festival, see Isle of Wight) So I subtracted one star for cheesy documentaries.    But the real problem with the \\"Ultimate\\" 4 DVD edition is the packaging. Wow! I can't remember anything ever being designed this poorly. From the automatic scuffs on the discs before you ever get them out to the bad faux leather fringe that bends and twists obnoxiously to the various plastic molds and boxes you need to have to puff up and protect the thing to the ridiculous waste of plastic hologram to the commercial hippie art of the packages to the useless folder of scrawled notes found in the debris. Ugh! Hands down my vote for the worst packaging job for a DVD in the 21st Century. This clearly demonstrates the failure of the Woodstock dream.     But if you are teetering of the fence. It's worth getting only if you are a student of the times and need to understand the issues of the era by owning a DVD copy of the event.

1884822312|5.0|I very much consider myself a talented chess player trapped in a bad chess player's body.  Seriously I love the game but have found a lot of material either boring or downright boring.  However, I found this book to be useful, easy to use as well as engaging in its layout.  I practice a few pages a day and I have seen an improvement in my recognition of options during my games and improved thoughtful play.  I am still a chess hack but I am getting better.
0307266303|5.0|Born to Run tells a story about an Indian tribe in the Sierra Madre who race and beat the world's greatest ultramarathons (people who run 50+ mile races).    In the style of John Krakauer or Michael Lewis, the overarching story is used as a frame for meandering segues into other aspects of distance running. McDougall digresses into:   * The latest understandings about humankind's unique (in the animal kingdom) ability to run extremely long distances without faltering.   * Stories behind some of the most grueling distance races on the planet: from races through shoe melting heat to frostbite inducing cold.   * How woman seem to compete at the same level as men as the distances get longer.   * The science behind running shoes, and running without shoes.    Overall, a hugely entertaining read that I learned a lot from, and I can't stop telling other people about.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I was delighted when I heard about Star Trek being 'remastered' (I'm one of the few Star Wars fans who found the new effects added to those films to be well done).  Like Star Wars, I thought it could work if they stayed true to the original Star Trek shows as they were originally shot.  How glad I was to see that they did!<br /><br />The new effects work wonders - the best part for me is that the actions in outer space now match the dialogue spoken by the actors.  'The Doomsday Machine' (my all-time fave) is an example of this.  We SEE the ships doing what the characters describe, not just routine stock shots of the same old Enterprise flybys.  Even middle-of-the-road episodes such as 'Gallieo Seven' benefit from these enhancements (the burn-up sequence is stunning).  Little things abound, such as the Pod seen missing from the Enterprise's aft section as she comes into orbit in 'Court Martial' (also here we get to see the Intrepid parked in a lower orbit, again mirroring the base commander's dialogue).<br /><br />My only beef is the fact that while many infamous 'bloopers' are digitally fixed (adding phaser beams were none were before but SHOULD have been), major goofs are left unfixed.  These include a blank viewscreen seen behind the 'evil' Kirk and the captain's insignia missing from his uniform in early shots, both from 'The Enemy Within', Baylock's missing line from 'The Corbomite Maneuver' (surely a sound-alike could be found if not the original dialogue reel), and from 'Charlie X': Charlie's reflection in the medical monitor while he's supposed to be lying down, and the 'steel wall' cracking visably when Spock & Kirk are thrown against it by Charlie.  None of these (or other little things) makes viewing these remasters any less gratifying, but you'd think that if some things were going to be fixed, the rest should too.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these sets to any and all Star Trek fans.  Having seen these episodes over and over through the years, it's like going Where No Man Has Gone Before for the first time.Gone Before for the first time.

B000Q67876|5.0|Shawshank Redemption, the best movie I have seen and will always be. Words cannot describe what I have just seen because it is simply too powerful. The movie is about two men who met in prison. That is as far as I can say because I do not want to waste the elegance of this movie on a stupid summary for you, so see it for yourself. After some research, it's a wonder to why this movie had not won any awards and Forrest Gump was the one to win it all back in 1994, especially when Shawshank Redemption is by no contest and by far better in every aspect.<br /><br />I avoided this film all these years after numerously hearing it was good, simply because the title and front cover of the movie looked boring. Shawshank Redemption was opposite of that, I do not believe I will ever find another movie as beautiful as this, that is why I say it is the best movie that I have seen ever. I normally do not say something is the best ever because I will always experience new things and something will always surpass one thing. Impressed beyond my ability to describe the film, Shawshank Redemption is one thing that cannot be surpassed.<br /><br />The connection that I felt between the characters were strong and powerful. The one thing this movie shows and talk about is hope, it reminds me of a video I made for my multimedia class back in high school. The video's message was about hope and contains a poem about it.<br /><br />I have seen plenty of grade A movies, The Godfather, Goodfellas, American History X, Cidade De Deus, Pulp Fiction, etc. But nothing I have seen has come near to holding up it's beauty when in comparison with Shawshank Redemption. Maybe it's just me, maybe I have some personal attachment to the movie that others may not have. But it's hard to believe so because I know a good movie when I see a good movie.<br /><br />Once again, if you have not seen this, it is highly recommended and it is the number one movie that I recommend to watch before you die. The sooner you see it, the better. I've seen many people wrote Shawshank Redemption is highly overrated and is just another good movie. I can not find another way to disagree more, Shawshank Redemption is a superb movie that tells a unforgettable story of friendship, struggle, and hope. One of the few movies to cry to after seeing, it is too beautifully made and you know that no movie will ever be the same again.<br /><br />\\"Get busy living, or get busy dying\\".<br /><br />\\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies\\".people wrote Shawshank Redemption is highly overrated and is just another good movie.

0446615641|4.0|Truly enjoy the Camel Club group of eccentrics. This one was a little more shoot 'em up than the last couple but the dynamics of the group are fun. I would have liked a little more with the other members of The Camel Club beyond Oliver but still it was a great book that I read in a couple of sittings. I like Baldacci almost as well as Sanford - but not quite. It is definitely worth a read.
B001W63DX2|5.0|GREAT DVD FOR BOTH IRON MAIDEN FANS AND NON IRON MAIDEN FANS!!!!!!!!  You will not be disappointed!
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|Not bad, but not good either. Why? Because every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue is overdone by Art. It doesn't take long before you realize you're saying to yourself, well, look how the blood is artfully arranged...hey, one side is all wearing black, the other white...notice how all the actors are standing, carefully posed in the culvert...listen how cheerleaders are saying \\"push 'em back,\\" only you can't see them and the hero is being chased around by a madman with a knife...etc. All the cleverness absolutely overwhelms the film.    One other oddity I noticed: it's rated R, and yet I'm fairly sure I heard not a single obscenity, something that even some PG movies have. There was barely a hint of sex, and no exposed skin. As for violence, the hero gets punched a lot, and there's one--yes, arty--scene involving a gun. I guess that's what got it the R rating. Strange.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|It's sad to think that this is Eastwood's last appearance in a film.  I grew up watching him.  But, what a film to end on!  Hopefully, he may direct some more.     Walt is a 'call it like you see it' kind of guy with no diplomacy skills whatsoever ( or if he has them, he chooses not to exercise them )  I think the way he speaks in this movie is the way many people think, you just don't hear it.      [...]    He is more a grand dispenser, with no \\"politeness filter\\" of what he sees and how he tells it.   With all Hollywood puts out these days, a person who enjoys true quality has to keep their eyes open for the one of a few true gems that is put out each year.  This is one of those diamonds in the rough of 2008.    Becauase the movie doesn't glorify gays, weirdos, or dysfunctional killers, it didn't receive any oscar nominations.  Such is the world we live in........Whoa, maybe Walt had some influence on me and I'm starting to call it like I see it.
B001PR0Y5S|3.0|If you don't know how \\"The Proposal\\" will turn out before entering the theater, maybe you're better off because it means you haven't seen as many romantic comedies as I have. I, unfortunately, know the formula like the back of my hand. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie, of course, but it does make it a lot harder to get into. Imagine, if you will, two people at opposite ends of the personality spectrum; she's a pushy boss, and he's her lowly personal assistant. Now imagine that they find themselves in close contact for a couple of days, and during that time, they discover that they do, in fact, love each other. Honestly, it doesn't take a degree in cinema to figure this one out. Thankfully, \\"The Proposal\\" manages to be halfway decent in spite of its overused formula. I'm not quite recommending it, but still, there are worse films out there (\\"My Life in Ruins\\" very quickly comes to mind).    The pushy boss is Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), who works for a publishing house in New York City. Actually, she's more like the boss from hell, not so much because she's demanding but because she's incredibly mean-spirited, pointing out personal faults that have no business being pointed out. Her lowly personal assistant is Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), a driven young man with a manuscript he wants published. In the course of fifteen minutes, Margaret fires a prominent employee, bullies a reclusive author into appearing on \\"Oprah,\\" and orders Andrew to work over the weekend. It doesn't matter to her that he was supposed to go home to Alaska that same weekend for his grandmother's ninetieth birthday.    The crux of the story: Margaret, a Canadian immigrant, has just learned from her superiors that her visa has expired, which means she'll have to leave the company and be deported. Desperate to stay on top, she blackmails Andrew into pretending that he's her fiancé. He goes along with it, but only on the condition that he be promoted to an editorial position. Theythen have to convince an immigration agent (Denis O'Hare) that they're not committing fraud, so they say that they will be going to Alaska over the weekend and surprise Andrew's family with the good news (Margaret's family is conveniently not in the picture). At this point, they agree that it's strictly a business deal; they will get divorced as soon as they possibly can and move on with their lives.    In Alaska, Margaret is shocked to learn that Andrew is from a very affluent family. Here enters his accommodating mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his kooky but loveable grandmother, Annie (Betty White), and his disapproving father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who wanted him to stay in Alaska and take over the family business.    The ensuing scenes of Margaret and Andrew fooling everyone around them don't generate big laughs, although their sarcastic verbal jabs are effective. I also admit that they share more than a few smirk-inducing physical moments, such as when they bump into each other and fall over when they happen to be completely naked. There's also a point at which he's forced to get into bed with her because his mother is at the door and wants to serve them breakfast; as they frantically position themselves in a loving pose, Margaret is rudely reminded of what happens to a man's body when he wakes up in the morning. Some of the amusement is balanced with one or two touching moments, as when Margaret lies in bed and tells Andrew facts about herself. I won't rattle off a list, but I will say that she isn't as immune to character attacks as she makes herself out to be.    But for every decent scene, there are at least three others that aren't very good at all. There's a subplot, for example, involving a character named Ramone (Oscar Nuñez), who seems to do a little bit of everything in this small Alaska town. When he's not a caterer, he's a minister. And when he's not a minister, he's a shop owner. And when he's not a shop owner, he's a male stripper. We know he's a male stripper because Grace and Annie decide to take Margaret to one of his shows as a surprise. Is there any such thing as Amateur Night at a Chippendale club? There's also a painfully unfunny scene in which Margaret goes off into the woods and spots Annie performing a chanting ritual around a fire pit; Margaret, encouraged to chant along, performs a profanity-laced rap solo.    Tension mounts when, on a whim, Andrew's family decides that his wedding should take place during his visit, specifically on Annie's birthday. Can Andrew and Margaret go through with it knowing it's a sham? Will Margaret be able to reconcile her growing feelings for Andrew? Will Annie be able to alter her old wedding dress to accommodate Margaret's less-than-ample [...]? As I already said, I knew the answers to these questions before entering the theater, and I'm sure most audiences are in the exact same situation. I shouldn't criticize a film for achieving exactly what it wanted to achieve, but really, this romantic comedy formula is getting very old. No, \\"The Proposal\\" isn't an all-out bad film, but it is grossly unoriginal, and it's filled with jokes that are amusing but hardly hilarious.

B00005Y6YB|1.0|I can not even bring myself to finish watching this movie.  When I first started watching it I was somewhat interested since I had heard all of the hype.  After watching 20 mins I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.  I could not believe that anyone could think this was worth watching.  Then I thought I might be missing something or not understanding some type of weird humor.  I have heard people rant about not being able to wait until the series came to DVD.  While watching the 20 mins it felt like some sort of joke that I didn't get.  Now after trying to give it a second and third chance and watching different parts of the movie and hoping it would get better I now am done.  This is one of, if not the worst, movies I have ever seen and I can not believe someone was able to talk these well known actors into acting in this movie.
0439023483|5.0|When I read a book I want to escape. The book has to be compelling enough to take me to another realm and return me feeling as though I have been on a vacation. This is one such book. I am dying for the second installment. Set in a modern day tech society there are 12 districts suffering under the weight of the \\"Capitol\\". The government is quick to take out anyone or district who stands against them. They do not like to be mocked. Hence the demise of the once district 13. As a reminder of who holds the power the capitol instituted an annual game of sport between the competing districts ending with one victor out of 24. Katniss, the leading lady, has been training for this her whole life without ever realizing the days out in the wild hunting would one day save her life. Great book.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|It is a great movie, and it also has some deep meanings, if you listen carefully to the dialogs.
1905492073|5.0|Mark Powell's book is one of those rare books which takes complicated concepts and renders them into simple and readily understandable terms.  The author is not a scientist, but a technical diving instructor whose interest goes beyond the superficial.  In this excellent text he bridges the gap between short and simplistic diving textbooks and obtuse and arcane research papers.  The result is short, readable and interesting, particularly for technical and serious recreational divers.  A superb addition to any divers library.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Pixar makes adult movies that are family friendly. It is a grand tradition that Disney has had a grip on since the days of [[ASIN:B000AJJNIG Old Yeller]] or [[ASIN:B0002YLCOM Bambi]]. That tradition continues with \\"Up,\\" a film that is one part melodrama, one part adventure film and just a smidgen of buddy-movie. It is also 100% Pixar.<br /><br />Ed Asner gives voice to Carl Fredricksen, an adventure obsessed man who, along with his beloved wife, Ellie, were fans of explorer Carl Muntz. But Muntz vanished in disgrace when he is accused of falsifying the discovery or a new species in the mysterious Paradise Falls. That doesn't matter to the young Carl and Ellie, who make a vow to get to Paradise Falls one day. In the film's most poignant segment and its main opener, Carl and Ellie marry and you watch their life together unfold. This, again, is why Pixar excels at movie making. Their life is wonderful and filled with love, at the same time, it is heartbreaking. You watch as grow old together, dreaming of their adventure together and working at the zoo that serves as a surrogate. And when Ellie begins to falter before Carl can make her dream come true, there wasn't a dry eye over 30 in the audience.<br /><br />Carl, now a widowed septuagenarian, soon finds himself in a world he no longer understands, and decides to make one more desperate attempt at making it to Paradise Falls. Stowaway Russell and Carl are soon floating on a house heading for South America. But Carl Muntz, still bitter and a bit mad from decades searching for his lost bird, is there and doesn't want anyone stopping him from taking his discovery away. Carl, Russell, Dug the talking dog must save \\"Kevin\\" and get Carl's home to its final destination before Muntz destroys everything.<br /><br />It's a fun movie and more than a little dangerous (if [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]] was too much for you, then stay home from this), as Pixar depicts Carl and Russell evolving from a \\"get off my lawn\\" curmudgeon and somewhat naive and gawky kid into friends. Dug the Dog and the rest of the talking animals are the comic relief (\\"the cone of shame\\" alone was worth the price of admission). And when the line \\"Now go have one of your own\\" appears, if you don't get a lump in your throat, then I don't know why you're reading this review in the first place.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is sentimental and wildly imaginative. Movies that touches on love, life, loss and adventure are hard to come by, and once again, Pixar captures it eloquently.  \\"Up\\" will rank among the list of Pixar classics like [[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E]] and the original [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story]] as movies that are fun for entire families; intelligent, funny and adventurous.d gawky kid into friends.

B0000X81ZI|1.0|Absolutely no reason to watch this movie. Watched for 30 minutes, and found it to be torture, with the worst bathroom humor and violence done in bad taste one could imagine. The guy who directed this film should be a bum on the streets, why make an atrocity like this? If I could have given it 0 stars I would, a complete waste of time and a real downer.

1416914307|4.0|Clary must travel to the City of Glass to find the one person who can revive her mother. And unbeknownst to Clary, the Shadowhunters have captured her best friend and imprisoned him. Meanwhile, her evil, father Valentine has plans to invade the City of Glass, overthrow the Shadowhunters, and destroy all of the Downworlders. With spies in their midst, Clary and her friends face horrible heartache, impending war, and an uncertain future.<br /><br />Clare has developed the characters so much throughout the trilogy, and I've grown to enjoy each one immensely. The story is extremely complex, and best if the novels are read somewhat close together so information is fresh in the mind. Even the character of Valentine is wrought with complexity, as his children both love and hate him.<br /><br />The author has definitely created a fantastic world of demon-hunting Shadowhunters with intriguing abilities, using runes; along with vampires, werewolves, faeries, and mages. These creatures can live in two worlds but mundanes (as average humans are called) can't see past the veil of magic.<br /><br />Written for young teens, the dialog can seem overly dramatic at times and several plot elements extremely predictable to adult readers. But, for me, this did not detract from the overall suspense and excitement of the story. In fact, there was so much going on, I wondered how Clare would be able to wrap everything up by the end of the book. It has plenty of romance, action, mystery, and magic. It's both gripping and fun. I would highly recommend this trilogy to young urban fantasy readers.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|wow , this a very good show , don't be suprise it will happen in the future.
0439023483|4.0|This book has a futuristic setting, and it really makes you wonder about what the future really will hold for us as a species. There is violence, sure, but it is a very good scientific novel that can easily be enjoyed. I look forward to the next book in the series. The Hunger Games is a very well written book that, makes you think, and keeps you reading for as long as it takes until it is done. It is a pretty quick read, that continues to make you think even when it is over.
B000683VI4|5.0|Wonderful romantic movie about two people, Noah and Allie, and their lives.  The movie is told with an older set of the charactors, played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, who are wonderful in the roles.  She is often disoriented and confused and he takes care of her and reads to her.    We are then introduced to their earlier lives and how they met and struck up their relationship and see how their love developed through the years.    It may be a bit sappy at points, but not overly so, and overall the story is well told with warthm and also some heartbreak along the way.  Even my husband, who does not particularly care for these kind of movies, found it very enjoyable, and he even became a bit choked up at points.
1416914307|5.0|This is my favorite book!! I love it, it is amazingly written, and it totally keeps you reading late into the night. The plot is wonderful and the twists are \\"Wow\\". I think more people should read this series, it is AMAZING!!! It is creepy and fun, the balance is superb. Romance and a taste of horror!! I think im in love with this book. The ending is good, and the series is also. Cassandra Clare is wonderful, and I really hope she continues writting. I would deffinately recomend this book series to teens and above.
0143038419|1.0|I got this book as a birthday present.   I struggled so much to finish this book in which I found only a couple of interesting sentences... one was something like \\"better to live your own destiny imperfectly than living the imitation of somebody else's life\\".   I think the author actually belong to the latter.   Her decision to get divorced/not wanting a child should be respected and that is fine and brave but what she gets fulfilled with instead is such a shallow act of wanna-bes after all. It seems to me that she is a typical spoilt naive American woman. (sorry no offense for American women though...) I myself love traveling and I do live outside my own country even now and I have been through lots of ups and downs in my life. And for people like me there was nothing I can learn or be touched in this book.   She is so much self-oriented and self-indulged which rather disgusted me by the time I reached the end.   A good example is: what about this medicine man??? She arrives in Bali for him, but once she has this attractive man she stops visiting him... Any respect for this elderly person? Probably this Sharon person he mentions was the same as the author - comes from a foreign land, befriends with him, and leaves him as soon as she finds something more interesting.   This is not a magazine article and it should have had more depth in it.

B001SMC91M|5.0|There have been a number of performers who have been resurrecting the sound of 60's soul and R&B. From Amy Winehouse, Sharon Jones and James Hunter (a few of the well-known ones) to Orgone, The Bamboos and the Quantic Soul Orchestra (a couple of the lesser known ones), the sound of that golden age of music is coming back. And coming back strong. And I love it!    There are a lot of great comparisons for Black Joe Lewis, but the one that I can't seem to escape is that this reminds me so much of Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders. The bombastic approach to the music, the horns, the energy, the I-dare-you-not-to-get-up-and-dance attitude that courses through every track on this album and the soul swagger that permeates every note.     This is the real deal. In an age of samples, over-done riffing, manufactured music and pre-packaged hits, Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears is a HUGE breath of fresh air. Whether you're into old school Soul/R&B or just discovering how good it can be, this is an album that can't be over-recommended.     Buy it. Buy it now.

B001UW58YU|5.0|I no longer buy DVDs, after experiencing the clarity and quality of blu-ray.  Thus when I heard that Josh Groban's AWAKE was released as a blu-ray, I did not think twice about springing for it.    Sure, there is premium pricing but that is the price that one pays, when one wants to take advantage of using the product right away.    One thing I need to point out is that the video footage is a bit grainy at times and this is probably par for the course, in such live events, where you cannot bathe the entire stage in light, to avoid the graininess.  The uncompressed Audio via Blu-ray is great, even though I wish they would have taken advantage of the gobs of space available in blu-ray, to add more content to the disc.    Bottomline, I really enjoyed the product and would buy it again, for the price.

B00260HH3K|5.0|My review will be very short.    This is a dragonball movie NOT dragonball Z. except Goku and Yamcha; the characters are exactly like they were in dragonball. Now, all I've seen in db was about half the show. Chichi was a nice girl in dragonball; she did NOT become the loud mouth (from what I saw) `till dragonball Z. now, Yamcha was the same, they just intensified his personality.    They kept piccolo's story the same. Goku, they also kept. EXCEPT, they did make it out to be that he was from namek. But a sequel could very easily fix that.    Now, I'm going to leave this with a few questions I asked myself going into the theater: Why would they make a movie based solely on the show? Why would you pay money to see a movie you've seen 100 times over? And why would you deal with the crowds of a movie theater for a movie you already know?    And I was very surprised: they changed Goku's style and made it more modern day. But, that was all they changed.    Thank you for reading
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is a magical book with intense characters and an engaging plot line.  The translation is super - although the book is so wonderful that I wished I spoke spanish in order to get every possible nuance intended by the author in his native language.  The story is a tantalizing treat for all the senses leaving me weeping at the end wishing there was more!  Highly recommended!
143915726X|3.0|I picked up this book knowing that it would be emotionally moving, however like most books and movies created these days I expected there to be a semblance of a happy ending, even though it didn't seem like that would be possible. Throughout the tragic story (which often leaves you squirming in your chair due to the graphic descriptions of the cancer treatments and their respective administration), you really don't believe that there can be a happy ending and yet you still hope that maybe there will be some crazy twist that makes it all okay and may give you hope.     Well, there is a crazy twist but it is absolutely not what you would expect and it absolutely does not leave you feeling hopeful or uplifted. It leaves you shaking so hard through your tears you can hardly catch your breath.     This story is very interesting as far as perspective on a story that's been done over and over again. It really makes the reader think when it's given from a sister's standpoint rather than the patient or the mother of the patient, although their insights are interspersed as well. It really does make you look long and hard at a tough situation but then you're left depressed because there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Don't say you weren't warned.

Late 1960's with Linda Ronstead? 70's and 80's with Eva Cassidy?<br />Yes, we had voices from groups that shook us loose like Nancy Wilson with Heart and even the Abba chicks and Roxette's Marie.  But where is the one woman who stood out alone with a voice so memorable you can't get her tunes out of your head?<br />Here we go.......... this chick, Brandi Carlile, started out as a little girl calling pigs...... Who Cares?  Whatever happened with her voice was pure magic.  Where the songwriting skill came from, I dunno?  She penned lyrics that stick in your mind with melodies that are forever.  Some lyrics are weak, as in, The Story \\"they don't know my hair's a mess\\".  So, again, Who Cares?  We still love the song.<br />Other greats on this CD are Cannonball and Until I Die and, in fact, every damn song on the CD is great listening.  One of the best performances in years..........

Sharp Objects was great, Dark Places was even better . . . I can't wait to see how great her third book will be.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Paramount does a real good job remastering their movies.  This re-release of the class first 5 movies on Bluray is fantastic.  On Bluray you will see new detail you didnt see with basic DVD discs.  The extras is normal nothing spectacular but you shouldnt buy the discs for the extra stuff anyway for me its all about the movie.  Ok the first and third movie are pure garbage I mean we all could have written better movies than the writters for those two movies but the rest is worth the package.
1416550542|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is a long, sprawling mystery that spans over 100 years, loaded with Gothic undertones. We have a spooky old Victorian mansion, an overgrown maze, a derelict cottage on a cliff, a forgotten garden, wealth, poverty, love, betrayal, good and evil all wrapped around an abandoned child.<br /><br />Told through the perspectives of three women, Nell who is found when she is four years old, abandoned on a dock in Australia, with very sparse clues to her identity; Eliza who is the mysterious Authoress whom Nell vaguely remembers and whose book of fairy Tales is in Nell's tiny suitcase and Cassandra, Nell's granddaughter, who tries to put together all the pieces of the puzzle after her grandmother's death.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story, I enjoy multi-generational family sagas and I found this one to be absorbing and well written and I liked the mystery and all the introduction of little clues. The changes in the perspectives could get a little confusing at times, and it would be hard to leave one story that was really getting interesting, to be taken back to another time and place but after a while I got accustomed to that. The best part of the book were the fairy tales written by The Authoress, lovely but spooky stories that all have clues to the mystery of Nell's identity.  I also enjoyed Ms. Morton's inclusion of Frances Hodgson Burnett as a minor character, an obvious tip of the hat to the author of The Secret Garden, which clearly inspired portions of this book.<br /><br />I didn't care for the male characters in the book, they all seemed ephemeral and weak, but I've read many a book where the women were relegated to the background, so it didn't really spoil my enjoyment of this book.  Overall a very good read.
0762434279|1.0|This Stinks!  Rich Dad Poor Dad is one of the best books ever written, but I just got ripped off by Amazon touting the \\"mini\\" Abridged edition in the first slot.  It's so small you can't hardly hold it, much less underline or highlight in it.  I am really disappointed in this purchase, but there is no sense returning it, because that's just throwing good money after bad because it was so cheap.  I have a college degree, but I guess I just learned what \\"Abridged\\" means.  Amazon you need to advertise what you're selling a little better.

0060558121|5.0|To go to \\"American Gods\\" after first reading \\"Neverwhere\\" seems to be a lot to ask of a new-found fan of Neil Gaiman, but Gaiman winds up getting your imagination wrapped up in the story all the same. It's like going from a cartoon to an Eastwood movie in one day.<br /> Gaiman has his way of slowly establishing the mood and the plot, and establishing main characters that seem to get moved around by their circumstances. \\"American Gods\\" starts out with a big guy named Shadow in prison, but it's his last day: he's being released in the first chapter, but that's not a totally happy story, at all, for him...<br /> Gaiman's technique is to introduce the main character to some otherworldly character who will take (or in Shadow's case, send) him to a different world where he'll encounter new, strange things... It's interesting how the reader is somewhat made to encounter, to a degree, Shadow's uncertainty between the real world and the world that he encounters in his dreams (it's not really a world of fantasy and wonderment, so it doesn't really strike the reader as a \\"dream world\\").<br />As the story progresses, the reader may not realize that 3 quarters of the book is a \\"build-up\\" in 2 directions and by the time you realize where the build-up is taking you and Shadow, you're thoroughly in awe of the circumstances! So, with \\"American Gods\\", Gaiman puts your imagination on a slow boil (unlike the strong boil to the imagination that is his book, \\"Neverwhere\\"). But, make no mistake; \\"American Gods\\" is not boring at all. The characters that Shadow meets along the way are very intriguing, The first being his \\"boss\\", Wednesday, of whom you aren't sure whether he's the bad guy or the good guy, which kind of makes you wonder, \\"so what does that make (or rather, what is that making) Shadow, a bad guy\\"? That's what makes \\"American Gods\\" so intriguing; you're not sure of what's happening to the main character's development and neither is Shadow, himself, sure.<br />As you read Gaiman's books, you find that the main character, at some point deep in the story, must go through a major rite of passage [or in Shadow's case, purgatory (a purging)], that death doesn't necessarily mean \\"dead and gone\\" and that YOU WILL get a full-length, real-life history lesson late in the story; perhaps this is Gaiman's means of  re-establishing the balance of FACT and REALITY to all the IMAGINATION and FANTASY that he has stirred up in the readers' minds; my favorite `lesson' of his is in \\"American Gods\\"; he really lets you know a lot about Lookout Mountain, and that's where the climax plays out (one of them, at least); I even researched Lookout Mountain on YouTube).<br /><br />Another intriguing aspect of \\"American Gods\\" is the presence of mini-stories (or bonus short stories) that Gaiman has included at the end of certain chapters; and there are many of them in \\"American Gods\\"; the first one at the end of chapter one is a jaw-dropping, eyebrow-raising twist from left field that the reader just won't see coming, making one wonder, \\"Uhmm, ok...\\"? My favorite was one that dealt with what Africans were put through in slavery in America; it's a poignant tear jerker. The premise of all the \\"shorts\\" (although, some not so short) is that there are \\"gods\\" lurking amongst us normal folk, always have been, always will be.<br /><br /> On Youtube there is a vid of Gaiman talking about \\"Anansi Boys\\", in which he mentions how he intended for that to be light hearted and funny (and funny it is!!) and he wanted to get away from all the seriousness that he conjured up in \\"American Gods\\", even if it didn't get him all the awards that \\"American Gods\\" brought him. \\"American Gods\\" is a very intense, macabre read and the ending is worth every word read up to that point! For a contrast on his endings, read my review on Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\".<br />Gaiman is truly a MASTER STORYTELLER!nd that the main character, at some point deep in the story, must go through a major rite of passage [or in Shadow's case, purgatory (a purging)], that death doesn't necessarily mean \\"dead and gone\\" and that YOU WILL get a full-length, real-life history lesson late in the story; perhaps this is Gaiman's means of  re-establishing the balance of FACT and REALITY to all the IMAGINATION and FANTASY that he has stirred up in the readers' minds; my favorite `lesson' of his is in \\"American Gods\\"; he really lets you know a lot about Lookout Mountain, and that's where the climax plays out (one of them, at least); I even researched Lookout Mountain on YouTube).

B000BBOUU4|3.0|Remakes rarley are as good to me as the original, but this one is good and I didn't find myself comparing them too much.  And this one is actually a lot closer to the story that is in the book.  I recomment both book and this movie.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie, and I agree with the reviewer that stated this was Eastwood at his best.  It is a movie that combines humor and seriousness in wonderful mixture, examining the realities of prejudice, but ultimately showing how those realities can be altered and overcome.  Eastwood is at his gruff best, while at the same time ultimately showing his humanity and selflessness.  My daughters and I thought this movie was simply great!
B001V9LRTM|1.0|Could you imagine if the people at the Louvre said, \\"technology allows us to have more colors today than were available 400 years ago\\" and then added color to the Mona Lisa?  What a travesty.  This is an example of a washed up ego-driven sound engineer that has run amok.  It would be one thing if they added the music from a mic recording that was lost (such as Newport 56) but this is unnecessary and an abomination.  It's one thing to do re-mixes/edits before the original release (ie. the Last Waltz) but to do it 40 years after is idiotic.  All that said, it is worth buying for the improved picture.

0345472322|5.0|I first became acquainted with Dweck's work as a graduate student and have incorporated her theoretical approach in my own research. I am so glad that her students encouraged her to share her work via this book. Dweck includes real world examples of how an individual's self-perceptions and behavioral habits influence responses in positive and negative ways. She then uses these examples to suggest ways that readers can modify behavior through awareness of how individual responses can inhibit or enhance personal growth and interactions with others.    Last semester I included this book in my senior seminar. The students' responses were overwhelmingly positive. A majority of the class reported that it was one of the most motivating books they had read and that they had incorporated what they had learned into their daily lives.     Probably one of the most surprising reactions was from my husband who shuns self-help books and topics with a psychological theme. He has enthusiastically recommended Mindset to our adult children and several colleagues!
044024367X|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was typical Jack Reacher. I see the disappointed reviews, but have these people read the whole series? Jack Reach just walks from one place to another. I thought it was great a town said he couldn't walk through it....like Reacher will except this! I just loved that it was such a genuine portrayal of a character I have come to count on.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is my favorite series on HBO (which means alot, because I have watched over 15 of their original series, and loved all of them). It is based on The Sookie Stackhouse Series by Charlaine Harris. Anna Paquin delivers a great performance as a sweet southern girl courted by a southern gentleman \\"vampire\\".  The story begins about the time vampires have \\"outed\\" or \\"come out of the closet\\" to the human world and are trying to co-exit (or it's a great front) with them.  They now can survive on a sythetic blood called true blood hence the title.  There is a little bit of everything in this series, love, romance, blood, horror I'm sure everyone can find something they like........I, myself, find Eric the Vampire VERY interesting....................
B0000648WZ|5.0|This film may be hokey, but it's still a good movie. One of the last films Paul Verhoeven has done in America, was a good one to be remembered by. He uses a great use of Sci-Fi and propaganda that he was subjected to in his native Holland during WWII, and of course, his good use of gratuitous graphic violence is always a plus. This film also broke ground in the progress of CGI, considering that they had less then half of the overrated Titanic did at only $90 million, it did a great job.     Of course the acting feels labored at times, or all the time, and the cast seems like they just came off the set of Beverly Hills 90210, but that's what was intended. It was supposed to be these hot young newcomers, being sent off into a war and environment that they underestimated. \\"Everything is all fun and games until reality comes into play\\"    And if you look past the propaganda, and themes of Socialism and the satire of it all, it is still the one of the best Sci-Fi B-Movie made.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|This movies is the biggest waste of time that I have ever seen.  I debated paying someone to take this movie after I was done watching it instead I just threw it in the trash.  For one thing, half of the stupid movie is done in flasback black and white.  Plus, it is so easy for people to get lost in this movie.  Of the two people watching it with me, I was the only one who could keep up with the storyline.  This movie had elements that really just ticked me off.  First of all if you are pentecostal, it makes us look like nuts who shove people over and thank God for a miracle that really did not happen.  It uses curse words for emphasis in places where emphasis is not needed.  Then within the last thirty minutes of the movie, it feels that it can redeem itself by throwing in partial sex scene after partial sex scene.  It also throws in some lesbian comments that were just so out of place.  I honesly believe that they should use this movie for torture at Guantonomo Bay.  If you can watch this movie and not crack, then you are extremely tough.  What a waste of time.  And like another review said, it tries to mix so many movies.  I see elements of the Titanic, Forrest Gump, Terminator, etc.  This movie is so ridiculous.

It offers the Walt Stanchfield lectures for the first time in a two-volume gathering of legendary lectures from the long-time Disney animator. For over twenty years Walt Stanchfield lead Disney and influenced rising young illustrators: his writings for animation artists and film pros alike offer valuable insights for any students new to animation and is a 'must' for both film and art libraries. Volume 1 and V. 2 each pack in legendary lectures not to be missed by any serious art library.
0061438294|5.0|I bought this book with the intention of increasing my advantage in social situations, and it did that in spades. It very clearly separates the pop-psychology that has become popular through certain TV shows and other media, and instead focuses on the scientific reasoning behind many of our subconcious actions while being extremely easy to read and understand. Although it relates heavily to business interactions, the techniques in the book can easily be translated to any social interaction. Recommended for anyone who wants to understand the world around them better, wants to get ahead in social situations, wants to learn about themselves, or any of the above

0140277447|3.0|This history shed new light for me on a sad story of brutality on which I was under-informed.  I will let others debate the controversies; I found myself persuaded by the author.   I have a few small criticisms to this otherwise fine study.  First, I prefer my history more dispassionate; the author is emotionally involved in her study, though not in a way which was fatal to her thesis.  Second, the book has the flavor of an excellent undergraduate senior thesis which has been expanded into a book.  It lacks the scholarly gravitas of an experienced historian, e.g. James McPherson, who does a better job framing his subjects within larger historical currents.  But asking the author to work at McPherson's level is a tall order.  For the early work of a young author for a general audience, it is unusually good.  For the interested general reader, Chang's book can be read quickly and should be.
0452289963|5.0|An amazing book! So grateful for the recommendation I got to read it. It has already changed my life.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|First I'll comment on is the visual quality.  WIth HD, the CGI looks better than ever, especially many of the landscape, the ruins, the details of the model and texture.  If you're into 3d art you will appreciate the amount of the detail it delivers.  One thing I have is that now the image is so sharp, it somehow makes the model looks less realistic.  Also the camera treatment in my opinion can be improve, (like how Pixar did with Wall-E, which makes the film looks more believable.)      The extended scenes are nice, in my opinion gave some more depth of the characters (only a bit more though)  I don't want to be a spoiler, so I'll just say that some of the added scenes are rather frightening to see, I was a bit shocked the first time I saw it, but this version is unrated, so keep in mind for that, as far as I consider this version is NOT for kid, don't watch it with your kid!      The story I'll say is much better than Spirit Within, but only fans will understand and appreciate it.  For people who never played or know the story of FFVII, they are just watching a nice CGI movie presentation and that's it.       Over all a nice CG film and I'll say as a FFVII fan I enjoyed it.  It doesn't touch me emotionally, but at least visually.

As for the actual music, they have better things than the ultimate sap song \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\", which is apparently about some fat kids girlfriend becoming an hero. Oh and they never got any MTV airplay.

B00288KNLS|4.0|I'm not ashamed to admit I loved this flick and I'll be the first one to pick it up on DVD. This movie deviates from my normal taste in movies like Highlander and the Transporter. I am 19 years old and saw this with my 46 year old father when it came out and we loved it. I thought this movie was a little to intense for a children's movie as it will probably scare the crap out of it's directed audience. The core message is to appreciate what you have(the good and the bad). I loved the fact that it was done in stop motion and not CG I recommend this not as a kids movie, but as an adventure/horror movie.
6305128952|5.0|I had the pleasure of viewing this movie projected on the big screen when it was first released, however, I was disappointed in the ending which diverges from the 1995 book by Nicholas Evans.  It has taken me a while to understand why director/star Robert Redford ended on a moral high note.  I believe he was trying to convey lessons he had learned from mistakes he made in his personal life.<br /><br />Panned for its length, happily the leisurely pace of The Horse Whisperer is today a visual valentine to the breadth of our great country, from snowy New England meadows to majestic thunderstorms in Western mountain ranges.  The movie has aged like a fine wine and I have to periodically uncant it to savor Redford's grace notes - the way Tom Booker (Redford) secures a missed button on Annie's (Kirstin Scott Thomas) dress; the various stations coming over the car radio during the journey west; the look on Grace's (Scarlett Johansson) face when she realizes she can drive; that one slow waltz between Annie and Tom which conveys more raw emotion than most torrid sex scenes.<br /><br />What's not to like here?  No director has managed to elict a finer performance from Johansson; Kirstin Scott Thomas is at the peak of her beauty; Chris Cooper, Diane Weist and Sam Neill are all pitch perfect, heck even the little Booker boys are great.  Although the plot centers around a kind, wise and patient animal trainer who nurses a girl and her stallion back to health, the healer is only human and I believe he fell for Annie from the first time he laid eyes on her which adds the poignancy of this memorable movie.  Beware, the Horse Whisperer can make a girl yearn to live in Montana, and just remember, Tom Booker isn't there!

031606792X|1.0|I really enjoyed the first three books even though they had lots of problems. This book, however, is beyond bad. The good ending was so pathetic and easy that I really had no desire to finish the novel. I only continued because I hoped that Stephanie Meyer would somehow redeem herself and deliver great action or some twist in the story that finally made it interesting. But she didn't. At the end, I felt no interest in Edward, no happiness for Bella, no love for Jake. All I could think about was Renesmee (which by the way is the stupidest name ever made) and I quickly realized how sad that was considering this story used to be a romance. I personally loved Jacob's character and I was BEYOND annoyed by his imprint on Renesmee. I agree with others, it would have been better if he had died. I expected a little better from Stephanie Meyer.

B00008NRL8|5.0|This CD presents a different kind of genre that inmerses you into the old times at Buenos Aires, Argentina with the traditional tango while at the same time gives you a taste of some new smooth electronic kind of music.  love it!!! Cannot stop listening to it.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|This is, while a technically brilliant piece of filmmaking that fully exploits all the wizardry of CGI and makeup of which the filmmaker's art is now capable, strangely hollow at the center.  One begins the movie expecting some profound truths about human existence to be explored, but it ends not with a big life-affirming bang, but more of a whimper, quite literally.  Benjamin says though his diary at one point: \\"Life is defined by opportunities--even the ones we miss.\\"  And that could be a sum-up of this film project as a whole, as well as the life of the bizarre hero at its center.  One gets the sense of promise grasped for here but not quite realized as the technical and stylistic gymnastics of this movie overwhelm the fragile love story that should be its beating heart.    The film opens with Mr. Gateau (Cake) constructing a magical clock that runs backwards and mounting it in a train station in New Orleans in honor of his son, dead in the Great War.  No mention is made again of Mr. Gateau or whether his clock was successful in rewinding time to bring dead boys back to life.  It does have a curious effect on the life of one boy, though, as Benjamin enters the world essentially running backwards.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's quizzical that the clock has this metaphysical effect on only Benjamin among all the other children born afterwards, but then, fantasy is not required to operate by the rules of logic. Perhaps Benjamin, with a Gullah mother was particularly susceptible to magic, and how serendipitous that old-man baby Benjamin's grieving father abandoned him, along with $18 on the steps of an old-folks home, rather than say, a brothel . . .this being New Orleans, after all.  What are the chances, outside the realm of fantastical fiction, furthermore that Benjamin's progenitor be named Mr. Button, and that he own a button factory?  Otherwise we wouldn't have such nifty alliteration.    Countless comparisons have been made to \\"Forrest Gump\\", withwhich this narrative does share structural similarities.  However, that didn't occur to me while I was watching and found instead resonance with one of Pitt's earlier characters, Tristan Ludlow from \\"Legends of the Fall\\"--like Benjamin, Tristan is a soul set apart, blessed or cursed with mystical powers he does not fully understand; uncomfortable among other people and destined to lose the true love of his life due to his own inability to live a normal life.  Scenes of Benjamin travelling to foreign shores and sailing a boat underscored this impression.  (The presence of Julia Ormond, here playing the adult daughter of the aged Daisy was just a bonus, since she and Pitt have no scenes together.)  The setting of New Orleans during Benjamin's childhood in the early decades of the last century also reminded me of Louis Malle's \\"Pretty Baby\\".    This film is technically dazzling, but I think it was justly deprived of the top acting awards.  With so much else to be distracted by, the acting had a job of it to even be noticed, really.  Cate Blanchett is luminous, as usual.  I had my doubts a 38-year-old mother of three could pull off a 23-year-old ballerina, but La Blanchett can do anything.  The greatest curiosity I had, to be honest, was in how they were going to make Brad Pitt look 18 again.  Brad has taken pretty good care of his body over the years, but the strain of being father to the United Tribe of Benetton is starting to show . . .at least when he's not on a movie set.  When he's lit and coiffed for a film, he does not look anything like a 46-year-old father of six.  He can easily pass for a decade younger . . .but I thought 18 would be pushing it.  Well . . . did I say that the makeup department is amazing??  Looking at the scene of an 18-year-old Benjamin coming to visit the now-58-year-old Daisy--wow.  It was like having a flashback to Mr. Pitt's debut in \\"Thelma & Louise\\", and it was a very unsettling feeling.  \\"Unsettling\\" is the best descriptor for this movie.  Parts of it were stunning to look at, but its tragic meditations on the ultimate inablity of love to bring any meaning to human life leaves you wrung out and uncertain whether you are better off having seen it than you were before.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is one movie I had less expectation and was turned quite the opposite. At the beginning I almost turned it off looking at a situation that the father was in, but I'm glad I didn't.    I was never let down, & from scene to scene it just kept pushing and moving on. The action was great & I just like where the movie went as did almost every person I know.    I won't speak about plots so as not to ruin anything if you haven't seen this yet. Just know there's few movies I say great things of, but this is a good one. If you haven't, just go see it.
B001TODCII|5.0|Taken is simply an awesome movie. Simple plot, great action scenes, the good guys are good guys, the bad guys are bad guys, and the movie doesn't get into any moral relativism junk. At no point does the hero do any navel-gazing, pondering whether or not he should kill the bad guys. Of course he should.<br /><br />Plus, this movie has one of my favorite scenes when the hero is talking to his French police friend and his wife.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD, especially for fans of Winwood and/or Clapton and Blind Faith/Traffic that have never seen them. The DVD is great and the musicianship of both Clapton and Winwood and the others is absolutely superb and inspiring. The iconic \\"Well, Alright\\" is a major highlight of this DVD, as it evokes Blind Faith's traditional fare. Also, see if you can locate the Winwood album with Sea of Joy and Empty Pages. It has to be around somewhere and is a great album. Winwood and Clapton are incredibly good--and apparently getting better-- forty years later. To complement this DVD, I highly recommend either purchasing or borrowing [[ASIN:B000FC2EXY Blind Faith - London Hyde Park 1969]]  to witness the young, highly gifted musicians Winwood, Clapton, Ric Grech, and Ginger Baker, the Blind Faith \\"supergroup\\" which is an amazing and technically perfect DVD and mellow concert with no hype only great music and vibes from the era.

0007270968|5.0|If you ever have seen Gordan Ramsey on TV you know what he is about, rough, gruff, mean and likes to curse.<br /><br />If you watch Kitchen Nightmares, he really seems like, well a bad guy.  But it also comes across that he really does care about the people he is trying to help, and it becomes more clear as each episode goes on.<br /><br />This book ties it all together in an honest book that goes through his life and the challenges he has faced getting where he is now.  In almost classic fashion he made it past a harsh childhood and family problems to become who he is, and explains the fact that underneath the gruff and rough persona that is alot of what you see on television, when it comes down to it he really does care.

B0029VT3UQ|4.0|The plot of this movie was not at all what I thought it would be.  I was not disappointed, though.  I thought it would be a typical boy meets girl (or woman) romance and the struggles they face because of their age difference.  It ended up being a boy meets woman.  Woman wants a sex buddy.  Boy wants to learn to be a sex buddy.  After some empty sex, they start to get to know each other.  Boy falls in love.  Woman keeps him at a distance.  Woman's illiteracy and low class cause her so much shame she lets it steer her in a destructive and isolating direction.  Boy becomes a man and ends up accidentally witnessing her destruction.  Boy-man uses woman's destruction to learn not to self-destruct himself.      Even more unexpected is the nudity!  I didn't think someone of Kate Winslet's caliber would ever do nudity and I've never seen a man's weiner in an R-rated film--but there it was!  I thought the sex scenes were very honest and real, though.  Just kind of suprised me is all.      Overall, VERY good, unpredictable movie!

1594481717|5.0|This is hardly a book of right-brain/left-brain pseudo-psychology. Rather, this is surprisingly tantalizing with its ideas about skill needed by the workforce of the future.     Not interested in employment skills? Retired? Still in school not looking for a job? This is also a good book for learning new ways to expand your life, increase your enjoyment of life, and augment your knowledge. Whatever your purpose for reading this book, you are in for a treat.     This is a very short read (I read it in about 4 hours or so), and it is true there are few details or solutions or step by step guides as to improving your right brain thinking, as other reviewers have mentioned. However, part of the point of the book is that training yourself and expanding the way you think needs to be your journey -- any more input from the author would have just been fluff.     As it is, I received some good things to think about, and \\"A Whole New Mind\\" points me in a new direction. The author also graciously recommended additional books on specific topics, and I'll happily check some of those out.

0060763280|5.0|I have been in business for many years, I have read MANY books over the years, Now unless I have missed something in them T.Harv Eker's book is the 1st one I read to talk about your financial blue print. (This is only out of the books I have read) Since reading this book I have changed the way I run my personal finances and business finances. This is the only book I would recomend to anyone else. I have even told people if they read it and do not like it I will BUY the book back from them. Out of all the people I have told that to who actually went out AND took action and bought it NOT 1 has asked me to buy it back. Crazy what happens when WE take responsibility for where we are in our life what can happen. I have bought numerous copies of this book and given them as gifts. THIS is the only book in 10 years I have done that with. This book will not make you rich but if you do what the book says YOU will see a change in your life and yourt finances. Please excuse my spelling and have a great life. I believe all is possible when we TAKE action.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is what Blu-ray is all about.  Armchair travel at it's very best.  Soar with the eagles, dive with the fishes and walk with the beasts.  Beautifully filmed and narrated.  Informative too.  You'll wonder how they got some of these shots.
B00005JKGO|5.0|The film is fascinating, and the remastering and restoration excellent.  What a shame, then, that Mr. Schickel's commentary is so persistently banal, doing little more (when it's accurate) than stating the obvious.  The film deserves a much more distinguished critique than this.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The DVD was exactly as advertised. It arrived just a few days after placing order. I will purchase from this seller again.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This is a very well made film that really touches the emotions.  The acting, writing, and photography are all very strong.    I'm surprised by how many negative reviews there are - I expected a higher rating when I checked.  Yes, they lay on the sugar quite thick, but it's well done.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Great high quality video, good sound, and a cool commentary version also included! The video from Live-Aid is great too.  One of the last concerts where it was just the four of them playing on stage, awesome!
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I usually read the book before watching the movie.  In this case, the movie just happened to come on Starz and I watched it.  I LOVED the movie so much!  I love anything to do with that period in time.  The lovely accents, the beautiful dresses, handsome men, romance, and deceit.  It was all there!  You will not be disappointed with this movie!
B001TDPPVG|4.0|This is an artist with an incredible ability to walk across musical genres in a single CD and still maintain coherence and overall musicianship.  Not your ordinary Avishai Cohen for sure but in this record he makes it clear that he still has a lot to deliver to his audience in the coming years.  I saw him playing along Chick Corea at the Blues Alley in Washington DC about 10 yr ago and one of the adjectives Chick used to qualify Avishai was a \\"very fresh\\" bass player.  In my opinion he still permeates freshness as well evidenced in this record.   Being a native Spanish speaker, his command of the language in \\"Alfonsina y el Mar\\" is far from good.  But this is perhaps a minor annoyance which to most of you may  probably become meaningless.  I would recommend this CD to all lovers of \\"world music\\" as well as Avishai's fans and the jazz community in general.  Compralo ya!

0316017922|5.0|Just finished Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers and it is by far one of the most interesting books I've ever read.    The book looks at how people are successful. The idea in our world is that success comes from hard work, being smarter than the other guy. But what Gladwell points out is that is not the end of the story. Sometimes, you can be those things and not be successful.     Gladwell looks at how to know whether your child will be a star hockey or soccer player based on what month they are born in. What the Beatls and Bill Gates have in common. Why Asians are so good at math. Why star New York lawyers have the same resume.     \\"Outliers are those who have been given opportunities - and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. For hockey and soccer players born in January, it's a better shot at making the all-star team. For the Beatles, it was Hamburg. For Bill Gates, the lucky break was being born at the right time and getting the gift of a computer terminal in junior high. Joe Flom and the founders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz got multiple breaks. They were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity, which allowed them to practice takeover law for twenty years before the rest of the legal world caught on.\\"    This really was a fascinating read on why people are successful and why others are not. All successful people are not the same, sometimes you have to be born at the right time, in the right place, to the right family. But then, you have to do something with it.     [...]
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Fantastic movie! Best I've seen in years! Wonderfully involving and gives you a lot to think about afterwards.
B0000508U6|1.0|I was very disappointed with the purchase. The seller described the product to be in \\"like new condition\\". I anticipated receiving the disc in the original packaging (along with the cover)as though it were purchased brand new from a store. The disc itself was in fine condition. However, it came in a clear plastic case. I don't think the cd should have been advertised as being in \\"like new condition.\\" The music by Coldplay is great and the disc is definitely worth purchasing, particularly if you like all of their other cd's but don't own this one.
B001HYX3IY|4.0|An incredibly expansive romp through the development of human culture.  Interesting theory on the rise of dominant cultures which makes a great deal of sense.      Production of food and domestication of animals gives the culture an early advantage, allowing it to develop surplus, which allows the development of technology.  Geography (north/south or east/west axis), the initial disposition of animals(not all animals can be domesticated), and agricultural resources (variety of edible plants) are key to getting the first early advantage.    Thought provoking.
B00263J69K|5.0|This audio book was the best I have ever listend too, I can't say more than that, Many thanks
B001993Y2C|5.0|Nice packaging and if it comes with that centurion I'm buying this set. I already own most of the series in DVD format, but that cylon figure cinches it.  I'm not one to throw away money on something that I already have, but for the blue ray format and because of the caliber of this show, I'd say its worth it. Also its important to support shows like this. Too many are being canceled like the Terminator just was.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|As the title suggests, I bought this as a birthday present for my wife and have watched a few episodes with her and haven't COMPLETELY wanted to kill myself.  I can see where the attraction comes from, but it is really geared towards a specific demographic and if you fall outside those limits it might be more than you can handle.  Strictly from a consumer perspective, the product is great.  Great case, loads of extras, \\"cute\\" packaging, etc.  She loved it!!!!!
B000063DFN|5.0|The last song on this awesome album simply is worth the price of admission. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is Steve Harris at his best. At about 8 minutes or so into the epic 13 minute song it becomes what amounts to a powerhouse of metal madness that almost no other band could surely replicate. Virtuoso guitar solo, wicked melodic guitar, driving bass guitar, and thunderous drums heading for the climax. It is the best epic metal song ever. Driving is extremely hazardous with that tune on because you surely will be WAY over the speed limit.    Other notable songs are Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight. Both are great and I prefer 2 Minutes to Midnight of the two.    The intro to Flash of the Blade is awesome and I like the fact that it kind of has some D&D appeal to it. If only Iron Maiden would do the score to fantasy based video game or movie with that type of theme. In listening to this song again right now I forgot how great it is. The guitar playing is just incredibly tight and precise.    In short all the songs are listenable material and several are classic material. Powerslave is one of the Golden Age of Maiden albums also including Number of the Beast in 1982, Piece of Mind in 1983, Somewhere in Time in 1986, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son in 1987. If you are into the metal genre and will be experiencing this music for the first time get ready for one wild ride. PLAY IT LOUD!
0783233477|5.0|[[ASIN:0783233477 Meet Joe Black]]  I keep coming back to this DVD. It is uncomingly wise and illuminating as the characters interchange with each other. Joe Black, played very well by Brad Pitt, is Death, in human form. He wants to feel the experiences and learn about both the human person he has impersonates and the person (Hopkins) he come to deliver to the afterlife. Anthony Hopkins and Pitt, as well as Claire Fiorani, the beautiful daughter of Hopkins, perform exceedingly well in their roles. The ending brings the movie full circle, bringing to Claire what she thought had captured during their first meeting in the coffee shop. True love with a remarkably handsome man she met briefly, but indelibly at a coffee shop. This film brings out the best and the worst of the characters as the movie moves through all the challenges they meet. I've watched it many times and never tire of the remarkable performances and a script that suits them. Thank you for considering my opinion. S.Johnson  [[ASIN:0783233477 Meet Joe Black]]
B001FB55M6|5.0|One of my favorite Jim Carrey movies ever and definitely one of the best of his recent  films. Blu-ray looks great and the digital copy is always a plus.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century.  The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India.  Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate.  In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.<br /><br />Based on the novel \\"Q & A\\" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up this much money as a contestant on \\"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?\\" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating.  With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.<br /><br />Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle (\\"Trainspotting,\\" \\"28 Days Later\\"), \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next be indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition.  Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.<br /><br />The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset.  Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters.  And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say..

B001DHXT1G|4.0|Overall, I was more impressed with this film than the first \\"Hulk\\", though they seem to be quite similar. Aside from Ed Norton and Liv Tyler taking over for Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly, it's still just a movie about the origin of the Hulk and Bruce Banner's quest to reverse the effects of his mutation. Lots of good action and a bit of humor. Compared to other recent Marvel Comic-based movies, I didn't enjoy it as much as Iron Man, but it was much better than Spider-Man 3. It was worth a purchase and definitely worth it on blu-ray.
B000026C1Q|5.0|This is typical Alan Parsons music. If you like the other albums, you will like this one also. I do, and this will finish my collection. Very enjoyable.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is an outstanding movie, full of wonderful lessons from history.  It is the well told, true story of the abolition of the slave trade in England.  The scenery, costumes and acting are suprisingly great.  May we draw the parallels to the present day fight for the right to life of human beings in the womb.
B0011Z3334|5.0|Definitely worth the price if you like Paramore.  I ended up enjoying most of the tracks on the album.  This is a great band with an energetic sound that grows on you.
B000W91RUG|4.0|+ Flat box (very convenient).  + Large amount of subtitles.  - Lack of bonus (interviews, behind the scene, etc...).
B0018QOIXU|5.0|My husband heard one of her songs on the radio and bought the album for me.  I fell in love with her voice first and her lyrics are just as wonderful.  I only wish she had more to listen to.  This album is fabulous and I could listen to her sing all day.  Absolutely my kind of music, and her soul touches me to the core!
B001KR0BDI|3.0|There are very few books that I truly dislike, but I can't say I was thrilled by Kristen Cashore's Graceling. The plot and many of the medieval fantasy formulas felt as though they had been recycled one too many times. It seemed as though the author was following a set of rules for \\"How to Write Medieval Fantasy\\" that she was afraid to depart from. It was altogether too formulaic, and I was too often reminded of other books that had this or that exact same element or plot twist.     The only real upshot to this book was the strong female protagonist. Katsa is brave to the point of being rash, intelligent, and capable of handling herself. She has strong opinions, such as her obvious disregard for the institution of marriage, which made me like her all the more. Unfortunately however, her character is ruined by the stereotypical female blindness to a love that is (literally) smacking her in the face. Don't get me wrong; Graceling is definitely readable. But if you want to read really good medieval fantasy, I'd check out Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness series or Immortals series first.
B0017CW5J4|3.0|Better singers with the first release.  Really missed Venus Hum on \\"I feel love\\".
B0018YIFEK|4.0|A friend gave me this book, and told me to read it soon as there is a movie coming out.  I always like to read the books before the movie comes out, as the movie sometimes ruins the book.<br />I loved this book.  I have three children, all born healthy Thank goodness.  However, I related to this book, putting myself in the mother's shoes, and wondering how I would handle the situation, if my child was sick.<br />Not an uplifting book by any means, if you do not like sad tragic stories do not read this book.  Have kleenex handy...
1591841666|3.0|This was a book that I had heard a great deal about and I was anxious to read it. The book was a quick read despite the fact that I underlined it and made notes in the margins.  I think I was looking for more from the book than I actually got.  His points<br />1) every activity has a Dip, a period of initial success followed by a period of stagnation followed by a period of success<br />2) when you are in a Dip lean into it and commit the resources to get through it.<br />3) when you are in a cul-de-sac, a dead end, you should quit and quit with honor.<br />The problem is that he doesn't help the reader determine the difference between a Dip and a cul-de-sac and it is very clear from reading the book that a resource-sucking cul-de-cac for some businesses is a Dip for others.  Since recognizing the difference between a cul-de-sac and a Dip is crucial and the book doesn't provide a way to determine the difference, its utility is pretty limited other than telling anyone in sports, business, sales or any other endeavor that they will, in all likelihood, go through a slump (ah excuse me, Dip)

B00005JLCI|4.0|Well, we had to wait almost a decade but it's finally here:  Kenneth Branagh's monumental production of Hamlet, on DVD for the first time.  I'd been using a VHS/video version for years quite successfully but all good things come to an end.  The tape had started to wear out and the colour didn't seem as fresh as it could have been.    Happily, Warner's did the right thing and digitally transferred it onto DVD for all of us Shakespeare afficionadoes!  In short, it's magnificent. No problems with regional codes or additional technologies.  [[ASIN:B00005JLCI William Shakespeare's Hamlet (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
0688002307|4.0|This is one of the hardest books I have ever read. I decided to pick it up after seeing one of Fitch's pre-fight interviews before his fight with George St. Pierre for the Welterweight Championship. Jon Fitch said this is the book that helped him become such a successful MMA fighter in the UFC.<br /><br />After Jon tied the UFC record for victories in a row with 8, I wondered how this book could be so influential. In the book as in many martial arts the focus is on quality instead of winning. The analogy of climbing the mountain and enjoying the view along the way up and not just at the top was very easy for me to understand, and relatable to training for a fight.<br /><br />There is a lot of philosophy and Zen in this book and having never studied philosophy in school this was my first exposure to both topics. There are a lot of difficult concepts in this book and I put it down many, many times because it provoked so much introspective though for me. The story of Pirsig's trip across the country with his son was a great way to approach many of these more complicated philosophical topics.<br /><br />While it did take me over a year to read the book due to putting it down so much I'm glad I finished it. Reading this book opened up my mind to many new ways of thinking about things.
B001TOD92C|3.0|Darren Aronofsky is an excellent filmmaker, so I knew this movie would be good.  I do not see what all the fuss was about though; I thought it was good, but nothing earth shattering here.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke was great as the nearly washed up Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson.  Once a great professional wrestler, he is now doing local fights, where he still is the greatest, but on a miserable scale.  The film goes through the fascinating (to me) look at professional wrestling, from cutting to steroids.  Randy's miserable life is made more miserable because of his unrequited love for a stripper named Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei.  Randy also has a daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, he abandoned long ago, and who know wants nothing to do with him.  Complications further arise as Randy suffers a near fatal heart attack and is told never to wrestle or do drugs again.<br /><br />And here is where Rourke shines; Randy does try to do good by his body: he starts a relationship with his daughter, a friendship with Cassidy, and even gets a legitimate job at the deli counter.  (The deli counter scene is my favorite, probably because it was improvised with real people and not extras!).  But because life is unfair, he loses his job in a fit of rage, Cassidy rejects Randy's advances, which makes him forget about a dinner date with his daughter, which causes her to hate him again.  Wait not hate, she does not feel anything for him, ouch!  And so, alone again, Randy turns to the place where he was always loved, even though it may kill him, the ring.<br /><br />I thought it was a good film, with good acting, and an interesting story-Recommended.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I am a big fan of Blind Faith, Traffic, Eric, and Steve.  When I saw their reunion during Eric's Crossroads Festival 2007 DVD, it seemed too good to be true.  Seeing actual Blind Faith songs resurrected from the ashes of time.  Too bad Ginger wasn't invited to join, but then, that might bring back some sort of negative memories of the first time Faith was patched together and urged by management to record and tour, then Eric jumped ship.  I'm not passing any judgment.    So now we have a full tour of Eric and Steve playing together and seemingly enjoying it.  They play together wonderfully and I only wish they would come to my town AND I could afford it.  But that's why we are blessed with this wonderful DVD, so the rest of us can experience it.    Eric does a great job of playing the required guitar licks for Blind Faith and Traffic songs.  Steve plays great on both guitar and keyboards where required.  Both sing just fine.  Neither has lost a thing.    We get all but one song of the one and only Blind Faith album, and great highlights of different phases of each player's career.  We even get a tribute to Buddy Miles (RIP) on \\"Them Changes\\", Otis Rush on \\"Double Trouble\\", and Ray Charles on \\"Georgia On My Mind\\".    Be aware \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" here has more in common with the \\"electric\\" version on the Steve Winwood \\"The Finer Things\\" boxed set, rather than the acoustic version on the original Blind Faith album.    My only beef is it would have been pretty cool to see them play \\"Gimmie Some Lovin'\\", but perhaps they're tired of that one.  I'm also surprised that \\"Freedom Rider\\" didn't make it to the set, but that's the way it goes.  Also, it was known (and heard on a bootleg) that Blind Faith played \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" as an encore on their original tour; that would have been a nice encore.    A great value and highly recommended!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Why do movie-goers wait in great anticipation for the next Clint Eastwood movie??... because he's the last of the great American actors, that's why.  When Clint goes... who's left??  There's not much to choose from... Rubber face Al Pacino??... Marble Mouth Robert DeNiro??  Growth humanoid Sly Stallone??  The list is pathetic!  The simple reason we love Clint so much is he doesn't turn out drek like the rest of the above mentioned sell-outs.  We love him because in all his movies through out his wonderful career he acts with dignity... something that we as a country are in great need of and even if we have to turn to film to get it we will and that's why we look to him!  This film is no exception to Clint's long list of great films.  It doesn't turn out like your typical Dirty Harry movie but leaves you feeling there's still hope...somewhere.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Like Advent Children (incomplete?), this is a good movie. It adds much new footage to the original, much of which is very, very good. Unfortunately, it fails in some areas that the previous version did not.<br />For starters, the previous version led you on Cloud's path of discovery - as he discovered what, exactly, the Remnants were up to, so did you. In this version, Rufus spills the beans almost immediately.<br />Which brings me to another point. Uninterrupted monologues can be fine in books, but they become rather tedious in movies; and, unfortunately, not only is Rufus now King of Destroying-the-Suspense, he's also King of Nonstop-Monologues. ;) Seriously, Rufus is one of my favorite characters in the movie, so, theoretically, more talking from him is a good thing. But Rufus is also a very concise, calculating talker; he doesn't give away anything more than absolutely necessary. This came across perfectly in the first film; not so in the second.<br />Now, arguably, the audience already knows what happens, so spilling the beans early on isn't a big deal; I don't mean to imply that the movie is ruined (or anything of the sort) by it. I do think it lacks a sense of intrigue that the first maintained, though. The tension that the characters' quest for answers created helped to make the movie interesting each time; now they know, almost immediately. Also, some of the added scenes (at least for me) didn't add much to the movie. There's a fine line, I know, between enhancing the FF saga and making a great movie; I think a lot of the additional scenes were aimed at continuing and enhancing the saga rather than making a spectacular movie. Which, again, is not to say that they were bad; they were good, but I view them as someone coming from the FF7 saga.<br />Finally, on the visual level, the Blu Ray version is awesome, and AC Complete generally looks fantastic. The only exception to that would be the heavy-handed application of dirt smudges during fight scenes, etc. While the idea of adding realism through dust, rumpled clothes, etc., is a great one, I think they went a little overboard at times; dumping dirt on the characters is just as bad as having none.<br />Now, all of this said, keep in mind that I am highlighting the problems with the movie, and saying little about the good parts of the movie. I do this in large part because most of what the original had going for it, this has going for it. It IS a good movie, despite its flaws, with an interesting story line, fun characters, and lots of action. AC Complete has enough additional footage and new touches that it is well worth seeing at least (personally, I added it to my library; if you're a FF7 fan, you'll likely do the same). I may not see it as often as I'll see the original, but is a very enjoyable movie. 4/5 starsle the idea of adding realism through dust, rumpled clothes, etc., is a great one, I think they went a little overboard at times; dumping dirt on the characters is just as bad as having none.<br />Now, all of this said, keep in mind that I am highlighting the problems with the movie, and saying little about the good parts of the movie.

B002AQTD2S|1.0|I downloaded this version because I couldn't get it at my library. BIG MISTAKE. Some things didn't make sense. So, when the library copy came in I compared it and found WHOLE paragraphs missing from the story! UGH! Now, I am going to have to read it all over again to get it. I doubt if this is an \\"abridged\\" version either because it is a very short book to begin with.<br /><br />Not even worth the .99!
B001DD63UO|5.0|This is a great CD. I would recomend it to everyone. Pink is the best singer out there!!

B000VBIEXS|1.0|I don't understand why anyone would get so wound up about the mastering of this. It was terrible when it was released, now it sounds terrible & dated. If you want good prog rock, get some Can, Neu, or Faust, if you want experimental rock that has intelligent lyrics, buy some Zappa. If on the other hand, you have some terrorists locked up & need to play something to torture them with, this will do quite well, prog rock for people with no musical sensibility or intelligence.
B0026IBY72|4.0|After reading Hale's graphic novel Rapunzel's Revenge, I decided to try and get to one of her novels sooner rather than later.  After a little coin flipping, Austenland made its way to my nightstand.    Austenland is an intriguing concept that is carried of rather well.  From a high level, it involves a thirty-something single woman named Jane off for 3 weeks of \\"Live Action Role Play\\" (LARP) in a Regency House populated with servants, gentlemen and other women searching for Victorian style romance.  I expected plenty of sappy moments and coming away with a sugar headache.  Instead, I found a thoughtful and fun (albeit cheesy at times) romance that tries to get to the heart of romance while exploring unrealistic expectations and the joys and pains of obsessions.    Starting out the novel, I was worried that Jane would quickly become a stereotypical archetype...the 'unlucky in love' woman who obsesses over Pride & Prejudice (and other similar books), spurns men as vile and unromantic, and sets herself expectations that can never be achieved.  By the end of the book, many of those traits were in fact proven out.  However, Jane did progress through the novel and explored her own psychology to determine which of those characteristics were realistic and which should be abandoned.      Her path to discovery was humorous at times, frustrating at others, but in the end felt believable.  I really found myself getting to understand and sympathize with Jane while at the same time wanting to shout at her that she was an idiot.      I absolutely loved the prefaces to many of the chapters in the book...many of the chapters began with a short description of each of Jane's \\"boyfriends\\" (of which I think she had 15).  Most were a few paragraphs...one was just a sentence.  Each was very insightful into her character and each was rather humorous...the kind of humor that is funny because you can see the reality behind the pathetic occurrence.  As an example, one of these \\"boyfriend\\" descriptions tells about how she first saw the boy in class and they shared a glance and then, because he was too shy, she asked him out...to which he responded, \\"sure...and what was your name\\"....which promptly ended their \\"relationship\\".    As for the other characters, I felt that they were well portrayed, but I had some trouble (as did Jane) trying to sort out the behavior of the actors versus those of the person behind the character.  I really felt Hale did a good job of keeping the true person at a distance while exposing glimpses of reality.  The gardener was an interesting character who felt a little flat and, while I was surprised what happened with him, I was glad the way his story ended.  I thought Mr. Nobley and the other gentlemen on the estate were well portrayed as proper 19th century gentlemen, but I would have liked to have seen more \\"behind-the-scenes\\" moments with them.  We get one VERY brief scene where one of the characters is smoking behind a bush and talks about \\"getting back to work.\\"  I would like to have seen moments like that elaborated on a bit more.    The writing and the plot flowed along very nicely and it was a very fun read.  Even though I am a heterosexual male, I did enjoy the book and can recommend it.  However, I can't recommend it to everyone.  For example, most of my friends (both male and female) would likely laugh at the suggestion and never make it beyond the first chapter.  Others would certainly eat it up.  I think that in order to enjoy this, the reader must first have an appreciation, if not a love, of Victorian literature and particularly Victorian romances.  Having at least a perception of the obsession around Pride and Prejudice may also help.    So, two scores.  To those who don't like Victorian romances - 1 star  To those who enjoy Victorian lit, romances, or \\"girlie\\" books:    ****  3.5 stars
B00140PK6O|5.0|The DVD Cranford was family entertainment!!!    A story of compassion, family secrets, rules to break, some to keep. It has many twist and turns. True family relationships which pertain today 2009.    Enjoy a simple era that stirs the mind as well as the heart.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Best show I've watched since Stargate SG-1.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series, read all the books. Season 1 of the show follows book 1 pretty well, with just enough changes so you don't get bored if you've read the book. I'm guessing season 2 will stray a bit further because it introduces some new characters that don't exist in the novels. Anyway, I totally loved it and I intend to buy all the seasons as they become available. Since there are already 9 books in print, there's plenty of material there for a VERY long series :)
B001EO748M|4.0|Noticeably, many actors in this series have given some of their best performances during their scenes on the scaffold, giving memorable recitals of historically accurate speeches during their final appearances in this drama.    The final episode of Season 2 of \\"The Tudors\\" begins with a dramatic scanning of the elegant broadsword that will kill a queen, wielded by French executioner, Jean Rombaud(Anatole Taubman), called from Calais for this judicial regicide.    Thursday, May 18, 1536 is portrayed a foggy day around the Tower of London. We hear a chapel chorus of women singing \\"Jerusalem, My Happy Home\\" (which, in reality, would not be composed for another 44 years), until they are interrupted by the volatile Henry VIII( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers--a fine actor, but I still don't get him as Henry), whom in an irony that should not be lost on Tudor-era history buffs, is about to execute a woman reputed for her beautiful singing voice.   Meanwhile, the beleagured Anne(Natalie Dormer), having witnessed the executions of her brother, George(Padraic Delaney), along with four other men accused of being her lovers including Court Musician Mark Smeaton (David Alpay),out of whom a confession was tortured, prays in her cell in the tower, where she is attended by three (in reality four) ladies-in-waiting, a chaplain, Constable Kingston(Steve Wilson), and has her confession of innocence of the charges against her heard by Bishop Cramner (Hans Matheson).     Her two-and a-half-year-old daughter, Elizabeth (Kate Duggan) is tended to by Lady Margaret Bryan (Jane Brennan), unaware of the tragedy that is about to befall her. Her treatment at the beginning of this episode will be in sharp contrast to her treatment later on when her status changes.    The bereaved young Mary Tudor(Sarah Bolger), who was ill-treated by Anne,and who is still in mourning for her mother, Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) receives very consoling news from Holy Roman Empire Ambassador Eustace Chapuys( Anthony Brophy) while finishing her prayers in a chapel.   Charles Brandon( Henry Cavill) frolics with his son, Edward, gives Thomas Boleyn (Nick Dunning) the news of his release, and lays into the condemned Queen's father with a lambast that History would like to think he was actually given, if not by a person, than surely by his own conscience.    James Frain's Thomas Cromwell carries out the King's mixed signals regarding the Queen's execution, but, here, is made out to be reluctant to do so, and is shown anxiously kneeling in prayer towards the end.    The fortunes of Jane Seymour( the exquisite, delicate looking Icelandic actress, Anita Briem), are on the rise, and the contrasting scene of her preparing for the King's visit with Anne's preparations for the scaffold as Anne's chaplain recites from the Book of Ecclesiastes are very effective.    Anne's ladies-in-waiting listen intently as the prisoner reminisces about her life at the Court of Queen Margaret of Austria.   While praying again on her last night alive, Anne's thoughts fly to a delightful childhood memory.   Then it is Friday, May 19th 1536...    In a performance that should have landed Natalie Dormer a cabinet full of accolades, she reenacts the true-to-life bravery of a complicated woman who made an indelible impact on history in the face of her unjust demise, and whose posthumous compensation lay ahead with the 45-year reign of the feisty red-haired toddler she was leaving behind.Our last scenes of Anne are as a child in a loving moment with the father who later pimped her out to her fate.--A moment whose greater symbolism  may lie in the concept of Anne's permanent reunion with a Heavenly Father who would be infinitely more just, carrying her past the intrigues of the life she had previously known.--A gallant and undeniably moving swan-song indeed!    The next day, the King sits down to dine on a swan pudding (an exclusive priviledge of Royals) to the applause of prudent courtiers who will keep silent about recent events and in so doing, keep their own heads.   While the inaccuracies of this passion play have been rather off-putting, I can never deny the grandeur of the acting, nor the high drama and skillful portrayal of the historically correct scenes.   A weeping Thomas Wyatt (Jamie Thomas King) was there to see his beloved Anne off. During this season, it had been his poetry which towards the end reflected the continuing devastation as ...\\"Around the Throne, the thunder rolls..\\"    And so do the heads...

Anyway, it's finally here along with a plethora of extras and I'm eight years old again. Fantasmagorical!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I watched this movie on HBO a few months ago, Michael Moore talks about how the United States is so hell bent on making money instead of providing free healthcare to everyone.

B001VPJZFO|1.0|This review is for Amazon.com, not the movie itself. I bought this dvd because the description said it was released in February 2009.  This was not the case.  This is the 1998 version.  The aspect is 2.35:1, but it is not anamorphic.  Played on my widescreen tv, the image was stretched out, so I had to use the fill screen mode, which cuts out some of the picture at the top and bottom.  The sound was dolby 2.0 mono.  The movie itself is great and I would give it 4 stars.  I was only hoping for a remastered version with better sound and picture.  Amazon needs to remove this listing if this version doesn't exist.

Try the Agave cupcakes; great for people who are watching their sugar and they are so yummy.  Also, if you like waffles get their other book Vegan with a Vengence and try the chocolate chip waffle and the Ginger pear waffle (I omitted the ginger since I am not too keen on ginger in sweets)...they are wonderful.

B001KVZ6FM|2.0|I love Pixar films BUT.... wow. I must be nuts.    This movie, first of all, is not something I would bring my nieces to see. It was heavy, sad, depressing and there was no... \\"moral\\" to learn or \\"point.\\" The old man does eventually \\"realize to live life\\" but seeing as how he had a long, beautiful life to start with... it made no sense at all that he was as grumpy and rotten as he was to begin with. The entire movie centers on this old man yearning for his dead wife and I'm not revealing a thing or spoiling a plot because that's the intro!! And then it goes on. He yearns for the wife. And on. Yearning for her. And on. Yearning! I don't see this as appropriate for anyone under the age of say, 13, and I can't imagine anyone at 13 would want to sit through that.     THEN. There is no plot.     SLIGHT SPOILER:    So this old man wants to move his house to the top of this waterfall to achieve the childhood dream his dead wife never got to see fulfilled. He takes this dream quite literally and moves the actual house to the waterfall... amazingly he gets to South America in a blink of an eye and a storm.... only to magically be at the waterfall but not quite close enough... so he wants to drag the house to the other side of the canyon to get to  the exact position... and so he moves the house... and he moves the house... and this is the plot... the house, moving the house, getting the house just right... seriously?    There are obstacles that come between him and moving the house to the exact position he wants it in.     He also inexplicably moves in and out of jungle even though the landscape is shown to be a huge, rocky ledge.     Oh then there's the villain who is somehow still quite active and alive?... considering he must be over a century old. He also has been sitting in the jungle for oh, 60 years at least, and has had access to lots of fancy gidgets and wizmos and serves gourmet food.     I give it 2 stars for being colorful. Also, I did LOVE the promising, romantic, sweet intro... But after that... there just wasn't anything left to watch. Except for the cute dogs... a much needed comic relief. The entire rest of the film was disappointing and I think it was marketed way wrong.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Now that everything was established in the short first season (writers strike) the second season gets things really going.    I will not spoil but I will say this show is now falling into history. It's one of the greatest shows of all time and will most likely only get better from here.

O estilo inconfundível de Mazzy Star é atemporal e deixa-nos extasiados com a envolvência musical que requer, como sempre, um contexto e ambiente propícios a que possamos apreciar todos os temas por completo. Para mim o melhor álbum, apesar de não conseguir-me desligar de \\"Among my swan\\".

B000YDE4FA|5.0|I love this boot. It is a great summer boot. Beware the boot is not waterproof as the description might lead you to believe. Splash proof, yes. But don't go stepping in any puddles, the tongue is not sewn in completly, as is neccessary for complete waterproofing. Boot is very comfortable right out of the box. This high of a boot could use a different lacing system at the top to facilitate taking on & off. If you can look past these things you will love the boot. Comfortable all day.

B001FB55MG|5.0|I never thought I would let my young children watch an Adam Sandler film, but when this came out, it looked really funny, and okay for my kids. My wife and I previewed it and it was fine for the kids. The kids watched it, and watched it.....and watched it. They are 4 and 5.5. They belly laughed (and so did my wife and I). There is nothing really that bad here and I thought the entire film was fun (a bit silly, but I like that, and it's perfect). My only disappointment is that I cannot find Adam Sandlers ringtone (wait until you hear it, it's hysterical). There are enough double entendres that adults as well as children will enjoy it. Also, this is a great transfer. If you like silly fantasy and good comedy, this is for you. If you are not a fan of silly fantasy, you will probably still like this enough to rate it 4 stars. If you have no sense of humor, then rent it first. ;-)
0375831002|5.0|The author has managed to create a beautiful and tragic world defined by some of the most memorable characters created in a very long time. Narrated by Death and written mostly from the perspective of a pre-pubescent German girl, Zusak paints his story in creative and compelling ways. The final 70 or so pages are epic and will break you down. Read this book.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|To be honest, Avenged Sevenfold's self title album is pretty overrated.    its single tracks \\"Critical Acclaim\\" \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Almost Easy\\" are alright at best, but there older songs from City of Evil such as \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" makes there singles from this album look as if they were played by amateurs, they have some pretty good tracks on here but they are less popular (which is a shame) Gunslinger, Unbound (the wild ride) and Lost are by far my favorite tracks from this CD, those songs show of there instrumentals and song writing skills.    If you are just getting into Avenged Sevenfold, i suggest you buy City of Evil (one of my favorite albums ever) or Waking the Fallen before you listen to this, because quite frankly i'd give City of Evil a 5/5 and Waking the Fallen a 4/5 ... while self titled gets a nice 2.5/5 [[ASIN:B0009I7NNA City of Evil]]
B000N6TX1S|3.0|The story is a neat idea, but the bad sound editing made it difficult for me to understand much of the dialogue.

Watch it with the sound turned up.   Could barely hear it.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This is my favorite music DVD.  There were no disappointments as Clapton went through his range of guitar/singing abilities.

0618918248|3.0|Mr. Professor Dawkins is brilliant. A work of pure focus. Now science is about theories. When your theory is displaced by a better theory, your theory goes to the garbage bin. That's science! It's beautiful. And Mr. Dawkins gets that. He gets it better than others. Even better than other scientists out there. This book makes it clear. It offers brilliant British rethoric that dazzles. It can be a bit distracting too. But the points are made. Science is about theories. Here is a theory for Mr. Dawkins: [...]    It makes no scientific sense. The people in the video are probably just pretending for fun anyway ;-) I would love to know Mr Dawkins's informed and brilliant scientific opinion. Basically under Mr Dawkins, if it cannot be proven, it does not exist. That's science. Right? Thanks for making Mr. professor Dawkins a super wealthy scientist author person.

0312370849|4.0|Just shared this book with a book club that has been in existance for over thirty years.  The consensus was that it was an incredibly affecting book.  We thought that there have been many holocaust books written and what more could one say?  We found that this one had a new slant.  The idea of children being involved can really be drenched in pathos. There were times when the story made you cry with profound sadness.    The book is a quick read and the idea of the key makes you turn pages faster and faster as though you were reading a \\"who done it\\". The Sarah story is arresting from beginning to end.  The woman reporter story grows a trifle weak with a bit of implied romance that becomes \\"contrived\\".    A particularly interesting book with a brilliant beginning, middle and surprising outcome.
B00011RPB0|1.0|This is every middle-aged man's fantasy. A hot young chick falling for a much older man. It is obvious why the older guy would be interested, but why would the younger woman be interested in the older man? The movie fell short on giving any reasonable explanation as to why the young woman would be interested in the older man. The young woman was protrayed as a Yale graduate who is missing intellectual stimulation in her marriage and life. Yet in the relationship she had with the older man, there still was no intellectual stimulating conversations between them, which made the relationship fake and unbelievable. Ask \\"What can the older man offer that the young woman can not get with her younger friends or husband?\\" This movie does not satisfactorily answer that question.

B002BPQ0Y2|2.0|I LOVE the Black Eyed Peas.  Well, I loved their last two albums (and the Duchess to boot).  However, this new album is not the Peas I know.  I understand that artists like to evolve, but at the same time I don't understand why artists choose to stray so far away from where they shine.  The Peas are a hip hop group and they do hip hop better than anybody else.  This album is too much electronica and not enough boom boom pow.  The Peas are not a techno-type band, ala La Bouche or Real McCoy.  I wish they realized that before releasing this--dare I say, passe album.  I must say that I am sorely disappointed.
B001DTUTU8|4.0|I have put off watching this film for many months because I didn't know if it's story could sustain a full length film. It turned out to be an amazing looking film with a lot of heart! The animation is stunning and the characters are funny with great voice work by the cast. I would love to see 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' done with CGI animation.<br /><br />I have to deduct one star for the DVD as the two disc special edition is really a one disc edition with a digital copy being the only feature on the second disc. For the purchase price, this is ridiulous! I had problems with the movie disc playing in my DVD player, I had the same problem with the WALL E three disc edition and had to buy three copies before finding one that would work properly.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Freakishly entertaining...and touching at the end. My fist subtitled movie (non-English speaking), and it took me twice through to catch some nuances since my attention was divided by having to follow visual and script at the same time. I enjoyed it!! This was suggested to my be a friend of mine from Ukraine. I got her a copy, but she was bummed when it wasn't subitled in Russian. In fact, she saw it in Ukraine with Russian voice overdub. At any rate, as I said, I liked it and would recommed it to anyone who is open minded and does not require the standard USA movie making concept.

0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a journey as colorful, dynamic, multidimensional, inspiring, and touching as walk through a market in Mumbai. Its pages and chapters quickly carry the reader on an adventure that covers so much contrasting ground - both in setting and emotional tone - yet somehow it all comes together seamlessly and smoothly in an exciting and well crafted symphony.     Love and life on the run serve as a kind of harmonium, a constant undertone as Roberts takes us through the Bombay beat from heartwrenching to heartpounding adventure all intertwined with silent and sensitive moments of quiet insightful reflection and revelation.
B000BT97AO|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much based on the reviews I read of this movie.  Possibly I expected a bit more coherent of a story from Neil Gaiman, but ultimately this was a disappointing movie for me.    The selling point of this film is obviously the melding of a story from a great fantasy writer, Neil Gaiman, with the expertise of David McKean and the Jim Henson Company in bringing the film to life visually.  And for the most part the visual effects are fairly extraordinary in their portrayal of a surreal dreamworld.     Where the movie falls flat is in the plot.  The protagonist, Helena, is a girl in her early teens who is experiencing all the chafing with her parents, especially her mother, over her development as an independent person that all teens go through.  When her mother falls ill, the stress of the situation causes Helena to enter a dreamworld based on her own drawings.  This world consists of two domains ruled by queens, one of lightness and one of darkness.  The light queen, who is basically a idealized version of Helena's mother, has fallen asleep and can only be awoken with a charm called the mirrormask.  However, the mirromask was stolen by a princess from the dark domain, who turns out to be the anti-Helena.  The anti-Helena has also used the mirrormask to displace the real Helena in the real world, where she is busily destroying her relationship with her father and family by dressing like a goth girl, making out with boys, and burning Helena's drawings which are windows into the dreamworld.    This is all presented in kind of a hazy way, which could be excused if it didn't fall apart on it's own internal inconsistencies.  I get the idea that the light queen is Helena's mother.  I get the idea that the dark princess is the dark side of Helena.  And it makes sense that Helena's fight with her mother in the real world at the beginning of the film is symbolized by the dark princess putting the light queen into a never ending sleep by stealing the mirromask in the dreamworld.    But if the dreamworld existed in a state of balance before all this, where's the light princess?  You have a dark queen, and a light queen.  You have a dark princess, shouldn't you have a light one as well?  If the dark princess is the dark side of Helena, wouldn't the dark queen be the dark side of Helena's mother since the light queen is portrayed as the idealized (light) version of Helena's mother?    Another weird inconsistency is Helena's companion Valentine's vision of the future should he enter the real world.  He finds himself overwhelmed as a waiter and decides that instead of using the mirrormask himself as he intended, he should give it to Helena.  And then at the end of the film, he ends up in the real world anyway.  Go figure.    This is all probably quibbling, but these inconsistencies detract from the film.  It's still a film worth watching for the visual feast alone.

B001V9LRV0|4.0|With this deluxe version I was expecting to get the '94 director's cut, the 'Woodstock: The Lost Performances' video that has been out of print for years, and new footage that I had never seen. With the deluxe version you get the following extras (besides the director's cut of the movie): Country Joe and the Fish: Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine, Flying High, Grateful Dead: Mama Tried, Love Light, Joan Baez: One Day at a Time, Jefferson Airplane: Volunteers, 3/5 of a mile in 10 seconds, The Who: My Generation, Johnny Winter: Mean Town Blues, Joe Cocker: Something's Comin' On, Paul Butterfield: Sunrise, CCR: Born on the Bayou, I Put a Spell on You, Keep On Chooglin', Mountain: Beside the sea, Southbound Train, Canned Heat: I'm Her Man, On the Road Again, Santana: Evil Ways, Sha Na Na: Teen Angel. This does not include much of 'Woodstock: The Lost Performances'. No performances by The Band, Blood Sweat and Tears,and no additional performances from Ten Years After like I was hoping for either! Some of the interviews (especially with Michael Wadleigh who filmed the festival) are very interesting. Some re-use footage from the director's cut. There's even a repeat of The Who's performance of We're Not Gonna Take It, most of which is found on the director's cut of this edition, on the extras DVD. The packaging is a bit excessive but it's nice to have the reproduction of the LIFE magazine issue that was all about the festival.The picture is somewhat improved and the sound has had any distortion removed by some computer program...it's a clean sound....kind of sterile sounding in places. The picture and sound don't seem to go together and the difference in quality is noticeable (especially Santana's 'Evil Ways'). It's too bad we couldn't get all or most of the filmed performances in one place. That's what I'd expect from something called a \\"Deluxe Edition\\".
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|First the good.  The resurrection of the original characters from the first Star Trek series is incredibly well done.  This movie does a tremendous job in filling out and expanding the characters from the original series in a thoughtful and respectful way, except for the completely gratuitous love affair between Spock and Uhura that so many others have commented on.  That's nothing but a complete slap in the face to any fan of the original series.    Secondly, most of the sets, uniforms and overall feel of the movie fit in with the original series.  I don't know what it is about the Star Trek franchise, but every time it bounces back and forth between TV and the big screen, someone feels an overwhelming urge to change the uniforms.  It was nice to see the original uniforms pretty much unchanged from the original series.    Lastly, most of the action scenes were fairly enjoyable to watch.  Not overly drawn out, but fairly fantastic all the same.    Now for the bad.  I've already mentioned the putrescent love affair between Spock and Uhura, but whoever thought that up really needs to be publicly executed at the halftime of the next Super Bowl.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in any Star Trek based show, and that's saying a lot.    Secondly, the plot is completely unbelievable.  In order to enjoy any piece of fiction, especially science fiction or fantasy, a suspension of belief is necessary.  However, the work must be internally consistent, and this film falls far short of that.  I'm not talking about the gist of the plot here, however, where an evil Romulan goes back in time to get revenge on Spock by destroying the Vulcan homeworld.    I'm talking about the fact that somehow, Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and McCoy end up in their senior positions on the most advanced starship in Starfleet ten minutes after leaving the Academy.  That just doesn't make a whit of sense.    But let's not let a minor detail like that get in the way of making oodles of box office cash thissummer.  Just make sure you leave your brain at home, and you'll probably enjoy this movie.
B000VFGQUC|5.0|What is everyone bitching about?  You get the Live and Dangerous video release on dvd, a special 1983 promo live clip of the band that is 7 to 8 tracks long, loads of extras including a bonus live cd from 1975 at the Derby.  All for $10.99!!!!  This is quite possibly the best Thin Lizzy bargain (or steal depends on how you look at it) I've ever seen.  GET THIS NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT!
1407106171|5.0|....well, my kids are still a bit too young for this, but I very much enjoy reading it to them.  It is written to be read aloud.  It's great.
0307266303|4.0|This book is definitely inspirational. It forces the reader to give a second thought of modern life style, which is supposed to be advanced over our ancestors'. If widely accepted, those evolutionary theories it states will have a profound impact. In other word, this book could be a life-changing read.    However, it would be better to add a bibliography to back those theories, especially for the chapter where it reveals that the ability of endurance running is an evolutionary advantage of human race.

B001FB55H6|4.0|Watchmen was based upon one ot the greatest graphic novels ever made but in my opinion they included too much what i think the audience wanted and less of the story it they had made it more of a mystery i believe it would have been spectacular overpowering the excessive sex scenes not including manhattan because the less use of cloths shows his detachment from the human race and use of gore but it doesn't matter the directors cut has tales of the Black freighter and more from the book
0385732554|2.0|Young Jonas, eleven and turning twelve, lives in a community of the future where everyone is happy and everyone is the same - to the point that sunshine has been 'edited out' and citizens don't see colors. The young lad is selected to be a keeper of memory, which means that the previous Keeper will give him his memories (by laying hands on him, Vulcan style). These are collective memories, of war, famine, biological families, snow, colors and sunshine (all eliminated from this 'utopian society'). Jonas feels colors and snow, decides they are good, snatches a little baby that was about to be euthanized and heads for the hills, with the blessing of his Keeper. The idea is that as soon as he's gone, the painful memories he had inside would spread out into the community and society would be transformed.<br />  The writing is good, and the ideas sound interesting at first. The intent is fairly clear: this utopia of the future is collectivized, a sort of communism pushed to the extreme. The fact that the book was written during the Cold War tells you all you need to know about the intent and context. But the book ultimately fails because the ideas are not explored, they're just thrown out there, with the vaguest hint as to how this came to be. The inhabitants seem so thoroughly brainwashed that they are just lines on a page: they lack plausibility or any third dimension of thought and genuine feeling. The 'way out' is, again, simplistic; it seems a sleight of hand, an easy way out of the plot. If you want to read a far better description of an alternative reality, try The Left Hand of Darkness, or The House of the Scorpion (though the latter suffers from the same structural flaw of  a rushed, easy ending).
0590030299|4.0|This is a classic children's book that every child should have the opportunity to read.  Sure, the scientific information is wrong, but the book isn't a science book.  It's fiction!
B001TH16DS|5.0|This is the best version by far for the original series. I can't wait to purchace the two remaning seasons. This is everything I wanted except widescreen but because of it's age we are limited by the source material to keep the look natural and correct.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|The burning of the robot doppleganger of Maria as a witch is sort of the high point of the movie.<br />The idea that society was becoming workers and owners<br />with a golf between, becomes a strange future world.<br />I had seen another version of this movie that wasn't as complete or as well done. A lot of people may wonder that just a few subtitles<br />made this picture ( waiting for them).<br />The destruction of the power plant by the workers and the flooding of the workers city make for action. Charlie Chaplin used some of this material in one of his movies. I enjoyed the movie with the upbeat theme<br />of understand between workers and management.

B001PA0FF4|5.0|I try to make a point of seeing all the Oscar-nominated films and I saw all but one last year.  I very much enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire and fully expected it to win best picture. But I am convinced that Doubt was the best picture. A wonderful script with an outstanding cast giving exceptional performances.  As much as I thought The Reader was a film to give one pause for thought, Doubt is much more so. After seeing the film on Blue-ray and watching the extra features,  I noticed that John Patrick Shanley seemed to imply that he expected viewers to come away with differing views of the truth behind the events of the film. Well, that may be true, but I am convinced that there is only one reasonable way to view the events. So I do not think that Mr. Shanley's script leave as much room for Doubt as he perhaps wants. It is not enough to fail to provide definitive proof.  There must be plausible explanations for differing views. As I said, I don't think such explanations exist. I strongly recommend this film to any thinking adult.  I don't think that Blu-ray makes a big contribution to the enjoyment of this film.

B000P46QIG|5.0|This is really an extraordinary Heavy Prog Fusion music disc that signals to a new way of make music in XXI century. With odd time signatures and polyrhythmic performances, Virgil Donati's out of tempo madness drumming and Derek Sherinian use of amazing atmospheres, supply the perfect musical textures and landscapes for all the arrangements, riffs and solos of their guests Jimmy Johnson, Bret Garsed and the master Allan Holdsworth. The contained music is very dinamic and intense. It reflects great thinking level, hurry, desperation and suspense. It feels like the motion picture of an interesting brand new action film.<br /><br />Though Bret Garsed make some great solos for the day with fast legato playing in a kind of a 70's feel (A. Holdsworth played at this level in mid-seventies; just listen the \\"Velvet Darkness\\" album (1975) or with Tony Williams, the \\"Believe it\\" album (1976).<br /><br />Allan Holdsworth shows his famous liquid legato dextresity that puts that disonant ingredient to the Planet X's music, the kind of lines and sound of the guitar is very similar to the 1985 album METAL FATIGUE (classic Holdsworth!), making the tracks where he played, \\"Desert Girl\\" and The \\"Thinking Stone\\", real crown gems. These tracks are supported by bassist Jimmy Johnson (full time band member in almost all A. Holdsworth solo projects), making perfect sense with the musical Fusion galactic concept of the cover and the name of the band, impresive!<br /><br />The top tracks are: \\"Alien Hip Hop\\", \\"Desert Girl\\", \\"Matrix Gate\\", \\"The Thinking Stone\\", \\"Space Foam\\" and \\"Poland\\",... Good Luck!
0393061310|3.0|This book contains a number of fascinating historical stories and studies on the evolution of civilized society.  The opening discussion of the battle at Cajamarca between the Spaniards and Incas, including translated first-hand accounts, is both riveting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />The book suffers from two main defects.  First, the author spent most of his career working in New Guinea and too frequently uses this direct and narrow experience to add credibility to a more general assertions about other societies.  These provincial interruptions sometimes interrupt the flow of an otherwise fine exposition.<br /><br />Second, the author seems intent to refute the idea that the current state of human society - with widely varying adoption of technology and social standards i different geographical areas - is the consequence of mathematically closed-form natural laws which can be employed to predict not only history from first principles, but future societal trends.  This may be a commonly held belief in some backwards social science departments, but has already been widely discredited.  The authors tilting at this windmill is sometimes tedious.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning the contrast between this book and Darwin's Origin of Species.  The latter still seems intellectually fresh, despite its elaborate detail and minor errors in thinking. Darwin's thoughts are shaped by his travels but not limited by them.
0060763280|2.0|I came across a mention of this book by accident, and got it at my local library to decide if it had reference value (e.g. buy a copy.) This book can go back to the library.    It starts with an interesting premise, which is not that much different from other motivational books. It (and his YouTube videos) also use the con man's hook - they key into your dreams and desires, then peddle you whatever they want - disguised as helping you attain your dreams (in this case wealth). Also rather annoyingly, Eker engages in far too much arm-waving during his videos and presentations. I guess someone \\"blueprinted\\" that into Eker - and he carries it with him. Give me five minutes with a motivational speaker and I can predict that he'll be an annoying speaker the rest of his life.    His book was written in 2005 - far before the recent turmoil of the financial markets - during which more than a few \\"millionaire minds\\" were sent to prison - some to die there. He also likes to cite Donald Trump - who has screwed far more of his investors than you can count - and, by the way, started out with a family fortune to begin with.    I've met some millionaires over the years (personally and through reputation known to people I know) and they run the range of personalities. Some are real idiots, some are cheap (meaning they can afford stuff but will stiff you on the dinner bill) some are liars and some can't be trusted at all. Interestingly, the ones who didn't let on or flaunt their wealth (no Jaguars or Rolls) usually weren't like that. My favorite example was told to me by some people at my broker's office - some old guy dressed in work clothes and driving a beat-up pickup truck came in late one night just before closing to deposit some securities. The staff was curious so after he left they looked up his holdings - he was worth more than $6 million (and that was just what he had on deposit with them.) Another was my former landlord - an immigrant who had numerous real estate holdingsin an upscale East coast town. I checked his holdings at the assessor's office - $3.5 million (years ago.)    None of these people, I'm sure - would meet Eker's profile of a \\"millionaire's mind\\". But they have millions and know how to hold on to it.    There's no formula, guaranteed path or state of mind to making a large amount of money. Some of Eker's points are part of it - but by no means the whole. For a number of people that I know who did create substantial net worth - it was something of a byproduct of what they were doing - and more than a few admitted to me they could not have predicted it. In many cases, they were the right person, at the right place, at the right time (preparation meets opportunity?) So much for the blueprint.    So read Eker's book with the intent of perhaps not falling into some of the mental traps he points out - but don't get the idea you can stop there. There's a lot more to wealth creation than he lets on. The right frame of mind is only part of it.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I have heard many albums in which the artist decided to go in a new direction. I always hated them at first, but once I got used to the change in style, I loved them. Such is the case here. If you only like hard rock, and not hip hop, then you will probably hate it. However if you like the fusion between pop/hip-hop and serious rock lyric writing/performing, you will get used to this album and love it just as much as any other CC related one.

B001FB55MG|2.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie as was my kid.  I mean it had a great storyline,  and the trailers looked good, but thats about it for the good stuff.  I thought the character Sandler played was a boorish, rude and lazy person.  I don't see where it is funny for him to shut the door in a womans face (twice) when she is being nice to him and talking to him.  Yeah, let's teach our little boys to be rude.  Sandler has to take care of his sister's kids for a few days and he do so in a careless manner and expects others to pick up his slack.  He wasn't the type of character that you rooted for and had hope for.  Of course, the movie writers make the  pretty girl fall for him even though he has been nothing but rude to her. Ugh, disgusting.  Yes, I realize it is a movie, but when the main character isn't endearing or funny, it isn't a fun movie to watch.  The kids and supporting actresses were fine, so that was the only glimmer of light in the movie.  What a waste of a potential good story.  And Mr. Sandler, please learn what makes good humor, rudeness doesn't.

B001GKJ2FW|3.0|This is an international hit musical brought to the silver screen or some sort of Blu-Ray screen. Many screen adoptions fall short of the actual play; yet occasionally they surpass the play because they can show things such as facial expressions and outdoor locations that cannot be seen in a play. Unlike the stage play, this film also is relying on many major actors. Unique and gutsy is the fact that the actors themselves sing the songs.<br /><br />This is definitely a musical. The storyline and dialog are used to glue the songs together. The film is cute entertaining and has a balanced ending where everyone gets what he or she wants, even if he or she does not know what he or she wants. That is what we want.<br /><br />Be sure to view the extras, as it is the extras that add depth to the presentation.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0790731452 Mars Attacks! ~  Pierce Brosnan]]
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I am a fan of the old and new Doctor Who series.  The thing to keep in mind is that this is a toy, so don't expect metal parts, superb simulated sound, and such.  It's plastic with batteries and a light.  However, once you accept it for what it is, it's great!  I love just fooling around with it.  Pretending to fix people's problems with it, especially with people who have no idea what it is (confusing them like the Doctor would, and just smile and be on my way).  I use it at shows and such like people would use a lighter.  And if I ever need help seeing something in the dark, it does come in handy.    It's not the most durable thing, it's all plastic.  The UV pen works great, but keep in mind the size of it's ink well, and it's hard to get a replacement, so use it sparingly.  The sound is of course low quality, and the two sounds it makes are very hard to notice any difference (there is some if you listen to it carefully).  However, it's not that loud, so it doesn't annoy people too much.  The light itself is very good, but just don't point it at anyone's eyes (UV light).    Now, there is a little problem with it.  When I got it, it was hard to keep the thing on.  It felt like there was something keeping me from pressing the buttons down.  When I opened it up to where you put the batteries, I noticed that the plastic thing holding them is right next to the 2 buttons, and that cover was sticking up on the edge when screwed on (because the pressure caused it to bed).  What I did was carefully sand down that plastic with a small piece of sand paper(a nail file would work too) so it was level with the rest of the tube.  Then I had no problems with it.  Don't know if it was only mine, but it's an easy adjustment.    All in all for this low priced toy, I love it.  Just don't expect too much, and you will love it too.
B000654YK6|5.0|Hype really captured the time well. Seattle was a magical place to live in the late 80's and early 90's. There definitely was a greater creative energy that took over the town although most of the \\"Grunge\\" thing and the label itself was created by Hollywood. Seattle has always been a city that doesn't pay much attention to what other city's cultures are up to. We live under our own overcast (literally). We've always had a great music scene. It doesn't always jive with what Hollywood is paying attention to. But in the early 90's it did and they came and swept up a few of our more prolific bands. Suddenly the world was wearing flannels and wool hats and Doc Martens, even if they lived in 90 degree weather. Go figure. If you want to know a little more about the scene, this movie is a great place to start and see the life that inspired great bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. You will see rare early footage of Layne and Kurt. Hopefully, you'll also take the time to check out a few of the other bands featured in the movie, bands that didn't quite experience the same success but made some amazing music nonetheless.

B000OIOGDA|1.0|I bought the Riverdance collection so I would have all the material on dvds.  But none of the disks were made in England.  They would not play on my Denon dvd player.  So I returned the Riverdance dvd collection and asked for my money back.
0553266306|2.0|I bought this book on hopes that it would be a gripping read about spies, sabotage, and suspense.  This novel moved very slowly and was bogged down with French details, too many acronyms, and weak, uninteresting plot development. On one level, the Jackal's character was interesting, mysterious and somewhat dynamic, but this novel dragged and was such a slow read.  Look elsewhere for a page-turner.  Ken Follett's Eye of the Needle is a far better choice in this genre; now that was a fantastic, gripping spy novel.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I purchased this series because I had read all of the books and LOVED them.  The attraction with the books were that they were all well written and did not have a lot of explicit sex scenes.  This series more than makes up for the lack in the books!  If they could have followed the basic story as written, it would have been much better.  As it is, unless you have a voyeuristic personality, this series is NOT for you.
0061245097|5.0|I hated the ending of the first book and the beginning of this one. But as soon as he came back, the action picked up and they were both happy again. Loved the character build up and the new characters she added to the story.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I'm laughing as I'm typing this review because Manson's music is really freaky!  When this album came out, I was 11 years old- but growing up with older siblings, I used to sneak into their rooms and borrow their worlds.<br /><br />This album used to give me the creeps.  I used to fall asleep in my sister's room listening to the melodies and weird background noises, his distrubing and screaming voice, the pounding of the bass and drums... and I'd have nightmares!<br /><br />But, by the time 14 years old came around, I was stealing this album from my sister who had long forgotten it, and it has followed me around ever since.  For 10 years I've been loving Manson's \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" cd.  It is not mainstream, by any means, (well, besides the track overplayed: \\"Beautiful People\\") but the songs and lyrics are so easy to listen to.  Manson is definitely a mastermind in his craft at this stage of his life.  The album is interesting, therapeutic, alarmingly interspective and so astonishing!<br /><br />His lyrics speak the TRUTH.  He is not afraid of what people think of him.  He is not hindered by the public \\"eye\\" and not afraid to tell [scream] his worldly findings to us.  And, boy, am I listening!<br /><br />I love love love this album.  Even some of you techno geeks may like it because the bass is that darned good!  Don't be put off by the album art.  It's Manson's \\"artist\\" version of himself.  His music, though, speaks loudly enough.
B000002L68|5.0|Another review of this landmark album is certainly not necessary but I figured on occasion of it's 25th anniversary that I'd write one anyway. When this came out I was 7 years old. Seven! I didn't know what \\"masturbating in a magazine\\" meant. Who cared! The music was incredible. It was all we heard on the radio, we also had the cassette tape and we played it incessantly on hot 1984 summer's days in my Mom's Datsun. I still remember listening to \\"When Doves Cry\\" and the smell of the leather seats on hot days. We continued to hear it certainly into 1985 and the album really has never left me. It's one of those ones you can't imagine life without and one you can't leave out of your childhood memories. Simply put I was listening to this when I was 7, 17, 27 and I'll be listening to it forever.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|How can anyone with ANY taste or intelligence  give this pile five stars? Or four? Or three?  It has virtually nothing to recommend it: a  gaseous, overblown mess of a movie with a trite   story, bad acting (Kidman especially), worse   dialogue, and a tone that shifts from comedy   that is not funny to drama that is not dramatic.    What was Luhrmann thinking?  The point is, he   wasn't and he can't. He cannot tell a story much  less put an intelligent thought on film.  He is a  maker of bad pastiches, a repackager of Holly-  wood trash. \\"Australia\\" is an even more shameful   collage than his unspeakable \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" that  piece of emetic kitsch.  But at least \\"Moulin Rouge\\"  didn't pretend to make profound statements.  Among its   many, many other sins, \\"Australia\\"  tries to say   something very important and moving about Aboriginal   culture. All Luhrmann can manage is the tired and  stupid PC cant that indigenous culture is ALWAYS  superior to white European culture. This is the level  of insight one finds here. And it is as related to real  thought as the rest of this sad and sorry epic of  excess is to real art.

B00004RFFS|3.0|I really loved loved the movie itself.Great actors, One of Tom Cruise's finest (seriously). The actors were really captiviting, the special effects blended in beautifully.  Buttttttttt  1. I got special features when I pressed play   2. The face of the background when there is someone in the foreground is blurry.  3.Very poor quality of images, you get wavy vcr-like lines get irritating at one point (e.g wavy lines on brad pitt's faces). If you buy it, go for HD    Maybe some won't mind, but I would have liked to have been warned as I expected good quality as promised

0553582038|4.0|I originally planned to write a review of the first book only and then proceed to write about the second one and the rest in the consecutive manner. But when I started to write about the Game of Thrones, I realized that, knowing the entire published story, I do not perceive \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" as the series of books. I rather see it as a whole, extremely complex although not yet completed story.      The very beginning of the series gives us the impression of a good, but rather classical fantasy novel and, apart from a little twist in narration, we do not expect anything unusual. But after finishing the fourth book in the series, we cannot help but ask. What kind of game does the author play with us?      The multiple points of view narration was a good idea from the very beginning and it's taking the right direction now, when we have the chance to hear the voice of some of the most hated characters in the novel. Everyone has their reason and their morality, though the latter seems to be endangered with extinction. Martin does not try to please the reader by making his characters noble and heroic. Nor does he have mercy of us when he makes another twist in a plot, crushing our hopes and destroying the perfect picture we have already made in our minds. He breaks the conventions easily, playing on our feelings and feeding on our constant disappointment. And yet we love him, or rather love to hate him, admiring the mind full of wicked ideas, but furious that he outwitted us once again.     There are some darker sides, and we sometimes think that he finally lost himself in the maze of intrigues, driven by the need to overcomplicate everything. There is a constant risk that the next step will be fatal, both for the characters and for the book itself. But it is this feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty that draws us toward the series. And even if we do not approve of the author's decisions, we are always willing to give the book another chance.  (Agnieszka Engel)
B0015DROBO|5.0|I don't usually read thrillers but picked up this one because it sounded quirky and fun. I sure am glad that I took a chance. It proved a page-turner from the start and had me guessing about the whereabouts of Harriet Vanger, the mystery of the story. I guessed wrong but won't go into detail here for those who haven't yet read the book. I found Mikael Blomkvist an interesting main character but even he could not compete with the captivating Lisbeth Salander, the 24-year-old tattooed computer hacker. I hope she appears in his other two books. This is a book in translation but it reads like literary fiction and the storyline never becomes incredulous. Can't wait for Larsson's next offering. Too bad he died so soon.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|Good story. Lots of action. Very good character development. Will probably read the rest of the series.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I admit it.  I had never heard of Mastodon until this year, when I saw an ad for a new album called \\"Crack the Skye\\".  Interested by the fantastic artwork and 4 star review from Rolling Stone magazine, I picked up a copy.  Not only was I extremely blown away, I was mad at myself for not discovering this band sooner.  \\"Crack The Skye\\" is a masterpiece of not only metal but music in general.  It's heavy, melodic, bizarre, trippy and unlike anything out in music today.  They have a lot of metal influences going on but the two biggest influences might come as a shock:  Genesis and Rush.  This album owes more to The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Hemispheres as it does Francis the Mule or anything from Lamb of God.  And after hearing interviews with the band, they really have captured the classic rock sound they were going for. From \\"Oblivion\\" to \\"The Last Baron\\", all of the songs need to be heard together and not separate yet can be heard on their own as well.  The concept is so out there yet Brent Hinds, Troy Sanders, Bill Kelliher and Brann Dailor somehow pull it off with amazing precision, face melting vocals and shredding that was thought to be dead long ago.  It's one of the greatest albums of the 21st century so far and should rank up with the great prog masters of the past.  Simply put, Mastodon will set the world ablaze with this master work.
0060594896|3.0|Jack Canfield provides a lengthy book discussing many principles required for success in any endeavor.  The book is filled with examples, an abundance of relevant quotes, and short chapters providing emphasis to each principle.<br /><br />Canfield is an interesting writer, and he adds a number of very good principles that would serve to assist anyone seeking to take better control of their lives.  He has clearly given a lot of thought and research to all of his principles, and inside the book are a few gems that could make a significant impact on one's life.  One of the downsides to the material is that it tends to be very longwinded, providing far more explanation than is needed to convey its messages.  Many self help books cover the vast majority of what Canfield discusses which results in the book mostly offering a repeat of well known self help ideas.  The book regrettably went well off course in its finance section by offering vauge and dated ideas such as start a website, make more money by selling things on the side, and other non descriptive notions that did not match tone of the rest of the book.<br /><br />Canfield could have easily provided a very profound book by editing the content and sticking with his most profound ideas; instead it feels as though he filled the book with every possible principle he could think of.  It is difficult to know whether his recommendation of things like joining a network marketing company are a shameless plug to sell more books to those folks or an unfitting idea poorly mixed into the book.  If one only was able to read a single self help book, The Success Principles would be helpful; however, there are better books available on the topic that have both original content and a more efficiently delivered message.
1400063515|5.0|I normally would turn away from any book dealing with economics and statistics.  My husband, a physicist, was listening to it on CDs and I would hear bits and pieces when I happened to be in his car.  What I heard intrigued me, and I ended up listening to the entire book.  WOW!  This explains so much of why I have often thought economists make no sense at all, and why, as a classicist, I loved Plato's literature but not his logic.

B0012GTZFC|5.0|This book is now among the top three books that have become required reading for all of my consulting clients. The information on how to determine the stages people are in at work (and ultimately in life) is easy to understand and the steps to take to move forward are very implementable.<br /><br />Superbly written. Tribal Leadership is a must have in the tool box of any coach or consultant.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like so many others, I just came upon this show and sequel movie many years after their release.  I watched the entire series free on hulu, but am still going to buy it because I enjoyed it so much and know I will want to watch it over and over - and because I want to support the show.  I realize I'm about the 3000th person to give a 5-star rating, but it's such an amazing show I just had to add as well.  I'm not sure why some of the negative reviews say the acting was poor, because I thought it was great - and not just great for sci fi standards, which are notoriously low.  I thought the storyline was enjoyable and believable (other than perhaps the ability to terraform hundreds of moons with no discernable difference in gravity between them).  And any concerns that one character is a companion (prostitute) - get over it.  There is no nudity, and her job is referenced as very respectable for the time - it is a different universe and culture, after all.  I would (and have been) highly recommend this show to anyone.
0930289234|4.0|The Greatest Graphic Novel of All Time, they say.  Indeed, one of the greatest `novels' of the 20th Century according to Time magazine.  Well, I think Time was being a bit generous, but THE WATCHMEN certainly is deeper than what one will normally find in the genre, and one can certainly spend time in less interesting pursuits than reading the twelve chapters that bring everything together.<br /><br />Set in an alternative American history in which costumed adventurers have given the U.S. an edge in the Cold War, but are viewed with deep suspicion and ambivalence by the public, THE WATCHMEN explores the psychological horizon of such heroes against the backdrop of a familiar, if altered, history.  When a few adventurers are killed or in some other way neutralized, Rorschach, a deeply disturbed renegade, starts pursuing what he believes to be an intended plot to kill former masked heroes.  He enlists the help of Nite Owl, his old partner, who views his past adventures as the immature manifestation of a largely wasted life.<br /><br />The truth is far more complicated, both personally and politically.  Alan Moore, The Watchmen's creator, uses the genre to explore terrain that, although more meaningful during the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union still existed, is not completely outdated today.<br /><br />History, however, has not been exceptionally kind to the interpretation of this book.  In fiction, the world's smartest man, despite years of reflection, cannot escape the conclusion that the two world powers, given their trajectories, will ultimately come to blows and destroy the world.  As someone who came of age in the `80s, I remember this perspective as all too common back then.  But events proved this view wrong.  We just needed Ronald Reagan, who recognized the inherent weakness of communism and exploited it until it imploded.  Reagan's mark on the world stage makes large chunks of THE WATCHMEN basically superfluous in retrospect.<br /><br />Further, although Moore portrays one of two clearly right-wing characters as morally degenerate (The Comedian) and the other as, for lack of a specific diagnosis, borderline schizoid (Rorschach), it takes the left-wing, pyramid worshiping, vegetarian to wipe out millions out of his `concern' for mankind and in pursuit of his utopian vision.  What a hoot!<br /><br />Significantly over-rated by fans of graphic novels, no doubt to convince themselves that the genre is meatier than it really is, THE WATCHMEN is nonetheless an interesting read.  Moore took the superhero story into unexplored territory and wrote an interesting story while out there.  Just don't believe all the hype.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Incredibly underrated show. Love the dvds ... it's one of those shows you can watch over and over again :)
B001UREJWM|4.0|I think this is a great album from the masters. i would just like if on their next one Vinnie would get a little more energy in his drumming. he's still a solid drummer but faster songs like tv crimes, turn up the night, and die young would be greatly appreciated.
B001QB9H10|3.0|Another great Transporter film. Hot chicks, explosions, fist fights cool cars. Love it love it. I'm sure the feminist and tree huggers and alternative lifestyle people will hate. But to heck with those artsy fartsies. The film has great chase scenes drugs, gun fights, fist fights and a cool villians.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's key is a book written in present day about a woman who is researching an event that took place during the holocaust.  It flips back and forth between present day and during WWII.  Sarah is a little Jewish girl who locked her younger brother in a cupboard during a roundup with promises to let him out when it is safe.  She doesn't realize that she and her parents will be taken away and she will be unable to unlock the door.  It was heartbreaking to read... and the guilt that followed this little girl...      Like other readers, I found the historical story line more interesting than the present day one.  This is a well written book and I highly recommend it to you if the story sounds intriguing.  If you don't like reading about WWII, then look elsewhere.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Gran Torino is outstanding, the best job Eastwood has done to date.<br /><br />This is a very carefully constructed film. Eastwood has to come off as a crotchety old curmudgeon, and that's easy acting for him. Within the first 20 minutes his curmudgeondom is established. The tough part for any film is that transition when the curmudgeon becomes likeable or human. Eastwood did a fabulous job at making that transition perfectly. His motivation for the relationship with his neighbors is 100% completely beleiveable. I bought it, and I've seen hundreds of films where I never bought it. The film easily climbs this hill and then rides down for the next hour to where the film's climax is established. The first indication of film trouble is at the construction office - after Walt and Tao leave the construction office, the camera focuses on the construction boss for about 10 or 15 seconds too long. It's a beat played too long. Eastwood made a few tiny errors at the final transition point, where he turns from the likeable guy with a heart to the vigilanty. The big misstep for me was when Tao comes over to Walt's house and Tao says let's go kill these guys. The dialog didn't work well, there was some odd editing, and the cage thing was just a bit too drawn out. There was symbolism here, that was good, but the pacing / editing was just jarring compared to the rest of the film.<br /><br />The most remarkable part of this film - almost every movie (bar masterpieces) have this very akward time around the midpoint of the film. Gran Torino did not have that problem, Eastwood delayed the strange transition to 7/8 of the way through the movie. An odd choice on his part.<br /><br />Blu-Ray is amazing. The sound effects are so real. Pool balls knocking together in the left rear channel sounded like they were in the house and real. It just goes on and on. Sound was so well done in this film. The images on the other hand were not so special. It was well filmed, but sadly the contrast was a bit flatter than I would have liked.<br /><br />One last bad part, turn off the sound at the last scene. Clint Eastwood performs the theme song and it's awful. No it's just plain pitiful. Don't listen, you will Van Gogh your ears if you do.<br /><br />One other odd piece, the Blu-Ray disc has almost no speical features. What is there, is lame. I mean really lame. Two pieces about the car (who really cares), and a piece about the Eastwood look. Some previews, and some nasty junk from Warner Brothers you have to sign up to get.<br /><br />Go ahead, buy this disc, it's really that good.bit flatter than I would have liked.<br /><br />One last bad part, turn off the sound at the last scene.

0307269752|5.0|This book is full of suspense, family drama, violence and a little romance...something for just about any reader.  It was the first time I'd read anything by the author and I look forward to reading more!  The main character is a man who, career-wise, has fallen into hard times and agrees to try to solve the mysterious disappearance of a teenage girl many years previously.  All in all, I thought it was well written, good paced and enjoyed the ending!
1591841992|5.0|First Amazon purchase.  Super please.  Item is textbook for class and I got it really quick and in excellent condition.  Thanks!
0739341790|4.0|The recorded book proved a good dramatization of the novel.  A woman and a man shared the reading. Choudhury assumed the female narrators and Naidu the men's.  Their light accents authenticated the Indian-American heritage of the storytellers.  Other language from India, Italy, and elsewhere they rendered well.  A few paragraphs made me stop the recording and reread what preceded. Either my mind had wandered or the reader rushed over the words.  I listened with a copy of Unaccustomed Earth before me.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Everyone seems upset about the special edition computerized effects that Lucas added to these films, but these ARE his creations, so let him do as he pleases.  Lucas is currently modifying the first film for the next \\"Even More Specialer Edition\\" which is coming soon in 2010, and after speaking with him directly, I am very excited about the new changes!    In the upcoming release of \\"A New Hope,\\" Greedo will not only shoot first, but he shoots every creature in the bar scene, except Han.  Han will no longer fire his weapon, because Greedo fatally shoots himself in this version.     Lucas has also decided to convert all Stormtroopers into pro-football players, and being a lifelong fan of the Houston Oilers, he has chosen their defunct uniforms as the model by which his squadron of computer goons will work with.  I feel the super-imposed uniform colors will contrast perfectly with the Empire's lifeless gray and black uniforms, as well as making the old stormtroopers' boring white outfits a thing of the past, just as Lucas had envisioned originally but was unable to do in the 70's when the Oilers refused to allow their uniforms to be \\"commercialized\\" in such a manner.  Bet you didn't know that, did ya?      Chewbacca will be replaced by Jar Jar Binks, in a move motivated soley by the immense popularity of Jar Jar, and the fact that wookies have always been considered the least popular characters amongst true fans of the Lucas logic.  The original Chewbacca outfit has since been destroyed, so forget about looking online for this collector's item because it's gone.      The Milenium Falcon has been converted to a hot air baloon, in order to lengthen the escape scene from Mos Eisley.  This was secretly Lucas's favorite moment in the series, and he has plotted to expand the run time of the scene for years.  The hot air baloon will take approximately 20 minutes to fully inflate, and an additional 15 minutes to lift off.  I personally cannot wait to see this cinematic triumph for myself!     George asked me not to divulge any more information, but I'm sure you're all excited for these new changes!!  I have pre-ordered my personal copy already, and you should do the same!
0345495004|2.0|Just finished discussing Loving Frank for book club.  It is well researched, in terms of facts.  But the characters' actions were so scandalous, and regarding Mamah's parental instincts, fairly inconceivable in any time (but especially back then!) that it commands the historical fiction author to really shine a light on the motivations and shaping backgrounds of both parties to make the book a worthwhile endeavor.  The book club consensus was that wasn't quite achieved by Nancy Horan.  The other serious problem I personally had with this book is that the ending is in no way foreshadowed, leaving the unsuspecting reader shocked and disturbed without warning, and with very little wrap-up regarding the remaining characters' reactions to the final event.  The only book club discussion it generated was along the lines of 'people shouldn't have affairs', and 'how could a mother leave preschool-age children for two years?'...but once we got done with that bashing, and a little bit of discussion about the limit to women's choices in the early 20th century, there were no deeper truths except for wondering why the characters would behave so badly.  This book should have given us a feel for the possible answers to that question, leading to some kind of compassion for the characters, but I feel it stops short of achieving that goal.  It may be there just wasn't enough historical information, but that is where the fictional license must take over to create a solid read.
1433503794|5.0|I have used several different study Bibles over the years. One of my favorites is the New American Standard Study Bible. This new ESV Study Bible has set a new standard in in depth study, excellent notes and a well-balanced presentation of different theological views -- just enjoy the opening notes to Revelation.  The fact that the complete Bible will be available to you on the internet is a further advantage. I personally like the option of keeping my personal study notes on the internet linked to each of the verses. Nice feature.  This Bible is not perfect -- the note part that is -- but it is definitely one you want to keep close by for your daily study of GOD's holy Word.
0307269752|4.0|I have had great difficulty finding a Scandinavian mystery writer to like, so I had pretty much given up.  But this book changes things.  A bit too long, but the story is quite good and it reads easily.  I liked it so much that I got the second book from the UK and will follow up this fall getting the third from the UK as well.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I have just begun this book (I am about half way through the second narrative), and so am not posting a review of the novel's content or style...I anticipate good things.<br /><br />I am, however, disappointed in the text's formatting for the Kindle edition. Many sentences are missing end punctuation, and many words run together with no spacing in between. I haven't run into this kind of poor formatting in other Kindle books. This is low quality work from the publisher.
1847245560|4.0|The first book of the trilogy was quite good.  This one is better.  While again the book is a bit too long (the first 100 pages could be left out), you get through them pretty fast, and then things get interesting.  The Salander character is compelling, such that I couldn't wait and ordered the book from the UK.  It was worth it!  I'll again go to the UK for the third book this fall.  Great series.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I love this movie.  I held off on seeing it for a while because I had heard about people getting motion sick in the theater, and I'm pretty prone to that, but I had no such problems watching this on DVD.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it's because I've always liked the big-monster-attacks-city movie concept, but had never really seen it done that well.  This movie just nailed it.  You really get the feeling of what it would be like to be in the city while an unknown creature is causing destruction.  I know a few people who've seen this film and who didn't like it as much as I did, so this may be the kind of movie that is just for certain types and not others.  Then again, I think most fans of action/thriller/sci-fi type movies would really enjoy this one.  I bought the DVD, which is something I don't do very often anymore unless I really enjoy a film and want to come back to it a lot.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|It was the TV commercial that got me interested. And then I listened to the snippets available on Amazon.  So I bought the whole album.  I have listened several times to it and will now be buying more of this exciting artist's albums.  Hard to believe I'd ever be a fan of the violin.

We were having problems in our marriage but thanks to this book and counseling we are back on track. These 5 languages if you understand yours and your spouses make things smoother and you can appreciate where your spouse is coming from and vice versa. A must have for any couple, whether a new relationship, old relationship...a \\"In Love\\" stage or on the verge of divorce...READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!!
0975991477|5.0|The Biology of Belief does something not many have been able to do, place spirit (energy) and science together in a synergistic way.  The spirit/energy work that goes on in alternative medicine now seems rooted in state of the art science.  The implications of this for healthcare reform seem clear on the one hand while realizing the traditional way of looking at medicine may take longer to change.  Just the idea that beliefs/perceptions actually determine our lives is exciting and grants power to the individual.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is the best show to come to cable TV ever.  The characters are well played and the theme is edgy and relatable.  I hope they give Aaron Paul his due this year at the Emmys as he is soooooo good in this part.  Cheers to all involved in making such a compelling show!

B001W63DX2|5.0|OMG I actually got TEARS during some parts of this, b/c it's so amazing to sit there at 35 years old thinking, \\"Man, here I am watching the same great band and listening to the same great songs, some of them from when I was like TWELVE(!) and still being touched by them in the same way\\".  All these years later and I still get chills when the recitation portion of \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" concludes, and Steve's bouncy bass line kicks in.  I'm getting chills just writing about it, actually.  Maiden have been at the top of my list since I bought Live After Death after seeing it on Friday Night Concerts on MTV so very long ago, and there they remain.  The concert performances presented here take you right back to that place again, replicating many exciting facets of the historic World Slavery Tour, mixing thm in with all of the other eras for a bombastic amalgamation of Maiden glory.  Truly something special.  The film is presented in the style of Sam Dunn's other masterpiece, \\"Metal: A Headbanger's Journey\\", and is every bit as captivating and exciting to watch.  I can't say enough about this entire package.  Maiden have not let me down even once in 25 years (yes, even through the \\"dark times\\" of the X-Factor and Virtual X), and this package is further testament to their commitment to quality.
B000063COX|5.0|i never realy liked this album.back when came out on vinyl it just sounded cheap. even when released on cd, sounded no better. why the 5 star rating? well when the remastered version came out, there was a big improvement.remastering the maiden cataloge helped this release the most.you can here the music the way it should be. remember this was pre martin birch producing the next 7 cd's(not counting \\"live after death\\")
B000002UA9|5.0|Concerning \\"Love Me Do,\\" Andy White plays drums on the single; Ringo plays drums on the album version. Speaking of Ringo, I get a kick out of the idea that he sings Boys are \\"a bundle of joy.\\" It's a good song. I'm not surprised that they gave it to Ringo. It seemed like he usually got to sing the silly tune on each album. Not that \\"Boys\\" is silly. It's merely funny that Ringo is belting out a tune that was written from the perspective of a female. I guess the fellas had to get one in there for the girls. \\"P.S. I Love you,\\" and \\"Love Me Do\\" were written while the guys were still in school. Paul wrote \\"Love Me Do\\". And after that, John was in depression from his mom being hit and killed by a car. So he didn't contribute much to \\"P.S. I Love You.\\" And this was a few years before the album was even recorded. Before they were signed. Before they were called the Beatles.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|the fact that the could put out a cd this good this far into their career is unbelievable. maiden still kicking after all these years, makes me look foward to their next cd.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Metallica is one of the last great \\"huge\\" bands. What I mean is they never have to put out another album, but could continue to sell out football stadiums. All they have to do is perform songs from their first four albums and 50,000 would show up. \\"Death\\" is a good album that does signal somewhat of a return to what we want and expect from the band.    Musical taste changes with age. When RTL and MOP were released within two years of each other, it was music that made me want to drive off of a mountain. It was that intense. However, I also attribute some of that to being 18 years old. \\"Death\\" has a sound that harkens back to the '80s; it's the sound that machine guns and sand paper make if you could rub them together.     The gripe here is that it's too long. Although Justice was long, it seemed  more epic at the time. In 1990 CDs were not 75 minutes long. That made it interesting. Many collections now go too long. I understand getting the most for your money, but how about just putting out the eight best songs by dumping the instrumental and cutting out a weak link.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Feel like i should write 2 reviews. 1 for the documetary and another for the concert dvd. both are great. but i guess the concert has more replay value , so it's good it's included.This package is outstanding on so many levels. The first disc is an excellent celebration documenting the historic Somewhere back in time tour. This on its own would be worth five stars, but to back it up with another disc showing each song from the tour from venues around the world just makes this outstanding value.
0312360266|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this book.  I'm a big fan of the Twilight series and other sci fi/fantasy.  Now, full disclosure -- I am a grown up, so what the heck am I doing reading a teen novel?  But you know, good writing is good writing no matter who the intended audience is.  Unfortunately, the writing in this novel is so self-conscious and awkward that it's actually uncomfortable to read at times.  I've actually cringed at certain passages.  It's no match for Twilight, Potter or Golden Compass.  Sorry, I wouldn't recommend.
0375758992|5.0|I found this book so interesting and it was written in such a personal, tangible way. I first met Bo in Jackson Wyoming in the mid 1990's after she had left Zambia. We were waitresses together at the Snake River Grill in Jackson Hole. She had a vibrant smile and a beautiful spirit, must be the African spirit! I would never have known the childhood that forged the young adult she became. She was a special woman. What a history! I remember Bo was writing a book, to see her realize her efforts in such a grand way is incredible and deserved. This was one of my favorite \\"reads\\".            -Delia Gelinas
0307346617|5.0|The whole \\"zombie\\" part of the story is secondary to the plot.  Yes, there was a weird contagious disease that created a walking-dead, and spread very quickly and widely.    What would REALLY happen if there was a world-wide plague?  What forms would the chaos take?  Who tries to profiteer off it?  Who tries to hole-up and go into survival mode?  Who actually makes it through?  Any why?    This book is the first-hand accounts (interviews) with survivors from all parts of the world.  Some of them are famous, like the guy who invented the \\"zombie cure drug\\", or the guy who put together the plan for survival.  Others are just people who witnesses key parts of the books history.  Like when the first stories hit the news, when the break-out was finally \\"accepted\\", etc.    Very well done, really shows the extreme chaos and horror - most of it caused by the living - when the system completely breaks down.
B000ELJBAA|4.0|David Gilmour's \\"About Face\\" is a glimpse of what the \\"Final Cut\\" could have been, had only David Gilmour some input on the final product. This was released at about the same time as Roger Waters' solo album \\"The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking\\", and I find the Gilmour solo project more listenable. Song highlights on \\"About Face\\" include \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\", \\"Murder\\", \\"Blue Light\\" (even though some Floyd fans seem to hate this one), and \\"Until We Sleep\\". I only wish that Waters & Gilmour had been able to pool their creative resources together during this time, as the 1970's Floyd material proved superior in my opinion when the band collaborated. Alas, it was not to be. Although the Pink Floyd reincarnation of the late 80's and 90's was decent, one only wonders what could have happened. I still like this album, although it is a bit dated - but that doesn't mean it's bad.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|First off, I'm a huge fan of FFVII and consider it among the best of the series (the top spot still belongs to 3/6, however). The original movie expands on Cloud's story and shows us what's become of the world of FFVII after the events of the game's climax. But what it did was leave a lot of questions unanswered with a somewhat shaky plot, despite the jaw-dropping visual effects and CGI.    This movie was made for fans, pure and simple. And if one has never played the game, it's not going to make much sense to you. That said, the graphics still hold up very well despite the original film being nearly 4 years old. The added scenes are a welcome addition, particularly the highway chase scene and the final fight between Cloud and Sephiroth. Even some of the soundtrack pieces have been remixed and rearranged, with some new additions as well. The new music is relatively minor, but sharp-eared fans may recognize some familiar tunes taken from the game. Nobuo Uematsu does great work.    The plot has been expanded to include more background on Denzel (whom I wondered what was the point of in the original film) and Cloud's activities prior to the main events of the movie. The debilitating effects of the geostigma are seen more clearly as well, and it helps the viewer identify more with the victims' desperation in going along with the villains in the hope of a cure. Extended scenes with supporting characters like the Turks are a nice touch.    Cloud, to his credit, hasn't just been moping around all this time being all emo, as some have complained about, but has been searching for a cure (though without success). And to those who do complain; the whole point of his character here is that he still blames himself for Aeris's death and that he's afraid to let anyone get too close to him for fear that he won't be able to save them in the end like he failed to save Aeris.    Still, there are some problems with this director's cut. Some scenes drag on too long (particularly the dialogues with Rufus and Tifa), or are poorly edited (inter-spliced with other scenes for a jarring chronology). The pacing of the middle of the movie becomes bogged down by these scenes, and the angst of our hero does become rather tiresome even to diehard fans (even if Cloud gets over it at the end). The action, while crazy and over the top, can be enjoyable if chaotic and eye-twitch inducing, requiring additional viewings to catch what's happening.    All in all, this film is what the original movie should have been. If director Nomura can work on his editing and dialogue, I'm sure his future films will be much improved over this effort. On a final note, the choice of song during the Cloud motorcycle scenes at the end credits was fairly blah as far as J-pop goes. I'm not sure why they decided to change it as the song Calling from the original was much better suited to those scenes (it sounded much more to me like an open road song rather than that new J-pop song).
B0014127BO|4.0|Unlike the dyed -in-the-wool Adams fans who said they expected more, we were very pleased with this album. It had good balance across the tracks, was very listenable, and did not not become tiring to us in repeated play time.    Based on this experience we would not hesitate to explore more of his music.
B00004VWHI|4.0|\\"The Legend of 1900\\" is one of my keepers. It is an unusual movie with some fantastic music. I especially enjoyed the piano duel between the main character T.D. Lemon, \\"1900,\\" played by Tim Roth, and \\"Jelly Roll\\" Morton, played by Clarence Williams III. This scene alone is worth the price of the movie--and then some.     The story has a decidedly Italian flavor or style, given it by writer and director, Giuseppe Tornatore, which adds to its uniqueness. Use of the \\"F\\" word is one example, but it is used with a special meaning, as if dismissive of all convention. A few other examples: the musical description of various \\"odd characters,\\" passengers described in music by Lemon; the joy of seeing the Statue of Liberty, by the immigrants who shout joyfully, \\"America!\\"; the philosophical Italian peasant who talks at length with T.D. Lemon, \\"1900,\\" and then just happens to be the father of the beautiful girl played by Melanie Thierry who appears on a later voyage. The hauntingly beautiful piano tune Lemon creates after seeing the girl. All these things and more, give the movie its unique quality.    But as a whole, for me, there was a major flaw. The story was a tragedy but there was no need for it to be. The Tim Roth character had enough internal fortitude and a great talent to make it anywhere; and after meeting the girl, he was inspired to do so, to take the next step in his life and leave the ship. Instead he exhibited cowardice at the last moment, and for no good reason I could see. A very disappointing and unnecessary ending.

143915726X|5.0|I read this book on a road trip. I think I was crying on the first page or so.....but oh my goodness it was such a great book. I felt really drawn to all the characters. I would definitely recommend reading this book! I have read that the movie will have a different ending so I suggest (of course) to read the book first.
0316174483|5.0|I remember going to a craft festival when I was a child, and this lady had a booth there where she would take your finger, dip it onto a ink pad, stamp it onto a small piece of paper and ask you what your favorite animal was. Mine at the time was a pig, and she drew the cutest pig on my fingerprint and I still have that pig to this day!<br />My mom immediately went out and bought this book because we all wanted to do more for ourselves! It has the simplest of instructions, TONS of different things to draw on your fingerprints and is so much fun to do, even as an adult!<br /><br />You can create so much using just your fingerprints and a pen. Greeting cards, wrapping paper, ornaments, keepsakes, whatever!<br /><br />I will always love this book, and give it as a gift whenever I can.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|What can I say, love this movie!!  For summer blockbusters, this is our favorite so far.  Really liked all the action & the new characters, can't wait to own it on DVD!!
0765348276|4.0|At 62 many of us sort of wonder what the future holds for us. This story was an interesting fantasy about an alternative to the nursing home.
0385340990|4.0|I enjoyed the multiple voices of the book through the letters.  It kept me interested and involved me more in the story.  I especially enjoyed the character of Kit.  The book has me searching for histories on the Channel Islands and WWII now.
B000SZZIH2|3.0|I have read several reveiws and feel that this album falls in between the masterpiece category and piece of trash category.  I appreciate wilsons harmonies and use of various instruments, but I feel sometimes the music is contrived.  Sloop john B, God only knows, Wouln't it be nice are excellent.  The best thing about this album is that it was the start of what I consider one of the greatest rock masterpieces - the song Good Vibrations which is a perfect mix of the early pop beach boys and the artsy stuff
B00005MP58|5.0|What a wonderful way to enjoy Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" This adaptation is the closest I have ever seen to capturing the true feeling of the book. All other Pride and Prejudice movies do not even come close, especially the latest version from a few years ago. Terrible! Although a bit long, the series was necessary to give true detail to this memorable tale. The images are beautiful, the characters are flawless. Mrs. Bennett is just as I would imagine her, Mr. Bennett is wonderful as well. Darcy (Colin Firth) is the best and most handsome Darcy and does the character justice. Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) is beautiful and a great actress.  The only character who is a little off is Jane. I thought she should be more beautiful than Elizabeth, but her deameanor is correct. I could watch the series a thousand times and never get tired.
B001I8C498|5.0|The book was in great condition, had been described exactly as it was.  The estimated shipping date concerned me when I was ordering it, however my concerns were erased when it arrived in the early days of the estimated arrival date.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Was a great movie depicting the era of the Vietnam war.  It remade a lot of the Beatles' songs, doing an incredible likeness.  It made me fall in love with their songs again, along with the era.  I would highly recommend this movie to any music lover, especially to those who loved the Beatles.
B00003CY5J|4.0|In The Score, Robert DeNiro plays a jazz club owner, Nick, who sides as a safe cracker in Montrial. He is cautious, non-violent, subtle and smart. He wants  to retire, and is set up by his fence, Marlon Brando, on one last job. But the job is close to home, something Nick has vowed never to do.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays the guy who Brando wants Nick to partner with. Young and cocky, he poses as  a handicaped, mentally-slow janitor at the customs house the three bandits are trying to rob. There is the expected antaginism between the young buck and the old master, and the job gets more complicated. Eventually, through twists and turns, one outsmarts the other.<br /><br />This is a great thriller: tight and compact and dead on point. Norton is great as usual, and DeNiro makes a great choice by downplaying the criminal cleches of his character. Nick is sophisticated and complex and not nessasarly motivated by the thrill of the chase that most robbers are.<br />He runs a successful bussiness and, aside from being a robber, seems like a down to earth guy--not the type that would steel for the rush. It is great to wonder what is actually driving him to take such risks.<br /><br />The film also gets into some of the technical aspects of safe cracking, and shows how hard it is to be a theif. This adds a lot of texture to The Score.<br /><br />I do have one gripe with this film: I have Cerebal Palsy, and object to the way Norton portays his disabled alter-ego as the cute, dull muppet that everyone loves and babys. Even in our day and age, the public is still woefully ignorant about physical disabilites; think about racial stereotypes around 1955, and it is comperible. People still equate physical limits  with intellectual ones. I am not politcally correct and I don't mind good satire, or even a negative portrayal of a disabled person. But socially, we have not evolved to the point where people have shed their stereotypes of people with disabilities. We can't, yet, afford to have this kind of cleche out there without counterpoint. Plus, it would have been more interesting to have Norton make his disguise persona disabled but smart, and then have him turn the tables at the end.<br /><br />That said, this is a great film: I own it and am not about to throw it away, and I'd reccomended it on a asthetic basis if not a social one.without counterpoint.

B0026UV77C|3.0|-OVER-ALL-ALBUM-  Lyrics: 7/10  Music: 6/10  Originality: 5/10    * Ratings based on previous Placebo album expectations    Let me start by saying i have a wide range of music favorites. I collect (and regularly listen to) movie soundtracks and instrumental versions of songs, rock, alternative, j-rock, metal, rap, pop, folk, ect. I will most likely always like a song that has strings, piano, and guitar in it. But this album.....almost....has too much. The guitars have too many effects (to the point where it reminded me of a powerman 5000 guitar sound sometimes). I'm a sucker for great lyrics. Over-all i think this album is worth a listen if you're a die-hard placebo fan, so you can decide for yourself. It seems like maybe they experimented with a bit of Spanish-folk influenced horns and drumming which is admirable. It has its certain songs, aside from the singles 'Battle of the Sun' and 'For What It's Worth', that are good. I recommend 'Julien', 'Happy You're Gone', and 'Kings of Medicine'. If you're just getting into Placebo it would be good to start with 'Black Market Music','Without You I'm Nothing' or 'Meds'.    ________________________________  \\"Kitty Litter\\"  This song is pretty decent. It's not overly produced. Lyrics are kind of silly. It's a dance-y song (well yeah the lyrics kind of already say that).  ________________________________  \\"Ashtray Heart\\"  This song has the band singing in a different language, i would say it's Spanish or possibly french, but i'm leaning towards spanish. It's a neat song....too many chorus repeats towards the end....and it ends on a typical note.  ________________________________  \\"Battle for the sun\\"  Definitely still the best song on the album. The awkward drums in the beginning are awesome, and the drunken/worn-out way Molko sings the first few lines is perfect for the lyrics (which are a bit repetative, but it works for this song) The end of this song with the soaring vocals, keyboards, and strings is gorgeous. It progresses typically, but almost subtley (as compared to some of the other songs on the album). I feel like there's also a conclusion to this song, unlike a lot of the other songs on this album.  ________________________________  \\"For What it's worth\\"  I honestly don't really like this song...but i'd rather listen to it than a handful of the other songs on this album. It seems like they might've been trying to make another 'Special k' or 'Days Before you Came' single....but failed. It's WAY too pop-y, even for a placebo single. The lyrics are silly.  guess this was supposed to be an all out rock song, but it seems out of place with the other songs.  ________________________________  \\"Devil in the Details\\"  I don't have any feelings towards this song. neither good or bad. It's just a song.  ________________________________  \\"Bright Lights\\"  The guitar effect on this song (or keyboard not sure which it is in the intro) but it's unique. The chorus is kind of thought provoking. 'A heart that hurts, is a heart that works'. Just a simple song, reminds me of The Never-ending story for some reason.   ________________________________  \\"Speak in Tongues\\"  The intro is very cool, creepy-ish. Not much to the lyrics, i guess you could just call it a song to keep your spirits up or something. A solid song.  ________________________________  \\"Never-ending-why\\"  Definitely a rock song, which starts off hard, and softens in the middle and then builds back up, which kind of threw off the predicatable progression sequence on the other tracks. I actually started getting into this song the first time i listened to it, but 3/4 of the way through the brass horns or something became more prominent in the progression of the song, which was...weird, like some NOFX ska song. In conclusion this song makes me ask 'WHY?' to the horns. Neat keyboard loop in it giving it the feel of a clock ticking, time running out, or whatever.  ________________________________  \\"Julien\\"  This song has an eerie-techno sound in the beginning. It started to remind me of Brian Molko's guest appearances with Timo Maas (which i throughly enjoyed!) The lyrics are great, not repetitive. They're very honest. The guitar bridge towards the middle is a bit like 'Bulletprood Cupid' not exactly.    some stand-out lyrics:  'Just one more hit to make it right  But every one turns into seven  Now that's it's snowing in your brain  Even ten will not placate you  This ain't no cure for the pain  This avalanche will suffocate you'  ________________________________  \\"Happy you're gone\\"  This song is melodramtically emotional and the strings and keyboards are perfect for this songs lyrics and over-all feeling. But, on a down side the lyrics are repetitive for what i've come to expect of Brian Molko.  ________________________________  \\"Breathe Underwater\\"  Gets repetitive (seeing a trend here?) The song progresses in a typical fashion...but it doesn't catch you. I'm not really sure what it is about the song that doesn't catch you....but it could be that it's just predictable. Or perhaps it's the part in the lyrics where Molko's vocals take a turn down the Nsync route when he sings, \\"Hiding deep ins-I-yide!\\" You'll have to listen to the song to understand. 'Try to kill this song, Cause the melody's all wrong' to quote the lyrics.  ________________________________  \\"Come Undone\\"  another attempt at a good melodramtic song....i dunno, just didn't do it for me. The lyrics weren't amazing. Just another mediocre track.  ________________________________  \\"Kings of Medicine\\"  I do like this song. It's got an innocent irony to the music, given the lyrics which sound thought out and heartfelt. The song started out cheesy sounding to me, but you have to give it a chance to progress. Once again there are horns in this song, but it works. They didn't overproduce it with tons of guitars slamming their way through the peaceful introduction.
1416914307|5.0|This is a must read.  I LOVED the whole series.  You will get sucked into the world of Jace, Clary and Simon.  This series will hold your attention from the first page.  You will not get bored or want to put it down.  I would recomned buying all three of the mortal instruments series.  You want be un happy.  Buy all three books
B001E5FYS8|4.0|The spotlight customer review here on this page perfectly nails my feeling of the movie:  \\"Beneath the Thrill, a Lot of Sadness.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.  It takes an enormous ego to pull off what Philippe Petit did.  That combined with the hothouse environment required to plan and execute the WTC caper led to an irreparable rupturing of Petit's closest relationships, most notably with childhood friend, chief planner, right-hand man and unsung hero, Jean Louis Blondeau.  James Marsh's movie makes clear: No Blondeau, No Petit.  Blondeau's reaction to his passing of his friendship is real and still visceral: he breaks down in tears discussing it.  Post-film interviews make clear that 35 years on, the two remain on distant, untouching planes.  The rift is so hard that Blondeau needed to use a fake name to gain access to the Tribeca Film Festival (where \\"Man on Wire\\" made its US debut).<br /><br />It is Blondeau's involvement and post-WTC reaction - not Petit's crossing - that will stay with me long after my remembrance of this film fades.<br /><br />Marsh's film gains additional poignancy by focusing on the early-70s  construction of the Twin Towers.  It's hard not to get wistful and misty watching the workers hoisting the now-famous building skins into place.
B00000AFFF|2.0|At the outset:    I admire Elvis Costello tremendously. Burt Bacharach has written some incredible stuff over the years--some incredible radio music that I recall from when I was a kid. I even recall that full-page ad that appeared in Billboard to promote his first solo release, \\"Nicky\\". (?) The tagline for the ad was something like, \\"Burt Loves Nicky\\" scrawled inside a lover's Valentine heart in chalk. (I guess it was the tearing point of his working relationship w/Hal David.)    When I first heard of this collaboration, it sounded like a dream.    I was...somewhat disappointed when I heard the results. Nevertheless, I own \\"Painted from Memory\\" on vinyl, on cassette, and on CD. When I told this to a close friend of mine, he asked me: Why?    My answer? 'Cause I kept expecting/wanting the thing to be good! (And, because formats changed: vinyl bit the dust; I then drove a car that still had a cassette player; then I bought a car w/a CD player. These days, I do most of my listening in my car. These days...)    By the by, Nico's recording of \\"These Days\\" on her Chelsea Girl album is far & away the best version of it. (imho)    In all fairness, I haven't listened to Painted from Memory in quite some time. I really have to listen to again--with \\"fresh\\" ears.
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|This is another classic from Pixar. The movie has a fun and silly storyline involving an older man who seeks to fulfill his deceased wife's childhood dream. Along the way, he is joined by a boy scout, giant bird, and talking dog. Ultimately, they all realize the need to take on new roles in life and forge ahead. While the story (a floating house, talking dogs, etc.) were silly, I found the movie surprisingly mature and emotional. It actually really makes you think about how important it is to try to fulfill your dreams with your loved one while they're still alive. The first five minutes goes through their relationship and the joy of a happy marriage. It as enough to get me a bit misty-eyed.     In terms of the animation, the film looks great, especially in 3D. The animated old man is surprisingly realistic, even bearing stubble after a few days in the jungle. The best animation is in the brief cartoon at the beginning, in which several clouds make baby animals and give them to storks.     I'm looking forward to Pixar's next creation.
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you liked the original movies, you will enjoy the remastered blu rays.  Video and sound quality is excellent, and of course, all my favorite lines are still there.  This is worth upgrading to the blu ray.  I especially enjoyed the Captain's Summit.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|This season definitely didn't hold it's weight. The previous seasons proved to be better written and well thought out. I actually was lost in season four. In my opinion, season four jumped ahead and left you confused and lost as to what happened between getting off the island and now wanting to go back. It was difficult to follow and boring at times.  Waiting for season five on dvd and hoping it will improve.
B00006G8G1|1.0|I love this band to death, BUT this is just unwatchable. Seems like the Editing wand broke on Steve. And it's really a shame because it could have been up there with LAD. On this concert we hear Bruce singing songs from the Blaze era from FOD and some old material too. It would have been great to sit back and enjoy, but I'm afraid you have to watch this at your own risk of a possible seizure or a blinding headache. Sad really :(<br />Oh....and the same applies to DOTR dvd.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Prior to watching this movie, I heard alot of mixed reviews about it when it was in the theaters. However, I took a chance and purchased the dvd. It was definitely worth purchasing. Alot of action and it's about time the bad guys learned a real lesson. It has a good plot and the movie moves right along. Maybe not enough hard violence for some but enough to keep it dramatic.
B001I1123O|5.0|Have you ever read a part of the bible or attended a sermon that you deep down, just didn't agree with or had serious questions about?  Not to worry!  You're not alone.  A book was finally written which helps you find the answers that you are looking for; The God Delusion.     When I starting reading this book, I didn't know what to think.  I felt that Richard Dawkins was being over zealous; especially when he wrote that his wish is to convert everyone to ATHIEISM.  That to me was a very bold statement!  However, as I read more, the more in-line his writings were to my inner beliefs.  In all honesty, I have came to the realization that The God Delusion is my own personal bible.    This book is thought provoking and will make you question everything you were taught to believe in.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Although this season didn't prove to be as exciting as the first two, it will definitely keep you in suspense as to whether they will get off the island. It goes a little slower than the first two but it's definitely worth the buy for any Lost fan.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|There's not much more that can be said about WALL-E that hasn't been already, but consider this another nudge to see the film, if by some chance you haven't yet. WALL-E accomplishes incredible feats of emotion, depth, grace, and entertainment with only animation and limited dialogue. One of the finest examples of filmmakers and animators that really know exactly what they're doing. Must see!
B000VD5I94|3.0|Even though this shares the same cover as the 20th Anniversary DVD, none of the features are carried over with the exception of a theatrical trailer.  Other than that, the only plus side is that you get the high def movie.  However, the movie itself isn't the best transfer job I've seen.  I've seen older movies transferred better.  Don't get me wrong, it's decent-but I personally feel that it could be better.  To put it simply, unless you are a huge Robocop fan, don't bother.  Any DVD version of this movie that you have will do the job.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|Dream Theater's ninth studio album is by no means a bad album, but if one views it from the front, looking back at the rest of their discography, it can't help but lose a bit of its shine. Before any conclusions are jumped to, it IS a very good collection of songs, and still one of my more favorite albums. But it's definitely one of my least favorite DREAM THEATER albums.    In Systematic Chaos, we see a Dream Theater that is looking for a bit more mainstream exposure while at the same time holding on to what it is that makes them unique - technical instrumentation, catchy melodies, and best-in-class hooks and riffage. These are still present; however, the focused, driven, and confident sounds of Awake (1994) and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) tend to get lost among the more \\"radio-friendly\\" cuts like Forsaken and Constant Motion. As such, the end result conveys the impression of a band that is writing and playing in a domain where they may not be most comfortable or best suited.    This is more of a \\"big picture\\" analysis; each member of the band is in close to top form, technically speaking. John Petrucci's melodies and solos are still among the best in the music world today, James LaBrie's voice displays both aggression and grace with ease, and Jordan Rudess continues to be at the forefront of keyboard innovation. It's just...when everything is put together here, the end result is probably a bit less grand than the aged Dream Theater fan might expect.    Be it that Dream Theater fans may have a thing or two to complain about here, Systematic Chaos is still a great album. Music fans with little to no exposure to this genre will almost certainly find something to like, and the increased accessibility of the songs creates a convenient bridge for those listeners that may have shied away from progressive rock/metal in the past. All in all, it's definitely worth a spin. It still gets one every now and then from me.
B000AL730O|4.0|This is not the Paul's 80s and 90s muzak.  This is not Wings music of the 70s.  This here is Beatles music.  Most if not all of the songs would fit comfortably on the White Album, Rubber Soul or Revolver.  That is not to say that these songs are imitations of past glories ala Bluebird.  I docked it one star because what keeps this album from perfection is the absence of John, George and Ringo.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I found the Star trek movie collection to be a fantastic buy. They have done a very fine job with the transfer to blu ray. This collection looked 200 times better than I thought it would. Great product.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Please rent this movie before hollywood gets their hands on it.     i can just see it now - The American Version!  Instead of him being a pale, fragile, handsome, kid, he'll be a \\"geek\\".  Instead of boys bullying him, yep, he's going to be made fun by a bunch of \\"Mean Girls, and Handsome Jocks\\".    When he decides to work out, he'll not only be 12 years old and more confident - he'll be 12 years old, complete with a body double on steroids - for those intimate, close up shots. He'll also grow 2 extra inches on his penis, plus sport eyeliner, mascara, and wearing tight tee shirts while flexing his now bulging biceps, (and crotch) much to the delight of squealing \\"tweens\\" all over the world.    She, on the other hand will be blonde/blue eyed, basically for the \\"innocence\\" take on the media. But if we're going for dark and mysterious, the casting  director will definitely go for a brunette, or brown haired with light eyes of course. Yes, Obama may be president, but america still has a long way to go when it comes to mainstream aesthetics and innocence.    The \\"bite\\" scenes, will be the usual american take.  aerial work - a kamakazee flying 12 year old, blood splattered everywhere, camera shaking, dubbed in yelling/screaming, 3 sec. cuts, and afterwards she'll have blood all over her face, and in the next frame - it's gone!  And of course, she'll bite him, eventually.. about 3 sequels later.    The original version is subtle, enigmatic, has nuance, has character depth, and gratefully targets an audience with brains.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Not only is it FREE, but these stories completely hold up over time. Wonderfully sectionalized in tasty bite size short stories, the adventures of sherlock holmes is awesome. Cocaine injecting, boxing, female-agnostic to remain as logical as possible - these stories are enthralling and fun!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Amazing idea, amazing execution and amazing performances.  Especially effective coupled with the video of the performances.
0765350386|4.0|Orphan of mysterious parentage with awesome power?  Beaten-down working class?  Aristocrats that are bloodthirsty jerks?  A supreme ruler that oppresses everyone?    Check, check, check, check. But these do not detract from the genuinely interesting way that the world is set up - including the superbly engrossing \\"magic system\\" involving the ingestion and \\"burning\\" of metals.     The point of view switches between the main protagonist and her mentor, and for the most part, the voices of the two remain seperate and interesting.     The book is by no means revolutionary, but it is intriguing nonetheless, and I shall be reading the sequels.
B00269FOHM|4.0|I saw this movie on tv, as I was switching channels, and got engrossed in it. Went online the next day and ordered it. It is reminiscent of The Miracle Worker in parts cause the daughter is so unmanageable at first. It's just one of those movies that draw you in, and yes it is a love story. Acting was very good.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Love this film.  I had to add it to my DVD collection.  The story breaks your heart but it must be seen and told.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Pixar once again proves why they are the undisputed champions of animated film making. Up is beautiful, poignant, funny, and engaging. It is a great film by any standard. Why is this company so successful again and again? The founder of Pixar, John Lassiter has stated that Pixar films are all about the story. The animation techniques only help tell it. Pixar is run by creative people with a clear artistic vision, while most other companies appear to be run by marketing groups who try to calculate the right number of snappy one liners and gross-out jokes to capture the largest demographic.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I bought this because I liked the song they had for the Twilight movie soundtrack. I have it in my car and have been playing it everyday and love it! I'm used to Country and old rock and this is so fresh and mood elevating.
B001EOQWEY|5.0|I purchased this movie for my Spanish I students to watch on the last day of class.  Because the movie is relatively low on dialogue, I thought it would be less likely to overwhelm them than a dialogue-intense movie.  I was right--they loved it, and were able to follow it well.  My only complaint:  in order to help students follow what was going on, I had Spanish subtitles showing as well, and the Spanish script and Spanish subtitles were not the same, which was confusing for some of my beginning students.  Otherwise, everyone enjoyed the movie very much.
B001HN697M|5.0|The movie was great because I have the other two sequels.  I think it should have been in the reverse but then it would not have come out right.  Everybody lives except Marcus.  Viktor is back in the last one and Seleen is not in it either.  It was a very good movie, that if you like vampires and wolves.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|Even if you summarize the Moody Blues' career by purchasing the [[ASIN:B00000E5FG Time Traveller]] box set, you need this album. In this case I wouldn't settle for downloading just a couple select tracks.<br /><br />The box set does do the justice of including the full album length versions of the two hits here, \\"Nights In White Satin\\" and \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\", but \\"Days of Future Passed\\" is a great example of a release from the album era where, from start to finish, it works as a whole and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Apart from the opening 'festival orchestra' instrumental (which seems to be very much about the orchestra and very little about the band) every track is a keeper.<br /><br />Admittedly, when I compiled a single CD 'best of' for the car I edited out some of the portions at the end of songs that were strictly orchestration. This brought \\"Dawn is a Feeling\\" down to two minutes and change, and \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Another Morning\\" were trimmed of string section extensions as well.<br /><br />The only negative I've ever heard levelled at this album came from an old girlfriend. She agreed that it was a choice album for putting on endless repeat when the two of you are in a sultry mood, but she suggested that the orchestrations sometimes sound like a travelogue. I'll give her that, they do; but \\"Days of Future Passed\\" is still an essential album, one of the two dozen or so most significant rock albums of the 1960s.
0385341008|4.0|This was my pick for my book group. Being a Brit but living in the US I had said i would find something with a British slant. This was a good choice...if slightly 'out of the box'.<br />Loved the book. Found some interesting facts about the German invasion of Guernsey whilst enjoying the evolving love story.<br />Yep...was worth the read.
1569242739|2.0|I really enjoyed the creativity of these recipes, but most, if not all of them, called for refined sugar, which isn't considered vegan. While some vegans are happy to use it, I don't, and had a hard time reworking the recipes around that. It basically invalidated my whole reason for buying the book.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Just another forgetable comic book movie.  The build up and hype surrounding Ledger's performance is way overblown.  He licks his lips a lot, acts crazy, has greasy hair, and you can't tell he has an Austrailian accent; that's about all I can say.  There is nothing moving nor substantial in his performance.  I'm sorry the guy died, but that wasn't an Academy Award winning performance.  Bale and the rest of the cast go through the motions and it's all very bland.  The Maggie Gyllenhall selection is puzzling; she's unattractive.
0765350386|5.0|I decided to read this book not because I had heard anything good about Sanderson but because I knew he was going to be completing Robert Jordan's bloated Wheel of Time series.  I was initially impressed, even before beginning the novel, that Sanderson had managed to complete the series in three books (something I wish Jordan could have done).  I started the Wheel of Time series in 7th grade, and I should be done with my graduate degree by the time the series concludes.  I actually feel a glimmer of hope for the Wheel of Time series now, however, even though the last 4 books or so haven't been that great (for a laugh, read some of the reviews of [[ASIN:0812571339 Crossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, Book 10)]]).<br /><br />Anyway, on to the review of Mistborn: The Final Empire:<br />I was extremely impressed by this book.  Sanderson's system of magic is unique, but it was especially interesting because it still kept a sense of realism despite its fantasy nature.  The magic didn't get so ridiculous and out of control that it became cumbersome to the story or detracted from it either.  The plot itself was not anything truly unique (but what book really does have an interesting and totally new plot?), but it was well-paced and addictive to read.  Where Sanderson really shines is the setting and characters.  Other reviewers berated Sanderson for the lack of characterization in secondary characters.  This criticism is unwarranted.  Firstly, by focusing on two characters, he was able to bring a much more profound sense of change for those characters and make the characterization much more satisfying.  Second, characterization for a host of characters usually results in a bloated story that slows down the plot.  Take the Wheel of Time series for instance: Jordan tries to focus on EVERY character, and the books suffer because of it.  By book 10, the main characters, for whom people care and about whom people read, are sidelined so that stupid characters can have the limelight.  I'm not saying that it's impossible.  Tolstoy managed great characterization for quite a few characters in War and Peace, but then again, the novel is more than three times as long (very good, though).  Sanderson breathes life in his characters and makes them realistic and great fun to read.<br />This book is a great read; highly recommended.ot saying that it's impossible.

0061706620|5.0|Ever wondered about the enigmatic John Winchester and how he raised his two sons to be hunters? Check out this book, which offers some touching insight into the shadowy figure that is Papa Winchester. He gives personal details on his family and on the monsters he hunts. This book ties in with the two Supernatural graphic novels \\"Origins\\" and \\"Rising Son\\" and is a must have for any diehard fan of Supernatural. I recommend it to anyone who's ever wanted to get their hands on John's journal. My only complaint is that it's not bound in leather, like the real one. But the pages look beat up and stained, which was a nice touch.
0765356139|5.0|Is it as good as Mistborn: The Final Empire?  No.  It's four stars compared to that book, but as a book itself, it really deserves five stars.  Yes, it has its problems, but it's an addictive read, and it's very hard to stop once started.  The last 200 pages or so really deserve six stars.  I didn't mind the first 400 pages or so; in spite of the slower progression and perfunctory action sequences added, I enjoyed it.  Furthermore, the continuation of the story after what seemed to be a stand-alone fantasy book made for an interesting read.  Sanderson's world of politics feels very real as the characters encounter realistic problems.<br /><br />The book falters in a couple of places, however.  My biggest issue with The Well of Ascension is the romance.  The romance is as awkward and wooden as is is in the Twilight series.  I know that's a very grave insult to compare this series to Twilight, but I make no apologies.  The romance between Vin and Elend is just very frustrating to read.  I understand the conflicts of interest that cause the issues, but the resulting relationship was far less interesting than it could have been.  The other aspect that really bothered me was a lack of a character that really captured my interest.  While the absence of Kelsier is a necessary evil due to the plot of book one, I found it hard to connect with any of the other characters in the same way Kelsier grabbed the reader by the belt buckle in the first book (Sazed emergence as a more central character helped but did not alleviate this problem).<br /><br />Don't let those issues stop you from reading this book.  It's still a great book, and I'd take it any day of the week over 1984, Brave New World or most of the books from the Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|A true classic of the genre in every sense of the word. Bela Lugosi simply can't be topped as the definitive Count Dracula.<br /><br />For devotees of this hypnotic film the 75th Anniversary Edition is the one to get. Steve Haberman's excellent audio commentary finally sets the record straight by debunking the recent unwarranted criticism Tod Browning's version has received when it's compared to the alternately filmed Spanish version. Haberman points out some serious flaws with the Spanish version that clearly emphasizes the superiority of Browning's film, and restores the latter's deserved reputation as one of the seminal works of cinematic horror.<br /><br />My one complaint with the disc set is Philip Glass' music score. It's just plain terrible. It does exactly everything a music score should NOT do. It's too loud and it's CONSTANTLY meandering its way throughout the entire film, which gets really annoying. Thankfully the music track is optional, but it does such a disservice to the film that it shouldn't have been included at all.<br /><br />When watched the way it's supposed to be seen - in all its quiet, restrained creepiness - this first talkie DRACULA can still cast its chilling spell on us unlike any version that followed.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.

I keep listening it non stop.<br /><br />I maybe late to discover this, but its ok cause good music will live forever..and i everyday I listen to this as if that'll be my first time.<br /><br />And its place in history? ...From \\"here we are now to entertain us\\" to \\"F**K u I wont do What U tell me\\" to \\"I Wanna Live Forever\\" that dwell many in pop music the last decade ..Neutral Milk Hotel also contribute the same thing to the genre of new voice of generation. With less angst(love indeed instead of anger), a religious-mantra maybe....but with \\"Jesssusss Criessssttttt I Love Youuuuuu yes I doooo\\" at least it put richness to the 90s.<br />it is shocking to hear it at first. While all bands heading to a non- believer category, NMH with that single words turns in other direction and bravely put what their believe in the missing link, of a new genre that should exist long time ago perhaps.<br />For some it should not be taken serious. But somehow u cant just get the words ouf out ear long after u finish listen to it.<br /><br />Yes, theres other good music being made out there..but this is sure to be one of the best ever made.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|The difference between Art and mere Entertainment, is Art causes us to think and feel -- sometimes thoughts and feelings that are not exactly enjoyable. If I have ever seen a movie that is Art, it is \\"The Reader.\\"    When I undertook my undergraduate studies, I decided to focus on 20th Century European History because I wanted to understand how and why the Holocaust happened. I even had opportunities over the years to talk to a few survivors of the camps and to talk with Germans who denied knowing anything at the time. Needless to say, I did not achieve understanding despite reading countless books and watching documentaries and films that dealt with that subject directly or indirectly. I cannot wait to read the novel, because this movie \\"takes no prisoners\\", which is a tribute to its actors, director, and the exquisite job of editing in the released version.    I will take a moment to contrast The Reader with another fine movie, Schindler's List. Both are powerful movies, but Schindler's List is easier on the viewer, because it is so easy to say: \\"I would have been like Schindler.\\" Inevitably, that enables us to avoid a deep confrontation with not only our own possibility of evil, but the ease with which our race will allow evil to happen to others or even assist. In no way is The Reader easy on the viewer!    The Reader, on the other hand, hits you squarely between the eyes with the question of knowing the right thing to do . . . and doing nothing. There was a particularly gripping scene in the meeting between a now-older woman in New York who as a child had been an Auchwitz inmate and between the adult lawyer after Hanna's death. She remarks people are always asking her about what she learned in the camps, and she vehemently says, \\"Nothing. . . . Nothing comes out of the camps!\\"    This somehow resonates that nobody can draw any lofty conclusions from the fact that our race so easily perpetrates and endures genocide. Perfectly ordinary people go to great lengthsto hide its existence under their very noses.    As other viewers have said, this requires the right frame of mind to confront what it depicts. In some ways, the nudity particularly will keep any well-intentioned parent from watching it with immature children. The sadness is that there are many adults who will never be mature enough to watch this movie.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Saw this in an iMax theater.  Movie was so good that I went back again...plus bought the Blu-Ray.  You do the math.<br /><br />Everybody knows the story.  Everybody knows the characters.<br /><br />Let's talk about the product itself.  It comes with two Blu-Ray discs plus an \\"electronic\\" copy for your computer.  The first disc is the \\"money disc\\".  It holds the movie and over an hour of special features that could stand on their own -- without the movie.  The special features pull back the curtain on the movie-making process and reveal some remarkable facts about this movie.  (no spoilers here!) I replayed several portions of the special features.  Ok, one non-spoiler is how they prepared for the Hong Kong stunts.  A stuntman actually leaps off of a building while attached to a bungee cord...which is connected to a helicopter.  The video shows the man doing a swan dive off a huge building (had to be 30+ stories).  You see him just fly through the air and appear to be heading directly into the side of another building.  The helicopter takes up the slack and the guy just floats in the air waving to people down below.  The shot is just...it took my breath away.<br /><br />Ok, one more.  Another segment shows how the semi flipped in the downtown scene.<br /><br />Oh, and the \\"wacker drive\\" chase is taken apart piece by piece.  You get to see several camera views that were not in the movie.<br /><br />Disc 1 is a goldmine.<br /><br />There is also a BD-Live component that I didn't test.  It involves something about adding your own commentary or clips.  Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />The second disc has more fluff and filler on it.  There's an hour long piece on how Batman developed and claims to delve into Batman's psychology.  In truth, it was poorly produced and poorly written.  The amount of comics involved also turned me off to it.  The other piece on disc 2 was so uninteresting that I've already forgotten it.<br /><br />Packaging is up to par.  This set will look great on your shelf.<br /><br />Wish there was more special features.  Seeing all the iMax stuff behind the scenes was just fascinating.  I've developed a new appreciation for the work involved in making this masterpiece of a movie.reat on your shelf.<br /><br />Wish there was more special features.

When they all take a turn dancing with Liz, it makes me laugh out loud and Whistler driving the van at the end?  This is the best part.  I have always enjoyed Robert Redford's movies, and the ensemble cast just made it even more perfect.  Too bad River Phoenix died so young.

B0025X4PL0|5.0|I have been a devotee of prog-rock since its inception, way back in the late 60's. I have worn out multiple copies (and formats) of Yessongs, for one. I never thought I would find a band that surpassed them. But then about a year or so ago I was listening to Pandora and up came a cut from this album (if you can still call it that). I also got hooked up with Porcupine Tree, but Oceansize is special. The title cut is, in fact, my new, personal \\"anthem.\\"    Lush, intricate rhythms, mesmerizing lyrics, astounding drumming and a clean sound. What more do you want?

B0024RIMBG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000LC4CVA CELTIC WOMEN-A NEW JOURNEY (LIVE) AT SLANE CASTLE (DVD)]]. One of the finest DVD's of a concert I will ever own.

My favorites, Lisa singing \\"The Voice\\" and \\"Calidonia\\", Haley in\\" Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\", \\"Scarborough Fair\\" and \\" The Last Rose of Summer. Chloe with \\"Panis Angelicus\\" Maec in \\"Danny boy and Dulaman\\" and laast but nor least Orla in \\"Newgrange and Carrickfergus\\" The sheer talent of these five soloist is beyond compare but as a group they fit each other like a glove. Listen to \\"Spanish Lady\\" and \\"You raise me Up\\"The first will have you laughing and the second crying. An Album for any serious music lover. And I even spoke about the energy and talent that Mairead brings to the stage. That little fiddle player has more energy than the Energizer bunny. And remember Chloe and Haley had not yet reached their 18th birthday when this album was made.    Don Lake
0143038419|2.0|I had a hard time getting through this book.  The author is pretentious, whiney and very self-absorbed.  She whines about her divorce, but it seems like she was the one who just up and left and took up with another man.  Her year of travel seems less of discovering herself and all about a Year of Me.  She goes to at least two places - India and Bali - with much poverty and never seems to note it or want to be involved.  It would be nice if we could all just travel for a year after a divorce to find our way.
B00122PUS2|4.0|If anyone can discredit this album, I welcome it.  I am a huge PG fan and his departure made a big difference in Genesis sound, but as you all know Genesis still stands on their own.  Even with PG departure Genesis still knows how to create and maintain their own unique sound.  Breaking boundaries is what PG and Genesis stood for and this album is a good example.  In fact PG still has a great career and leaving Genesis was a good decision for both.  If you like this album I suggest you get Genesis: [[ASIN:B000024E9M Selling England by the Pound]]

0451196716|2.0|Despite this being a \\"Richard Bachman\\" novel, the book is a complete loss. You become easily lost from the beginning of the story and become entrapped into this vicious cycle of losing random characters back and forth. If you cannot keep up with the characters and what conversations that they have held with Ray Garraty, then you will be completely lost.     I do not see how Stephen King came up with such a lame idea for a story! It's absolutely horrible and I would not recommend reading this one.

The main characters are likeable, the story is well-told, the cinematography is engaging, the actors can actually act and the dialoge is completely real.  Not just a superiour gay romance, but a true testament to what it means - in terms of sacrifice and reward - to be committed to family and at the same time to find the courage to follow your own path.  Worth watching again and again!

0140277447|5.0|It is a sad reality that most Americans think World War II began on December 7th, 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. They know little or nothing about the crucial events in Europe prior to that and they definitely know nothing about the atrocities committed by the Japanese military before America entered the war.<br /><br />Chang's book is a good way to engage people and get them curious about the important events that took place before 1941. This book is like the worst imaginable train wreck; once you start reading, you cannot look away. And we shouldn't. We, all people everywhere, have a responsibility to be aware of the darkest events of our collective past. The Holocaust was not as simple as \\"bad Nazi monsters\\" did it and the Nanking massacre was not as simple as \\"bad Japanese monsters\\" did it.<br /><br />As a species we are capable of great evil. Those who are ignorant of events like the Nanking massacre do not fully appreciate this.<br /><br />The guards at those Nazi death camps and the Japanese soldiers who decapitated Chinese civilians for entertainment were not monsters. Unfortunately, they were humans--most of them probably not so different from you and I. If we are to ever have a hope of preventing mass murder in the future, I suspect the first step is for most people to be aware of the events that have occurred in the past.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. If you are interested in learning more about World War II, I recommend the following for a good overall view: John Keegan's [[ASIN:014011341X The Second World War]], Martin Gilbert's [[ASIN:0805076239 The Second World War: A Complete History]], and the old but still excellent television documentary, [[ASIN:B0002F6AH0 The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)]]<br /><br />--Guy P.

What I didn't expect was for it to be 1% about zombies and 99% about politics. Why not just call it, \\"World War Everything That's Wrong With the Government in Every Part of the World\\"? So. Incredibly. Boring.
0385736002|4.0|I was actually pleasantly surprised by this book.  That's not a slight against the author, but I had read many reviews saying the book was only so-so and was lacking in substance and character development.  Anyway, I actually very much enjoyed The Alchemyst.  I wouldn't say it's in my top 5 or anything, but it makes the list of favorites.  I enjoyed all the mythology, although I do think that perhaps there were a few too many myths and legends stuffed in without having too much of a point in being there.  All in all though, as I am not a mythology expert, I found myself wanting to know more about the creatures described.  So that's good.  The story itself is an intriguing one, and I love the characters of Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel.  The characters I weren't too thrilled about were Josh and Sophie.  It wasn't that I hated them, I just didn't LOVE them, nor did I care too much about what happened to either one of them.  I just didn't get to know them.  So maybe there could have been a tad more character development in the case of the twins.      Overall, though, the book was really fun to read and offered an interesting and engaging storyline.  I found myself actually unable to put it down towards the end, which is good.  I've bought the second in the series, The Magician, and hope that it is even better.  Good read!
0307266303|2.0|This is a magazine article that got plumped up to book length and it shows. After a couple dozen chapters (!) you're finally into the meat of his story, his writing gets interesting and all the cheesy metaphors and padding drop away. This part is a very good read. But to stretch the material --like a giant elastic rubberband -- for about the first third of the book -- which seems as long as a desert rattlesnake -- no sentence is complete without a metaphor and simile. They drop down like rain in a Mexican thunderstorm. Cliffs are (wait for it..) \\"death-defying.\\" The author's running is so bad that anyone seeing him would want to put a pad between his teeth and fetch a doctor. And so forth. On and on. It's really quite painful. All weighted down with one apocryphal story after another about the Tarahumara -- they can run on water! they run up cliffs!! they run for weeks without food!!! they have wild nookie parties (really)!!!) -- without one single shred of evidence or sourcing. The Tarahumara are remarkable enough to not need this kind of  obvious hype and spin, and would probably be terribly embarrassed by it anyway. But in the second half of the book, when he actually settles into his story, as opposed to setting up and hyping his story, he can be gripping if you're a runner. His explication of the Running Man Theory is fascinating. Buy this book, but consider buying it used. Maybe after reading it you'll even be able to run *faster* than a Mexican antelope up a sheer, *death-defying* cliff in the rain! (really).

But my suggestion is for Lee Child to read the first few Reacher books over slowly, and then go back to his writing roots on this fantastic series.  We're Reacher fans or we wouldn't be writing these reviews, but we want the old Reacher back and he's still not quite here yet.  Close, but no cigar.

He has so much fill in material in it that one forgets who the people are when he names them after 300 pages.

B001ANYDAO|2.0|I've read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books and I've been increasingly disappointed with each.  This one is another fluffy, fast read but I did not learn anything new.  It's not exactly groundbreaking to learn that hard work will result in big payoffs.  At the end of 250+ pages, you learn that success is a product of hard work, luck and opportunities.  Crazy, eh?    Who would have thought that a book that teaches you nothing more than that would make so much money?  How is Malcolm Gladwell going to explain this success?
0861661605|3.0|The League is back, newly formed (sort of... if you've read the last three books, particularly The Black Dossier, you know about this version of the League already) and it's ready to defend London.  Expect to need to sit down with a wiki after you read this (at least I did) to get all the characters and references.  If you're a LoEG fan already, that shouldn't be new!  Nemo's daughter, Janni, really makes the story, with her departure from Lincoln Island and transformation working in the Cuttlefish Hotel.  I had not expected to dislike Orlando so much, particularly after his/her feature in The Black Dossier made me so much more curious about this character.<br /><br />The artwork, as always, is awesome.  I felt like the story was somewhat lacking, though I felt the same way about The Black Dossier.  The last book was a quick chase, with frequent and lengthy interruptions of the League's history.  Moore seems to resist the urge in this volume, with a rather short entry at the end called \\"Minions of the Moon,\\" which explores the League's future.  I'm really curious to see more of this iteration of the League, but it sounds like I'll be disappointed, based on Moore's plans for the next two volumes.  I suppose, in a way, I've always been more interested in the other members of the League and less so in Allan and Mina.

B0013FSL3E|2.0|So much hype and praise for Wall E but there's nothing here to truly recommend it.  Lack of a main character or person to relate to is one thing that will alienate a significant portion of the audience.  Kids will watch anything, but I highly doubt that in ten years this film will be regularly watched by kids unlike the brilliantly attention keeping \\"Finding Nemo.\\"  Making a robot exhibit human-like characteristics is not as easy now as it was back in the days of Short Circuit when people were less educated about AI.  In the days after movies have seriously dealt with robots, movies like \\"Robots\\" and \\"Wall e\\" are haphazard with the material.  Instead of this being about realistic potential of robots they're more about making robots as humanlike as possible.  They try to mask that in this one by making Wall e and Eve unable to communicate in human terms.  Robot love?  I think Cris Cunningham and Bjork are the only ones who actually got it right.  If Stanley Kubrick and Spielberb can't get it right, why does Pixar think they can? Animals and toys can be used because their exhibits of life are the existence of imagination and here there's no explanation for it.  Wall e is a trash robot who makes walls of trash, a trash robot acting human...was that in his programming?    The bottom line is: why cheer for a cypher of human emotion when the gain for the audience and the character is more trash compacting?  The robot doesn't even get to be truly optimistic when human kind comes back, he doesn't truly have the robot he desires, she's probably just being compassionate as is programmed.  Someone needs to reprogram these Pixar writers, or at least go with different ones because this movie leaves you out in the cold.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Yup, I cried.    UP was the first Pixar film to make me cry my eyes out.  (Usually I leave that kind of thing to my wife.)  It was sweet, tender, and filled with the kind of old school Disney magic that you usually only see from the Disney films of yester-year, when Walt himself had to give his personal stamp of approval.    Like all of its Pixar predecessors, UP abounds with a variety of unforgettable characters like Carl Frederickson, his beloved wife Ellie, the clumsy but loveable Russell, Doug the dog (proud to share my name with such an honorable character), and Kevin the...bird-thing.  Also abounding are adventure, suspense, romance, friendship, and Pixar's trademark brand of fun!
B001SN78JO|5.0|Jim Carrey was once an actor who elicited endless bouts of laughing fits that usually resulted in one being bent over on the couch on the verge of peeing in ones pants.<br /><br />Or so I hear.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I've never been a huge fan of the whole `zany is funny' approach to comedy.  Sure, every once in a while a mindless film that filters gag after gag is a nice escape from reality, but I prefer my comedy to have a little more substance.  Even at that, I could never deny the fact that Carrey had what it took to do what he did better than most other people.  I may not be the biggest fan of `Ace Ventura' or `The Cable Guy' or even `Dumb and Dumber', but I respect what this man can do.  He is, without doubt, considered a comedic god to many.  Personally though, I have come to admire what Jim has been able to do with smarter, more subdued comedies.  His performances in films like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and `The Truman Show' are leagues better than what he's done in any of his big Blockbuster smash hits.<br /><br />As of late, Carrey's star has seemed to kind of fade away.  His newer movies are not as big and or as exciting as his older ones, and as he increases in age he has found himself replaced by the new generation of slapstick stars.<br /><br />Because of that, you may not have given `Yes Man' the time of day.<br /><br />Even before it was released, rumors of this being nothing but a `Liar, Liar' rip off were everywhere.  Beings that I was not a huge fan of `Liar, Liar' to begin with (I found it only marginally funny) I was not really all that excited about this film and so I wrote it off.  Then I noticed that it co-stared the amazingly talented and absolutely gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (who I would sit through anything to see) and I decided to give it a try.  Cuddled up on a couch with my wife and my best friend we popped this bad boy in and prepared ourselves for a letdown.<br /><br />That letdown never came.<br /><br />What is so great about `Yes Man' is that it plays to every one of Carrey's strengths without letting them get the better of him.  He begins the film a very subdued character, and so when he starts to venture into `zany' territory he is reeled in by his character's demeanor.  He never goes overboard, which saves this film from becoming a random clich&eacute;.  Instead, he pulverizes us with physical comedy that works, with new age wit that works and with actual human emotion that sells because his character seems much more down to earth than a lot of the freaks he's played in the past.  Deschanel is sweet and charming and everything a man could ever want and need and so she complements Carrey's transformation very well; and the script is actually all sorts of clever.  Sure, there are moments of clich&eacute;d and obvious `borrowing' from other possibly better films, but for the most part this one actually works very hard to be something memorable.<br /><br />If you like what Carrey is capable of when handed the right script then see this movie.  It's one of his better films in recent years, certainly his best since `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.  Sure, it has nothing on that film (they are totally different), but for what it attempts to be, it is aces all the way.e of Carrey's strengths without letting them get the better of him.

B000000H5K|5.0|I love Heavy metal and i am from Brazil and i remenber When Roots came to the world. The metalheads in Brazil were really proud of Sepultura... Can you belive that? From Brazil, man?Yes, and they are really heavy and really great, and Roots was the pinaccle of it all. After that, Max split the band and things change a lot. Arise and Chaos are my favorites, but Roots consolidate Sepultura as a monster rock of heavy music. At 1996 these guys from Brazil were on the top of metal with Pantera and Biohazard, do you remenber? Whatever, í love Sepultura with Max and if you like insane music with heavy guitars, drums and attitude, Roots is perfect for you.
B000000H3W|5.0|Arise is one of the greatest thrash metal records ever made. Max screams insane lyrics while Andreas destroys your neighbours brains with heavy guitars riffs. Igor is one of the greatest drummers of all time. In my opinion, Arise was the best album from Sepultura. If you like thrash metal you will love Arise. Try Chaos A.D, too.
B000W91RUG|4.0|That rarity in tv comedy - something that actually makes me laugh and so far, it's not too vulgar.      I returned this set, however, as it arrived damaged.  Most DVDs have at least one reviewer complaining about the bad physical quality.  I wish manufacturers would take note.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|There was a good reason this show was cancelled...it sucks! If you are highly intelligent you will not like this mess of a production. The sound track is ridiculous, the dialogue is lame, and the fight scenes are amateur hour intense. I viewed all the great reviews and was misled. If you haven't had an original idea in years you may find some comfort, but basically I would stay away if you really thirst for something new and intense, something well written, which this is not. All the small town barn dances or country whatevers almost drove me mad with boredom. If I wanted a western with dancing I would have rented something from the 1950's. This is somewhere below science fiction, somewhere way below. A total waste of money unless you are simple minded or have a red stain on your neck.
B000002MJC|5.0|This album was one of, if not, the best album ever put out by DM and the most underrated. Everything is perfect, almost every song is incredible. Martin's lyrics written for Dave's secret pleasures and pain, Alan's genius compositions, Dave's vocals cut are his best yet and cut through you with sheer, raw grit...every emotion bared for you to experience with him. Unfortunately, unlikely that we will ever experience him at this level again. Hard to replicate because this is Dave at his deepest, darkest moment and you can hear it in his voice. Luckily, he made it out and he has something magical that was produced and something we can cherish forever. This is a must for any DM fan and even for anyone sick of listening to the same commercialized crap on the radio. Also a must is the Devotional Concert on DVD. Dave's performance brings me to tears.  This is a true artist and living rock god!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadore&ntilde;os rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.<br /><br />Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he \\"disowned\\" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of \\"our\\" fathers' generation(s).<br /><br />The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.<br /><br />But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made \\"dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.<br /><br />Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from \\"not bad\\" to \\"well, I've seen worse.\\" Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity. I wonder who has the film rights to produce \\"The Eastwood Chronicle\\" when he dies...The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families.

B0013USZHG|5.0|The Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra is an inspiring sight in concert, a vast sea of joyful young faces all concentrating on making something beautiful for all of us. It's a large orchestra, larger than most American communities can afford even with the donations of wealthy individuals and foundations, but it's almost entirely supported by the government of Venezuela. You might call it socialist music education, though the S-word will draw hostility in the USA. But the SBYO is only the visible tip of 'El Sistema' of music education in Venezuela, which reaches out to the remotest provinces and benefits the poorest communities.<br /><br />The best-known graduate of El Sistema these days is Gustavo Dudamel, newly appointed conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, succeeding Esa-Pekka Saalonen. Dudamel is energetic, charming, and personable. Good things are to be awaited as he establishes rapport with his new \\"instrument.\\"<br /><br />This \\"Fiesta\\" is a revel of folkloric, impressionistic crowd-pleasers, based chiefly on dance rhythms, by Latin American composers: Arturo Marquez, Antonio Estevez, Silvestre Revueltas, Inocente Carreno, Evencio Castellanos, and.... Leonard Bernstein. Don't scoff, Eurocentric music lovers! These are well-made pieces of music, worth hearing often.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect so I downloaded on to my itouch instead of spending the money ( due to the economy )...I knew it got very mixed reviews. I knew that Fitzgerald wrote it as a short story and that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were the playing the leads( loved \\"Interview with a Vampire\\"  and \\" Elizabeth \\" )and it was set in New Orleans.It was the reviews that got to me...most so different, so I had to see for myself.After almost 3 hours of watchng it I fell in love with the characters and all the changes throughout the many decades that Benjamin & Daisy went through, together and apart.From the end of WWI 1918 to 2006 an entire life span. It was an epic film... as in forrest Gump epic where you were living the history with them and saw the times changing.No matter what age Benjamin was at the time, they loved each other, But he had the wisdom to know he had to wait for Daisy to grow up emotionally, before she was ready to fall in love with him.( they had to meet in the middle ) I could feel the emotion  just by watching the film ( which is harder to portray in films and easier to do in books ...it's usually the other way around )No matter where they were in the world, they always found each other.The ending was predictable you knew it was coming, but still needed to watch it to the end.I probably would have given it 5 stars, but it was sooooooooo long, happy I watched at home so I could get comfortable and could pause the movie  when needed.Long after the movie I'm still thinking about Benjamin & Daisy which means the movie is still growing on me, which leads me to believe that I will be purchasing it.If you have the time, put the movie in the DVD and clear the evening to enjoy it.

These two:  Jason and Tara should be second bananas....maybe Tara a third banana.  Ms. Harris should have much more control over the next issue of True Blood--- which I will buy-- so that it will remain true to her books.  She is an extraordinarily popular writer and should be able to have lots of clout.  Bill is my favorite Vampire !<br /><br />Frances J. Jessup, RN, BSN

1897299214|4.0|French cartoonist Delisle found himself in North Korea's capital on a 2-month work visa for a French film animation company. He could only explore in the company of his translator and a guide. Yet, Delisle managed to create a graphic and realistic \\"novel\\" of his experience.<br /><br />At the time of his visit, mobile phones were prohibited, and there was no Internet. Delisle depicts the foreigners' hotel (bland, especially the cafes), municipal loudspeakers with the daily propaganda and motivational music, photos of the Kims in every room, a subway buried 90 meters down that doubles as a bomb shelter, food rationing based on loyalty. The six-day work week + 1 day of \\"volunteering\\" for the state, everyone wearing a pin picturing one or both Kims (foreigners are not allowed these pins). Time is measured from the year in which Kim I was born. A trip between two villages in the countryside requires a visa. Only married men with children staying behind are allowed to travel outside North Korea. \\"Re-education camps\\" supposedly don't exist, but everyone knows of them, striking both the guilty and their entire families into lifetime servitude.<br /><br />One of Delisle's diversions from boredom is a trip to the large, underground \\"International Friendship Exhibit\\" reached via a nearly deserted 4-lane road to-from Pyongyang. Its purpose is to showcase all the gifts to \\"Dear Leader\\" as well as positive news articles. Westerners are not allowed to visit the U.S.N. Pueblo.<br /><br />Probably most disconcerting of all is the revelation that about half of Pyongyang's residents (a preferred locale) served as informants in their provinces where they formerly lived.

B001Q9E9F6|3.0|Most people have heard various flavors of the 80-20 rule (20% of goods sold result in 80% of profits, 20% of the time of a project delivers 80% of the results, etc.).  The 80-20 rule is usually invoked to suggesting focusing more on the little that results in a lot.  This book, in essence, says the idea of applying that rule to products is coming to an end.<br /><br />First, the curves (technically called power-law distributions) are getting flatter.  Expressed another way, the heads are getting smaller and the tails are getting longer, hence the name of this book.  This is really the crux of the book, and it points toward cheaper means of production (of items from music to video to books, etc.), cheaper distribution (via the internet), and better ability for consumers to find new items (via Google and recommendations from proprietary sites or blogs) as all contributing to this phenomena.<br /><br />Second, while the number of sales *per unit* is smaller in the tail, by having greater and greater varieties of items in the tail, one can still aggregate to very large numbers.  For example, while the top 10 selling books in 2004 sold about 17 million units (combined), the million worst selling books sold about 15 million units.  Closer to the center, about 220 books combined would sell that number.<br /><br />Third, as more and more items go in the digital direction (where the concept of inventory doesn't apply - such as with digital music providers like iTunes), the cost to carry a virtually unlimited selection of products is nearly zero.  Therefore it pays to carry everything- even a few sales should still add to profits.<br /><br />Putting all this together paints an interesting picture of the future of retail, but is not very practical.  In the book, the author mentions that it started with an article in Wired magazine.  For those less interested, perhaps it should end there.  Towards the end is some advice, but all of it is geared toward the aggregators/retailers, not the producers.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|I am one of those who will admit to have liked the Omega Man film in the '70s. I was mildly initially dissapointed with Will Smith's \\"I am Legend\\" because of the ending, but was sold on the alternate version on the DVD. When I reviewed the film, a woman asked me if I had read the book and I had not. I asked my dad about the book as he has a huge library, and he offered me his first edition paperback from the '50s (with the $.035 price on the cover), I was excited, but ended up turning down the offer, as I didn't want to break the aged binding. This week I finally got a new copy and read it. It is a completely different story than either of the films, for example, Robert Neville is not an Army Doctor, he is in fact a factory worker. And there are actually vampires in the story, not just vampire like people.<br /><br />The short version is this, this is a very good story (if a bit sad), it was written as a sci-fi, but the future of the book is 1976, and the tech was a bit out of date even for '76, but what can you do? It was published in 1954. If you have an afternoon to spend on a good novella, give \\"I am Legend\\" a try.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|I am a very big fan of Darren Aronofsky so I make sure to see every one of his movies as soon as they come out.<br /><br />He is simply a visual genius, with each shot carefully planned out and calculated thoroughly so it fits in with the bigger picture of the film.<br /><br />When I first saw this film, I was at first a little disappointed. All the camera shots were handheld and a little shaky.<br /><br />I later realized the genius behind this. At first I thought he was shooting this way out of necessity, probably due to the film's low budget of $6 million. I then realized that he made the extremely visual Requiem for a Dream for only $4 million which contained hardly any (if any at all) handheld shots.<br /><br />In this film he employs a documentary type of shooting. He doesn't just show us the characters - he makes us follow them around. Handheld shots usually take me out of a film because it makes me realize that there is someone there holding a camera. Not in this case. No. This time it adds to the experience and makes it seem like we are following real people throughout their grind through each day, while trying to dodge life's nasty curveballs - sometimes they strike out.<br /><br />Randy \\"The Ram\\" Johnson is a middle-aged wrestler stuck in the independent circle, making around $100 a night and then blowing it on steroids, tanning salons and gym memberships -- all so he can keep wrestling and make another $100 so he can do it all over again while visiting the strip club to see a middle-aged stripper (Marisa Tomei) who he's falling for.<br /><br />An opportunity to relive his glory days from the 80's pop up in which he would get to fight his arch-rival, The Ayatollah, in a rematch to a fight they had 20 years earlier. He accepts the challenge.<br /><br />One night after an independent wrestling match, all the abuse and drugs his body has taken over the years comes to a head and he has a heart attack. He's told that if he ever wrestles again that he would most likely die. That's when he tries to clean is life up and patch up his relationship with his daughter who he barely knows who hates his guts while also trying to win over Marisa's character.<br /><br />Another thing that impressed me was that this was the first full-length script from writer Robert Seigel, a former writer and editor of the satirical news network The Onion. The fact that a satirical writer was able to write a film with so much heart and such complicated characters blew me away.<br /><br />The characters are all so believable and they are what make this film so powerful. That isn't Mickey Rourke on screen. No. It's trailer park resident Average Joe who has made many mistakes throughout his life who just wants a second chance to make things right.<br /><br />Only when he continues to fail does he realize that he can only do the one thing he knows how to do, and how to do well. Wrestling. Even if it means he dies.<br /><br />Damn.<br /><br />What a movie.
B000JLTR8G|4.0|\\"The Yakuza\\" is one of those slow introductory films that seems like it will be pure melodrama, but then dramatically turns into full-fledged action served with a side of revenge.  Director Sydney Pollack has no fears of educating the nondescript viewer into the world of Japanese culture, specifically that of the renowned Yakuza.  Robert Mitchum is our lead, as we travel into Japan to help a friend, reunite with family, and eventually bring down a whole slew of gangsters.  This film begins like a simple trip, all the normal stops are made and emotional heartstrings are pulled - it is dull at first.  Pollack's introduction into not only the world of the Yakuza, but also into Mitchum's past with our majority characters initially felt heavy.  While it was easy to follow these characters, more was needed to make our interaction with them more enticing, or more relevant.  The first act of this film pulls out of the gate, with no hope of finishing the race.  Mitchum is entertaining as a man knowledgeable of Japanese culture, and because we didn't quite know all of his past, he is captivatingly mischievous.  His friends, his possible daughter, his connections with the gangsters, kept my eyes glued to the screen - even if the beginning of the journey jaded me.  Then, \\"The Yakuza\\" changed.<br /><br />What was at the outset was this uninteresting voyage from point A to point B in Mitchum's past, suddenly (and surprisingly) transformed into this action film, equipped with double-cross, mayhem, and deliciously choreographed fight sequences.  It felt as if Mitchum wanted to get his feet we prior to just firing a gun throughout the film, and I don't blame him - but the pace drastically needed to be quicker.  Then Pollack introduced us to, whom many consider the \\"star\\" of this film, Ken Takakura.  My first introduction to this man, I was left desiring more.  His stone stare, the pensive ego, the unknown past (both in this film and an actor) brought a fresh page to this story.  His quiet demeanor allowed us to understand the Japanese Yakuza culture and comprehend the pride that follows.  As Takakura enters this film, it changes.  He brings life into an otherwise recycled drama - and I think Pollack knows that.  Whenever possible he uses Takakura, and weaves a story that at times feels more about Takakura than about Mitchum.  Perhaps the work of Takakura's acting ability, or more the ability that a young Paul Schrader had prior to \\"Taxi Driver\\" - this film becomes an important film once Takakura becomes involved.<br /><br />I must admit, this film took several times to get into, especially with the sluggish introduction.  I wasn't sold on Mitchum, trying to understand his relationship with everyone else surrounding him - and wondering why at nearly forty minutes we hadn't been properly introduced to the Yakuza yet.  Then, like a phoenix in the night - Takakura arrives, and we are handed a powerful film full of betrayal and consequences.  Pollack's direction, much like Mitchum's character, takes a moment to warm up, but in full swing, Pollack understands what he is doing and executes without forgiveness.  \\"The Yakuza\\" is a brilliant film, one of those classic 70s films that I could imagine watching as a child and finding respect for the Yakuza.  Like what \\"Goodfellas\\" was in the 90s, \\"The Yakuza\\" creates that same atmosphere - yet probably less watched.  My suggestion - trudge through the first thirty minutes, and be prepared for a film that requires another viewing, an attention to detail, and a combination of both intriguing acting and powerful direction.  \\"The Yakuza\\" was impressive.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****emeanor allowed us to understand the Japanese Yakuza culture and comprehend the pride that follows.

B000C3H4MC|4.0|the 5.1 sound is great- still my least faveorite talking heads cd- well next to naked- the 5.1 sound really makes the sound come alive for a cd I havent listend to in years this is a great upgrade and will intice me to listen to it more often.
B000WTZ784|3.0|I have to say that this album is a good listen, it may not be Peter Gabriel or Phil Collins singing, but at least it isn't terrible, the 90's churned out worse stuff that's for sure.    I am only giving three stars because Genesis can make better albums than this regardless of who is singing.
B001RTP48Q|5.0|If you've ever enjoyed the Pet Shop Boys then you need to hear this. While I've always found a few great songs on every PSB release this is the most consistently excellent  album I've heard from them in several years. With the exception of the final track `Legacy' (too dissonant for me) every track pulled me in with the characteristic combination of irresistible rhythms, inventive progressions, rich texturing and complex but accessible layering that only the PSBs can deliver. I can't seem to stop listening to it!
B00011RPB0|1.0|Not for people who like movies with plots. Basically, Lost in Translation follows two Americans who are in Japan on business. Both have their problems (one has a workaholic husband and doesn't know what to do with her life, the other is an actor but feels stuck doing commercials, both have failing marriages), but they are not the highlight. Neither do anything to fix their problems, but they lean on each for support. Meaning, they go to karaoke bars and arcades and drink. There is absolutely nothing meaningful about Lost in Translation.     While the back of the DVD case says an unexpected friendship blooms, their relationship is more like that of two people who don't know what they want. Ex. They act as if they want to help each other with their marriage issues, but then wind up sharing a passionate kiss before the guy (I forget his name.. It was really that boring) has to leave for the States. If some development of the romance had occurred, it might have made more sense.

B00008PC2O|5.0|They threw in the deleted scenes in the movie, some of them really weren't needed, but otheres made the movie more interesting.  Best movie out there!
B001TODCII|3.0|A movie with a premise that might have spawned a real 5-star film (in the vein of the far superior [[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 Bourne Ultimatum]]), TAKEN left me feeling, well, taken. The movie has nice action sequences, a lovely setting and some intense moments, but ultimately is too implausible and sometimes even silly. The acting is marginal, and the plot has some large holes. That said, watching scumbags get blown away by a grim-faced and seemingly indestructible angel of vengeance dad is fun enough--especially if you enjoy popcorn action flicks ([[ASIN:B000RW3VCK Commando]] anyone?!?). Just be aware of what you're getting here: this is 80 minutes of bad-guy beat-downs with a plot exists simply to try and pull it all together.<br /><br />Neeson plays an ex-CIA 'preventer' turned remorseful dad trying to earn back his daughter's affections in typically silly single-dad ways. When she decides to head to Paris with her teenybopper, valley-girl friend, overprotective dad begrudgingly agrees to let her go, but lays down some rules, and gives her an international cell phone to call him with each morning and night (something he might have learned in a previous career as a parole officer). Of course things go horribly awry and the girls are kidnapped by some deviant Albanian sex-traders. Albanians appear to be the new Russians in post cold-war thriller movies. I guess the Russians deserve a break; they had a good run.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes of the film are spent on the set-up, and by the time Neeson finally lands in Paris and starts to administer a few butt-kickings, my response was 'it's about freakin time!' since I had been led to believe this was in fact a thriller/action flick, not a commentary on overprotective, guilt ridden fathers and their whining, uncoordinated daughters--Remember when I said the acting was marginal at best? Maggie Grace who plays daughter Kim, spends most of her screen time awkwardly running from place to place, arms and legs akimbo-- or yet another divorced dad/mom are both jerk stories.<br /><br />The story thunders forward with all the subtlety of a freight train running off its rails as Neeson beats up roomfuls of villains with an ease that makes the viewer believe he could probably still do it with one arm tied behind his back. He is also most definitely a marksman; I believe he never misses who he's aiming at through the entire film--in fact he seems to administer single shot kills like Kobe drains three-pointers. Overall, his amazing marksmanship and Batman like superiority even in 10-1 combat scenarios are what really destroyed the movie for me: there is never a time when the viewer is forced to worry for Neeson. There is no 'burden' on the viewer to pull for him. We already know what's going to happen.<br /><br />In the entire film, Neeson is in real jeopardy for about 3 seconds. That's right, three seconds. That is during a brief stint as a captive in the basement of Mr. St-Clair (by far the movies most compelling baddy, a sort of super-pimp selling girls to the worlds richest scum bags) before he immediately locates an escape route and continues with his reign of holy terror. It is also St-Clair who tells Neeson \\"You have to understand, it was always only business,\\" to which Neeson replies \\"It was all personal to me,\\" a classic one-liner for which I've bumped the movie up a half star. It made me laugh.<br /><br />If there is one thing that Neeson's character is not, it's conflicted about doing what's necessary to find and save his daughter. He is as unconcerned with torture as he is with collateral damage or even shooting a complete innocent in the arm just to prove a point. Nothing is more important than saving his daughter, and while that might make him a pretty awful neighbor in real life, it comes across as refreshing in a Hollywood environment where soul-anguished mamby-pamby heroes seem to be all the rage.<br /><br />By the film's conclusion, Neeson has succeeded in killing probably abouta 100 thugs, creeps, perverts, and scum bags. --SPOILER WARNING!-- He's got his daughter back, is safe in the States, and has even earned the respect of his Ex and her Mr. Monopoly husband. Not bad. However, it was all so easy, so painless (for Neeson at least!), and the darker underpinnings of the movie handily swept under the rug (like the fate of Kim's valley-girl friend or the implications of ends-justify-the-means torture) that watching Kim head off to voice lessons with a Jewel/Brittany hybrid in the obligatory Hollywood ending is just too sappy & stupid for my tastes.<br /><br />2.5/5 Stars. Silly in many ways, but there is some fun to be had watching jerks getting head-shotted by an angry Uber Dad. Too bad it wasn't built around a better plot with a bit more intelligence (something like [[ASIN:B000XHSL9W The Punisher]] but directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Hugh Jackman--Now that I would happily pay to see).ags. --SPOILER WARNING!-- He's got his daughter back, is safe in the States, and has even earned the respect of his Ex and her Mr. Monopoly husband.

B000JLSM00|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Searchers is universally beloved, but the people who heap gallons of praise on it seem to have ignored the terribly boring and unnecessary subplot involving Vera Miles & Jeffrey Hunter, the general slow pace of the film, and the overboiled performances by basically everyone other than Wayne; some of the themes are interesting enough, but as a film The Searchers leaves a lot to be desired.      2.5/4
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love all the songs on this CD.  Even if I didn't see the movie, I would love this CD.  Each song has a special place and everytime I hear one it brings me back to that scene in the movie.  My kids love Muse, Submissive Black Hole.  They call it the \\"baseball song\\" and love to jam out to it.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Wall-E is a bit overrated (here come the unhelpful votes!), with a middle section that drags noticably after the stellar opening act and suprisingly poor animation of the human characters (in contrast to the excellent rendering of Wall-E and EVA); if you like animated films and haven't seen it, you should know going in that this isn't the end-all be-all.    3/4
B001P9KR94|3.0|I don't really sympathize with someone being offended, especially at hollywood. It happens and it sucks and though complaints are legitimate, they are no more so than any other culture which was \\"disrepsectfully\\" portrayed. THIS particular movie was not that bad. I have heard many from India or with Indian heritage who fairly enjoyed the movie, so this isn't necessarily a \\"national outrage\\" as may be portrayed by some who are offended.    SO for those who have not seen this movie, don't listen to the hype...don't listen to the offended complaints of those with high cultural sensitivity (this isn't a bad thing) .....don't even take this review too much to heart. Watch the movie. AS a movie on it's own it is average. The acting is passable but I only say passable. The movie is \\"feel good\\" and you might like that type of \\"poverty romance\\". But don't expect what you would find with some of the past Best Picture winners. This movie is ok don't get me wrong, but it is no Titanic...or LOTR.....it just isn't, if you were expecting that and came here to complain (for future reviewers) don't.     The movie is not that bad is my final answer. :P
B001DDBCUU|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Severely overlong--at 149 minutes it's roughly 5 times the length of an episode of the show--melodramatic and tame when the show (at its best) was witty and caustic, and full of moments that make one want to groan (i.e. when the phone slips, in the slowest slow motion, from Carrie's hand at her wedding) Sex and the City fails as a cinematic endeavor and makes one thankful that soon the actresses will be too old to continue their roles.    2/4
B0013D8LKO|5.0|This is a typical Kubrick movie, very strange,but also very good.  It definitely holds your interest.  I saw it originally on the Big Screen and couldn't imagine Cruise playing an innocent, but he pulled it off.  And this is the only movie I have seen with Kidman that I did not like her character at all.  But then Kubrick was very good at twisting things and people around.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A sudsy look at British history starring two Americans and an Aussie, The Other Boleyn Girl isn't out-and-out bad but it's so \\"dramatic\\" and hystrionic that few viewers (with the potential exception of middle-aged women) will find themselves sucked into the story and/or caring about the characters.      2/4

0784011710|4.0|The Bottom Line:    One of those prestige-y, Oscar-bait adaptations of a critically-acclaimed work of literature that isn't quite as good as the producers think it is, (see also: The English Patient, The Hours, The Reader, Cold Mountain, etc.) Sophie's Choice is a fairly engaging and compelling piece of drama that is enhanced by Streep and Kline but marred by a overlong running length and a not-especially good Peter MacNicol; it's worth seeing but it's not a great film.    3/4
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I have been waiting for Skylark for nearly 2 years, so I was a little disappointed with the result.  Skylark seems a little over-produced and campy when compared to her debut CD.  Not to say this isn't good, it is.  I look for better things from her in the future as she matures.

Next, I need to state that the book itself was a publisher's defect (no frontspiece, repeated pages) - I cannot see how that would be the distributors fault.    Nevertheless, the distributor corrected my credit card and apologized for the inconvenience.    I would definitely order from this distributor again - I trust them.    Tim
B00000JSJC|5.0|Now for those who still have yet to see this movie, it has lots of grown up material. So if you aren't old enough to see naked ladies and suggestive material, please skip this. To many, it would be a disturbing film. In ways, it even disturbed me. But some of the dialogue really struck home and made a lot of sense. Too much sense.<br /><br />I usually don't get the character names down pact, and this movie was no different. I remember Lenny (the main character), Mace (Angela Bassett) and Faith. But basically in a nutshell this movie was about Lenny and his lust for his old flame, Faith, who is now with someone really not worth her time. You see Lenny made a pact with Faith that'd he'd always have her back and he falls and falls for her time and time again.<br /><br />Mace has Angela playing your typically strong black women who doesn't take much (....). She is Lenny's friend and will pretty much see him through thick and thin. They make a really good team.<br /><br />The main premise also involves this crazy virtual reality device that lets you experience \\"altered\\" realities that you can't quite experience  in the real world. If you're not careful though, many bad things can happen with them.<br /><br />I don't wanna give too many hints out but I think you should watch this movie if you are 17 or older. It's got a lot to offer although a bit strange sometimes.<br /><br />It felt very indie to me and not very Hollywood. Maybe it's just me.<br /><br />It also felt quite fresh although I had seen the movie beforehand years and years before tonight.<br /><br />5 stars = A+

B0000CF300|5.0|\\"No Other\\" is often referred to as Gene Clark's finest album; and indeed - it is hard to disagree.<br /><br />Started off with two catchy country-rockers \\"Life's Greatest\\" and \\"Silver Raven\\" the \\"new\\" listener probably will expect the album to be in the the same vein as Gram Parson's solo-albums. But with the title-track the record opens towards a broader musicial approach. A little like the Doors on \\"L.A. Woman\\".<br /><br />\\"Strength of Strings\\" is a slightly weird track, that can hardly be called country - but after a long intro, the song is actually quite catchy.<br /><br />\\"From a Silver Phial\\" is a gorgeous ballad, and the outstanding track on the album - I can never get tired of this song. Weird lyrics and an arrangement quite simliar to Badfinger's \\"Name of the Game\\" - another sadly overlooked ballad. A fine alternate version is included among the bonus-tracks.<br /><br />\\"Some Misunderstanding\\" is a long slow ballad - a fine song, but a little long-winded for my taste in the long run.<br /><br />Clark is back on the country-tracks with \\"The True One\\" - great song that deserves to become a classic.<br /><br />\\"Lady of the North\\" - the original closing track - is a ballad leaving space to musical experiments.<br /><br />\\"Train Leaves Here\\" is the only \\"new\\" bonus-track - another fine country-song.<br /><br />The other six bonus-tracks are all alternate versions of songs on the original album; all fine and releaseworthy, but not markedly different from the originally released versions.<br /><br />All songs were written by Clark ( two in collaboration ) and show him as a versatile and gifted songwriter.<br /><br />Musically Clark is helped by a long list of friends like Chris Hillman, Tim Scmit, Jerry McGee, Richard Greene, Jo Lala, Butch Trucks and Lee Sklar.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|I can't remember the last time a movie presented such an opportunity for discussion. Did Father Flynn or did he not behave inappropriately? Can Sister Aloysius' \\"certainty\\" be trusted or is she merely an intolerant (or disturbed) social dinosaur? These are questions the viewer will be asking. The movie swings both ways equally...giving evidence to Father Flynn's guilt and his innocence. The one element that really stood out for me was how Father Flynn seemed to use his pulpit to plant seeds of doubt in those who would be against him. If he was a manipulator, then he was a very, VERY good one...a \\"sheep in wolves clothing\\". On the other hand Sister Aloysius comes across as mean; almost cruel. But she has a will of iron and a steely determination. She will not back down from her sense of \\"certainty\\" regarding the character of Father Flynn...even when her only evidence is her observation of him touching a young boy's hand. She refuses to follow the protocol of the church and is willing to be cast out from its doors...all to protect the welfare of a child. Sister Aloysius is the only one not swayed, BUT in the end her humanity reveals itself. This is a powerful and disconcerting film. The performances were nothing short of amazing. I mean, who else but Meryl Streep could have pulled off the Sister Aloysius character. Phillip Seymore Hoffman as Father Flynn was amazing as well, although I don't think it was as demanding a role as that of Sister Aloysius. One final thought: listen for Sister Aloysius' subtle attempts at humor that no one appears to comprehend. This film is a definite \\"must-see\\".
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I'd heard some of Pink's music previously, but when I saw her on Ellen, I was inspired enough to purchase this CD. It's great; shows the depth and ability of a great star.
B001JG8AU6|4.0|This book is definitely not for everyone, as the humor is often times crude. But half of the essays are well thought out and had me laughing out loud. The narration is what you'd expect from a professional comedian. David's style is a bit monotone, but that is part of his whole appeal. I particularly liked how he gives humanlike personalities to inanimate objects. It's a combination of childlike humor with a jaded adult outlook.<br /><br />I liked the chapter about his stay in Japan. He cleverly avoided the clich&eacute;s most comedians write about and gave us a nice perspective into his experiences learning Japanese.

B001IAOEXU|1.0|Just bought these triggers after reading all the good reviews here and I must say I am very dissapointed. They feel way too akward and nobody here seems to mention that the back of the trigger can sometimes (often) hit the side of your middle finger and even pinch you which can become really annoying.     For one, the triggers were placed too high for my liking and was often pressing them without wanting to. If your like me and use your middle fingers for the triggers you will know what I am talking about. I was playing killzone 2 and was thowing grenades by accident... Even my friends agreed that the controller felt more comfortable without them. Sure, the normal triggers can cause a slip every so often but id rather have that then a constant rubbing and pinching caused by these \\"real triggers\\". To every man his own.

0061767581|5.0|L.A. CANDY  LAUREN CONRAD  Contemporary YA  Collins    Rating: 4.5 Enchantments    Jane Roberts has just moved to Los Angeles with her best friend, Scarlett, in hopes of stepping out of her comfort zone. She just didn't expect to step this far out of her comfort zone and become the star of what is the soon-to-be the popular reality T.V. show L.A. CANDY. Between her internship with event planner Fiona Chen, her friendship with Scarlett and her somewhat dubious relationship with new friend/crush Braeden, things in L.A. won't stay sweet for long.    Scarlett Harp moved to L.A. with her lifelong best friend to attend U.S.C. and enjoy life in the city. But there's a lot of adjustments to make, like getting used to their small and dingy apartment that Jane simply calls `charming'. When the two girls go to Les Deux and end up meeting famed TV producer Trevor Lord, they couldn't imagine the turn their lives are suddenly about to take. A turn that frankly Scarlett finds herself regretting.    I really enjoyed L.A. CANDY. Jane's a likeable character, fighting to navigate life in Los Angeles when suddenly her entire life is changed again before she can get a true handle on things as they were when she becomes the star of a reality show. It seems in an instant, everything changes again--their apartment for one. Gone is their small, cramped apartment and they find themselves in pure luxury. Her cold and slightly scary boss even undergoes a transformation when the cameras are around and Jane finds herself suddenly attracted to someone she never thought possible. Can she really like two guys at the same time?    Hands down my favorite scene is Jane's first date in Los Angeles with Paolo, the cute guy she met at work when he accidentally walked into her office. If that wasn't nerve-wracking enough, not only is it her first date with him, but it's also her first date with an entire camera crew around.     Ms. Conrad pens a highly entertaining debut with L.A. CANDY, creating a worldthat takes the reader behind the scenes of reality T.V. and some of L.A.'s hottest nightspots to show that things aren't quite what they seem on T.V., especially for two girls who aren't fully prepared to deal with sudden fame. Equally memorable is the `villain' of the show, Madison, who's totally willing to do whatever it takes to take what she believes is rightfully hers--being the star of the show. She's truly a devious character, without question and what she's willing to do to get Jane out of the picture is definitely shocking. Jane and Scarlett are two memorable characters and with the major cliffhanger ending, I can't wait to see what Ms. Conrad has in store for Jane in the next book.     Ending with a major jaw dropper of a cliffhanger, readers will no doubt be demanding to know what happens next to this group of entertaining characters. Anyone who loves books about life in Hollywood will no doubt enjoy this debut read by Lauren Conrad    Lauren Conrad is the star of MTV's number-one hit show, The Hills.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|I finally got a copy of this universally reputed movie, after many of its characters and themes already enticed my curiosity through the years, and, basically, as I wished not to miss such a milestone in Peter Seller's career (being a staunch fan of him as inspector Clouseau). Well, I have been pleased and over-pleased by every minute of the movie, and found Seller's acting over the top. The sadistic smile of Strangelove while describing mass-destruction or the \\"unfortunate\\" case of a women/men 10-to-1 ratio in the post-atomic scenario were pure delight. But Sellers is not the only star shining in the movie. Praise be also to Kubrick's hilarious plethora of funny (but meaningful) names, from U.S. generals Jack D. Ripper to Turgidson, to the soviet ambassador De Sadesky and premier Kissoff...<br />And what more smartly funny than the mocking of the then well-known Cold War vocabulary, as the \\"peace race\\" or the \\"mineshaft gap\\"? Obviously, that's not a movie to be easily understood (and thus enjoyed) without some knowledge of contemporary history, politics and even military doctrine (the automatically-triggered apocalyptic reaction was less theatrical than one could think nowadays, in contemporary military conceptions, and the pre-emptive strike funnily described through Turgidson's delirious suggestion was about to be launched in at least two occasion in real history), but given the high level of Kubrick's productions this is just the masterpiece one could expect from such a director.

Ender, a genius boy with raw, unpolished skills for command, must endure extreme hardships that would break a boy of lesser strength. Following Ender through the years of his life, I felt sympathy and sorrow for his lost childhood.   At just six years of age, Ender Wiggin is used to pain. Everyday, his older brother pushes him around. Once the government takes away their surveillance (they are looking for brilliant children who might stand a chance at becoming soldiers), there is nothing standing between him and the greatest pain he will feel. So he fights back. The next day, a man comes to Ender's house, offering him a chance to become a soldier. Ender soon finds himself at a school in the stars.   But his life at the Battle School is not meant to be one of happiness. The teachers, including Colonel Graff, the man Ender thought was his friend, isolate him from the other students. Throughout his years at Battle School, Ender grapples with bullies, unfair battles, and even near death.    Down on Earth, Ender's siblings plot and plan. They want power no matter what the price. Valentine, his sister, sells out Ender for a medal. Peter tortures little animals. Slowly Ender's siblings grow closer and Valentine starts to hate herself for being like Peter. They create for themselves fake identities on the computer. Their identities, Locke and Demosthenes, see two different opinions. They debate with each other, placing a seed of doubt in those who read their postings. When Valentine (as Demosthenes) is invited to write a weekly column for a newsnet, she accepts. As they gather more power and followers, they are asked questions that they don't want to answer. Valentine becomes frustrated that her fake identity is so influential when she doesn't believe in the things she is writing.   Just as Ender starts to enjoy battle school, the teachers graduate him to command school. There, his enemy, Mazer Rackham, teaches him. Ender commands a simulated fleet of starships, defeating computer enemies. Haunted by dreams of alien buggers and by Valentine, Ender sleeps restlessly. His sanity slowly breaks down and he tires himself out. When his final test comes, Ender plays his hardest, not realizing that winning this game is more than just winning a game.   Ender's Game has a grabbing plot that sucks the reader right in. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Ender is a strong but lonely character that I loved right away. As I read the book I loved his friends as well, most especially the charming Alai. Although the characters are a bit unrealistic in the way that they think and write, I prefer it this way because then I feel as though I'm not reading about someone dumb. This is the best science fiction book I've read in a while. The philosophy in this book can be determined as right or wrong and could be debated for hours. Its sequel, Speaker for the Dead, has won the Hugo and Webula award. Ender's Game is a book that I could read again and again.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|DVD was shipped and received quickly, however was supposed to have been new. DVD received had no plastic outer wrapping on case and appeared to have been opened. DVD plays fine and appeared clean, so I am not spending any time on this issue.  Am accepting as-is, but if this had been a gift, I really would have expected an unopened package in accordance with price and description.
B001SO69IY|4.0|This CD just came out of nowhere for me since I didn't expect them to release a part 2, but this is dope.  The lead single with Bun B and the Pimp C hook is classic and the whole CD has that dope chemistry that red and meth have and others do not.  The production is on some nice and smooth tip, a little commercial, but I appreciate it when done right.  Not many wack songs on this one and something your girl will dig as well.  Hopefully they won't wait as long for Part 3!

0440244870|1.0|I bought the 3 book boxed set because I LOVE chick-lit and with all the rave reviews I was bound to like this one as well. I could not become connected with the character! She was too stupid, immature, and ridiculous for words. I went ahead a finished the set because I had already paid for it, each one just as bad as the first. I lent it to a friend I exchange books with, and she didn't even finish the first book before returning all three. I can't believe they made this into a movie (maybe the movie will redeem the book), they should have used the money they put into this movie for a movie about The Little Lady Agency. Now that is a fantastic book and series!
B001TK3XO0|5.0|This book was heart-wrenching but excellently written. I look forward to reading the Kite Runner next.
0743290127|3.0|Mildly interesting read. I don't think it will become one of the books I re-read. Was not a good as I had hoped. It was not so bad that I did not finish. I still liked it. Perhaps my hopes were too high, that tends to ruin many things. So buy it or borrow it and give the book a shot to see what you think.
1416972242|4.0|I'm always scared to begin a series, trilogy, etc. After reading City of Bones in one day flat I had to rush to the library and get this book. While I do agree that It's hard to find out just HOW Clary and Jace loved each other as much as they did with the short amount of time knowing each other, I was tangled in the messy weave of their relationship. They were siblings...but I had already grown to love them in a different way, so it was a battle inside my head. All in all, this book was really good. I laughed, and gasped in certain parts.     It was a great combination of Lord of the Rings, Twilight, and Harry Potter. I didn't think I'd find another thrilling and exciting series like those, but the Mortal Instruments is definitely another great one. I love the humor and sarcastic qualities of Jace. While his character isn't the sappy, lovey dovey kind like Edward could be, he was fierce and just as intriguing. Clary was a little annoying because she can't seem to make up her mind, but I think that is  normal. We can't like every decision every character makes. Plus, they are young and still trying to figure out who they are and what they want.     Overall, a Great book, and I can't wait to read City of Glass. I highly recommend it!
B001NXBRJG|4.0|Innumerable reviews are available across the internet extolling this unusual movie. \\"The Matrix\\" is certainly one of my ten favorite movies ever.    And many reviews are available praising the picture quality and sound quality of the movie as presented in this particular package, \\"The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book [Blu-ray].\\" The picture is nearly flawless, save occasional graininess. The sound is demo-worthy, especially if you have a TrueHD receiver. There are dozens of hours of great previously released extras, almost all of it in standard definition. Plus there is a new \\"picture in picture\\" mode that's quite interesting.    I have only two small observations for you to consider as you prepare to buy this disc (of course you *will* buy this disc, because it's stupid to pay three times more for the ultimate collection, and because you want this great flick in your library in high definition). First observation: the \\"book\\" included with the disc is nothing more than marketing fluff and will not be of interest to...well, to anyone. For a great Matrix book you can really sink your teeth into, check out \\"The Art of the Matrix\\" edited by Spencer Lamm.    Second, every time you put this disc in your Blu-Ray player, you will be treated like a criminal with the following message. Every time.    SUPPORT ANTI-PIRACY  FIVE YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON    DO NOT COPY, DISTRIBUTE OR PUBLICLY EXHIBIT MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS, INCLUDING UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS OVER THE INTERNET. IF YOU DO - WHETHER FOR MONETARY GAIN OR NOT - YOU RISK SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES.    FINES OF $250,000    Why present this message, EVERY TIME, to the person who followed the rules and paid for this disc? I don't know about you, but I don't like doing business with people who treat me like a criminal when I use their products.     These irritants will not keep you from buying \\"The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book [Blu-ray].\\" You know you want it. It is useless to resist. The Matrix has you.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have been sharpening my own knives for years using the Gatco system.  Normally I wouldn't trust my knives to anything but me and my Gatco.  However, I do tend to spend a lot of time out in the woods and having a portable knife sharpener is an important part of my gear.<br /><br />I was initially very hesitant to try this style of sharpener since the sharpening angle is fixed and not determined by me.  Having now used the Smith's sharpener on several of my hunting and camping knives, I am recommending it to all my friends and have even purchased one for my hunting partner.<br /><br />Great product, and I would buy it even at twice the price.

B00005JO9J|5.0|Prior to purchase I had not seen a single episode.  After purchasing the First Season, I conclud that you really have to see it from the beginning.  Having done so, I say this is a GREAT SHOW - grabs you from the first episode.  As with all good TV shows and videos the characters and their interpersonal relationships rather than the plot drive the show.  In this show, there are many recurring characters.  All have strengths and weaknesses and they are compelling both individually and as they relate to each other with respect their personal lives and with the pressures of working in a life and death environment.  None is a total stereotype.  Each at some point surprises the viewer with a personality characteristic or personal history that is unexpected and untelegraphed.  Each finds the value of maintaing friendships and/or relationships despite the recognized flaw(s) of the others.    The discs default to English subtitles, presumably for the hearing impaired.  This is an distracting set up that is also present on the Season 2 disc.

0525478183|5.0|There's so much to love about Paper Towns. Q is your average, boring teenager, and that is somehow exhilirating to read about when he's thrown from his comfort zone into the craziness of Margo Roth Speiglman, who is like the live, somewhat more reigned in version of Alaska Young, fiery, intense, magical.     I love John Green's female characters almost as much as I love the books he writes. They flow and expand and never lose the intesity and epicness they held at the beginning. They move you, they never lose you. He writes Paper Towns with the loving and hopeful care that a father has. You can tell he wants these characters to find each other, but the logistics of life keep them apart. All I can say is read Paper Towns.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I got this as a gold box deal of the day for $39.99.  Maybe I wouldn't be as emphatic in my opinion if I had paid 50% more.  That's probably the right price point to buy this if you already own the SD set.  I would not have paid $50+.  This way I get the added benefit of being able to give the other set to someone who should already have seen it.  I've only watched the pilot Serenity but I think the special effects scenes look improved.   The scavenger scene early in the episode looked great.  I always had a hard time picking serenity out of the flotsam in the standard definition, now it's crystal clear.    Maybe wait until you can grab it for <$40 and you've found someone you want to give your old copy to.  Then it's 5+ stars all the way.

B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Wilhelf Kempff's Beethoven cycle, dating from the 1960s, has recently been reissued at a budget price.  There have been many recordings of the 32 Beethoven sonatas, including an ongoing series by Idil Biret, a student of Kempff's. Much as I am enjoying listening to Biret, Kempff's cycle remains a grand achievement.  There is no better way to explore the Beethoven sonatas.  Listeners coming to the sonatas for the first time or listeners who have heard many readings of the sonatas will have their appreciation of this music enhanced by these performances.  The remainder of this review is taken from my review of an earlier, more expensive, issue of Kempff's sonatas.<br /><br />Beethoven's \\"Tagebuch\\" includes the following famous entry: \\"The starry heavens above, the moral law within -- Kant!\\" Beethoven was alluding to Kant's statement in the \\"Critique of Practical Reason\\" of the two things that filled him with awe. But, in a simple way, Beethoven's statement could be read to show two related ways of understanding his music: the first as heroic, heaven-storming, and outwardly directed, and the second as inward, reflective, and meditative. Some of Beethoven's music can be seen as occupying on or the other end of the polarity. Much of the music somehow occupies both ends.<br /><br />The same holds true as a rough approach to the performance of Beethoven's music -- including the 32 piano sonatas. Some artists emphasize the dramatic, rugged and virtuosic characteristics of the sonatas while others focus upon the music's inward and introspective qualities. The great German pianist Wilhelm Kempff's classic recording of the complete piano sonatas is clearly within the latter approach. Kempff (1895 -- 1991) recorded the complete Beethoven sonata-cycle twice, the first time in the 1950s and the second time in the 1960s. I had the original version on LP and purchased the CD set when LPs became obsolete. I recently had the opportunity to relisten to Kempff's renditions of the sonatas in their entirety.<br /><br />Kempff's readings of the sonatas are highly personal and introspective. His tempos tend to be slow and fluid, the pedal is used a great deal, phrasing is highly legato, and volume is, for the most part, subdued and restrained. He offers a metaphysical, thoughtful reading of Beethoven which probes within. It is a moving and convincing way of rendering the sonatas, and I came away from my experience with the set over the past several days with a renewed devotion to this music. I have attempted about half of the sonatas myself over the years on the piano.<br /><br />Beethoven's sonatas date from his youthful years in Bonn before his 1792 move to Vienna (the two sonatas of opus 49) to about 1822 (opus 111), five years before the composer's death. Thus, they occupied Beethoven for almost the entirety of his creative life. In listening to this complete set, the listener can follow Beethoven's development essentially chronologically and learn more first-hand about the sonatas and about the changes in Beethoven's styles of composition than can be gained from reading many studies.<br /><br />Listeners interested in a complete set of the Beethoven sonatas will probably have some familiarity with some of the better-known<br />named sonatas, such as the \\"Pathetique\\", opus 13, the \\"Moonlight\\" opus 27 no. 2, the \\"Waldstein\\", opus 53, or the \\"Appassionata\\", opus 57. After falling in love with some of these works, it will be time for the listener to explore the entire series.<br /><br />Kempff brings his own personal and introspective readings to each of these familar works. I think he does best with the rondo finale of the \\"Waldstein,\\" with the \\"Moonlight\\" sonata, and with the two final movements of the \\"Tempest\\", opus 31 no. 2. His readings of these familiar works on the whole will offer fresh insight into these great sonatas.<br /><br />But the greatest attraction of this set is the opportunity it provides to explore some of Beethoven's less frequently performed works. Again, Kempff is at his best in works of an introspective character. Thus, those coming to the sonata-cycle for the first time will enjoy his performances of the opus 26 sonata, with the opening variations and the celebrated funeral march, of opus 78, 79, and 81a (\\"Les Adieux\\"), of opus 90, and of opus 101, 109, 110, and the great end to the series, opus 111. Opus 90, 101, and 109 are particular favorites of mine, and Kempff plays them beautifully.<br /><br />There is yet another group of sonatas that also receive excellent readings on the set. This group includes two excellent ambitious early works, opus 2 no. 3 and opus 7 (another favorite), the three sonatas of opus 10, the under-appreciated opus 22, the companion to the more famous \\"Moonlight\\" sonata, opus 27 no. 1, opus 31 no. 3 and the enigmatic opus 54, sandwiched between the \\"Waldstein\\" and the \\"Appassionata\\". The magisterial and heroic \\"Hammerklavier\\" sonata, opus 106, is in a class by itself. Each listeners's choices and fovorites among the 32 will vary and change with time and repeated hearings. This collection is an excellent introduction to all of them.<br /><br />There are many recordings of the set of 32 sonatas and many approaches to the interpretation of Beethoven. His music is broader and deeper than any single reading. I have lived with my set of Kempff for a long time and am still moved and inspired by his playing of this inexhaustible music. Listeners wanting to get to know this great body of work will find much to cherish in these performances by Wilhelm Kempff.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanin works of an introspective character.

0385341008|4.0|Looking back on this book, I have to say it is a wonderful story as a whole and I believe I was a little sad when it ended. The story is written like a collection of letters and for me this was a little hard to follow at first. The plot is centered on a female war writer who is trying to make sense of the post wartime chaos and her career; when she receives a letter from an avid fan of Charles Lamb. It seems the letter writer Dawsey Adams, recovered her novel from a used bookstore and is hoping she will help him by sending more books by the Author. In his letter he mentions the formation of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and this peaks the interest of Juliet. Through a series of correspondence with the members of the Society she is inspired to write their stories about the formation of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society while Guernsey was under German occupation. This book is lovely nourishment for the soul and a lovely example of how love and friendship can sustain anyone through the hardest and scariest of times.
0143034901|5.0|Smooth.  That is the word that describes this book.  The plot is smooth.  The characters are smoothly moved throughout the story.  The plot is smoothly interwoven with each of the mysteries forming a seamless storyline.  The prose is very smooth and soothing.  The rhythm is smooth - as smooth as jazz.  As I started this book, I had the fear that the translation would be half-hearted and difficult; not so, it is very smooth and elegant.<br /><br />Much has been said about the plot and characters specific to the story, so I'll skip that.  But I would be remiss if I did not point out a couple of things.  The depth of the characters is rarely seen in today's novels.  There is a sense that you are in Barcelona and tagging along with the characters on their journey.<br /><br />Many times when reading a novel, the reader is tempted to skip ahead and get to the meatier portions of the story.  I had no such inclination while reading this book.  The words rise from the page to paint a story and just reading them is pleasure.  Getting to the end of the book is not something that becomes a goal.  I give very few books a 5 star rating, but this is one of them.

B001EOOQF6|5.0|I am a huge fan of Black Sabbath, they are simply one of heavy metal's all time greatest bands ever, no questions asked. I've been listening to their albums from the Ozzy Osbourne era ever since I first got into them back in my final year in high school. Lately, I've really been getting into some of their stuff from the Ronnie James Dio era as of late. I bought \\"The Mob Rules\\" from 1981 about a few months back and I've really been listening to it a lot, I just love it. This album is just excellent, it is definitely one of the best albums in the entire Black Sabbath catalog. This is also an amazing follow up to 1980's \\"Heaven and Hell\\" which is the best Sabbath album with Dio on vocals in my opinion. This also marks the first album to feature Vinny Appice on the drums as well, and he would later join Dio's solo band for the 1983 debut album \\"Holy Diver\\". The band's musicianship on The Mob Rules is simply amazing. I also give a thumbs up to Martin Birch's producing and engineering on this album, it's just excellent. Dio's vocals are just fierce and powerful yet melodic throughout the album, and he also adds an element of sadness in his voice as well (track three \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" and the beginning part of track eight \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" are very good examples of that). Words just can't describe how amazing Dio's vocals are. He is truly one of heavy metal's best and most legendary singers, no questions asked. Tony Iommi's riffing is just amazing on here, he is truly of the best riff writers in heavy metal, and not to mention that he can also play awesome solos as well, and this album is just full of them. Geezer Butler is an awesome bassist, as he rides high with great, strong, audible bass lines while skinsman Vinny Appice delivers an all around rock solid performance behind the drum kit.<br /><br />The songs.<br /><br />Kicking off The Mob Rules is the classic, fierce and high octane opener \\"Turn Up The Night\\" which features powerful, commanding vocals from Dio, fast heavy charging riffs and wailing solos from Tony, and fast pounding drums from Vinny, while track two \\"Voodoo\\" is a more mid-paced number, but it is very catchy and another excellent song that features a great main riff along with awesome singing from Dio and we also have a great solo from Iommi around 2:20. My personal favorite song on here is track three \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" which is a slower yet dark, atmospheric and powerful epic cut that is highlighted by a nice mellow acoustic intro, along with slow and dark ominous riffs and another amazing solo by Iommi, and amazingly powerful yet heartfelt vocals from Dio to boot. What an epic this song really is, it's just brilliant. I mean, you just have to listen to it to believe it. Moving onwards \\"E5150\\" is a strange, dreary, and hallucinatory like keyboard/guitar instrumental that leads straight into the high energy title track (another one of my favorites here) that boasts excellent, catchy high energy riffs and blistering solos from Tony, hammering drums from Vinny, and fierce, commanding vocals from Dio as well. Next up, track six \\"Country Girl\\" is yet another great song that boasts a huge, crunchy main riff, plus more of Dio's magnificent vocals. Track seven \\"Slipping Away\\" is highlighted by a great catchy main guitar riff from Tony, as well as a really cool guitar and bass lead trade-off section by both Iommi and Butler in the middle part of the song, while track eight \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" starts off soft and slow, but then later turns into an awesomely energetic, high octane metal onslaught with great high energy riffing and another blistering Iommi solo, along with more powerful, commanding vocals from Ronnie and more energetic drumwork from Vinny as well, and the closing track \\"Over and Over\\" is another slower song, but an excellent way to close the album. Ronnie's vocals are melodic and very heartfelt, and there's also some fantastic guitar soloing byTony as well.<br /><br />Overall, The Mob Rules is a true masterpiece of a heavy metal album that I highly recommend to every fan of Black Sabbath, Dio, and heavy metal alike. True, this album in my opinion may fall a bit tad short behind \\"Heaven and Hell\\", but it is still pure heavy metal gold as far as I am concerned. Anyways, buy this album now, play it loud and proud, and raise those horns...Overall, The Mob Rules is a true masterpiece of a heavy metal album that I highly recommend to every fan of Black Sabbath, Dio, and heavy metal alike.

The terrors were real and the urgency felt real, too. Excellent!
0312370849|1.0|Give me a break!  If I had to read one more stupid sentence like \\"his eyes pleaded with me\\" or \\"he looked at me as if to say 'read more'\\" I was going to scream.  Half-way through the book I wished I could lock Julia Jarmond into a cupboard so I could get on with the only interesting part of the book - Sarah's story.  It had potential to be great based on the premise, but overall it was just so severely lacking.  It was like Writing-A-Novel 101.  So many describing words.  \\"He said curtly\\", \\"I answered pertly\\", \\"I sighed impatiently\\".  They should have marketed this to teens.  I felt like the author was insulting my intelligence.<br />Tatiana certainly had her thesaurus nearby. Haha but my favorite line - \\"I flinched at the irony in her voice\\" .. ummm, what??

B000VFGQUC|4.0|The video of the '77 tour and the '75 CD alone are worth buying this set. The Robertson/Gorham version of Lizzy was always the best. The interviews are really great also. A lot of insight to the band. Although I loved the \\"Black Rose\\" album, I think they really peaked in '78 with Live And Dangerous. Anyone who is a fan of the best lineup Lizzy ever had will want this!!!!! Those of us who never got to see them live will also want this!!!!!! RIP Phil!!!! You ROCK!!!!!!!

0393307050|5.0|Master & Commander is the opening book in a 21 book Aubrey/Maturin series.  This book's purpose is to introduce the reader, and thus does not have a plot per se, but is really vignettes.  O'Brian uses dialog true to the period, so it's a bit of an awkward read for newbies like me, but absorbing and captivating all the same.  I seriously enjoyed the book and intend to continue with the series.  Can't put it much better than that.  Definitely a worthwhile read if you're into historical fiction or sea tales.  5 stars!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|There are two kinds of Beatles fans - those that credit John Lennon & Paul McCartney with being the pillars of the band, and those that appreciate George Harrison for the spiritual, whimsical quality he brought to the team. I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'get' Harrison, will understand more than anyone what sort of musical genius this man actually was. While McCartney spent years after the bands' breakup making one chorus-y, pop song-filled album after the other, it was Harrison who continually pushed himself to become more and more experimental and creative, and every album of his has been so different, so refreshing, and as a whole, they represent a very diverse catalog of recorded music. Its difficult to imagine that one man could create such varied work, but that remains the wonder that is George.<br /><br />Cut to 2009, and we have the third officially released compilation of George's greatest hits. I guess we have Dhani Harrison to thank for this, and while I rate this 5 stars, it should have ideally been a 2-CD set, considering the wealth of material that Harrison has behind him. As a listener who considers \\"All Things Must Pass\\" as the best solo album by a Beatle (nothing by Lennon or McCartney comes close - those Paul did surpass himself with \\"Chaos & Creation\\" from a few years ago), this album pays fine homage to that 3-CD set.<br /><br />The issue is that ALL of Harrisons' solo works are so absolutely essential, that culling tracks from any of them borders on unjustifiable - but of course that needs to be done in the case of a Greatest Hits collection. His second solo album, \\"Living in the Material World\\" (which sold less than his debut, but is still a classic) should have been given more due. The lead single from that set, \\"Give me Love (Give me Peace on Earth)\\" has all the strains of his Bangladesh concert - and this is present here, sounding better than ever before.<br /><br />The prime omissions come from \\"Dark Horse\\", which remains one of Harrisons' lowest-charting and most underrated CDs. Any listener should try to track down a copy of that album (just for its stunning cover art, if nothing else), as it contains so many vital Harrison classics, such as \\"Far East Man\\" and \\"Simply Shady\\".<br /><br />You will also find that much of George's output from the 1970s has been neglected here, which is a pity. Some of his best work came on \\"33 1/3\\" from 1976, and his self-titled record from 1979 (which thankfully is represented on this hits collection). Along the way, there are some oddities. \\"Cheer Down\\", which previously was only a compilation track, was also a song written with Tom Petty for the \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" soundtrack - many people have never heard of this song, so this is a great inclusion.<br /><br />Also, this record contains the three songs that George made magical for The Beatles - \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it would have been great to see them excluded in favor of some of George's solo works in his later career - there are so many hits that are not represented, especially many of his UK singles that failed to chart in the US. The Beatles songs that are present on this album are in fact from Harrisons' solo Bangladesh concert recording - which is little comfort to those of us expecting tracks from \\"Somewhere in England\\", or \\"Gone Troppo\\" (two more vastly underrated solo Harrison records). On a better note, \\"When We Was Fab\\" from \\"Cloud Nine\\" is present.<br /><br />Finally, this is not a perfect collection, but certainly the best Harrison collection that is currently available. His first compilation, from 1976, is clearly not his best effort, considering how much it relied upon his Beatles hits to flesh itself out. The current disc should have indeed been a double disc, but the attention paid to the song selection is satisfying. Still, this is by no means a comprehensive Harrison collection. Idoubt anything can be. He is one recording artist whose back-catalog is hardly remembered and always overlooked. I personally consider much of his solo work better and even more listenable than his work with the Beatles.<br /><br />\\"Let It Roll\\" runs for 78 minutes, which is great because it is indeed 'stuffed' with Harrison hits (technically, all of his Billboard Hot 100 hits are present here). As an introduction to a quiet and talented songwriter, this is a stellar way to get into his work and life. As a stand-alone disc, this is riveting and vibrant. For Beatles fans and longtime Harrison followers such as myself, this will fall way off the mark, but taken for what it is, this is a loving compilation that deserves all the sales and adoration it can get.<br /><br />Five Stars.tist whose back-catalog is hardly remembered and always overlooked.

0307346617|4.0|When I was given this book - and therefore forced to read it (thank you, Carl, wherever you are now) - I was surprised to find that it is actually excellent reading fare!     While, yes, there are zombies, and the pseudo-science that is trotted out to explain them is lame, and therefore the intelligent reader has to play a few mental tricks to be able to suspend disbelief, there are amazingly true insights and foresights here. IF something on this scale really happened, the reactions of society, government, the military, etc., all ring true.     The book is well paced and constructed, for the most part. Each little drama unfolds with its own feel and characters, the pace leaps and then calms, only to re-accelerate, and the timeline shifts forward and back, to fill in a collage of the full picture. In the process, it manages to be absolutely riveting. I might even have to read the Survival Guide...
0618918248|5.0|This is the first book I have read on Atheism and I couldn't help but be astonished at the way Dawkins has so clearly and methodically dismantled all of the most common arguments in support for religion in the 21st century.  He outlines the ways in which religion continues to (successfully) implement a Medieval system of fear, guilt, childhood indoctrination, and suppression of information in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence for Darwin's theories and the true nature of the universe.      I think this book will give many readers the experience of waking up from a deep sleep after growing up in our politically correct culture of blind tolerance for glaring scientific fallacies, feeble attempts at moral justification, and the a la carte adoption of Biblical laws that have become so common as Ancient religions try to keep themselves relevant in modern times.  Furthermore, without leaning too hard on the usual white elephants (Crusades, Witch Trials, Spanish Inquisition, Catholic Sex Abuse Scandal) he makes numerous chilling points as to how religion inflicts serious emotional pain in children, fosters crippling ignorance within the educational establishment, and inspires unspeakable acts of violence in otherwise good people.    So who should read this book?  Everyone.   Will it convert many believers to Atheism?  Don't hold your breath.  As Dawkins has stated, unlike scientific minds, most in the religious community have made their decisions before the questions are even asked and will only read it in attempts to debunk the author's points - as evidenced by the flood of books written in response to the mainstream success of this work.  The rest won't pick it up at all because they are truly afraid of what they might learn - not to mention that they don't want to offend the all-seeing, all-knowing watcher in the sky.
0553573403|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best books written that I've ever read. And it will instantly make you wanna read the rest of the series.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0026NWBY2|3.0|George Harrison deserves a proper Greatest Hits package. His first \\"Best Of' in the 1970's consisted of one album side of George's solo hits, and the other side Beatles songs. Not a great overview. Much later on, WB released Best Of The Dark Horse Years which contained most of his hits from that era and main album cuts, but neglected \\"This Song\\" and felt incomplete without the Capitol/Apple classics. Now in 2009 we have this collection, and while it is not labeled as a Greatest Hits collection, it sure has been marketed as one. Among George's Billboard hit singles missing from this collection are \\"Dark Horse\\", \\"You\\", \\"Bangla Desh/Deep Blue\\", \\"Ding Dong Ding Dong\\", \\"Crackerbox Palace\\". \\"Wake Up My Love\\" and the aforementioned \\"This Song\\". Instead we get some odd inclusionos of album tracks and live versions of Beatles classics. While none of it is bad, it seems a wasted opportunity. In addition to the rest of the hit singles, key album tracks that got a lot of play include \\"Awaiting On You All\\",   \\"If Not For You\\", \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" and wouldn't it have been nice to include a couple of Traveling Wilburys classics that included George up  front like \\"Handle With Care\\" and \\"End Of The Line\\". I realize that compilations hardly ever please everyone, and we all have a cuts or two we feel were left off most Greatest Hits packages, but this one is so far off the mark that is just seems silly. If you're looking for a definitive classic hits collection by George - this isn't it. However the remastering is superb and the music is still great all the way through. and it's nice they included \\"I Don't Want To Do It\\" from the Porky's 3 Soundtrack. Maybe someday soon they will put out a (perhaps double) CD anthology and get it right!
0385512058|2.0|This book was written to add one more bullet to Keith Ferrazzi's list of accomplisments.  The ideas are superficial, hardly revolutionary, and not much different from the simple epiphanies that come into one's life at one point or another.  To my surprise, for as many 'connections' as the author seems to have, I don't recall any of them providing any direct advice/quote(s) for the book.  There's too much arrogance in this book to leave one enlightened.  There are some feeble attempts at balancing his ego, but I would be hard pressed to believe that they came from Mr. Ferrazzi himself.
B000000OAA|5.0|After the elaborate \\"Queen II\\", Queen simplified their sound and rocked harder than ever on \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\". This was the last of their albums recorded on 16-track. Their acclaimed masterwork and follow-up \\"A Night At The Opera\\" benefitted from having 24 tracks to work with.    Producer Roy Thomas Baker was into \\"big\\" productions at the time - almost like a British Phil Spector. During these years he focused mainly on Queen and Denmark's superstar rock band Gasolin'. Both groups had 5 albums produced by him, and he was a major factor in their success.     This album yielded their first international hit single \\"Killer Queen\\", and it's still my favorite song they've ever done. The entire first half is just one Queen classic after another, but it's the second half that makes this my most played disc by them. The whole \\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\" suite is thrilling. They virtually invented speed-metal on \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", and the vaudeville/music hall influences exhibited on \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\\" are a pure delight. The suite segues and flows beautifully, and is majestic and fun. Mercury and May are in top form.    For a rocking good time, you can't do better than Queen's \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\".

B001SMC91M|2.0|Tell 'Em What Your Name Is! is the full length debut CD from Black Joe Lewis and the Honey Bears.  It is a CD that is high on potential but low on what it actually delivers.  It seems to run between two similar but distinct styles.  Lewis tries (but fails miserably) to channel James Brown on tunes such as \\"Sugarfoot\\" while other songs such as \\"Big Booty Woman\\" and \\"Humpin'\\" seem more Blues Brothers oriented.  In both styles, the instrumentation is pretty good.  You'll find lots of horns, guitar, and funky bass lines that combine for a good recipe of R&B/Blues.  However, Lewis' vocals are a giant boat anchor that way the CD down.  On most songs his deliver makes the lyricsunintelligible , and he tops it off with terrible screams on \\"I'm Broke\\" and \\"Please Pt. Two\\".  The humorous track \\"Get Yo #$%!\\" is the only one where Lewis doesn't seem tointentionally obfuscate the lyrics.  Overall, there The Honey Bears have some musically talent, but they need to dump Lewis or perhaps stick with instrumentals such as \\"Humpin'\\".<br /><br />Download this:  Humpin'

B000MZHW40|5.0|Blood Diamond is another movie which showcases how great an actor DiCaprio is.  At this point I will see any movie he is in because more often than not he chooses movies that I enjoy.    He plays Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler and mercenary, who has made his livelihood engaging in activites that show him as a rather distatsteful charactor.   He is juxtaposed with Djimon Hounsou who plays Solomon Vandy, a man caught in the conflict of his country and Blood Diamonds.    Over the course of the movie Archer does change, and though portions were predictable, it was still well down.  There is violence throughout the movie, and some have criticized that the movie may have been a bit too \\"moralistic\\" in the telling of this tale.  To me it was just a very good story.  Despite any shortcomings, this movie is worth it just to see DiCaprio and Hounsou - both deliver stand out performances that are worth seeing and carry the movie.
B0002ADXYI|4.0|I've known about Uriah Heep for a long time and probably heard some of their songs while growing up in the 70s, but I never owned any of their albums.  Liking bands from the late 60s like Cream, Deep Purple, and Blind Faith, I recently ordered some CDs from several groups including Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, Captain Beyond, and King Crimson. I like Very 'eavy, Very 'umble.  It is a good hard rock album with decent melodies, good singing and playing, and lots of energy.  But the album lacks the spice that would have earned it 5 stars.  In contrast, I think the debut albums from Wishbone Ash and Captain Beyond are outstanding and exciting albums. (I view \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson as well-played and innovative, but kind of dull.)    I think the reviewers who trashed it when it came out were quite unfair.  One review in the CD's booklet suggested that fans of heavy music should listen to Jeff Beck, Cream, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Mountain, the Velvet Underground, and Deep Purple instead.  I think this points to the problem with the album which is that it just didn't have its own distinctive sound.  I think Uriah Heep's 5 man format and use of Ken Hensley's Hammond organ probably made them sound like a Deep Purple imitation.  (While Deep Purple had not yet released their famous In Rock, Fireball, or Machine Head albums, they had released their first 3 studio albums with singer Rod Evans by June, 1969.)  Aside from this, another weakness is that this album does not have any guitar solos that stand up against the wizardry of Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore.  But the critics really were unfair.    \\"Gypsy\\" is a high-powered track that compares well with many Deep Purple tracks.  (Ironically, DP had a song called \\"Gypsy\\" on their 1974 Stormbringer album.) David Byron's vocals are excellent here and throughout the album.  Ken Hensley gives a powerful organ solo reminiscent of many John Lord solos from Deep Purple.  His playing might very well be original,but critics and fans might have viewed it as derivative.  Mick Box follows this with a short guitar solo; but neither it nor any of his other solos really light any fires.  But, overall, this is a good heavy metal song, one of the strongest on the album.    The second song, \\"Walking in Your Shadow\\", features some very nice bass playing from Paul Newton who lays down good bass lines on most of the songs.  Mick Box does a fine guitar solo, but nothing special.    One of the gems on the album is the sensitive cover of the anti-war ballad, \\"Come Away Melinda\\" by the 50s folk group, The Weavers.  I like that the engineers recorded David Byron on different channels for the parts of the girl and her father.    \\"Lucy Blues\\" is a nice blues number, but nothing special.    \\"Dreammare\\", \\"Real Turned On\\", \\"I'll Keep on Trying\\", and \\"Wake Up (Set Your Sights)\\" are heavier numbers, more in the vein of \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Walking in Your Shadow\\".  \\"Dreammare\\" is somewhat psychedelic and is one of the strongest tracks on the album.  \\"Real Turned On\\" has inane lyrics, but nice dual guitars from Box and Hensley.  \\"I'll Keep on Trying\\" starts out with more atmosphere than \\"Real Turned On\\", but gets kind of soupy in the middle, almost sounding like the group Bad Finger, before going heavy again with the album's best guitar solo from Mick Box. The final song from the original British version of the album, \\"Wake Up(Set Your Sights)\\", delivers good energy and atmosphere with a plea for justice; it's the most thoughtful song on the album.    The 2003 version of the CD gives a bunch of extra cuts including two new songs and variations of the others.  The new ones are the intense \\"Bird of Prey\\" and the peculiar \\"Born in a Trunk\\" which has strange lyrics but rocks.  \\"Bird of Prey\\" was put on the American version of the album instead of \\"Lucy Blues\\".  British fans had to wait for the Heep's second album, Salisbury.  The liner notes indicate that this version is different from the one on Salisbury.Overall, this is a good hard rock album, but it lacks the spice that would have earned it 5 stars.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Bought it for one reason, to finish the collection, and for a little extra variety in dinosaur movies for the kids to watch.  I like Sam Neill, but he couldn't carry this movie, it just wasn't impressive.  Jurassic Park was still the best, and will stay that way.  The others really felt like additions for the sake of making more money.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Veteran Film Critic Pauline Cael once said film art is defined by how little pretence and self-congratulatory ruminations can be found within a film. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is such a film. There are many more films than this with a far more believable premise that do not stand up to scrutiny the way this masterpiece does.  The ;ast film (and only<br />film until this one) that actually made me produce tears was Philip Noyce's brilliant remake of The Quiet American, a masterpiece along with<br />this gem. There are many excellent films that I soon forget after watching, but Brad Pitt's performance carried a chivalry, presence and nuance that was simply amazing to behold. This film is beatiful in its<br />sadness and ennui and will in ten-year's time stand up to scrutiny<br />as a masterpiece of filmmaking.  David Fincher, some of us may have laughed at you when you made \\"SEVEN\\" years ago, we are laughing no longer.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I have to say, that despite not really knowing any of the lyrics, this CD is still extremely enjoyable.  Tired of CDs where the whole thing sounds the same, this one does not have that problem.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|It's a zombie movie, yes, so of course I am going to like it.  It's a comedy too, sweet.  Chocked full of references to other movies, and with a circular script, by this I mean, things said earlier in the movie will be said again, later, and in reference to different situations, but used correctly just the same.  Some may think it's cheater, but I enjoyed it, and will watch it more just to see if I can pick out more instances.  If you like zombie movies, you like this one, if you like satirical comedies, you'll like this one.  If you think Simon Peg is hot . . . well, you're strange, but he's there too.  If you like Hot Fuzz, you'll like this one even better.
B000QYBB6M|5.0|This is a cute read, but not too cute so that it's like a little-girl read. It's a great car read- a thrilling combination of mystery and wits! Great book :)
0790729407|5.0|It's this movie that made me add Liam Neeson to my must see movie actor list.  This man is strong in every movie that he does and this movie is extremely intense.  Watch it without expectation and it's power will take you for a ride.  Based on real life, don't expect a happy story with a happy ending.  It's dark all the way through with a true to life ending.  Having said that this is a movie that if you have not seen it or heard of it, trust me on this, check it out.  Save it for a rainy day to get the full power behind it.  Michael Collins is a controversial story and topic, but real history asides the movie is impressive and the extras will help you to know more about the real man as well.

I didn't even know Guernsey was anything but a type of cow...  Doesn't matter... this book is like a different kind of \\"Griffin and Sabine\\" with more characters and richer story. You just cannot help but feel good during and after reading it...and, these days, we could all use some of that!

I won't tell you what it is about, because you can get that from anywhere, what I will tell you is the movie is certainly worth adding to your collection.  It's serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be, and immersive throughout.
B001K98MH8|5.0|A movie that will give you hope and to believe in the greatnest off others.
B000HIVOI2|2.0|Have you seen the movie?  Good, because as far as I can find, there is no way to watch this and know what the aliens are saying without subtitles, and when the subtitles are on, it's on for those speaking english as well.  I have to say that I found this incredibly annoying and am fairly upset that this copy was like that, even my VHS copy didn't play it that way.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|I did enjoy this movie for what it was--a ridiculous, but good, time.<br /><br />The story line is ridiculous, the choreography ridiculous, and the singing, well ... awful.  Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried surprised me, but the rest should have been cast differently.  I know some people just love this movie, but I am not one of them.  I enjoyed it, but more so for the music. ABBA is great, and I know some people won't agree with that, but that's the point: to each their own.  The location was beautiful, as were the costumes.<br /><br />The story, if you have not heard it yet (or scene 30 Rock this season) is: A girl is about to get married, and wants to know who her father is before she does, the problem is she does not know who her dad is.  So she invites the 3 men her mother wrote about in her diary about the time she was conceived.  To her shock, all 3 rsvp to her wedding, and the slap stick, confusing comedy/melodrama ensues.  Fortunately for her, any one of the guys would make a great dad, and they are all willing to play the part.  More slap stick comedy/melodrama ensues until happy twist, and happy ending.<br /><br />It was nice to see this movie once, but I doubt I will seek it out again.  I think I will stick to my [[ASIN:B000001DZO ABBA - Gold: Greatest Hits]]... or [[ASIN:0788814958 Muriel's Wedding]].
B0000009RT|5.0|Freak Out! was realesed in 1966 and has become one of the first ever truly psychedelic albums ever realesed and is one of the most complex, weird, and different and original albums out today. Freak Out! introduced what would become known very shortly as acid or psychedelic rock and experiemental rock and also introduced the concept album and mixes so many generes together like doo wop etc, avant garde, and classical music, and that is just the start. Songs like, \\"Who Are The Brain Police\\", \\"The Return Of The Son Of Monster Magnet\\", were unheard of at the time and were tottaly reveloutinary, and introduced new sounds that would impact music and the music buisness in a big way in the next 1-2 years. Freak Out! also would turn out to influence the greatest album of all time, \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", so really without this album music would be very different, This album is also almost like surrealistic paintings set to music and is defenently ONE of the first albums ever realesed to be called \\"art\\". As I state in the title of this review this album, \\"Freak Out!\\", was and is ahead of its time, no other album sounds like this and thats why Freak Out! remains to be one of the most important albums of all time.
B0026NWBY2|4.0|This is a bizarre collection.    Let It Roll, Marwa Blues, and Rising Sun have no place here - they weren't singles, hits, distinguished album tracks, or fan favorites.  I have no idea why they're here, but they seem like family picks.    Likewise, the three Beatle songs from Concert for Bangla Desh should not be here - there are no Beatles tracks on ANY of the other three solo Beatles' compilations.    In their place should be the following hits, singles, and famous album tracks:    Crackerbox Palace  This Song  You  Dark Horse  Beware of Darkness  Living in the Material World  Bangla Desh    If the Concert for Bangla Desh album had to be represented, the fiery live version of \\"Bangla Desh\\" could have been used in place of the rather tepid studio recording.  The stunning, live \\"Wah Wah\\" would also be a good choice.    That said, it is all George, and I'm sure it will be wonderful to listen to.  But I wonder if/when Capitol will ever get a Fabs' compilation right.

0060512806|2.0|I did not like the style of this book.  Each chapter did leave me feeling tantalized and somewhat experienced.  I thought I was ejnoying myself, as it turns out - I really wasn't.  After about 50 pages, I found myself cringing with doubt every other chapter.  Is it just a dream sequence - or is it a time jump?  Getting to the heart of the story is allot like deciphering a code that you did not agree to look at.    If you enjoy that sort of thing, and want to read a 900 pg book filled with very interesting side notes, and the author holds the plot over your head like a bully's game of keep away, then dive in!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|One of my all-time favorite Clint Eastwood movies.  Very impressed with the whole movie and Blu Ray adds the extra touch.  A must see movie.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|Since I bought this item i've watch it 40 or 50 times already. My kid (1 year and 10 months) love the film. The image is perfect and if I have anything bad to say about this blue ray is that it takes some time to start and that some extras (the shorts) don't have all the lenguage options that the movie have.    It has spanish audio. For me it's important.

0312427646|5.0|This little 121-page novella is a comic jewel in which Alan Bennett speculates what might happen if a very well-known person were to read a book...and actually enjoy the experience.<br /><br />If Queen Elizabeth II hadn't chased her Corgis 'round the back of Windsor Castle and stumbled across the bookmobile parked outside the kitchens, none of this would've happened. But the Corgis did, and she did, and the Queen checked out a book-- just to be polite. Who'da thunk she'd actually read it and go back for another?<br /><br />  \\"Books did not defer. All readers were equal, and this took her back to the beginning of her life. As a girl, one of her greatest thrills had been on VE night, when she and her sister had slipped out of the gates and mingled unrecognized with the crowds. There was something of that, she felt, to reading. It was anonymous; it was shared; it was common. And she who had led a life apart now found that she craved it. Here in these pages and between these covers she could go unrecognized.\\"<br /><br />Turning such a world figure into a reading fiend is a stroke of comic genius as the reader rides along in the state carriage while Her Majesty learns how to wave and read at the same time or watches the servants learn to cope with a formerly punctual monarch who now wants to wait until she's finished the chapter she's reading.<br /><br />The Uncommon Reader isn't all fun and games. On a deeper level, Bennett shows how the world opens up to anyone who chooses to read for both enlightenment and enjoyment. Whether we realize it or not, reading transforms us.<br /><br />Read it for the humor. Read it because you're a fan of the royals. Read it because of the truths it contains. For whatever the reason...<br /><br />...read it!
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I only have a couple of negatives.  I feel that the actor who portrayed Thao wasn't that great.  There were a couple of scenes where he didn't look that convincing.  Another complaint is that I wish there were more extras on the blu-ray.  A big positive was Clint Eastwood's performance.  He was perfect in this role.  The actor who portrayed Thao's sister was also excellent.  If you're a fan of Eastwood, you'll enjoy this movie.
044024367X|4.0|In Nothing To Lose, Jack Reacher finds himself in a load of trouble in the small but aptly titled town of Despair, Colorado. The town has a secret, and Jack is determined to find out what that secret is.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of negative reviews about this book, but personally I thought it was a good as any other in the series. The pace is a little bit slower, than in the other novels, but I felt that added to the character development.<br /><br />Only a couple of points prevent me giving this novel the full five stars. 1) The Police Officer, Vaughan, in the town of Hope, gives Jack too much of a free reign, in the story, particularly when he first starts to antogonise the neighbouring town (Despair's) Police Department. 2) Jack has a lot of luck fall his way when he is in tricky situations. Perhaps more so than in the other Reacher novels.<br /><br />Four to four and a half stars.
1439157383|5.0|I have to admit that it's been a while since I read the book but I remember really enjoying it and powering through all 400 some pages in about 3 or 4 days. My mom had given it to me to read after lending it to both my cousin and her Med student husband (who read it and even enjoyed it himself). Parts of it were cliche and annoying at times, yes (i.e., Sara, the mother). But as another reviewer commented, Sara is the mother of a terminally ill child and there's no telling how that would make anyone act unless it was their child. I do remember being slightly disappointed by the ending but maybe I was more disappointed that the book was over because, as the title of my review states, this book got me hooked on Jodi Picoult (it was the first of her's I'd read). I am reading my fifth JP book right now as a matter of fact, so overall I'd say I liked this book :) I enjoy Picoult's books because they can be very relevant and heartwarming but are not too mushy and can keep you interested. The way she trades off writing chapters from different character's perspectives is also a unique way to keep the reader's interest.
B000OONQ9O|3.0|The original Warriors is a great movie.  Unfortunately this blue ray version has been ruined with comic book segues between many of the scenes.  The stupidity of the comic book drawings is exceeded only be the lameness of the captions hinting at what will happen in the next scene.  What a horrible hack of a great film.    The only reason it gets 3 stars is for technical merit of those parts not butchered.  The sound track and video quality are much better than the DVD version.
B001S86J0I|5.0|My wife and I both had a fun evening watching this DVD.    We've since given it to our grandchildren who also enjoyed it.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This is a great mood album for a relaxing, Quiet Night. If you're a guy and your lady likes it slow (and what lady doesn't), this album will set the tone and tempo for an evening that will drive her out of her mind. Reminds me of \\"A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night\\" -- very similar style. Elvis Costello is one lucky guy.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|This young woman has such a beautiful voice. I have other albums of hers and enjoy listening to them over and over. I hope she continues to put out more.
B00192IV0O|1.0|I've always loved the eclectic tunes created by BEPs and they usually carried thoughtful lyrics.  I was SO disappointed with this new CD.  It's almost all \\"techno-pop\\" and while it features a LOT of Fergie, it's not her best work either.  This is the first time I thought all their songs sounded alike.
0385340575|5.0|I purchased this in hardback, and thoroughly enjoyed the book. Per one reader's comments there were less than accurate facts in the book, but come one - it is a work of fiction!!    I am getting tired of looking at reviews for books, and seeing multiple one star reviews - then upon checking them out, find out they are reviewing the price of the Kindle edition and not the book. Amazon has repeatedly informed people that the price (including the Kindle price) is set by the publisher.  If you wait a few weeks it goes down to the promised $9.99 for a hardback. I too have a Kindle, and if the book is not one of a series I collect, and the Kindle price is too steep, I wait!!!    Stop reviewing the price and start reveiwing the books.
0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a genius, plain and simple.   This is such an incredible book - the kind of book that spreads like wildfire from people saying \\"You have to read this!\\"
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Yep, one of the best James Bonds ever has a major role as one of the Possible Dads in this musical masterpiece - and he does a great job on the songs, folks.    The inspired casting is just one of the things that makes this such a delightful experience, and I highly recommend the 2-disc DVD, for the invaluable insights into the production, cast interviews etc.    One of the most unbelievable technical achievements is the fact that most of the Greek village is actually a set, inside and out.    With a cast that includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, the quality is a sure thing, and the screen adaptation by the trinity of women behind original breathtaking stage show is exceptional.    Loved it.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Whether people remember it as such or not, it feels like Button is the movie that demonstrated when the dust settled on his real life relationship with Angelina Jolie whether the public would enjoy watching him in the movies still.  The answer was a quiet and resounding yes, but this movie still seems to cast a sad note on his career that has an odd feeling of connection to the beginning of his career in \\"Johnny Suede.\\"      Literature lovers will note the differences in text and the implications of these on this three hour film.  Several added subplots, severe tonal differences from the book and terrible stylistic choices are problems that will sink the hopes of a number of film fans and hoards of casual watchers, but the film's pace is what ultimately makes it unimportant.  For a long, slow, uninvolving, depressed film about a \\"simple man\\" it suprises me to be able to say it's also schizophrenic at times, and doesn't really understand the story it's trying to tell.    We think the reason Ben was born this way was because of the blind clockmaker, but that's never truly explained, and confusion with his identity in relation to his age (as opposed to how he looks) seems to be the majority of issue in the film.  It's clear this wasn't what the screenwriter and director wished to express since they don't really make a number of things clear even for those who pay attention. Benjamin Button as a character is impenetrable. You may be able to understand his thinking at times merely because of what's happened in his life and his unique circumstance, but his insight and personal opinion are largely absent which is curious since the story is being told from his own words via his diary and there lies the emotional and character problem with the movie.  The movie isn't really about him and yet he's right there in the center, you'd think he would have more to say.         His silence on his own feelings is something the audience has to come up with themselves. At first, you think it's because he's a soul trapped and confused but after awhile you suspect and probably settle on the idea that he's mildly retarded because he rarely talks in a way that is more than servicable and writes in a way that tells you everything you don't want to know.  People talk about Forrest Gump comparisons because of the writer and similarities in character, story, and obsession with state of the art effects mimicking old film stock.  Interestingly, Gump says more of his own feelings and perspective even though he seems to be the more mentally hindered of the two.  He also seems to make the most of his oppotunities whereas things just seem to happen to Ben.  I understand the difference in physical infirmities given to Ben, but they can't really justify his lack of action.  In some ways the two characters are the antithesis of one another, one extroverted and natural and the other inward and we really wonder who he is even after the 3 hours.  With such an inward character we grasp out for something to take his place and nothing does.    We see the affects of his story being read by his daughter to his love on her death bed in what is one of the worst collections of storytelling  ideas in history.  The daughter is underderstandably haggard, why would seeing her invoke anything except a suggestion to take a nap and relax let alone keep flashing back to her telling the story.  While this is happening Hurricane Katrina is about to go off outside and it just reeks of opportunistic fervor in this story.  To top this all off, the elderly woman is Southern and out of breath in an \\"I'm going to die.....but not just yet, I've got some plot points off ma chest.\\"  Now, I don't want to replicate what she sounds like, but to anyone who's had to experience this kind of speech pattern in real life, southerners included, will no doubt agree that it's the kind of speech that no one wants to listen to since it's pain all around.  Pain for the listener, for the speaker, and for theactor in this instance is in abundance.  Fortunately, it doesn't last very long, but the fact she speaks at all for the rest of the film is terrible.  It comes off as a sick joke at the beginning and only becomes less so because she says less and less until she dies.  Not sure why these two are the two that read the diaries as they're not particularly interesting, or passionate, and come off just as resonant as Ben.       I made it through the movie well despite it's running time with the help of a Monster energy drink and was very patient and sedate in processing the overlong and basically meaningless film.  Length and pace don't mean a film's boring by themselves, I myself sat through the six hour Italian film \\"Best of Youth\\" in succession (the theatre showed them in separate 3 hour increments with separate admission) and was riveted without the aid of any caffiene, vitamin based energy drink, or otherwise.  While the film isn't boring, it also isn't riveting, or thought-provoking due to good storytelling.  Anytime the film causes you to think it's because of details the filmmakers either failed to include, or didn't think were important.        Examples of this lack of foresight, or ignorance are numerous.  It starts at the beginning with the story of the clock (what's the significance? how does it tie in with the rest of the world?) right down to how mature is Benjamin internally when the world, his mother included, treat him in ways that are probably inappropriate considering his true age.  This is something we're never clued into, but I felt the movie not addressing this was sloppy and not thoughtful.  The fact I'm stating this objection now and not saying \\"well, who really knows?\\" is a sign that the movie doesn't really take its central idea seriously they just like what it conjures and that's not good enough.  If you're going to change an original work to fit your meaning it should fit like a glove and their film has a number of ugly tears, misplaced stitches, stains, and frays.  A thoughtful person who doesn't care for storytelling would excuse these problems and say they don't matter, but a person who loves storytelling in all its shapes and sizes will recognize this as substandard work that gets away with it because of the pace, soundtrack, and reserved performances of its leads placing the audience into a dulled silence. There's a reason why it's called the case of Benjamin Button instead of \\"the story\\" aside from the literature title, it feels like it's treated as a case and not a story. Fincher is able to make violence tranquill and elegant and boring situations interesting as he does here, but he clearly doesn't have the mind of a writer, or the gift of dramatic detail.        As for the two stars, I'll let you in on that: it has to do with the tangental elements the film doesn't really use.  The story of the clockmaker although told through the voice of old dying woman is still more interesting than a majority of the story and his heartfelt apology to the people after he explains why it ticks backward is truly moving.  The man who was struck by lightning seven times conversely is kind of silly but it lightens up a murky mood and distracts from the lack of momentum the movie feels throughout.  Finally, the character who merges both of these strengths is tugboat captain played by Jared Harris.  He's always good and sometimes feels out of place because of his strong acting choices and accent, but he's always bringing vigor and vitality to his roles.  Here, he makes you completely forget everything that happened before he stepped into frame and he makes you sad that he's leaving after being wounded in the submarine incident.  He's an artist indeed and the only one who emerges victorius in his battle with the drab and lukewarm plot.      I don't recommend this film to anyone because it has nothing going for it. The good spots are enough to outweigh the bland and empty and it wastes a lot of talent.  Even Brad Pitt fans won't get what they want.  There are love scenes and sex is a major issue that comes up in the course of his life, however, it's treated in a very limited manner and even the emotional payoffs are shortchanged.  In short, nothing is savored and there's no sex to make it titilatting.  I would hesitate, in fairness, before admitting it's not even sensual which actually accurately describes the whole movie.  It's not a sense of taste, or attention span, that seals the deal, but a lack of story and plot instead of heart.  A Curious Case indeed.

B000UZ4G8M|5.0|Every tune has a distinctive and catchy vibe: jazzy, dreamy, sometimes melancholy to the extreme, and insinuatingly romantic when it needs to be. You can close your eyes and feel characters in front on you.  Honestly though, I couldn't remember EVERY track from when it was played on Grey's.  It would have been nice for the soundtrack producers (Hollywood Records) to have included the episode detail (e.g. \\"season 2, ep. 4\\") for each track on the CD insert booklet.  Having said that, Shondra Rhimes writes a clever and quirky letter in each of the 3 booklets.  The photos inside, although limited, are well chosen to reflect key 'signifcant moments' for that particular season. And, value-wise, the 3-CD box set can't be beaten...seriously!
1933771690|1.0|This is an odd amalgam of personalized reminices that describe a poor boy's aspiration and achievements and a popularization of a rather extreme version of the anthrpomporphic prinicple in physics,i.e. the presence of an observer is necessary for the universe to exist as it does.In its former themes,it is mawkish and self indulgent;in  its latter it is shallow and unpersuasive.In his science explication the author  regularly approaches the reducio ad absurdum of solipcism and ignores its consequence.One wonders for whom he wrote the book since he appears completely persuaded that nobody else exists as anything but his idea of them.

0440246008|5.0|The first Jack Reacher novel I read was \\"One Shot.\\"  Immediately after I finished reading it, I started \\"The Hard Way\\" by Lee Child.  I know I need to go back and read some of the earlier books of the series, and I plan to, but these were available.  I really like Jack Reacher as a thinking action hero, and how Lee Child writes his thriller suspense tales.  I enjoyed \\"The Hard Way\\" just as I enjoyed \\"One Shot.\\"<br /><br />There were a number of things I figured out before they were revealed in the story, but that is okay.  There were still enough plot twists to keep the book entertaining.  I enjoyed reading along as Reacher figured things out.<br /><br />I am not a stranger to violence, but I have to admit, as the father of a little girl, I could not wait for the demise of the lead bad guy, Lane, in this story for what he suggested with the potato peeler.  The book is not for the squeamish.  Besides the potato peeler, the descriptions of the torture in Africa make you feel for the men who underwent such sickening treatment, even if they were not really \\"good\\" men to start with.  Regardless, in the end, you really want to see the bad guys pay for the atrocities they had a hand in, and for what they plan to carry through.<br /><br />Bottom line, this was a good, enjoyable, action tale about a hero I find myself liking more and more as I read about him.  I plan to read more Jack Reacher novels and hope Lee Child continues to write them.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.
B0026NWBY2|2.0|This collection is weak.  It doesn't include major hits like Crackerjack Palace, but a bunch of songs from Brainwashed?  What's that all about?<br /><br />And sure, people love George's famous Beatles songs, but I bet many won't be pleased when they find out these are live versions, and not very good ones.<br /><br />Once you knock out a bunch of the tunes most people won't care about - the CD costs as much as buying the tracks seperately as MP3s.<br /><br />I'm early reviewing this collection.  I too believe George is a 5 star artist, but that doesn't mean a poorly constructed collection warrants that rating.

0060775858|4.0|To be honest (and you know I always am), I really hate this book.  I hate reading it.  I find it boring and redundant and mind numbing almost.  But, as much as I hate the book itself, I absolutely adore what it has done for my daughter.<br /><br />Yes, no matter how I feel about the book in general, I must admit that it has had some wonderful affects on my child.  The book is simple enough to inspire her to read.  Sure, she is not yet two and so she isn't quite READING yet, but the simple wording and straightforward pictures have caused my daughter to learn what it is she is saying `goodnight' to.  As a parent I can say that there is nothing more rewarding than watching your child learn and grow, and regardless of how much I hate this book as an adult I can see why she loves it and watching her love it makes me love it.<br /><br />Does that make any sense?<br /><br />If you have children I'm sure you get what I'm saying.<br /><br />Now, I will tell you just why I'm not the biggest fan of the book itself.  I do find the illustrations to be very old fashioned and the overly simple nature of the story (there is no story) leads to redundancy.  Each page feels like the page that came before it, and thus it feels like it never ends.  When we first got the book and my daughter was too young to really react and or repeat anything I was saying I found the book a nightmare to get through, but now that she does repeat and say pretty much word in the book it is not such a pain.  They could modernize this with some nice illustrations too.  I mean, one of the things I love about children's books is the vibrant colors and the crazy art inside.  This book is rather dull in that regard.<br /><br />So, in the end; it is a great learning tool and it is a book that your little one will enjoy very much, but I urge you to wait until they are a bit older and can actually learn something from the book; that way it won't be such a bore.<br /><br />I can't give this a really poor rating because it's not a book for me.  If this were a book I read and not my daughter it would have a D at best, but the expression on her face when we read this before bedtime says it all.  I'm giving it a B.  To her it is an A, but really, it could have been a lot better.ok I read and not my daughter it would have a D at best, but the expression on her face when we read this before bedtime says it all.

B000YENUI6|3.0|Am I the only person on the planet who thinks Mr. Mortensen passes his good looks off for acting and Cronenberg has his name stamped on Mortensens' bare bottom?  Oh, and that most of the fans swallow all of it hook, line and sinker?  In this country, fans seem to think the better looking you are, the more you can act.  Ok, Mortensen does great accents.  This is a case of can't see the forest for the trees.  Shouldn't you worry a little more about your performance and where the movie is going than getting that accent just exactly so?  A lot of background errors have been forgiven when the acting is fantastic.    This man displays no emotion in any of his movies.  You get so much from a Travolta, a Downey Jr., a D. Washington, a Cruise, a Hoffman that you don't get from this man.  Just a flat nasal voice with a really good accent. Or no accent and a flat nasal voice.  He says he likes to portray his feelings in his face with no words.  He needs to watch Gary Cooper - that man knew how.  VM doesn't yet.    Eddie Murphy as The Nutty Prof. - when he's sitting there in the club taking it from Chappelle, you almost can't watch the scene because you feel so badly for him.  Now THAT'S what I want to see from VM - give me some idea you are actually FEELING what's happening to you and not some slightly interested by-stander.  And stop with the soul-searching angst already - is that all a handsome man is allowed to feel in a movie now?  Does he never get embarrassed or humiliated or ashamed???  Don't try to tell me that shower scene was NOT a gratuitous gig.  Cronenberg manages a scene like that every time he hires VM for a movie.  At first, I didn't think VM got it but now I wonder.  He's supposed to be fairly intelligent and I can't imagine his admiration of Cronenberg would cancel out ALL his I.Q. points.  Read any comments under the review of this movie and all you read about seeing VM's picnic basket swinging through the steam.  And gee mom!  This seems to happen in EVERYCronenberg movie VM appears in...some naked body part shows up in all it's shining glory. Hey, I DARE you two guys to make a movie where VM keeps all his clothes ON.     YES, I know VM is extremely handsome.  YES, I know he's a nice guy.  YES, I know he's intelligent and speak a zillion languages.  YES, I know he's a writer and artist.  Can he act?  Four outta five ain't bad...    Three points for the rest of the actors.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|I heard about David Garrett on NPR recently and thought I would give it a listen. I love the way this CD has a great mix of some older fantastic classical pieces mixed in with modern day songs. The arrangements are wonderful and exciting and his violin skills are amazing!

055380684X|5.0|Have you ever wondered why certain high school teams are better than others? Why are there so many good Russian tennis players? Why is Brazil always good in the World Cup (and the USA sucks)? Or why so many great artists lived in Florence? This is a dynamic little book that puts a very readable twist on how we learn. Mr. Coyle, in a remarkable piece of writing, explains how talent is generated in the most unlikely places. His style is reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell's work.<br /><br />Mr. Coyle explains the science behind \\"How We Learn\\". He explores \\"Deep Practice\\" and \\"Master Coaching\\" as tools that the best have used for centuries. This is an addictive little read that will change how you see the world. This is a must read for parents, educators, athletes, coaches and any one else that puzzles over \\"How We Learn\\".

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Seen the DVD version before, thought it was very good... But watching it again on Blu-Ray... It's amazing... This version has an additional 26 minutes and over 100 revised scenes.... make the storyline feels more complete making it even better than the DVD copy.     In terms of picture quality, as a whole, most part of the show is a bit grainy, probably due to the upscaling from DVD version, but the newer and revised scenes are freaking sharp and nicely done. I could tell right away it's newly rendered just for this Blu-ray.    I don't have a nice set of speakers, so I couldn't tell much about the Audio Quality. But I am a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu and Final Fantasy Soundtrack, so listening to it again with the movie, brings back memory of the FF7 game years ago.     For those of you still thinking whether this is a good buy, I say just get it... This is a fantastic version of FF7:AC and it's a must have for any Final Fantasy fan or any Blu-Ray movie collector!
143915726X|3.0|When ever I read a book, a story, one of the first things I do is classify it under the wide umbrella that is literature.  I do this because it usually helps me to read a book without preconceived expectations and began reading with an open-mind.    So, I classified this in my own little catalogue as a summer beach read, what I presumed would be enjoyable fluff.  And for the most part it was.    Overall, I think all of the characters are underdeveloped as the story jumps right into the action before establishing any type of back story.  Granted, the back story attempts to be created throughout the novel by the differing POV's, but I still usually found it unsuccessful.  Likewise, the differing and changing POVs also add to the underdevelopment of the characters as each one has their own story individual story and they don't always interweave to create a cohesive plot.    Also, the end is quite contrived and can be seen coming a mile away.  I know that the end ruined the whole story for a lot of people, but I think that kind of reaction is a little extreme.    Again, for me this was a nice fluff read that had some great potential it couldn't always live up to.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Imagine Baz Luhrmann sitting around the Thanksgiving dinner table at the home of one of his Hollywood studio friends.  Stuffed full of turkey, they retire to the media room to watch what has become a Thanksgiving tradition, the classic film Wizard of Oz.  You can almost see the gears spinning in his mind as he reminds his companions that Aussies often refer to their mother country as \\"Oz\\".  Get it?  Well, if the point appears invisible as a glass-tipped spear, I suggest you witness his latest exercise in cinematic bombast.  Believe me, you'll get it.  Unfortunately, you'll get a whole lot more of it than what you really need.  Oh well, blame it on the Thanksgiving turkey.      Turkey - get it?      The correlation is not half as bad as being constantly reminded of it.  Glass tipped spear, get it?  You know, the set arranged like a rainbow on the mantlepiece, get it?  One spear is missing, get it?   Luhrmann constantly treats his audience like school children who need to be spoon fed the punch line.   Which brings up another irritation of this movie.  What type of audience is this movie geared toward?  Australia is certainly not a family film, there is way too much graphic imagery for any child under age twelve.  The graphic nature contradicts the Disneyesque feel of this movie.  From the very beginning of the boy's narration to the juvenile pop songs that resonate throughout the closing credits, we are led to believe that \\"this is the way movies used to be made, when you could take the whole family to the theater and be treated to something larger than life.\\"    No you cannot - not with this movie.  Unless you are a child sadist.  Or, considering the three hour duration, a masochist.     The plot centers around a boy coming of age; early on in the film, he witnesses first hand an incredible tragedy.  This brings to mind yet another pet peeve found in many films and TV episodes - how can a child (or any character for that matter, not least of which a widow examiningher dead husband with a spear through his chest) be traumatized so badly, yet spend the rest of the film behaving like nothing ever happened.  How can people dance and sing across a battleground riddled with corpses?  This is just not realistic.    Not that Australia could ever be considered a realistic portrayal of anything anyway.  The only thing realistic about this movie is the quality of the acting.  Given the absurd context, every actor (to their credit) provides a splendidly memorable performance. Nicole Kidman has never been better - her close-ups are breathtaking. (Although she is one stiff breeze from having her Michael Jackson nose blow right off her face!) Hugh Jackman is rough but irresistably sensitive, his jeans painted on like a ballet dancer.  Brandon Walters gives one of the finest child acting performances in recent memory.        This movie has so much going for it, what a shame to be left in the hands of a Dino DeLaurentis wannabe hell bent on outdoing himself with every scene.  Nothing illustrates this vicious cycle of excess more than the constant barrage of engineered images littered across the stark yet beautiful landscapes.  The cinematographer must have shed many tears over the mauling of his artwork.       \\"Can't we squeeze another battleship into that harbor. . . let's double the size of that herd. . .  How about another round of Japanese carpet bombing. . .\\"      Like overindulgence at a Thanksgiving meal, the viewer is left wondering if half as much would have been twice as good.      Five stars for the acting and storyline; zero stars for Oztentatiousness.
B000002UDB|4.0|As in many aspects, Magical Mystery Tour is a brillent album. In other, more serious aspects it is one of the Beatles ODDEST albums. As I said it is brillent from a Beatles' fan standpoint, but if you haven't heard any of their music, they might get a bad \\"rep\\" from your standpoint. This album features the songs from their rather odder movie: Magical Mystery Tour. The secound part is just some singles not released in the UK version. The most interesting piece is the instrumental \\"Flying\\" (the Beatles 2nd since \\"Cry for a Shadow). Do not be fooled by this 2 min track, it is actually about 1 min 35 sec because the end is just random effects. Magical Mystery Tour (opening track) is rather repeatative, which is one of the reasons I only give this 4 stars. But the reason it is SO good is because of its creative-ness. Have you heard any other rock group that would make silly songs like these? But these silly songs are rather good! If you are feeling down and you want something funny, I would get this album. If you have no other Beatles albums, start with the first, \\"Please Please Me\\". But I will say, I am the Walrus is a brillent track, because of its nonsense. Only John Lennon can make a song with nonsensical words into a master-piece.   Buy It!
B001SMC91M|4.0|Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears are throwbacks to a time when the vocals were funky and bluesy and the horns were loud and brassy.  Their old school roots are proudly on display in this enegetic, fun recording that will bring out the soul in any party.  The first cut on this cd, Gunpowder, sounds so much like the Bar-Kays classic, Soul Finger, that the first time I heard it, I almost shouted \\"Soul Finger\\" out loud during the song.  I also liked I'm Broke and Bobby Booshay. My only complaint is that this album is too short!!!<br /><br />Some people may find the sound a bit too derivative for their tastes, but I was awfully glad to hear the old sound brought back in a fresh new form.  I hope Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears go on to record more cds and expand their style further.
B001FB55HG|3.0|It's not easy to review a film like TERMINATOR SALVATION.  It's one of those movies that pretty much requires that you've seen the movies that came before, and certainly it helps if you liked or loved the earlier TERMINATOR saga.    I would say right off that bat that if you were lukewarm or worse about prior TERMINATORs...there is no reason to bother with SALVATION.  It will not change your mind, unless you have a Christian Bale fixation, I guess.  The film, which does have some strengths, will in no way change the mind of a doubter.    I'm a pretty big fan of the original trilogy, but not exactly a fan-boy either.  I don't parse every action and I sure don't spend a great deal of time working out the time-travel inconsistencies.  There are some in this film, just as one could argue there are in all the others.  To me, it all boils down to whether a nearly all-powerful computer can also somehow see into the future.  Whatever...I choose to go with it.    The original TERMINATOR, however dated the effects are now, is still a superlative sci-fi action film, with a near perfect mix of action, sci-fi \\"stuff\\", humor and romance.  Michael Biehn made a great Reese, the hero sent from the future to save Sarah Connor, the destined-to-be-the-mother of John Connor, the human who will defeat Skynet, the aforementioned supercomputer.  Arnold Schwartzeneggar is the Terminator sent by Skynet from the future to kill Sarah (Linda Hamilton).  Arnold (Schwartzeneggar is simply too long to type over and over!) created his signature role, a part that fit his limited skills and his assets perfectly.  Odd inflections worked for this robot covered in skin.  A super-buff body also worked perfectly.  It was an original and thoroughly enjoyable minor sci-fi masterpiece.    TERMINATOR 2 was a major sci-fi masterpiece.  Not only did it introduce CGI to an astounded world, but it was one of the most thrilling action movies of all time...with a brainy plot, great action sequences, and a breathtaking performance from Linda Hamilton.  She is still (along with Ripley from ALIEN, et. al.) THE great female action character.  Arnold was a \\"nice\\" robot now, and he pulled off the part with near perfection.  As limited as the man is as an actor, this role was crafted perfectly to him...and making him a hero also made him immensely appealing.  This is a movie that even to this day, I can watch about every 2 years or so and still enjoy the heck out of.    TERMINATOR 3 shows the now nearly adult John Connor running from a new Terminator, with the assistance of a new Arnold.  I know a lot of people really dislike the film, and it DOES feel moldy compared to the 2nd film.  There's nothing too earthshattering to say with this film...yet I still enjoyed.  There's a great car chase, featuring a fire truck.  There's some important new things to learn about how Skynet \\"becomes aware.\\"  Arnold and Nick Stahl have some good scenes together, and even shiny-skinned Claire Danes is sympathetic and enjoyable.  While the movie suffers in comparison to what came before, I still enjoyed it.    Now, many years later, SALVATION comes along.  Some time has passed since Judgement Day, and now the human survivors are clinging to life amid the rubble of civilization.  John Connor (Bale) is emerging a strong resistance leader, although not yet clearly the \\"savior\\" of mankind.  He becomes aware that Skynet is out to get not only him, but young Reese (Anton Yelchin) as well, thus killing the boy who is soon to grow up to become his father.  (Again, how does the computer know this BEFORE it has even happened?)  As Connor works to find  Reese and also a way to destroy Skynet...Reese is a somewhat incompetent resistance fighter living in \\"downtown\\" LA.  He meets up with Marcus Wright (newcomer Sam Worthington), a man who is not all he thinks he is.  (I won't say anymore about Wright's character...he's by far the most interesting and complex creation in this film.)  Wright & Reese eventually joinConnor, and they may join forces to fight Skynet.    The film features many fantastic visuals and some nicely staged action sequences.  The movie was filmed in the deserts of New Mexico (including one car chase that was filmed less than half a mile from some land I'm building a house on!!), and the bleached filmstock used to capture the dryness of the desert gives the whole film an appropriately desolate feel.  It's the best post-apocalyptic landscape since THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Actions fans should enjoy the fun explosions set against such a bleak and lovely landscape.    Fans of character development and good acting will be left wanting.  I've never been a big fan of Bale (except perhaps in AMERICAN PSYCHO).  His Batman/Bruce Wayne leaves me very, very cold.  To me he just seems smarmy...and I'm very tired of his gravelly voice.  He doesn't give a performance in this film, as much as  he tries to assert his presence.  \\"Look, it's me...I'm charismatic,\\" seems to be his attitude.  Sam Worthington is far more interesting as Marcus Wright, and his scenes are the best, without a doubt...yet even he bounces from American to Australian accents without a care in the world.  Anton Yelchin is far too lightweight for me to believe he will grow up to be the tough, sinewy Reese of the original TERMINATOR.  Dallas Bryce Howard looks great (those eyes!) as Connor's wife, but has nothing to do.  Helena Bonham Carter looks bored.  Jane Alexander looks dewy-eyed and bored.  Michael Ironsides (one of the greatest names for an actor ever!) is his usual monotone self.      The film simply fails to generate real suspense.  It has moments of sound and fury...but the story has no compelling arch and leaves no feeling of anticipation to see what  happens next.  We seldom worry for a character...and we should be worried, because circumstances are bleak.      When the movie was over, I had not one single glimmering of \\"can't wait for the next one,\\" even though it's clear they plan to make another sequel (or two, I've heard).      It's not a dreadful movie, but where the first 2 TERMINATORs broke new ground in their genre, SALVATION feels like a half-hearted creative effort, at best.    (PS:  You may have heard that Arnold makes an appearance.  Let me just say that if you've seen Patrick Stewart in WOLVERINE or know what the makers of GLADIATOR did with Oliver Reed after his death, then you get some idea of the value of Arnold's \\"appearance\\" here.)
B001EN71DG|5.0|For the first time in ten years Amazon failed to deliver an item I ordered.  So I made a call, three days later I had my Star Wars DVDs.  It's not about Star Wars, it's about customer service...Amazon delivered.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is by far my FAVORITE Beatles Album. From the exparamental \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" to the slow but inpowering \\"Dear Prudence\\" this album has it all. What a come back to rock from their album, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"! It is a surprise, as break-up was in their future that they could create such a...WONDERFUL album.   Personally I think this album has more of an influence on ROCK than Sgt. Pepper. With the famous solo on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" probably explains that. Don't let the plain cover fool you, this double-album is so well-thought out. I hate it when people call it a \\"self indulgent\\" album. WHO CARES? It has awsome music! All in all you should buy this, REAL ROCK, album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to do The Firm workouts which typically last 45 min and never really broke much of sweat. But Jillian's 30 Day Shred leaves me dripping in sweat after only 25 min. I have been using this DVD for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a vast improvement in my endurance. I have only lost 3 pounds, but more importantly I can tell that I am getting stronger and more in shape. I started by switching between the first two levels and now I rotate doing a different level each day. Some of the moves in level 3 are too difficult for me so in order to get a full workout, I substitute those tough moves with easier ones from levels 1 and 2. Overall, these are great workouts.

0316017922|5.0|[[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]  In my opinion one of our most fascinating writers.  Gladwell's point of view (POV) is always refreshing.  The book is full of stories that challenge what we think: everything from why towns like Roseto thrive; how an airline can go from really scary to top-rated by addressing cultural and communication issues; why timing is almost everything  (stories of Gates, Bill Joy and Steve Jobs right place at the right time ) and probably the most important lesson--why hard work, more practice than everyone else, matters even more (again see Gates, Joy, Jobs stories.)  It harkens back to some old-fashioned values--community engagement, effective communication, seize the day and work hard.  Refreshing!
0553381687|5.0|There are already a lot of reviews for this series. Another one might not be necessary, but I've really become a fan of the series so I feel compelled to put in my two cents.<br /><br />A friend recommended this to me, and I decided to give it a try. I do not read a lot of fantasy (though if this series is any indication, maybe I should), but I used to read fantasy books intended for younger audiences many years ago. I tried reading Lord of the Rings when the movies were coming out, but found it didn't keep me interested all the way through. This book did, and the following two sequels did as well (have yet to read book four). Now I'm not saying Martin is better than Tolkein (mainly because fantasy fans will track me down and kill me), but his style definitely appeals to me more. If you really like to be surprised by plots twists, and see realistic characters and enjoy a little darkness, you will love these books.<br /><br />\\"A Game Of Thrones\\" is merely the first book in a series author George R.R. Martin predicts will be a seven part series. I'm not going to give much of the plot away, but I'll give you a brief overview of the novel's first few chapters. Eddard Stark is the Lord of Winterfell, the leading house of the North. Although the North is a cold, sometimes uninviting place, Eddard is happy to be there alongside wife Catelyn, sons Bran and Rickon, daughters Sansa and Arya, and his [...] Jon Snow. Eddard's life is about to change, however, when his old friend (and now King) Robert comes to Wintefell and offers him the position of the King's Hand which would require leaving Winterfell behind. Eddard is reluctant, but news that his wife's sister's husband has been murdered and a tragic circumstance in his own family pushes him to accept the position. With his daughters, Eddard travels south for King's Landing. And for the Stark family, things will never again be the same.<br /><br />These books are all quite lengthy. This first one is around 800 pages, and the next two are over 1000 pages in length, but the story seldom drags and even after near 3000 pages of reading, I'm still craving more of this story. In this first book, some of the elements readers of fantasy expect (magic, non-human creatures) are in short supply, but rest assured these things are coming and are used well.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to children, nor to anyone easily offended. These books were written for adults and they will be best enjoyed by adults. You've been warned. The only negative thing I can really say about the series is that it is thus far incomplete, and it will be a long time before it's finished (if ever). George Martin has taken nearly ten years on books four and five, and he's not a young man. That being said, while I'll be incredibly disappointed if this series is never finished, I won't ever regret the time I spent on these first few novels. The entertainment provided justifies the journey through them even without a proper conclusion, and I'll remember these characters for years to come. And believe me I'm the type of person to often read a book, and then just set it aside and forget about it. That hasn't happened with this series. It won't happen to you either.pages in length, but the story seldom drags and even after near 3000 pages of reading, I'm still craving more of this story.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|Thanks, for showing me that good movies are still being made, and great<br />actors still have the passion to make them.
B001PPLJJ0|4.0|Kate Winslet had a great year in 2008 with 2 fine films, \\"Revolutionary Road\\" which I've just seen in Blu-ray and this film which netted her a deserved Oscar though I think it would've been nice to see her split it with Angelina Jolie who also gave an excellent performance in \\"Changeling\\".  Though she has little dialogue in this film, she nevertheless conveys her character through gestures and nuances while David Kloss, as the young 15 yr old she seduces, carries the guilt and conscience of the new Germany.  One can see why the novel was a hugh hit in its homeland.  David Hare's screenplay also deserves mention for the spare dialogue and the final confrontation scene between Ralph Fiennes as the grown up David and Lena Olin as a Holocaust survivor is one of many excellent acted scenes in this fine film. I saw this last Xmas in a theater and I intend to see it one more time on video.  Special mention should made also of Bruno Ganz (Hitler in \\"Downfall\\") as David's teacher.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|Another morbid downer from kinky Clint. Vain, bitter old man, disappointed in life and especially his family, sort of gets to know his foreign neighbors and uses their problems as reason to die. Are you cheered up yet? A movie about a man who's learned nothing made by a director who in my opinion has learned nothing, except how to stay weird enough to keep Hollywood interested. This movie is an absolute zero in my book. I got sucked in by the reviews that this was a really great Clint performance. Wrong. Just a lot of silly profanity. Save your money, and skip it.

While Elend Venture and Vin are the focal characters, Sazed, Marsh, and even Spook and TenSoon the kandra have distinct opportunities.  It thrills me finding a crafty storyteller who creates careful plots, twists character perceptions throughout, and successfully connects the entire series.<br /><br />The ghastly spikes creating the extraordinary Inquisitors, involving the other magic form of Hemalurgy, is rather gruesome.  The religious perspective of the opposing forces between Ruin and Preservation blends great with Sazed's life studies.  The author could develop another series after displaying great talent with the finale.<br /><br />The summaries of previous books are at the end, it better serves a reader placing them at the beginning.<br /><br />Check out the author's web page at [...] for excellent inside information and deleted scenes (he provides warnings before any spoilers).<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
1582701709|1.0|There are plenty of well-researched, elaborate detractions for this book. I invite you to check those out for more in-depth analysis. I will add a shorter one.   At every turn, this book, DVD, and overall concept are flawed to the point of being dangerous. Few people with any amount of self-awareness would deny that positive thinking is a useful tool for our daily lives. The person with the ability to problem-solve, to seek solutions rather than focusing on what has gone wrong, puts himself at a great advantage in dealing with the inevitable hardships on any level in any life.   How quickly this positivity turns to the self-deception of a lunatic.   Do not look to this horrid book for anything that will address your personal, spiritual, and emotional needs. For the author, only emotions are useful, and only as a stepping-stone for the clarification of our mighty THOUGHTS. Happiness is the only emotion that exists for this cult (yes, CULT). All other \\"feelings\\" are prohibitive and harmful.  It is astonishing to encounter an utter ignorance and disregard for the realities of the human existence on such a level as this. WEALTH, POWER, MONEY, CARS, HOUSES, MONEY, LOVE, MONEY, WEALTH, WEALTH, WEALTH. The keen eye will notice a trend here. Items on this list are all the authors of \\"The Secret\\" feel are important enough to help you with. The infinite nuances of being a human being in this existence? Eh, you can worry about that when you're vacationing in the Hamptons.   In short, this book is disgusting and appalling. It is no Secret how this got published. I have no doubt that the publishers are printing their own money at this point.   As with religion, and any other belief system,  I feel that each individual should take what they find useful, move on, and try not to bother everyone else with your personal \\"epiphany.\\" In regards to this book, I can't imagine that any person with a modicum of self-awareness and intelligence (hell, with more than 13 years of life behind them), could fail to see this book for the vicious scam that it truly is.   l

That said, every CMO should absolutely read this book before they launch their next new product or service. Kim and Mauborgne make the case that if companies are to succeed in the future, they need to stop battling competitors and getting bloodied, causing red oceans. Instead companies that will be tomorrow's leading companies will create \\"blue oceans\\" of uncontested market space. They draw examples from every day brands with which we are familiar, including Cirque du Soleil, Yellow Tail wine, and Southwest Airlines to name a few.

I highly recommend this book, and I guarantee you that you will refer back to the book as a reference source in the future.
6305428050|5.0|Ever since I was a kid, I've really loved this movie! It's a classic. It has a great storyline, great comedy, and much more. Sexy beautiful Elisabeth Shue stars as Chris Parker who is getting ready for the night of her life, until her boyfriend has to cancel the date. Then, she gets a call from the Adersons, asking her to babysit Sara and Brad. Later, she gets another call from her best friend, Brenda who has run away from home and asks Chris to come get her. She takes Brad, Sarah, and Brad's friend, Daryl into the city to go get Brenda. From that point on, nothing good happens. They try to outrun bad guys, deal with a Bloods vs. Krips fight, and much more! One of my favorite parts is when they go to a club, and one of the singers says; \\"Nobody leaves this place without singing the blues.\\" I highly recommend ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING!!!
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is an amazing CD, if you like artists like Nora Jones then you will love this.  I can't stop playing it.  She has such a sultry voice and songs on the disc for every mood.  Will be getting everything she releases......what a find!

B001G60FTI|2.0|I really enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's first book, Tipping Point. He offered some significant insights in this book, and because of this, the book became a blockbuster big seller. I wish I could say the same thing about his second effort, Blink. Don't get me wrong, Blink is interesting. But at best, Blink should have been a long article in the New Yorker, not a whole book. If Gladwell had not been so successful with Tipping Point, I doubt that this book would have received the accolades that it did.<br /><br />Blink discusses the age-old concept that first impressions are lasting impressions. Gladwell spends a significant amount of time looking at the science behind first impressions, including the fact that most first impressions are made sub-consciously. But he spends so much time on the science behind this theory, that the book becomes uninteresting, and he feels it necessary to make his point in numerous ways. I've talked to people who have read this book, and they all say that they loved it. When asked what they loved about it, the readers find it difficult to recall any distinctive take-aways.<br /><br />All I can say is that I knew Tipping Point, and this is no Tipping Point. You can read this one, and it won't be a waste of time, but I doubt you will walk away saying you loved this book.
0316168815|5.0|Years ago I read this book on the heels of personal recommendations that I received from a number of my closest friends.  I found this book to be profound at the time because it deals with loss on every level- in other words, if you know what loss means you will appreciate the experience of Susie Salmon and the people she leaves behind.    Currently I am rediscovering what I loved so much about this book.  It is frank and it does not appologize for being so.  It is not overly sentimental, but that is not to suggest that it is lacking in warmth at all.  You realize when dealing with very traumatic or troubling situations that at a certain point you must allow all involved to find their peace however that occurs.  For some it means frantically searching for those responsible for the pain, for others it means shutting off and going into a shell, and for others it means clinging to whatever scraps of hope still exist.  I love this book and from the moment I picked it up again I remembered exactly why: the characters are honest and palpable.  This is not \\"Touched By An Angel\\".  There are moments in this book that are horrific, but there are far more moments of simple honesty concerning the thoughts and feelings and experiences of a girl that never had the chance to grow up amongst the people and places that she called familiar in life.  If you are considering \\"The Lovely Bones\\", have passed this book by and thought \\"I should read that\\", or if it seems that in some way the book has been crossing your path but you've never pursued- pursue it.  It's such a valuable piece of literature.  Alice Sebold has done all of us a magnificent favor in giving us a thoughtful look, not at death as much as at the act of letting go.    Brilliantly moving, and in ways you don't suspect in the beginning, I believe that this book summarizes the human experience through the eyes of one who gets to experience and talk about both sides of it: the physical and the spiritual.  Allow this book tospeak to you about loss that you have encountered in your own life, and I promise you will walk away from the experience with a greater understanding of life- both its meaning and why we must value it while we are still here to enjoy the chances for growth that it offers to each of us.    Tremendous book...
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood was the worst filmmaker ever and I recommend buyin a few of his films to see what I'm talking about. His enthusiasm is played well by Johnny Depp and he never lets up, just as Ed would have.
1591841666|2.0|If you have read my other reviews, you know that I like most of what Seth Godin says and writes. The Dip is 76 pages long, and the type is big. Why was the book written? Because Seth likes to point out that he is a prolific author, and therefore needed a book to come out in 2007.<br /><br />I&iacute;m not saying that the book is bad. It has some valuable messages, much like all of Seth's books. But this book could have been better, and more meaty, and longer, hence better value. Seth might be getting lazy as he becomes more well known, and this book isn't one of his best. That being said, there are used ones on Amazon for $7.00, and it is definitely worth that small investment.

0316743003|5.0|Ben Rich's tome on his organization (Lockheed Skunk Works) is told from his perspective - as employee, subordinate and eventual head of one of the most brilliant technological organizations ever.  Not only do we learn about the projects the Works took on, but we get a first-hand glimpse of the genius that was Kelly Johnson - and of what the CIA could have been today if it hadn't been for Bay of Pigs (and the pencil-pushers and lawyers hadn't taken over).  We also are offered a window into the motivations of the Lockheed employees, who were driven by Cold War realities not present today.  Highly recommended.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I ordered this product some time ago and hadn't received it so I contacted the seller who replied that I should have gotten it by then. They were unable to track the original shipment. They responded very promptly and sent me another set of dvds. Even though it took a while to get my product, I was very happy with the customer service I got and with the dvds.
0307455378|5.0|I bought this book as soon as I saw it in the shop!  after I started reading it I could not stop, I had to get to the end.  I bought the spanish version as a birthday present for a friend.  MUST HAVE.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|This is Fincher in his Spielberg, circa \\"Amazing Stories\\" mode. I really find this to be \\"minor\\" Fincher, more accomplished than Alien3 but less vital than anything else he's made thus far, it felt like a \\"kid in a candy store\\" production.    Having said that, I could watch Cate Blanchet all day and she is positively glowing in this film -- albeit digitally enhanced. Brad is Brad, the acting is not groundbreaking.The making of is very well made and after see it, I couldn't help but think what that the scrapped Spielberg or Spike Jonze versions might be superior.    Fincher tone seems strangely distant, unable/unwilling to peer into the soul of Benjamin, as a mainstream film, it is accessible and entertaining, but for a Fincherfilm(tm), I felt let down after the epic that was Zodiac.
0307472590|5.0|I was given this book as a present... and it has been one of my favorite ever since.  the story is rich of suspense and once you start to read it you can't leave it alone.  now I giving this book to my friends.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|This CD starts off a little scratchy but the sound quickly makes up for any taping difficulties. Great progression and harmony throughout, the band played much of this on the Austin City Limits piece in 2007 --- a simply incredible music rendition --- vividly seen in the crowds zealous enjoyment of this super indie band. Well worthwhile to own !!!

B0016116A0|5.0|OK, so I'm NOT crazy. It seems everyone agrees, this is the most beautiful rendition of the four last songs recorded to date. When I first heard this album as a young man I was transported. I was obsessed! And I was very fortunate to meet Miss Norman at a Tower Records (remember Tower Records?) and she signed my copy of the sheet music! Put this album in your iPod, put in your ear buds, close your eyes and prepare to be lifted to the heavens!
1416550534|4.0|Kate Morton's debut marks the beginning of what I hope will be more books to come! Her writing is solid and engrossing, and her storyline kept my interest. I would absolutely recommend this book to any of my friends.
0061245097|5.0|I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this series. I had it on my wish list for a long time and was dragging my feet; in particular the covers looked cheesy.  However, one I started reading, I found myself completely rooting for Bones and Cat.  It has great action, romance, and the fantsy manages to feel plausible.  I laughed out loud at parts in this novel and its prequel, something I don't do often, especially with a book that also has very satisfactory love scenes.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I am really happy after watching the Blu-ray version of Advent Children complete, it was totally worth what I paid, regardless of already owning the original version.  Now it is a full movie on its own, doesn't feel like a featurette for eye candy anymore.It vastly benefits from the other elements of compilation of final fantasy vii released after it, in particular Crisis Core, which if you have played it you will know has a storyline full of emotion that really adds up  when giving context to many of the extra scenes featuring zack.  But even if the almost half an hour of extra scenes is not enough for you, you will get also a full animated feature of the first volume of on a way to a smile. (the small booklet that came with the second release as a small novel) telling the story of Denzel, a pretty sad story. The animated feature does a great job of capturing the feelings written in the small tale, and gives a lot of context for the main film.  Finally, the review of compilation of final fantasy vii, is mindblowing, really!. It contains short clips of all the compilation, even before crisis that was never released in the US. Even better they do a great job at combining them in cronological order giving you very strong scenes such as the arrival of zack, cloud and sephiroth to nibelheim from the ff7, crisis core and before crisis perspective, it is just awesome.  The video quality is really really good, and I am watching this on a high def plasma with pretty good contrast and black levels. The new scenes in particular are significantly more detailed than the ones rendered for the original movie, which even though it makes the movie feel slightly uneven looks quite good.  You will also get to hear new arranged music of ff7 themes during the movie, of particular attention are the highwind and aeris themes, and even for a few moments anxious heart.  It is true that square enix has released this film many many times, in many different editions, but even if you don't want to buy it, at the very least you really have to see it if you played ff7, it is totally worth it.
B001FB4W16|3.0|I give the show a 4, but the blu ray only a 3. As someone who rewatches videos many times, I found this show to be a bit less enjoyable the second time around. The Jason and Tara plotlines were especially hard to rewatch and I found myself fast forwarding through them.     As for the blu ray, the picture is fine and the sound is fine, neither is too remarkable. I give the set only a 3 because the interface with the enhanced viewing is not very enjoyable. Rather than having the option of viewing each piece of information (as in the Band of Brothers blu ray), the enhanced viewing is either on or off. This is not too annoying with the popup information window, although some of these had glitches. I enjoyed learning about each vampire's history and even the hints, though I had already figured those out. However, when a pip video comes on, the video itself is silenced so that the pip video is heard. There appears no way to get out of the pip. This is most annoying when it is Lafayette commenting on the way things are. His comments and other newscasts and ads went on way too long. As I said, I would've preferred an interface such as the one with Band of Brothers.      I'm not sure I would recommend the blu ray
B00004YA66|5.0|When a freak aurora borealis causes interferences in the airwaves, a father and son separated by the father's death are reunited via a shortwave radio.     That's a simple summary of what's a very complex and heartrending story. Sully (James Caviezel) is living in present day NYC in the house he grew up in.  He comes across an old shortwave and hooks it up and manages to contact his Dad back in the past. He's a burned out cop whose relationship is going awry.     Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a loving firefighter Dad who gets an eerie message from his son in the future. \\"If you'd just gone the other way...instead of following your instincts...\\"    Together, these two guys work to change history....    I first saw \\"Frequency\\" in the theatre and had to buy the VHS, then upgrade to the DVD.  This is one of my all-time favorite films. I have to watch every couple of years, cry, then put the film aside. This is not just a sci-fi story, but a compelling family story that depicts a love that transcends time and space.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2009
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I saw Ishmael Beah as one of the featured speakers at the Miami Book Fair and just had to read his book. He is even more inspirational in person than he is in print! For anyone to have gone through the devastaion and loss that he suffered at a young age and still have faith in the goodness of mankind is amazing. This isn't an easy book to handle at some places because Beah candidly relates his experiences as a child soldier who was usually hyped up on drugs. There are some brutal scenes, and Beah even details occasions when he was a cold-blooded killer. Still, anyone who wants to consider themselves informed about what is going on in the world outside the U.S. border must read this exciting book. I can only hope that he will someday pick up where this book leaves off--just when he is about to come to live in the United States.
B001HN697M|4.0|Sometime before the original film, vampires ruled. Their labor came from lycan slaves. Lucian (Sheen) was the only lycan who was able to transform to human shape. Lucian is the favored slave of Viktor (Nighy) the vampire leader.  He's also the undercover lover of Sonia (Nitra) Viktor's daughter.     Lucian leads the Lycans against Viktor and the vamps when his love's destroyed.  The fight, in true \\"Underworld\\" fashion takes place mostly with archaic weapons and a lot of blood and gore.      It's difficult for me to review a prequel film, because I know what is going to happen.  Still, \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" has well earned the right to stand on its own. The film's continuity is excellent with a strong look and feel like the original \\"Underworld\\" episode: very eerie bluish lighting and dark, even sounds the same.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2009
B001EAWMGA|5.0|It's amazing what the director was able to do with a cool original idea, a solid cast, modern CGI technology...and a limited budget. Money doesn't make a good movie, and this movie proves just that. It's just sad how many well funded Hollywood cookie cutters this movie sorely beats out.   If you like Sci-Fi films, or period action films, you should see this movie. It has plenty of both. Some of the most intense action I've seen, along with plenty of good plot and character development, and the acting is also very well done. The scenery is incredible, and the special effects are only somewhat dated but still very good. It's a refreshingly original watch for a genre wrought with cheesy carbon copies and stale remakes.
B00005JKED|4.0|A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans when it was released.  I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one \\"Alonzo\\" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one \\"Jake\\" (Ethan Hawke).     This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started.     I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Absolutely recommended, even if you have Blu-ray! The truth is the Blu-ray releases of the first two films are only SLIGHTLY better in audio and video quality than these discs. Not enough to justify the extra money. You pick this up for ten bucks and you get all 4 films in anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 sound plus the first 3 films are Director's Cuts!    I'd never seen these films before so I picked up this set. Let me tell you, I stayed up with family & friends and we watched one a night for 4 consecutive nights! It was a blast! This is the best deal you will find! Buy them now!
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Somebody looking for an intense World War II film that has a few shocking twists, can't go too wrong with this movie. (Those annoyed by historical inaccuracies: stay away!)    For a submarine movie, it has far more action than most, with half of it outside the sub instead of inside as so often the case. It also looks great on DVD and offers some outstanding 5.1 surround sound.  I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray.    This is definitely a man's movie with an all-male cast of tough seamen fighting tough Nazi seamen in the middle of WWII. Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel are the two main stars and it's a bit odd to see the veteran Keitel taking orders from the \\"kid.\\"     My only faults with it are that sometimes it goes a bit long on the depth-charge action scenes and that the language is too rough for a PG-13  (if you have kids). otherwise, this is good entertainment and certainly a different kind of World War II story.
B0026NWBY2|4.0|Longtime fans get tossed a small bone in the form of \\"I Don't Want To Do It.\\" It's tasty, but it's not nearly enough. There are other Harrison rarities that could've / should've been here, including \\"Flying Hour\\" and \\"Sat Singing.\\"<br /><br />Four of Harrison's post-Beatles studio albums (including one bonafied classic) are not represented here at all. That means no \\"Crackerbox Palace,\\" no  \\"This Song\\" (among other deserving songs).  On the other hand, we get three tracks from 'Concert For Bangla Desh.' Yes, I know - it was probably the only way to include some of George's Beatles material, but I think it was a dubious decision. Anyway - a George Harrison collection can stand quite sturdily on its own without the inclusion of Beatles-era songs.<br /><br />What's here is mostly wonderful, but if Capitol Records and the Harrison estate had wanted to do it just right this collection would have been a two-disc set of hits, album tracks, and rarities. As a single disc it's frustratingly incomplete.<br /><br />My idea of a great 2-disc set:<br /><br />My Sweet Lord<br />What Is Life<br />If Not For You<br />The Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)<br />Bangla Desh<br />Give Me Love<br />Don't Let Me Wait Too Long<br />Living In The Material World<br />So Sad<br />Dark Horse<br />Ding Dong Ding Dong<br />You<br />This Guitar<br />This Song<br />It's What You Value<br />True Love<br />Crackerbox Palace<br />Love Comes To Everyone<br />Blow Away<br />If You Believe<br />All Those Years Ago<br />Life Itself<br />Flying Hour<br />Sat Singing<br />Wake Up My Love<br />Mystical One<br />I Don't Want To Do It<br />Got My Mind Set On You<br />This Is Love<br />When We Was Fab<br />Cheer Down<br />Poor Little Girl<br />Cockamamie Business<br />Stuck Inside A Cloud<br />Rising Sun<br />Any Road
B00005JNX0|1.0|quite simply when it arrived the disk had a mark on it so it won't play.  Now mistakes happen and things get broken, BUT if it could have been easily fixed there would be no harm done.  However despite all my efforts it has been impossible to contact anyone to get it replaced.  I am horrified that Amazon would use this seller.

B000006NPY|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins's \\"Adore\\" album is in my top five of all time.  It is the epitamy of 90s rock/ alternative rock/ nu age music.  It totally encapsulates everything that the era of 90s (and the 80s children) were going through.<br /><br />The melodies are beautiful and (as some say) haunting.  There are some great songs with some killer background bass that make it fully enjoyable to listen to in your car.  There are also some fantastic songs that seem to help you \\"drift away\\" into your own mind.  It is simply a masterpiece- the whole entire album.<br /><br />I use this cd to write my books, to meditate to, and sometimes to drift asleep.<br /><br />This is definitely up there with other Smashing Pumpkins albums, such as Melancholy and Infinite Sadness.  Great, great work.<br /><br />I cried when they broke up in the first time (2000)... and they haven't seemed to (quite) get their music back on track since they got back together in 2006.  \\"Adore\\" is one of their best pieces pre-break-up and it's still one of the greatest albums of all time.
B000005DQQ|5.0|Any way you choose to listen, this album provides incredible listening.  Very expansive and spacious, yet intricate and detailed at the same time.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|Honestly i was expecting a lot more from this movie. Casino Royale was so well done that this one should have lived up to its predecessor. The story was just not as entertaining and the only good part was a real car chase which Casino Royale did lack.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|This film follows a lot of existing horror / shocker formulas.  Unlike most other derivative horror flicks, it succeeds on just about every level.  It's not the scariest film on the planet, but its very solid.    Two thumbs up.  I'm keeping my copy of this for showing to friends.  it is easily among the best in the horror collection from Tartan Asia Extreme.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|To make this succinct, this movies was fantastic. From this point out superhero movies have a new mark to meet. just like the original graphic novel did the movie redefined what we should expect from comic book movies. For a concise and more verbose review that is right on the mark read The Great Rocky Hill's review it is excellent and accurate.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This film builds a genuine sense of dread like few others I've seen.    I found it by doing a web search for \\"atmospheric horror\\"...  I didn't know anything about it, and it seems to me like it could have been made for TV.  The strange camera that they shot most of the film with made it seem that way at least.    Despite the ultimately predictable story, the filmmakers did an excellent job of creeping the heck out of everybody watching.  Very well done.
B000G73UEU|5.0|Of course, nothing beats hearing the man himself, so it's fitting that the disk closes with Cohen performing the richest version of Tower of Song I've ever heard (and, no, Hank Williams still hasn't answered yet). But the rest is mostly pure gold--Rufus Wainwright's take on Everybody Knows, his sister Martha's version of The Traitor, and Teddy Thompson's \\"Tonight Will be Fine\\" are especially, well, fine. Very fine.    Unexpectedly wonderful--Antony's rendition of \\"If it Be Your Will.\\" You'll either love it or hate it--I love it.    My only complaint is that it should have been a multiple disk set so that all the performers who appeared at the tour's various venues might have been included.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter; she absolutely loves it. She has been a long time Austen fan and this was right up her street. Her only complaint is that there weren't enough episodes.

Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and \\"LOST\\" is no exception.  There must have been a change with technical equipment for the second season because there is a quality difference from the first season and the second.  You will notice that picture quality is more detailed, more vibrant and colors are just absolutely popping in the second season compared to the first.  Skin tones and pores are much more evident and overall, picture quality is magnificent.<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"LOST\\" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season.  Also, sounds of the island and even thunderstorms come quite clear through the various speaker channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE.  Overall, there appears to be more utilization of sound and how sound was used in the second season compared to the first.<br /><br />Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON TWO\\" is featured in Standard Definition (480i) and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

The first season established that the survivors were not the only people on the island and that there were \\"Others\\" that didn't like them being there.<br /><br />But I always believed that there had to be other survivors from the plane wreckage since the plane broke apart in three sections and sure enough, the second season addressed that and we were introduced to new characters.  I know that for some viewers, adding additional characters when there were so many other characters that viewers were following already may be a bit overkill but for me, it was needed.<br /><br />I felt that there was really good planning on how these characters were introduced but it did make me worry of how many major characters were being killed off in the series and I know for some people, they wondered if there was a correlation of them beingkilled off from the show due to their real life experiences of being busted for DUI.<br /><br />Suffice to say that Michelle Rodriguez character of Ana Lucia had this love/hate relationship with fans because of her abrasiveness.  But as a former police officer and the things that she has done in her real life, you can understand why she was the dominant survivor from the tail-end.  I actually enjoyed every new character introduced and especially how the series sets the tone with the characters of Desmond and Ben Linus who play such a major factor on \\"LOST\\" in the next three seasons.<br /><br />As for the original survivors, \\"LOST\\" really does play with one's emotions especially with the characters of Sayid and Hurley who have been put through major lows because of certain incidents.  Charlie and Michael, who were fan favorites have become men who quickly grown infamous with their actions in the second season and the love triangle between Jack, Kate and Sawyer has been intensified.  Especially the leadership between both Jack and Locke and putting these two characters at odds with each other.<br /><br />Personally, I felt there was a tremendous amount of storyline and character development flashbacks that were just incredible to watch.  Answers to lingering questions from the first season but also more questions added in the second season as well.<br /><br />With the introduction of the DHARMA Initiative and the HANSO foundation, it definitely gave writers a chance to play with podcasts, commercial ads, Internet websites, online videos and even audio books to tease people about this mysterious group.  And like many fans, even I found myself engrossed by following these various side stories and conspiracy theories.<br /><br />\\"LOST - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON\\" was a fantastic season that kept many fans in their seats and just shocked by certain developments of the series including major character deaths.  There was plenty of action of drama , action and its definitely interesting to watch this season once again and see how complex the planning went for this second season.<br /><br />But I absolutely enjoyed \\"LOST\\" in its second season.  Granted, I may be a \\"Lostie\\" and have a strong bias towards this series but I truly believe that this is one of the best drama series on television in the last decade and to watch and enjoy the series with improved picture and audio quality on Blu-ray is just fantastic!<br /><br />\\"LOST - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON\\" is highly recommended!Abandoned, The Other 48 Days, Collision, What Kate Did, The 23rd Psalm, The Whole Truth, Dave, S.O.S., Two For the Road, Live Together, Die Alone and Canine Castaway.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I do not run nor do I think I will ever be a runner. Nontheless I found this book to be near impossible to put down. It is a well crafted tale made up of unforgetable characters, places, and odd science. I was sorry to see it end.
B001NESPHC|5.0|have simply fallen in love with the music of Melody Gardot as of late. A young artist who is a talented musician but also a singer with beautiful vocals.<br /><br />Melody Gardot has an interesting musical background. Knowing how to play the piano, Gardot was influenced by blues and jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Duke Ellington and George Gershwin, the artist had major challenges several years ago when she was struck by a car when she was riding her bicycle and became a musician after discovering music therapy in a way to rebuild her cognitive impairment. In the accident, her pelvis was hurt and that she was unable to play the piano. So, she ended up learning how to play the guitar. But since the accident, she had become sensitive to light and sound and thus the reason why she is identified with her sunglasses.<br /><br />In 2008, her independent album from 2006 titled \\"Worrisome Heart\\" was released on the Verve Record Label which Gardot collaborated with Grammy Award winning producer Glenn Barratt and worked with guitarist Jef Lee Johnson, organist Joel Bryant and trumpeter Matt Cappy.<br /><br />She then began working on her latest album \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" with another Grammy Award winning producer Larry Klein (known for his works with ex-wife Joni Mitchell, Tracy Chapman and many talented female artists).<br /><br />The album would feature two CD singles \\"Who Will Comfort Me\\" and \\"Baby I'm a Fool\\". Also, a cover of the classic \\"Over the Rainbow\\".<br /><br />The album showcases a smooth jazz style but quiet sound. Relaxing but elegant.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Baby I'm a Fool\\" which I found simply elegant with its beautiful touch of strings throughout the track. An absolutely awesome lead off track that truly showcases Gardot's sensual vocals. And followed up by the track \\"Love Undercover\\", \\"Our Love Is Easy\\" and \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" which is just a romantic and enjoyable track showcasing Gardot's vocals and the music of her talented musicians.<br /><br />The second track \\"If the Stars Were Mine\\" has a bossa nova style that I just found absolutely captivating. The seventh track \\"Les Etoiles\\" is another bossa nova track but sung entirely in French. And impressive is her bossa nova cover of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" which is simply lovely.<br /><br />You also get a taste of the blues with her first CD single \\"Who Will Comfort Me\\" and noir with \\"Your Heart is As Black As Night\\" and overall, you get to hear the delicateness, the suaveness of Melody Gardot's vocals.<br />Overall, Gardot's \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" is romantic, well-produced and a solid album worth listening to! Highly recommended!a bossa nova style that I just found absolutely captivating. The seventh track \\"Les Etoiles\\" is another bossa nova track but sung entirely in French.

B0017YDPI2|5.0|I saw one review that said the quality of the show on Blu-Ray wasn't very impressive, and I just had to respond.  I don't know if the reviewer maybe has a bad wire, or doesn't have a HDTV, or something, but for me personally? The quality is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  It's every bit as good as a high definition movie, and so very much worth the extra money.  I just hope they hurry up and release seasons one and two on Blu-Ray.  Comparing the quality of this version to a regular DVD version is like comparing DVD quality to VHS tapes - they're worlds apart.  If you have a high definition television, and you have a blu-ray player, then I don't think you need me to tell you how incredible the picture is.  To the reviewer who said otherwise all I can say is check your connections, and make sure you have a good HDMI wire, because, trust me, the picture quality is gorgeous.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|It was a time of turmoil in the world.  There was the threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, how fatalistic Americans were during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US involvement in the military conflict in Vietnam was starting to heighten and tensions were high.  Director Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a thriller on a what if there was a nuclear accident.<br /><br />Using Peter George's novel \\"Red Alert\\" (written back in 1958) as a source to write his film adaption, his knowledge of nuclear war after reading over 50 books on the subject, after the Cuban Missile Crisis started to become a growing concern with Americans, Kubrick wanted to give a unique perspective and not make things so grim.  He immediately decided to change the screenplay which was more of a serious thriller into a black comedy.<br /><br />Needless to say, his decision to do so has made \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" a classic film that was ahead of its time back in 1965 and has so much relevance in today's modern world.  The film was well-written as the film is a satire on the political system, sexual themes (which the names and the characters and their role in the film plays a big part of the film's theme and their manhood) and most importantly the Cold War.<br /><br />The film's storyline and even what went on behind-the-scenes to create the film are two very interesting stories and now, fans and new viewers who have been curious about this classic film and what went on behind-the-camera can experience it all on this 45th Anniversary Special Edition via High Definition on Blu-ray.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition\\" receives its first High Definition transfer ala 1080p (aspect ratio 1:66:1).  With the outcry of videophiles of how a classic like \\"Patton\\" was heavily DNR'd (Digital Noise Reduction), the good news is that Sony didn't go that direction.  So, with the Hi-Def transfer, you do see a lot more detail but also you see the grain of the film quite strongly at times (moreso in the B-52 sequences).  But there are scenes that look absolutely awesome.  Where the images look pristine and blacks are nice and deep with no sign of compression artifacts.  Overall, this is the best transfer of the film to date.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition\\" is presented in English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and also its original English mono audio presentation).  For the most part, the audio is primarily dialogue-based but when you get to the action sequences as the US military fight each other, machine guns and blasts are heard quite nice and clearly.  In fact, the military standoff featured good use of the fronts and rears and good directional of audio and hearing the soldiers scream from different areas.<br /><br />The film utilizes the front channels quite well and again, dialogue and even the very few music used in the film comes out quite clearly for a film that is 45-years-old.  And \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" does sounds great for a film that was made in 1964.  But by no means is the sound going to be as immersive as a modern war film on High Definition but for a film that is 45-years-old, it sounds great.  So, the fact that this classic film has received a lossless soundtrack is a major plus.<br /><br />As for subtitles, English English SDH, French, Arabic and Dutch subtitles are included.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition\\" comes with a good number of lengthy special features and also, it is important to let Blu-ray collectors know that the presentation is in digibook format and not in the standard blue Blu-ray cases.  The digibook has a book included which goes into \\"Strangelove's Durability: In Kubrick's Words\\" by Richard Tanne, pages dedicated to talents such as Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Stanley Kubrick.  Also, chapters \\"Pie in the Sky: Or: How the Lunacy You Saw Wasn't All the Lunacy There Was\\" by Travis Baker and many still images from the film.<br /><br />  * The Cold War: Picture-in-Picture and Pop-Up Trivia Track (BD Exclusive) - When watching the film with this activated, people can learn many facts about the film and references to real life situations and through picture-in-picture also watch interviews with military commanders, military personnel and historians.  Very informative and goes into detail about the US and Russia in term of their use of nuclear bombs and test sites.<br />  * No Fighting in the War Room or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat - (46:04) Interviews with James Harris (producing partner of Kubrick), film critic Roger Ebert, filmmaker Spike Lee and many others about the significance of \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" and how relevant it is today.<br />  * Inside: Dr. Strangelove - (46:04) This is the making of \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\".  How Kubrick read over 50 books on nuclear war and how the film became a comedy/satire from its original plan of being a thriller.  Also, interviews with the cast and how certain talent were cast.<br />  * Best Sellers: Peter Sellers Remembered - (18:27) A featurette celebrating the life of Peter Sellers on films and learning about the films he was in and friends and talent discussing how brilliant and versatile an actor he was.  How he was able to play multiple characters for the same film.<br />  * The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove - (13:50) Stanley Kubrick was a photographer, writer, producer and director but also an artist.  This featurette goes into how he started out as a photographer and how he transitioned into becoming a filmmaker.<br />  * An Interview with Robert McNamara - (24:24) Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara discusses why he calls the Cold War, a \\"Hot War\\" and the nuclear threats and strategies of the that time.<br />  * Split Screen Interviews - (7:17) As part of the promotions of that era, both George C. Scott and Peter Sellers took part in mock interviews featured in split screen.<br />  * Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment theatrical trailers<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As basic as this summary is, there is so much detail in the writing of \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" that it is one of those films to watch and just be in awe of.  From the performances of Peter Sellers (playing multiple characters) to George C. Scott (who didn't know that he was being filmed during his run through of scenes) and just the amount of thought and detail that went into the creation of the film.<br /><br />Director Stanley Kubrick went through many nuclear war books (over 50) and read quite a few of them several times in order to immerse himself and gaining the knowledge he needed in creating the film, finding certain situations of that time that seem absolutely frivolous now but actually did happen during that era and crafting characters based on other characters but giving everything a satirical spin.  The results are magnificent and just brilliant!<br /><br />At first, when hearing General Jack D. Ripper wanting to go to war due to fluoridated water.  I thought such a thing was preposterous but then I learned that the John Birch Society at that time thought it was a conspiracy by the US government to introduce fluoridated water into the system.  Also, to learn that the \\"Doomsday Device\\" was not a far off idea, that a scientist had proposed a Cobalt Bomb that would act like the Doomsday device and annihilate all human life on the Planet.<br /><br />I was really amazed by this film and it definitely gave the viewers this unique perspective that Stanley Kubrick had at that time but giving it a comedy spin.  You have to remember that during that era this film was released, the threat of nuclear war and everyone dying from it was very real.  The political tension between the Kennedy Administration and the Russians was very real and very tense.  So, for this film to put a comedy spin into nuclear war was probably unheard of.  So, needless to say, it was a film ahead of its time and has so much relevance today.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition\\" is absolutely fantastic.  You are literally getting your money's worth because the special features included are lengthy, informative and really go into the behind-the-scenes creation of the film and setting up the tension of that Cold War era.<br /><br />For those that own the 40th Anniversary DVD Special Edition (released back in 2004), you may be wondering if its worth the double dip.  Personally, I would have to say yes because of the High Definition transfer and lossless audio.  You also, get the Blu-ray exclusive \\"The Cold War: Picture-in-Picture and Pop-Up Trivia Track\\" which is very informative and a booklet.  But if none of these interest you, then you are safe with the original DVD Special Edition release.  (Note: The DVD Special Edition release does come with a theatrical photo and advertising gallery not included on the special features of the Blu-ray edition).  With a release for it's 40th, and now it's 45th, there is probably a big chance we will see another release 2014 for a 50th Anniversary Special Edition.<br /><br />But for Blu-ray fans who have been wanting Kubrick's films on Blu-ray with a 1080p High Definition video transfer and lossless audio track, you can't go wrong with this release because it's quite solid and definitely worth having in your Blu-ray collection.  \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition\\" is highly recommended!the Cold War, a \\"Hot War\\" and the nuclear threats and strategies of the that time.      * Split Screen Interviews - (7:17) As part of the promotions of that era, both George C.

0316044695|5.0|I just finished this book and although there are over 900 reviews I had to voice my opinion. Let's start by saying it is an incredible story of tragedy and valor. By now you know the basics, the largest loss of Navy SEALS life ever. That is the tragedy. The story is about the valor and honor SEALS should bring to every American walking these United States. Every American should have to read this book. Turn the TV off and have a family reading circle. The story is gripping, unreal yet as real as it gets. Marcus Luttrell and his elite squad who died as well as the rescue squad are American heroes. I got teared up reading this book.It is amazing what our soldiers, especially these elite warriors go through so we can have freedom. Freedom is not free. All to often we hear on the news about soldiers dying and it's like baseball scores, win some loose some. Nothing could be further from the truth after reading this first hand account of one brave, tough Texan. What they went through is the stuff of legend, except it is true. The first part is about the training and the second half is about Operation Red Wing which was in Afghanistan hunting down a Taliban leader. There is lots of stuff on You Tube honoring these soldiers, check it out. You have to read this book, if you weren't a patriot at heart before you will be after reading this book. One last thing. I read recently where some scumbags killed Marcus Luttrell's  young Lab Daisy(named after his fallen brethren with an initial of each) for sick kicks and he chased them across five counties until the Texas Rangers caught up with them. This American hero, a trained killer, showed more restraint than I could have by not administering some old fashioned justice. Marcus Luttrell and all the fallen heroes of Operation Red Wing I salute you as true American heroes. Semper Fi, you are my heroes! Now go get this book and read the most incredible modern war story, you won't be sorry.
B00192IV0O|4.0|The Black Eyed Peas (which consists of will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo and Fergie) return with their fifth full-length album \\"THE E.N.D. (THE ENERGY NEVER DIES)\\", their first album release since the 2005 album \\"Monkey Business\\".<br /><br />Their first single off the album \\"BOOM BOOM POW\\" has been the #1 single in America on the Billboard Hot 100 charts for 10 weeks straight and on May 21st, the group released their second CD single \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". Prior to the album's release, the group released a total of three promotional CD singles through iTunes which included \\"Imma Be\\", \\"Alive\\" and \\"Meet Me Halfway\\".<br /><br />With the first listen to the album, one can easily see hear and come to the realization that will.i.am wanted to try something different musically for this album and in a recent Billboard.com interview, will.i.am told the music publication in regards to \\"THE E.N.D.\\":<br /><br />\\"It's a diary ... of music that at any given time, depending on the inspiration, you can add to it,\\" the artist/producer/songwriter explains. \\"When it comes out, there'll be 12 songs on it, but the next day there could be 100 songs, 50 sketches, 1,000 blogs all (online) around `The End,' so the energy really, truly never dies.<br /><br />\\"I'm trying to break away from the concept of an album. What is an album when you put 12 songs on iTunes and people can pick at it like scabs? That's not an album. There is no album anymore.\\"<br />Many artists and groups have echoed the very same sentiment that will.i.am is feeling and in today's modern world, people can pick and choose the song they want and one thing that this album has going for it is variety.<br /><br />In 2003, \\"Elephunk\\" gave us consistency with hits such as \\"Let's Get it Started\\", \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Where is the Love\\". And the other tracks showed consistency with an upbeat, urban style.<br /><br />For \\"THE E.N.D.\\", the album kicks off with their most successful CD single to date, \\"BOOM BOOM POW\\". What I enjoyed this song is its bass-driven track with upbeat transitions. It has a nostalgic 80's style but modern groove. Overall, a catchy and addictive track.<br /><br />The second track \\"Rock that Body\\" is an upbeat club track that uses Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's \\"It Takes Two\\" sample and features Fergie in an animated, sped up voice. Overall, this track grew over repeated listens and became one of my favorite tracks on the album.<br /><br />The third track \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" is a Fergie vocal track that has an 80's beat/groove. A nostalgic sound but overall, another track that grew with me over time.<br /><br />The fourth track \\"Imma Be\\" is simply catch track and is a \\"My Humps\\" style of track on the album. A hip hop track that has another cool transition midway into the song and never returns back to the beat of the first half. Catchy, fun and overall an enjoyable track. The fifth track \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is the group's second single and a fully produced single by French DJ David Guetta. A very different vibe than other tracks on the album as the track is very mainstream in term of its overall musical style and presentation but you can't deny how catchy this song is. Happy, upbeat and enjoyable!<br /><br />The sixth track \\"Alive\\" is a mid-tempo ballad that utilizes the Auto-Tune is a will.i.am and Fergie driven track that has an early's 80 groove but again, it's a track that grew with me overtime and it's so different from their past work that I really enjoyed it. The seventh track \\"Missing You\\" is an upbeat BEP-style of track similar to a style that we expect from a group. Catchy, upbeat and Fergie showcasing her vocals. Definitely dig the arrangement for this track. The eighth track \\"Ring-a-ling\\" is an awesome upbeat hip hop/pop track that is another bass-driven track with the group showcasing their rhymes. Overall, an awesome track!<br /><br />The ninth track \\"Party All the Time\\" has nothing to do with the classic Eddie Murphy pop track. Of all the tracks on the album, this wasone that I didn't listen to all that much. The tenth track \\"Out of My Head\\" is disco-style of track with modern bass and deep grooves. The eleventh track \\"Electric City\\" features a catchy Fergie-driven vocal track. The twelfth track \\"Showdown\\" is an apl.de.ap and DJ Replay driven track. The thirteenth track \\"Now Generation\\" is a will.i.am's upbeat social commentary on today's generation of wanting things \\"Now!\\". The fourteenth track \\"One Tribe\\" is a hip-hop driven track which features simplistic grooves to other tracks on the album and ends the album with an instrumental and experimental synth track \\"Rockin to the Beat\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"THE E.N.D. (THE ENERGY NEVER DIES)\\" is an album that shows a more musically diverse side to the Black Eyed Peas. There is a real experimental side to some of the tracks on this album with an 80's nostalgic side to some tracks and others that experiment with dance club but in the end, its a Black Eyed Peas album where you expect to hear rhymes and Fergie belting out vocals but it's will.i.am's experimental side that shines through each track and gives us a different side of the group that we have not heard before.<br /><br />\\"THE E.N.D. (THE ENERGY NEVER DIES)\\" is an enjoyable album where many of the tracks in the first half tend to have more of a mainstream feel and the second half that lends more to experimental.<br /><br />In the end, the album sports an enjoyable mix of variety that shows us that within the last four years of each member pursuing their own solo projects, the Black Eyed Peas (and each member) has matured and grown in different ways musically but when united, together they can really pull of some wicked, enjoyable and catchy music!of track with modern bass and deep grooves.

B000PS81U8|4.0|Even though this is before Tool went into their full blown experimental state that is now present, their debut is still a landmark for prog and grunge of the early 90's.  If your a Tool fan like millions out there, you gotta have this one, period.
B001UREJYK|5.0|Golf was a different type of sport back in the early 1913.  Not everyone had an opportunity to play the game.  Also, golf was a game dominated by the British.<br /><br />\\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" is a film adapted from a screen play and book titled \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf\\" by author Mark Frost (writer for both recent \\"Fantastic Four\\" films and creator of the cult TV show \\"Twin Peaks\\") and a film that would be the first directorial debut for a Disney film by actor Bill Paxton (\\"Twister\\", \\"Apollo 13\\", \\"Titanic\\", \\"U-571\\", etc.).<br /><br />The film would feature cinematography by Director of Photography Shane Hurlbut (\\"Terminator Salvation\\", \\"Swing Vote\\" and \\"We Are Marshall\\") and composer Brian Tyler (\\"Eagle Eye\\", \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" and \\"Rambo\\") and focus on two golfers who would become the greatest golfers in the history of the sport, American Francis Ouimet (played Shia LaBeouf - \\"Transformers\\", \\"Eagle Eye\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\") and Harry Vardon (played by Stephen Dillane - \\"King Arthur\\", \\"Nine Lives\\" and Haven\\").<br /><br />The film starts off with a young Harry Vardon who lives in an impoverished home and sees a group of men who is building a golf course in his area.  But of course, the builders pay him no mind because golf is a sport for the distinguished.<br /><br />The film then cuts to a young caddie named Francis Ouimet who lives across the street from the golf course.  His father is a hardworking man but believes a man must work hard to pay the bills and his mother is supportive of his interest in golf.  One day, the young Francis dreamed of meeting the popular UK golfer Harry Vardon.  Harry is the first pro golfer to endorse a golf ball titled the \\"Vardon Flyer\\" made by Spalding and during his travels of promoting merchandise.<br /><br />During a day of promotion, he gives young Francis a tip on how to hold a golf club (which would be known as the \\"Vardon Grip\\") and it was Francis first major lesson and a moment that made Francis want to play golf.<br /><br />The film then fast forwards to when he's 20 years old.  He is an amateur competing at local tournaments.<br /><br />During that time, golf was a game that was played by people who had money.  They had sponsors and people from distinguished families.  Francis was nether of those.  His father in fact is not supportive of the golf because his son would be treated lower because he was not rich and as an amateur, he can't make any money.<br /><br />But there are rich people who know of Francis's talent and so they give him the opportunity by sponsoring him.  Despite the rich not favoring him because he's a caddie that doesn't belong to any distinguished golfing country clubs.<br /><br />So, Francis eventually gets ready for the tournaments but he loses his main caddie who is offered money to play (Francis has no money).  So, he enlists the help of his friend to be his caddie and his ten-year-old brother Eddie who tags a long.<br /><br />It is also time for the 1913 U.S. Open and although golf is known as a game dominated by the British, there are Americans who want to defend the US title and vow to not have the British win at their home tournament (note: Since the first tournament in 1895 through 1910, the Europeans have won the U.S. Open).  But the British champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray know that they are the best in the world and look forward to beating the Americans.<br /><br />Francis will be playing the U.S. Open but is not considered a threat because of his status.  In fact, his caddie gets caught for truancy and thus Francis is left with this ten-year-old boy Eddie Lowery who becomes his caddie for the U.S. Open.<br /><br />And the game begins...<br /><br />\\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" is an inspiring film that shows us how golf was back then, how heated the rivalry was between the US and the UK but how a 20-year-old named Francis Ouimet, who is from a working class family would inspire Americans of different socio-economic class to enjoy golf and make it become part of America's past-time.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  There is quite a bit of detail that can be seen in the film.  The grass, the dimples on the golf ball, the grain on the wooden shafts of the golf clubs and the clothing of the time.  One thing that Bill Paxton wanted for the film was the colors to pop (he actually talks about what he wanted to achieve in picture quality in his commentary) and discussed using the Kodachrome process.  The greens, the blues, etc.  But he also discusses, having to use a process to eliminate grain because he did not want grain to be a major factor throughout the film.  The blacks are very nice and deep.  So, the picture quality is actually quite solid.  A very good looking film on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (and also in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue-based film which utilizes music by Brian Tyler to set the mood. Both audio and music are quite clear as it comes from the front channels.<br /><br />But there is very good use of the fronts and surrounds and also low frequency during the U.S. Open.  The crowds play a significant factor in the film but also Bill Paxton wanted to show a different side of golf playing, so there is CG used when the golf ball is hit and how it lands on the green or the grass.  There is a lot of emphasis on when the golf ball is hit during the initial drive.  You hear the sounds of the club swinging and then the pop as the ball is hit.  So, for the game of golf, the crew were very good in wanting to make the sounds of the game immersive for the viewer of the film and not boring at all.  Especially with husky golfer Ted Ray is supposed to hit the ball, you know that your speakers will get a good workout.<br /><br />As for subtitles, English SDH, French and Spanish is offered.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" comes with a good number of special features.  All features are presented in 480i Standard Definition, English 2.0 Dolby Digital and with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary with Director Bill Paxton - Bill Paxton has a very enthusiastic audio commentary, discussing everything from the Kodachrome to the people he hired on staff and is very complimentary.  Paxton focuses on the making of the film.<br />  * Audio Commentary with Author, Screenwriter and Producer Mark Frost - While Bill Paxton focuses on the filmmaking end of \\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\", Mark Frost focuses on the history of golf and what transpired at that time.  The differences from his book and the film and information on the actual golfers. Very informative commentary.<br />  * A View from the Gallery: On the Set of The Greatest Game Ever Played - (15:22) We learn of how actor Bill Paxton became director and how he himself lived near a golf course and picked up balls for Ben Hogan and how excited of having to become a director of his first film but also his appreciation for golf and a big fan of the original book.  We learn about the people involved in the film and interviews with cast and crew.  From the Director of Photography, composer, people involved with production and costume design, special effects and more.<br />  * Two Legends and the Greatest Game - (6:59) A featurette about the two men focused on the film, Harry Vardon who is a legendary British golfer and the man that everyone has based their current golf grip on and the first man to professionally endorse a golf product.  And Francis Ouimet and how he became a legend for winning the U.S. Open but showing America that you didn't have to be rich to win the game and therefore inspiring many Americans to take up the sport.  Also, his friendship with his ten-year-old caddie from when they first took the golf course through their older age.<br />  * From Caddie to Champion: Francis Ouimet - (25:15) An actual black and white featurette from 1965 hosted by Fred Cusick as he interviews Francis Ouimet.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Although I play golf, I have to admit that I knew nothing about Francis Ouimet.  Aside from him getting a US Postage Stamp in dedication to him, I never realize his influence on the game of golf until now.  Especially, the British golfer Harry Vardon and how different the game of golf was back at that time.<br /><br />\\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" is definitely an inspiring film and it was great to see the correlation between these two golfers.<br /><br />Harry Vardon grew from an impoverished upbringing.  How a group of men who built a golf course near his home treated him like he was a nobody because he wasn't rich and used that to drive him to win and become one of the greatest golf players of all time.  He has records that still stand and he is known for the \\"Vardon Grip\\" which many golfers use as their main grip for holding a golf club.  The winner of six British Open Championships, Vardon was known for playing in stylish suits while on the course.<br /><br />Francis Ouimet came from a working class family and like Vardon, not treated well because he was simply a caddie and not from a distinguished family or a member of any wealthy golf Country Club.  But there were people who were supportive of his talent and gave him a chance to play at the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts.  His stunning win over the top British players at the 1913 US Open made him the first amateur to win the U.S. Open (Note: The first American to win the U.S. Open was John J. Mcdermott in 1911) and inspire many Americans to take up golf.  But most impressive that he never became a professional golfer and wanted to keep his status as an amateur golfer for the rest of his career.<br /><br />I also found the game of golf quite interesting back then.  I had no idea that when two people had to put.  If a ball went in front of a person's ball on the green, that the player behind the ball, still had to put.  So, I found it interesting to see Ouimet have to chip the ball over Vardon's ball in order to sink a put.  But most importantly, how heated the rivalry between the US and UK in terms of golf. Mainly, on the US side, due to the fact that the British were wining all the time.<br /><br />So, I actually enjoyed watching \\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" and learning about the history of golf but also finally knowing the significance Francis Ouimet had on the game of golf and why he is so highly regarded in the sport.<br /><br />\\"Overall, \\"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED\\" is wonderful sports film that I highly recommend!with a good number of special features.

B000X20UC8|4.0|If not for the somewhat out of place opening and closing tracks, I'd give it five stars.  The three lengthy tracks are well textured and way ahead of it's time.  I think Dogs is probably the jewel of the album, but the other tracks are fairly good as well.  Probably my favorite Floyd album next to The Final Cut.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|[[ASIN:B001P9KR8U Slumdog Millionaire]]I really did not know what to expect when I saw \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\". I just knew it had swept the awards season, and I had a great respect for Danny Boyle, as a director. The film was, in turn, amazing, horrifying, romantic, beautifully photographed, engaging, and satisfying. What I do not understand are people who found it cliched or formulaic. There is nothing ordinary about \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\". The use of flashbacks to explain how Jamal knew the answers to the difficult questions was brilliant. Not that flashbacks are new territory; it is how they were used that is intriguing. How hardened do people have to be not to feel swept up into the emotions of the children in the slums of Mumbai? Are people that ignorant of what life is like in India? Danny Boyle just showed you what life was like for a certain caste of people, and some people still cannot see it. There are slums and abject poverty and beggars and orphans and thieves and human traffickers. I found a lot of this unsettling, but I can face the truth. Why is it easier to watch a teen slasher film than the truth about a real country? Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, the screenwriter, as well as all the wonderful actors, have created a masterpiece. It is deserving of all the accolades it received.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|My 6 year old it totally into Star Wars and HAD to see the original movie.  They are offered here at an amazing price!  Thanks!
B001SMC91M|5.0|Very Fun Album. Opens with some Cool sounding Drums, Vocals, Horns, and Percussion etc.Segues into a tasty toast of more fun. Track 3 is a different tone, but still with a highly skilled bass, drum and keyboard group backing the vocals. Percussion, Guitar and more expand out a delicious sound.Track 4 kicks it up a notch with a raunchy tune called Big Booty Woman ( very reminiscent of Keith Richards or is it the other way around ? ).Boogie keeps the pace and just raunches like wild.Slowly paced, \\"MASTER SOLD MY BABY\\" is a sad tone and emotionally lower than the previous pieces.To Kick it back up GET YO  jumps the beat with a sleazy   speak about love.Still some humour when he gets his lovers name wrong.HUMPIN is fast, sleazy and right to the point, and correctly placed right after GET YO .BOBBY BOOSHAY is a cool fast and rampant song about a mean dude( quite a picture).All the tracks are short and sweet, but PLEASE is about one thing, and that is the passionate request.   This CD is well produced. It plays superbly on a 5.1 sound system. The credits are all the standard fare, nothing unusual except that the standout thank yous include thank yous  to \\"Gene Roddenberry\\" and also to \\" Barack Obama\\", very interesting and positive fare.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I went to see this with a group of friends, all of whom are in their twenties and thirties. We have all been down about alot of things in our lives.We geniunely had belly laughs in the first time in ages.The humour is not snarky or bathroom humour : its just funny. The artwork is just phenomenal and the color palette is an artist's dream.  The story is simple it is about an elderly man named Carl voiced wonderfully by ed asner,who desperately needs to get away,so he hooks a ton of balloons to the house and sets off to south america. A boy scout stows along by mistake and him and carl strike up a friendship. They are differant,but they have one thing in common. They are both lonely and want to be taken seriously by the outside world. Carl misses his wife of 50 plus years and Russel's Dad often blows him off to hang out with his girlfriend.Throw in a giant female bird named Kevin and a lovable dog with a talking voicebox, and you have a great movie for the kids,and adults alike. I will be seeing this again..
B0012GMWI4|5.0|Parece que THE MAN WHO siguio por aca. Una segunda edicion?... aun asi, aunque no hay un concepto nuevo, si continuan afinando su sonido, ya se diferencian de las demas bandas, ademas de contener grandes exitos como SING, TURN y The Cage. Muy buenas letras, excelente sonido y de las mejores portadas que he visto.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I normally only watch sci-fi and fantasy, but this was a good movie- it sort of is a fantasy (a fable as others have said), where music is the magic.  It's about hopes, dreams, courage, and perseverance.      I don't like that the premise for the story revolves around a one-night stand, but if you can ignore that and focus on the good- they boy having to live his life trying to believe he wasn't just abandoned (when so many others were and resent his positive attitude)- you'll enjoy it.    Also, Robin Williams plays a good bad-guy. :-)
B00192IV0O|4.0|Being a true, old school Hip Hop lover, I've NEVER been a fan of the Black Eyed Peas, save the hit single here or there.  I picked up this album on Rhapsody this week and BEP are definitely evolving.  Maybe I just met them in the middle.  I love it.  I defy anyone to listen to some of these tracks (\\"Boom, boom, pow\\", \\"Imma be\\", \\"The showdown\\") without tapping your feet.  The music almost forces you to dance.<br /><br />If you need a fun, high energy album for a workout or a nice summer drive, look no further.
B001R7IHA0|3.0|There is nothing really wrong with this album, it just doesn't come anywhere near the bar set by Be Here.  There are few memorable cuts and much of the album sounds, well ... generic.  The softer songs are OK, the faster songs are OK, nothing much stands out.  Many of the songs last longer than they really need to which, for me, further exposes their weakness.  \\"Kiss A Girl\\" was a brilliant choice for first single, as it will mislead listeners into thinking that Defying Gravity will range and soar like Be Here.  It's a pleasant album, but listen to the crowd during Urban's tour this year.  I'll bet when he wants to rev up the crowd he cranks up something from Be Here and then fills in with Defying Gravity.  Not his best effort, or at least I hope not.
1416955070|4.0|I have to say right off that I enjoyed this story.  I think the storyline was fairly unique, with twists and turns that I truly couldn't have imagined.  The author writes well enough to get a pretty good idea of what this new world is like.  However, I think the author assumes too much.  It's as if she feels like she's hooked us, which she hasn't, and then she makes a big jump in the action and it's just too easy to get lost.  It's not really too big of a deal, but it's enough for me to notice that I had to jump backwards again to figure out what happened.<br /><br />This book wasn't too difficult for me to put down, but I did enjoy picking it up again each night.  I have been on a search to find something that I just can't bring myself to put down.  This isn't the one, but it's certainly not bad, either.<br /><br />A lot has been written about the twist at the end of the story.  I think it's great, personally.  There's nothing that adds tension to a story like forbidden love.  It's certainly not over the top as suggested by some other reviewers.<br /><br />So, overall, good story, lots of action, a little hard to follow the author's jumps and an unexpected twist at the end.  This is a great summertime book and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the stories in this trilogy.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Based on Alan Moore's classic Graphic novel, The Watchmen is an absolute feast for the eyes.This movie was geared towards the fans of the novel,but that being said it may be a bit of a headscratcher for the regular audience.Im making this review short and sweet,If your a fan this is an absolute must buy!
1416972242|4.0|I really enjoy the stories in this trilogy.  It's nice to come back to characters that I know.  One of the things that I love, right off the bat, is that the author doesn't waste time telling us about events that happened in the other stories.<br /><br />The tension remains high in the second installment of The Mortal Instruments trilogy, which instantly strikes me as odd that the romance seems to take center stage to the instruments themselves.  I thought there was another instrument, but it wasn't even mentioned in this book, so I'm not really certain what to look forward to in the last one.<br /><br />Clary hasn't really developed too much, other than to find out that she's a super duper Shadowhunter.  It would have been more interesting to see her emerge as a strong and intelligent character in this second novel, but she doesn't.<br /><br />Clary's mom's coma drags on and on and on in this book as well.  Jace hasn't really probed around to find out more about his mother, which seems strange and unnatural, especially now that he knows the circumstances under which she left.  I don't think that it's a realistic reaction.  The author seems to have gone out of her way to make Jace unpredictable, but it also makes it difficult to connect to him or really care about him either.  That was disappointing.<br /><br />Other than that, this is another great action-packed novel.  I was surprised (again) by the events and felt that the romance (or forced lack thereof) was handled in a very interesting way.  We don't just stop loving people, so I'm glad to see the main characters aren't perfect and able to handle everything in stride.
0060751967|2.0|Plot Summary:  Dr. Shanna Whelan is a dentist on the lam, living under the Secret Witness program after she witnessed a murder.  On a shift at the all-night dental clinic, a handsome man comes in with a huge canine he needs reinserted.  Roman is a vampire, and before Shanna can fix his tooth, a group of assassins shows up.  Roman saves Shanna, and takes her back to his five-story town house, complete with a harem of vampire chicks, and a barrack of Highland vampire guards.  Cozy.  Roman falls for Shanna like a stone in a pool, while she vacillates like a windmill in a tornado.    Reading this book was like going to a comedy club, and quickly realizing that I'd need to get completely blitzed to make the comedian even remotely funny.  It was uncomfortable watching the jokes do belly-flops during the supposed-to-be funny bits.  I like my humor either dark, dry or raunchy, and all the artificial sweeteners here were burning a hole in my gut.       I categorize this type of story as `vampire-lite,' and it's very much in the same vein as the Argeneau Vampire series by Sands (pun unintended).  I wish I could say it pulls off the same effortless charm, but it doesn't work here because this story never celebrates vampires.  If the goal is to write a sanitized vampire story, and have them drink synthetic blood out of bottles, so be it, but don't castrate them completely.      The heroine grated on my nerves.  Shanna is one of those yes-no-yes-no characters, who spins like an emotional top in each and every scene, and as a result she comes across as a wimpy drama queen.  Roman Draganesti was no better, and his self-loathing was tiresome.  I don't want to read about a 500 year-old vampire who apologizes for who he is, or what he does.  When Roman bites Shanna in a moment of passion, you'd think that the world had ended based on their reactions.  Hello?  Vampires are supposed to bite people, and treating it like a bad behavior was weird.  Roman uses science to undo everything that's cool about vampires, and I kept wishing the bad guys would win.
B0018QPPXW|2.0|The young Tom Cruise stars in this fantasy about a teenager in the Chicago suburbs setting up a temporary brothel in his home when his parents take a few days in Florida. Cruise is fine and gets to do an air guitar dance in his underwear -- but the movie seems awfully dated. Rebecca de Mornay is the young whore with a heart of gold. There's a cute car chase and a nice scene with Dad's Porsche going into Lake Michigan but much of the rest is slightly yucky. This movie came out when the big AIDS explosion was taking place -- but you'd never guess from watching this. Some of the interplay between Cruise and his parents recalls The Graduate but without the bite of that classic. There is also a character called Guido, a mafiosi type who seems like an incredibly gentle gangster to audiences that have become familiar with the brutality of The Sopranos. (I think the same actor later met a grisly fate in that series).
0143038095|5.0|Amy Tan weaves the story of four mother's and their four daughters in the unforgettable tale of 'The Joy Luck Club'. It's an exploration of the mother-daughter relationship, about the things they have in common and don't even realize, and of the things they want each other to know about themselves but don't always know how to say.  The story that begins with 8 people gathering to play mah jong and make profitable investments leads to life-long friendship.  Through the humor and the tears, I loved every page.
1423101472|5.0|Very good. Supurb plot and fantastic characters (a little irony to) also, Don't forget, theres ROMANCE TOO!!
B000ESST6U|1.0|The quality of the vocals on these discs is superb, probably the greatest recording i've heard of this opera, and one of the best Handel recordings ever.  Unfortunately the staging by David McVicars is absured in places and frequently embarassing.  The greatest flaw is the poor quality of the video.  I have returned two sets so I am assuming they all are of poor quality.  I saw this opera in the theater recently and the filming was clear and crisp.  The dvd's have poor lighting, vibrating diagonal lines and frequently snowy images.
0790729407|5.0|I first saw \\"Michael Collins\\" in the theatre when it first came out in 1996. Beautifully and thoughtfully done Jordan's directing is amazing, Neeson,Quinn and Roberts are excellent in this movie. this is a must see movie...
B0020MKTOS|1.0|The critical reviews of this Clint Eastwood film had been all over the board, so I watched it with hope but no special expectation.  Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this movie was in every regard...right down to inane \\"special features.\\"  Eastwood is a hell of a director when he wants to be.  I can't imagine what attracted him to this After School Special script with its one-note characterizations and by-the-numbers plot development.      There is nothing to recommend in this movie, but much to condemn, including atrocious acting by the supporting cast, including the priest and most especially the police officers at the end, who turned what should have been, in a good movie, a dramatic ending, into farce.      Not a single subtle, genuine emotion to be found in the movie, the apotheosis of awfulness was reached when Eastwood looks at himself in the mirror and says that he has more in common with these [profanity profanity racial epithet...if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, be aware that every fifth sentence follows that form] people than I do my own family.  That's how little trust the script and direction had in the storytelling--the need was felt to smack the viewer right in the face with the point of the story.      Finally, a word about the special feature...on cars.  Yes, the movie's title is \\"Gran Tarino,\\" and that's a car, and Eastwood's character had worked in Detroit making cars, and the car is in the movie in a couple of key scenes.  But this is not a movie about cars.  The eponymous wheels are if anything a symbol, but to have a feature about cars attend this DVD makes about as much sense as having a feature on sledding in a \\"Citizen Cane\\" DVD.      I can't wait for Eastwood to return to form.  He is a smart director and a talented actor.  Fortunately, this is a rare misstep for him.  I can see why he was attracted to some of the messages in the script.  But the clunky, clumsy storytelling is nothing if not Unforgiven.
B001TH16DI|5.0|ST1:    Well, after watching Star Trek the Motion Picture on Blu Ray after a several years' hiatus I can claim to be half right about my thoughts. The movie does lack the general humor that is so important to the flow and chemistry of the characters.. however in place of that you have a movie MUCH more epic and genuinely more grounded than what I remember from here on out.     I think director Robert Wise is more to credit for the true professionalism and less 'camp' than the ensuing sequels.. in many ways this is the true sequel to the series in terms of look; it's quite primitive. Even though exactly 10 years had passed between the series and this movie it looks more like 4 or 5.. and I like that.    It's probably less entertaining on most every level but I was entertained in a few unconventional ways.. like the sets, the story set up, and the transfer. IMO this is a must own movie from a sci fi standpoint if less than a must see from a Star Trek standpoint.    Overall -    8.5 out of 10 for the movie    9.5 out of 10 for the transfer    ST2:    I'm not a huge fan of this movie. Firstly I do not care for the actor playing 'David' and do not believe his performance.. I can't see him as Kirks son for some reason. I've never cared for Kahn's 'Krew'.. the casting seems awkwardly young, plus the 'look' (wardrobe) has never appealed to me. This is a bit too actiony for me, this movie spends too much time for my tastes on either bridges or outward shots of space battles, I prefer the human elements in this series.    I do like the transfer of this movie also, not as consistent as Prt 1 but certainly better than it's ever looked by far. I do think the original cast is in fine form and back to their usual selves but the problem is; aside from Kirk and Spock most have little to do. I must note; I LOVE Montalban, certainly a role for the ages. I actually just prefer watching the series episode 'Space Seed' to this movie.    Overall -    7.5 out of 10 for the movie    8.5 outof 10 for the transfer     I will conclude this review by saying Parts 3 and 4 have the weakest transfer.. Parts 5 and 6 look amazing.. except for some effects shots on 6. Also, going against the grain I really like Part 5 (the movie content). It seems much more character specific than 6.. which may be a better movie, but not a better Star Trek movie IMO.    Please do not let the naysayers sway you.. I sold my first 5 Trek dvds for $48 and got this set of 6 Blu Ray Movies plus the Summit for a song... NO REGRETS. What are you going to do, watch your dvds on your HDTV? Ugh. No Thanks.

031606792X|2.0|Warning: minor spoilers!   I'm one of those \\"older\\" Twilight readers at 31.  I'll admit that young adult fiction is not my usual area of interest, but a fun and needed break after reading Cormac McCarthy's The Road.  I really loved Twilight.  It captured all of that teen longing and angst perfectly and was addicting.  It's sometimes fun to look back and remember those high school feelings.  By New Moon I was starting to fall for Jacob (to my suprise!) and this continued throughout the rest of the series.  I longed for him to end up with Bella but knew that would never be.  I think their confusing and muddled relationship was the strongest driving force throughout the second 2 books.    Then I got to Breaking Dawn....I agree with some other readers that although it isn't horrible, it feels like it was written by a different author.  The tone is vastly changed.  I would have preferred to have stayed in the land of teen angst.  Instead, it seemed like a fan-fiction run-away train.  Did we need a pregnancy?  Baby imprinting?  All that weird sexual innuendo?  It's all too much  Uhhhhhhgh.  I thought the confrontation with the Volteri was well done, even though some have criticized the lack of a true fight.  The tension was very palpable in that scene and I think it was the best written part of the book.    The happily ever after ending was fine and I'm glad all the characters were satisfied.  Couldn't help wondering about Renee though.  Too many cop-outs on many levels.  It was way too easy.    I would gladly read the first three books again and create my own ending in my head.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|This 20th anniversary edition of \\"Robocop\\" is very well done. Not only is there a beautiful version fo the original theatrical release, but the director's cut is included as well. The special features were great in they included featurettes from 1987 and new interviews and retrospectives recorded for this release. I found the dicussions of the special FX techniques used then and how things would be achieved differently with today's technology to be very interesting. \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\"
0316172324|1.0|This book is magnificent; don't buy it through Amazon though since I never received it but was charged for it.
0307341569|4.0|I really like it when I pick up a book with no expectations and find a tasty little treat awaiting me in the pages.<br /><br />Each chapter of this book pieces together the TRUTH of a tragic event that happened 25 years ago. It really keeps you wanting to follow the trail and find out what really happened. It alternates between then and now with little pieces of the puzzle dropped in each flashback.  Just like Libby finds herself unwillingly drawn into the truth about her family's tragic past, I found myself steadily drawn into the story and couldn't wait to find out what the end holds.<br />It was an easy read, no real complicated plot well written and laid out.  Full of real characters with real struggles.  A lot of real feelings, flaws and angst in the characters.
B000VWSINI|5.0|Man this is one of my favorite cd's ever. I thought it was going to be weak at first,but ended enjoying almost every song on the cd. All em fans should get this.

B00000AF98|5.0|polished 80's pop metal masterpiece. no this is not your regular kiss. this is kiss hiring a producer and trying to sound like all the other 80's bands.while only 3.5 to 4 star release, nudged it up to offset the trolls. 35 years and counting ,even with all the haters KISS continues.
B00023B1LC|4.0|This is an action thriller that is great from start to finish.<br /><br />A man is rescued at sea.  He has no memory of who he is or anything about him.  He ends up being in some very tight spots and demonstrates that he has a wide variety of impressive fighting skills.<br /><br />In his quest to figure out who he is, he connects with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who assists him throughout much of the show.  As it goes along, he (Matt Damon) discovers that his name, or one of them, is Jason Bourne.  It turns out that he is a CIA assassin.  While he has amnesia, his employers think that he has gone rogue and are attempting to kill him.<br /><br />All of this makes for a story with lots of action.  The events take place all across Europe.  It is really a very entertaining film that is a good one for any fan of action flicks.
B001W63DXC|5.0|i won't commit the cardinal sin of saying that this is better the \\"live after death\\", but i will say that this is every as bit as good.
0307266303|5.0|I heard the author of this book speak on a public radio program about this book and I was intrigued enough to go on Amazon and buy it that same day. The book is very well written. It is a fascinating look at the culture of a Mexican Indian tribe (the Tarahumara)who are the focus of the book) and the subculture of running atheletes or superatheletes that exist in the world of marathon or ultradistance running. The author writes with a great sense of humor and a wry view of human nature that at times made me laugh out loud. I'm not a runner, and I typically enjoy fiction over non fiction writing but this book is filled with characters, events and landscapes that seem too outlandish to be true...and yet they are. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good writing.
B000000OAN|5.0|Every queen album will always be measured by this one.while i always personaly liked news of the world best, this is the masterpiece.Queen fans will know how meticulous Queen were with their studio recordings, with layer after layer of sound being added to create a depth and sound like no other band at the time. Two channel stereo can disguise some of this hard work as the speakers struggle to seperate out all that is going on at any one time. This new mix solves this problem by splitting the sound and sending each vocal or instrument through a seperate speaker where appropriate, giving unbelievable clarity particularly to such an old recording.    Every song sounds great and has something new to offer to new and old listeners alike, although some tracks are particularly noteworthy. The Prophets Song is the standout track for me, with the multi-layered vocal completely immersing you in surround sound. I'm in Love With My Car and '39 also offer a completely new experience with the clarity offering new sounds previously buried.
0385335989|4.0|After reading Drums of Autumn and reading several reviews I do not understand why some reviews have been so critical. I don't think that there were as many issues with the book as some have pointed out. In my opinion the story and characters have just evolved, which makes the   book(s) so enjoyable. In fact I nearly got to the end of Drums of Autumn before I even saw an issue, hence why I gave this book 4 and not 5 stars.    Basically the only problem I had about the book was the chapters dealing with Roger and that towards the end the book drifted away from \\"Jamie and Claries\\" story. I could have lived without learning of Roger, especially his trip to America. I just don't find Roger an interesting character and he seems like a wimp. I thought we could have stayed away from him except when Brianan mentioned him and still knew enough information.    I wish too we could have focused on Jamie and Claire more towards the end but once Roger and Brianna came through we saw less of them together.     As for Brianna I would have liked to have kept her too to a minimum but, I think she is significant to the story and its evolvement and I did get excited as she was about to meet her father Jamie. I agree she was whiny, but then again she came from a time were women were gaining their independence and rights that were not available to them before. Her era compared to her moms was significantly different.     Despite the small issues I saw I figured that Gabaldon has her reason for everything she writes and I have ordered the next two books and can't wait till book 7. So far nothing has compared to Outlander or Dragon Fly in Amber but I understand that the story, as life, evolves and I can't wait to see where Gabadon takes us next. Love, Love, Love this series!!!!!!!

B000001FQQ|5.0|this cd has 15 songs- some better than others. more of a straight up rock cd than other KISS releases. remastering would help it. does sound disjointed. never figured out why they stopped here with the remastering project.maybe remixing this one, crazy nights and unmasked. as for reviewers talking about the \\"read my body\\" def leppard comparisions. \\"all hell's breakin' loose\\" on lick it up and \\"get all you can take\\" on animalize. weren't both of these before \\"pour some sugar on me\\". mutt lange also wrote\\"lovin' every minute of it\\" for loverboy before he and joe elliot wrote \\"sugar\\".in fact \\"all hell's breakin' loose\\" was also before \\"i'm the man\\" and \\"bring the noise\\" by anthrax,so were they following trends or setting them???this is more of a straight rock album and not as heavy as as they usually are,but it's not the pop/polished rock/metal sound of crazy nights either.
B001W63DXC|5.0|the only complaint i have about this (which someone else already mentioned) is the cut-outs between songs. other than that, excellent. more proof maiden is one of the best live bands ever.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I have all of their previous albums . Leave a Whisper had blown me away when I first heard it. I liked some of the songs on Us and Them.Now with The Sound of Madness,I believe i've found my favorite Sinedown cd.

B00000AF95|5.0|another guitarist another top rate kiss album. during this time kiss seemed to change guitarists every album. this one features mark st john, a lightning fast player that didn't quite fit into gene and paul's plan.but this is one heck of a listen.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink-182 is generally a love 'em or hate 'em band. If you love them, then you know how much fun they can be. If you hate them, then you're missing out on some great stuff. A lot of people may dispose the thought of listening to the band because of immature lyrics or other reasons, but honestly, there's so much to love here on \\"Enema of the State\\". The album is fast, energetic, riff-filled, funny, inspiring, melodic, and in-your-face. The guitar and bass are crisp and clear, with some awesome guitar riffs and basslines through the album. Then there's Travis Barker on the drums. Man, that drummer is just full of pure, unstoppable energy on the kit!    It would be unfair if I built up the album so much and then left off without giving some insight as to WHY it's so great, so here's a run-through of most of the songs, which are personal highlights for me:    \\"Dumpweed\\": A fast and frantic anthem about crazy girls with an awesome, pull-off guitar riff and breakneck drumming, where the verse sections and in-between sections alternate from moderately paced to quite fast-paced.  \\"Don't Leave Me\\": Another speedy, short song, this one about breakup instead. A great, skillfull guitar/drum combo with Mark belting out some great vocal melodies and lyrics.  \\"Aliens Exist\\": Another song that has the anthemic, energetic sounds of the Warped Tour, this one features Tom on vocals singing about aliens. Another energetic and funny song!  \\"Going Away To College\\": A more serious, true-to-life song about missing a loved one as they go off to college, but more great instrumentation here.  \\"What's My Age Again?\\": A punk classic with some melodic guitar lines and very funny lyrics. A mid-paced song, but with a great, clean-guitar section in the middle.  \\"Dysentery Gary\\": Probably the most melodic song on the entire album, with great guitar lines, funny but jealousy-driven lyrics and awesome melody with a good pace, too.  \\"Adam's Song\\": A more balladic, introspective song that shows Blink-182 discussing more serious concerns of the real world. An overall gem of a punk ballad, truly one of the band's best songs.  \\"All The Small Things\\": Everybody knows this one! A steady beat, blaring guitars, funny lyrics and an infectiously catchy and memorable chorus.  \\"The Party Song\\": A very fast-paced, drum-driven song with great, highly amusing lyrics and more power chords that blast their way from Tom's guitar. A song you can listen to over and over.  \\"Anthem\\": More of Travis's great drumming here in this song about rebellion and the spirit of being a misfit in the modern world.    As you can tell, those are the \\"highlights\\", and yet that's most of the album right there! \\"Enema of the State\\" is an album you can listen to all the way through and love every second of it, and at only about 36 minutes, you certainly won't get bored. If you want a fast and funny punk album by one of the world's best modern punk bands, you will hopefully soon consider this one of your favorite albums, as I already do! Thanks for the time, and peace.

B000063DHL|5.0|Another masterpiece from maiden's GOLDEN YEARS.    1) Caught Somewhere In Time: The opening track hooks you in straight away with a brilliant intro. Which then builds      into a truly storming Maiden song.    2) Wasted Years:  A brilliant riff, again, to draw you in and then Maiden go in for the kill with the first single       from the album.    3) Sea Of Madness: The heaviest song on the album. Hit all the right notes is Dickinson's voice on this track. .    4) Heaven Can Wait: . The albums blistering early pace kept up with the second 7 minuter.     5) Lonliness Of A Long Distance Runner: The song title ripped straight from the movie of the same name. Just when        you think the album is slowing down with a melodic intro.... Oh no my friends. Another classic.    6) Stranger In A Strange Land: I just can not put it in words so i'll just say one of the best songs by Maiden       ever.    7) De Ja Vu:  De Ja Vu is another incredible track with well thought out lyrics.    8) Alexander The Great: Dubbed, by Harris, as the greatest Maiden song never to be played live. An awesome tale      told about the Macedonian warrior .

KISS' HEAVIEST AND BEST. no ACE or PETER in sight,while KISS will always be remembered as the original four this IS their best.(with REVENGE a close second- no ace/peter on that one either).for all the fanboys that can't stand a KISS album without ACE on it,while ROCK AND ROLL OVER is my fav, ACE also played on the travesty that is UNMASKED.(KISS single worst album)
B0026NWBY2|5.0|George Harrison, no doubt is ,was , the most underrated single performer in pop music history. (This is my opinion of course). For all those who unfortunately, only see Lennon & McCartney as the Main Beatles, this is testament to my belief. George I feel was the most influential popular artist, quite possibly, of all time. Yet, in such a subtle and unassuming way. He pieced together all the masterpieces that the Beatles wrote and generally gave Beatles songs that Midas touch, that have made them the classics they are. Unfortunately most people remember the players that score the goals, not the workhorses (Dark horses) that make the championships happen. From exotic sounds, diverse chords, 12 string guitars, gorgeous harmonies, inspirational lyrics etc. etc. George's stamp on musical history is phenomenal. And this is in no way exclusive to only Beatles music or fans. Many of the Greats share this sentiment as well .That being said and without overtly trying to convert newer listeners. I feel this newly released set of Solo music has been long, long, long overdue.       This is not a perfect collection. Other writers are absolutely correct, this should have been at least a 2 cd set. His solo catalog deserves that. But for now it will due. Hearing the new remastering of these songs makes this a must set for devotees and newer listeners. Many of the tracks are so crystal clear, you'd think you're in the studio while George was recording them.  Yes, some songs for whatever strange reasons are not here. You, Cracker Box Palace, Ding Dong, This Song and quite frankly countless more. But to avoid the negative and to emphasize the positive...    Listeners will be treated to a collection of some of the most inspirational, gorgeous, contagious pop music in history. Delivered and performed by a man who has made living on this earth, a much more happier place. Mostly by being true to himself. His talent is overwhelming . His insights are classical. If you do not have most of these songs in your collection I would recommend to anyone to go out and buy this Cd right away. For my money and belief I feel you can not possibly go wrong. And if you call yourself spiritual and don't have most of these songs in your collection, I Guarantee your heart will open with great joy. I could go on and on but truly, let Georges music do the talking.    In conclusion I'd just like to say, much peace to you George. You have changed and helped shaped the lives of many people. I for one am grateful to have been able to listen to your music for many, many years now. Although you are gone on the physical plane your spirit and music will live on forever. Thank you, with the highest respect, love, and appreciation. Docchalk

B00005ASOC|5.0|Reflecting on my fondness for the movie, I had hoped to share it with some high school students as a recommended film which inspires courage and overcoming adversity. Thankfully, I viewed the movie again before making the recommendation because the language/sexual reference of the film is strong; not something I would feel comfortable recommending to underage students. But as a parent who feels the language is in context and appropriate for the message, I highly recommend the film (for PG-13 audiences as recommended). Its JD Salinger-like character captures the heart as does the character of Jamal Wallace. The film accurately portrays societal issues of today including issues of race, ageism, schooling and literacy. Sean Connery is (as always) amazing!
B000063DHK|5.0|yes it is great and will always be the maiden live album that all their live albums will be measured by. but \\"BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH\\" from EDDIE'S ARCIVE box set has to be the single best performance of the band's entire career
B00005T7I1|5.0|Like an earlier reviewer so cleverly said, the less you know about the strip, the more you'll enjoy the film!<br /><br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" is not a movie about the strip, but about the memories it evokes. Unfortunately, you'll have to be eighty years old to have those! (the Tracy I recall was a boring TV cartoon that flew around in a trashcan). And chances are even so your memory will trick you, for the strip itself was anything BUT \\"nice clean fun\\".<br /><br />A failed masterpiece that -literally- ended up in the moon, \\"Dick Tracy\\" was in its heyday a cartoonist's personal crusade against organized crime. Outraged by the murder of fellow Chicago journalist Jake Lingle (who turned out to be corrupt), cartoonist Chester Gould created Tracy as his way of exposing criminals for what they were, and what should be done with them. For him, they were the scum of the earth: human souls of such deformity, it even reflected on their features. Thus there was no joke on The Brow's brow, or on Flattop's flat top. These guys were not ugly villains, but true human monsters.<br /><br />Confident of its Law & Order moral framework, the strip had no qualms about depicting sordid situations (sons murdering their parents, lovers quarrels with knives, villains getting impaled, victims beheaded, teenagers drowned, etc.), much to the delight of its millions of young readers. Today,\\"political correctness\\" would make such a comic strip unthinkable, but back then no one thought of it that way. People saw it as a simple Good vs. Evil moral story, where bad guys are ugly and good guys always win. \\"Nice clean fun\\".<br /><br />And that's just what appears in the movie. A bland and predictable story, sugarcoated in eye candy. It's all make believe visual nostalgia in bright colors and retro cars. Lots of fedoras, spats, tommy-guns and badges, in a fantasy 1930's American city full of newsboys wearing caps, sodajerks in bowties, Chinamen with pigtails, and elevated trains against the sunset. Shanties swing when hosting fistfights, boilers tremble before they explode, calligraphy gets written with bullets, and entire gangs fly through the air if they face Tracy up front. To top it all, there's an all star cast in outlandish makeup, several catchy Stephen Sondheim songs, and even a Madonna nipple if you look for it. Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S.: To most older people, Ralph Byrd was THE Dick Tracy of the movies. Actually, he sucked! Warren Beatty does an acceptable performance here, but nothing to write home about. Me, I always thought Robert Stack had Dick Tracy in mind when he portrayed Eliot Ness. \\"The Untouchables\\" itself is closer to the spirit of the Tracy comic strip than this movie is. As for looks, Victor Mature would have made the ideal silver screen Tracy. Alas, he never played the part.ilers tremble before they explode, calligraphy gets written with bullets, and entire gangs fly through the air if they face Tracy up front.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|not gonna talk about the technical issues. just know this is one great piece of music.Riffs, riffs, and more riffs. This album is littered with them, with several in each song and guitar solos to boot. The fancy fretwork of Kirk makes a welcome return, with him diving, shredding and flying around the guitar. The speed at which he plays is at times breath-taking.   This is a return of pre-Black Album   Metallica, with the tempo changes and subtle dynamic shifts . The pace doesn't quite compare with their thrash style of that era, but it's just as heavy. The playing sounds more polished than those albums, though there is still the passion and frantic feel in the music. It's very loud too, perhaps sometimes too loud, as the vocals seem to be drowned out by the guitars (then again, Hetfield isn't going to win any awards for his lyrics - they paint a picture of a post-apocalyptic world, but they don't make much sense). There is a case for saying that it's over-produced and it might not be a favorite of any audiophiles who like their music to be without clipping and over-distortion.   But overall, this is Metallica in top form. Most people were disappointed with St. Anger, this is the album that it should have been. It's not exactly innovative as it's a return to their older sound, but it's what the fans have wanted for years

B000LC3IDI|4.0|This is how it works for me. Very very simply. First I saw all the SAW movies SAW 5 to. So when I think back. SAW III is the only one I can remember it without  getting confused as to if that part was in II or IV or etc. No I got this one down Pat.   So if I said I like SAW 1 cause it was the original or SAW 5 cause it had more gore. I would be lying to myself and you to, probably for some political reason, when deep down in my soul the truth comes out. SAW III was the best or why else can I remember it so vividly over the others I can't?
0765356147|5.0|Hero of Ages is the conclusion of one of the best fantasy trilogies in recent memory.  I picked up Mistborn when I heard Brandon Sanderson was going to finish the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series.  Wow what a good choice!!!  The Mistborn series has a lot of twists and turns with an incredibly well thought out plot.  If you like the character development and intricate plot of Robert Jordan, you will love this series by Brandon Sanderson.

B001ED7C58|4.0|The \\"Twilight\\" novels by Stephenie Meyer were highly addictive and incredibly atmospheric books. The author added to her writing style by including on her website a \\"soundtrack\\" for each book. The movie was a departure from the novels (a horrible departure) and as such the soundtrack to the movie did deviate from the novel soundtrack -- but the soundtrack to the movie succeeded in all the ways that the movie itself failed so miserably.<br /><br />Muse inspired the Twilight Saga, according to Stephenie Meyer, so it's only appropriate that they lead off the album. Their highly infectious \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is somewhat irritating on the first listen but the punkish hook keeps listeners coming back for more. This is followed by one of my personal favorites on the album, \\"Decode\\" by Paramore.<br /><br />Paramore is something of a mix between Avril Lavigne and Megan McCauley, and the lyrics perfectly fit the novel as well as the music fitting the movie -- not too poppish and not too rockish, \\"Decode\\" was one of the highlights of the album. This is followed by the delightfully odd \\"Full Moon\\" by The Black Ghosts. Next, Linkin Park, another band featured on the book soundtrack, kicks in their lovely \\"Leave out All the Rest,\\" another solid track.<br /><br />\\"Spotlight\\" by MuteMath has an infectious beat but it isn't the best song. This track is followed by the extremely unfortunate \\"Go All the Way\\" by Perry Farrell. This track seems to be a mix of high prep and techno, and it's an awful song. Thankfully Collective Soul's \\"Tremble for My Beloved\\" kicks in.<br /><br />This is where the soundtrack takes a sharp upswing in quality; Collective Soul (incidentally the same track featured on the book soundtrack) blends in to Paramore's wonderfully ache-y tune \\"I Caught Myself,\\" which then bleeds into Blue Foundation's haunting \\"Eyes on Fire.\\" Next, Rob Pattinson, the actor who portrayed Edward Cullen, lends his soulful and surprisingly sexy vocal and guitar chords to the intimate acoustic ballad \\"Never Think.\\" The ever-lovely folk band Iron & Wine finish the album with \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\"<br /><br />The last track is \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" by Carter Burwell, the composer to the film. This track is taken with a grain of salt because on the one hand, it's a lovely, tranquil orchestration. On the other hand, it was a foreshadowing of how far from the book the movie would deviate. On its own, \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" is a beautiful song; but within the source material it's sure to anger true fans of the book.<br /><br />Despite its few downfalls, \\"Twilight\\" is a wonderful album and is more than worth the $10 price tag. 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />**The iTunes digital exclusive version of this album includes three bonus tracks, \\"Let Me Sign,\\" another beautiful track by Rob Pattinson, and modern performances by philharmonic orchestras of the classical ballads \\"La Traviata\\" and \\"Clair de Lune.\\"<br /><br />**The Borders version of this album includes one bonus track: a remix of \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" interspliced with dialogue from the film.<br /><br />**There has also been a deluxe re-issue of this album which includes five new songs and a bonus DVD: \\"Love is Worth the Fall\\" by OAR, \\"Decode (acoustic)\\" by Paramore, \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth (Live)\\" by Iron & Wine, a new remix of \\"Spotlight\\" by MuteMath and a new remix of \\"Full Moon\\" by The Black Ghosts.k.\\" The ever-lovely folk band Iron & Wine finish the album with \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\"    The last track is \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" by Carter Burwell, the composer to the film.

B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Yet another great a-ha album.  This time, with a throw back to their earlier sound- but very modern and definitely not a copy of anything they've already done.  Morten has one of the best voices ever in pop music and a-ha have been producing some great music for years.  It's so frustrating that America considers them a \\" one hit wonder.\\"  I agree with another reviewer- poor marketing keeps them out of the American spotlight.  I've been saying it for the past four albums-- but I bet this one would do really well in America if America knew it existed.  I'm American and when I talk about a-ha, most people don't even know that they're still around.  Very strange.  Just keep talking about it...maybe it will catch on.

B001N44BVQ|2.0|Body of Lies is a story about a CIA operative played by Leonard Dicarprio and his boss, Ed Hoffman, played by Russell Crowe. Crowe gained about 40 lbs to play the middle-aged supervisor Hoffman who spends a good deal of time on a cellphone from CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia talking with Dicaprio's Roger Ferris who shuttles around the Mideast, principally in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. Ridley Scott, the director, makes use of pinpoint satellite images throughout the movie, suggesting that the CIA has the ability to spy on various targets closeup through the use of overhead drones. It's very cool looking but can they actually do that? I wonder.<br /><br />Body of Lies is divided into three sequences, the first taking place in Iraq where Ferris attempts to make contact with an Iraqi who may or may not have information about Al Qaeda. The informant's cover is blown and Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent the informant from being tortured and revealing Ferris's identity. The first sequence ends in an exciting shootout with militants in a rural area where Ferris obtains information regarding a safe house in Amman, Jordan.<br /><br />The second sequence involves Ferris taking over CIA operations in Jordan. He meets with the Jordanian intelligence chief, Hani Salaam, played by the British actor, Mark Srong. Hani is depicted as urbane, highly competent and ruthless. He denies 'torturing' informants and when Ferris is brought in and observes them beating one of their own agents who hasn't followed orders, Hani tells Ferris that the operative is merely being \\"punished\\" not \\"tortured\\". Where Hani is smooth and calculating, Ferris's boss, Hoffman, the CIA chief, is depicted as impulsive and arrogant. He demands that Hani allow him to interrogate a contact, Karami, at the safe house who is already known to Jordanian intelligence. Hani adopts a patient approach and is content to leave Karami at the safe house and pry him later for intelligence.<br /><br />After a terrorist bombing in Amsterdam, Hoffman feels compelled to get \\"results\\". Without telling Ferris, he orders some of his operatives to tail Karami. Somehow Karami's cover isn't blown but it's enough for the militants at the safe house to set it on fire and flee for parts unknown. Hani is angry at Ferris who denies knowing anything about what happened and is ordered out of Jordan.<br /><br />The third sequence is the most implausible and weakest part of the movie. Hoffman and Ferris meet and Ferris comes up with an absurd plan to capture the terrorist they've been after, Al-Saleem. Inexplicably, Ferris, who has been opposed to Hoffman's amoral and impulsive methods, outdoes Hoffman when he suggests that they invent a terrorist to make Al-Saleem jealous. With the aid of a computer geek employed by the CIA, Ferris focuses on Omar Sadiki, a hapless Jordanian architect who is set up to be the next Bin Laden. Incredibly, they're able to convince Turkish officials to desecrate corpses obtained from a local morgue and use them as part of a plot to simulate a terrorist attack on an US Military facility. Meanwhile, Ferris has a change of heart and finally realizes that Sadiki is at risk to be killed by terrorists. After the simulated terrorist attack, the plot goes awry and Sadiki is killed by terrorists when they realize he's a harmless dupe.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned that there is a romantic subplot in this movie. Ferris falls for an Iranian nurse, Aisha, after she treats him at a local clinic for dog bites. At the climax, she disappears and appears to be kidnapped. Ferris meets with the kidnappers who turn out to be Al-Saleem and his henchmen. As it turns out, the noble Hani was the one who grabbed Aisha all along and used Ferris so he could lead him to Al-Saleem. In a harrowing scene, Ferris is almost beheaded by Al-Saleem's goons but in pure Hollywood style, Hani and his agents burst in and prevent Ferris from being killed. Al-Saleem is also taken into custody.<br /><br />Inreading some postings on the internet, some residents of Jordan feel that 'Body of Lies' maligns their dear country. This I can't understand; true, not all the scenes depict the natural beauty of Jordan but hey this is a movie about terrorism and not a travelogue. What's more, Hani, is the real hero here--intelligent, smooth and cool-headed (one who 'punishes' and doesn't 'torture'). Unfortunately, the CIA once again gets short shrift. Just like in 'Traitor' and The Bourne series, the CIA are either bumbling idiots or Machiavellian schemers (or both).<br /><br />Body of Lies has some nice cinematography and its greatest asset is the depiction of the Al Qaeda wannabe, Al-Saleem. He looks and sounds like the real thing and Ridley Scott correctly doesn't sugarcoat his terrorists. DiCaprio has a nice speech condemning Al-Saleem and his minions right before he's about to be beheaded.<br /><br />Despite this, Body of Lies errs in sugarcoating the Jordanian intelligence service at the expense of the CIA. Are they so much better than the CIA in real life? I think they're built up in order to shoot the CIA down and it doesn't ring true. Furthermore, Body of Lies features the ugly suggestion that the CIA would take an innocent man and set him up to be killed by terrorists. Of course if you're a conspiracy theorist, then you'll believe the CIA is capable of anything. Body of Lies is a mildly interesting spy thriller. It's worth viewing once but due to its implausible moments and somewhat anti-American bent, I wouldn't watch it again.idents of Jordan feel that 'Body of Lies' maligns their dear country.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|When I saw Sicko at the movie theatre in 2007, I was paying $580.00 a month for Cobra healthcare and not collecting unemployment because I had to leave my job in order to complete my student teaching. $580.00 a month would cover one person, myself.<br /><br />Fortunately, I could afford it but I know that many people can't. To be unemployed and paying cobra is a joke because most companies know that nobody can afford the premium monthly cost.<br /><br />Now, I pay less than $200.00 a month for cobra benefits but no co-pay. Well, what happened when I went to my primary care doctor for a check-up. I got billed and had to pay $81.00 out of a $130.00 bill. Instead of paying a smaller co-pay, the health insurance company is taking the bills and decided what counts and when it counts. Whatever the reason, the health insurance companies in this country have been taking us even the insured for a ride.<br /><br />Never mind that one of the major problems in keeping in our country is the high cost of health benefits. Major corporations go to countries where health care is state-provided and the salaries are lower. The health care industry is a joke now.<br /><br />I live in New Jersey where 18 hospitals have closed and our population has only increased over time to record amounts. Even the former first lady, Dina Matos McGreevey, lost her job at a hospital when it closed down last year.<br /><br />I waited for 7 hours at a well-known and respected hospital for 3 stitches in my finger in the emergency room because they had only 1 doctor on staff at the time.<br /><br />The health care industry is doing something criminally wrong when patients and human beings are dying every day because they can't get health care.<br /><br />The health industry worries about the growing obesity epidemic in our schools where the physical education programs have been cut and children today don't play outside.<br /><br />This documentary should have easily won the Oscar but the director's past behavior probably kept it from getting nominated. I don't blame President Bush or anybody else for this system that is in dire consequences. The companies and all of the politicians should have known about their unpredictable, dispicable behavior.<br /><br />There was a time when insurance companies did their jobs. Now they are failing us at an alarming rate. We have no choice but to ask our government to help save us and assist us in getting health care. Health care is a civil right isn't it? I think so.<br /><br />I have dual citizenship with my parents' native country just in case I need health care that I can't get here and that's why I did it.<br />I worry about going to the dentist for a cleaning or check-up just in case of the bill at the end.<br /><br />When I was last at my primary doctor's office, I asked for prescription for Allegra for the allergy season.

B001FB4VZS|1.0|This show used to be dumb but fun. Now it's incoherant and seems completely incapable of choosing what story it wants to tell. Chloe makes dumb choices, Clark is a jerk, there are no Luthors. The season ender to this show was abysmal and I really wish I could unsee it.<br /><br />No I won't buy the DVD, nor should you buy it as a gift for someone who watches Smallville unless they specifically request this season. Pretty much it ruins any good feelings towards previous seasons by ruining everyone's characterization.<br /><br />Go buy Chuck instead. That show understands Superman much better than Smallville.
0812971825|5.0|Elizabeth Strout has created a very believable, very human cast of characters, all of whom struggle with \\"issues\\"--some important, some mundane. Lots of big themes: courage, grace, humility, love, death, but mostly how to be the best possible human being in a world that doesn't offer quick, easy answers. The references to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the repeated mentions of the hymn \\"Abide With Me,\\" added to my enjoyment of the novel. Set during the Cold War, it brought back many memories of my own childhood: the canned food in the basement, the fear of nuclear war, telephoning on a party line. Highly recommended.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Existentialism: A college professor claims that far from being a philosophy of despair (Sartre claims never to have felt despair), existentialism is a philosphy of \\"exuberance,\\" hope, and possibility.<br />The professor considers but refutes postmodern claims that we are socially constructed, and re-emphasizes existential claims that we are our own authors.<br /><br />Language: A college aged blonde woman discusses language theory. She contemplates how much of our experience is abstract and ineffable, but also stresses how we live for the moments when true communication takes place and we feel understood. This she compares to spiritual communion.<br /><br />Evolutionary Psychology: An ev. psychologist considers the telescoping (accelerated) nature of human evolution. He argues that evolution is accelerating at such a rate that soon we will be able to detect evolutionary alterations even in our own lifetimes.  So far evolution has been governed by the survival of species, but, he argues, we are about to enter a new phase of evolution whereby individuals will evolve according to inner desires...<br /><br />Alienation: An alienated rebel suggests that humans not only desire chaos (including catastrophes) but that they need it. But he also argues that the media intentionally makes us feel small and powerless. As a means of protest, he sets himself ablaze.<br /><br />Collective Memory/Consciousness: Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy discuss the possibility that we are all able to access not just our own individual memories but also the memories of the human species. Delpy says she often feels like she is an old woman looking back on her life, and Hawke suggests that we are all somehow connected to the same consciousness (and that this explains why humans on all points of the globe often stumble upon the same ideas at the same time).<br /><br />Free Will: A scientist discusses the history of the determinism v. free will argument. Governed by his own field of expertise he attempts to explain everything according to unbending physical laws, yet, despite his training and deliberations, he is unwilling to give up the idea of free will...<br /><br />Systems of Control: A man with speakers on the roof of his car drives through the city streets warning the public that we are all members of a \\"corporate slave state,\\" and he urges us not to surrender to the mass dehumanization that he sees being perpetrated by corporations and politicians (which he sees as corporate puppets). He argues that they all want to make us feel small so that we won't resist, but that we must resist in order to assert our creative humanity.<br /><br />Attitude: An older professor argues that we must struggle to liberate ourselves from the negative: \\"Say yes to one instant, and you say yes to life.\\"<br /><br />Liminal Experiences: Meaning \\"inbetween\\"  states or experiences that challenge existing accounts/defintions of experience, identity, reality. An ethnic writer argues that these liminal experiences that challenge the norm are in fact becoming the norm. And, he goes on to argue that we are all becoming part of a greater subjectivity (or radical subjectivity) that recognizes no set boundaries.<br /><br />Time/Identity: A middle-aged pair of friends discuss their lives and how they felt that the uncertainty of youth would one day vanish into the certainty of age.

B0026JWDQW|5.0|This CD is definitely for those who like variety. There is the Paolo we know from These Streets but there is the Paolo we know from growing up with family and friends in Scotland. I find every song on this CD to be enjoyable in its' own way, Candy is the marketable piece but the wild jazzy Pencil Full of Lead takes you in a totally different direction as does High Hopes where you would swear you are sitting on the porch of an old southern plantation in the 1920's. Simple things is totally country ballad from the heather hills. Love it.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This action film (with its stunning soundtrack) reaffirms a cherished tradition for nobility under fire. Some of the great warriors throughout history were bodyguards for women. Overtures, codes of conduct, epic stories of chivalry and unrelenting heroism, were written to honor those who took a sword or bullet for the women, under their protective wing. Rules of conduct prevailed in antiquity, even for passionate men, who found themselves in service to and falling in love with women of noble birth.    To hold dear the memory of service and requited love to a wealthy woman: this would be the premise of Bodyguard, the motion picture. Accepting the consequences of shielding a celebrity from her attackers is the duty assigned our hero. He is the one who strikes the match to passion between client and guardian; she may light up the sky with her fierce temperment, but he presides over the calmness, that measures out discretionary love, subdued passion, and quiet intimacy between a woman and a man.     The lyrical beauty of the soundtrack permeates the relationship between our two main characters (played by Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston); this, in turn, allows pure romanticism to prevail as an undercurrent, and permits the bold eye contact between lovers to secure the bonds of stoic passion. This merge of powerful voice and orchestration with the heightened tension of a certain attack on our heroine drives the crescendo upward into the major climax, at the awards' show. The grateful client honors her bodyguard with her words (and in song cherishes his devoted love to her). Chivalry remains paramount in this powerful film.

B002BAWIWU|5.0|George Harrison has had a few compilations before, but none of them were very well put together.  This one is great.  If you'll notice, the only negative comments by reviewers are that they wanted MORE, not that the 19 songs here aren't worthy of 5 stars.  No one can argue that these aren't Harrion's best even if the occasional reviewer misses a personal favorite track.  The solo work of the \\"Quiet Beatle\\" is often forgotten, but the best of George Harrison truly stands with the best of Paul McCartney and John Lennon.  These 19 songs, 16 solo songs and three solo performances of Harrison's best Beatles songs, are a fantastic representation of George's work from the breakup of the Fab Four right through to the end of his life.  If you're a Beatles fan and you're unfamiliar with George's work but you like songs like Here Comes the Sun and Something, you will not be disappointed.
B0020GUXW2|5.0|In honor to the truth, the life of Casals was not only fascinating, enriching and exciting, but besides genuinely productive. Casals brought back the cello, the divine majesty as soloist instrument since the first half of the XIX Century, achieving an enviable pinnacle with the set of cello sonatas of Beethoven, Archiduke Trio, Brahms double Concerto among other musical gems. It could be said that during the second half of the XIX Century, the cello assumed a secondary role. The works composed by Schumann, Lalo, Saint Saens and Dvorak were charm and gentle but isolated the instrument of its innate expressive possibilities, to become another accompanist instrument. Over the first decades of the XX Century, Prokoviev, Shostakovich, Kachaturian and Villalobos at some extent, intended to restore the cello the first order role that had had during the XVII Century.<br /><br />Casals - like no other musician - worked without rest around the cello as prima voice. He understood better than no one, the enormous relevance of Bach respect the Suites for solo cello. And so decade and a half of his life, was devoted to show the world the forgotten treasures that nestled behind the dusty and yellow pages.<br /><br />On the other hand, his enriching experience with so many emblematic musicians, thinkers and composers widened his vision about the importance of the sound of this noble instrument. As we may realize, he consecrated his musical activity as chamber musician like no other soloist artist. And this wave grew around the world. Since the times of Fritz Busch, the emergence of the Budapest, Vegh, Hungarian, Parrenin and Griller Quartets, would lead him to materialize one of his most coveted expectations:his maxim achievement,the creation of Prades Festival in 1950 to commemorate the second bicentenary of Bach's death. This Festival still resounds over the actual generations of musicians.<br /><br />As a matter of fact,Puerto Rico and Marlboro Festivals(We should not forget Mitzuko Ichida grew up as musician at Marlboro)were sublime echoes of Prades. And the countless musicians (Szigetti, Vegh, Grumiaux, Stern, Horzowski, Kapell, Serkin, Istomin,Tortellier, Fuchs and Rose, among so many others) made possible the chamber music acquired status relevance and at the same time made every musician grew up to unsuspected levels as soloists and interpreters.<br /><br />This invaluable compilation is part of the musical history of the XX Century. As hard listener, you will have to reencounter yourself with admirable versions of the Trio Thibaud - Cortot - Casals, his notable contributions with Otto Schulhoff and Horskowski in the early thirties, his unforgettable cello suites, his unique and until now unequalled version of the Dvorak' s cello Concerto that certainly would be this brief comment would surmount its goal.<br /><br />For the new generations of young people, it's an excellent opportunity to listen with sublime sound without those unerring distortions of the well reminded LP format.<br /><br />So in order to preserve the memory of this sublime and exceptional  human being, you should not miss this first order edition that justifies plainly the undeniable transcendence of this master of masters.<br /><br />A glorious master jewel in your invaluable musical collection.musician at Marlboro)were sublime echoes of Prades.

0385340575|4.0|Really looking at three and a half stars.  The rating based on the fact that Lee tried to get back on track with Reacher. He still has to get back on track with America.  This book doesn't include all of the whinny political diatrabe in Lee's previous failure and that was refreshing.  He does however take a few pot shots at Ronald Regan, special ops and all of our federal crime fighting organizations. This was possibly required by the people in Hollywood who want to make a few Reacher movies with their own spin.    Lee did like the NYPD but that is proobably due to the fact that he lives in NY and doesn't want to drop any dirt on his own doorstep.    All in all the book is a good read and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.  Being an ex New Yorker I enjoyed the trips Reacher took around Manhattan and all of his escapades on The subway.  Stay on track Lee!!!!!
B001F7XIJW|4.0|... and to the untrained ear. Gojira's music is unmistakable and this is no small feat some 40 years after the genesis of metal. They have managed to refine a vibrant aesthetic completely their own, and remain singular. They simply do not collectively sound like anyone else though that's not to say none of their elements will not suggest other bands. Where The Link and From Mars to Sirius, however, had a much tighter and addicting flow to the music, this album seems like an abstract painting with sometimes TOO MUCH going on. It can make for a jarring listen to sit through in one setting because the band incorporates more of an ebb and flow to this album. It's truly inspiring to hear such accomplished skill in display but after several listens, i found with the shuffling of some of the tracks, a more consistent flow could have possibly disguised it.     All in all, the genius is here, but this time around, the indulgence seems a bit excessive, with a couple of tracks seeming oddly out of place, and if this trend continues, this great band just may achieve what they seek, minus the riches to captivate and scorch souls. After all, theirs was initially a nod more to death metal than prog-rock, which is where they're leanings lie on this round. A winner, nevertheless.

B001EN71DG|5.0|Probably the most famous, if not greatest movie trilogy ever made, this collection (essentially a slim-downed version of the earlier 2004 box set release) is a must have for any Lucas/StarWars/scifi buff, fan or dabbler. For me, though, what makes the set great is the inclusion of both original and enhanced theatrical releases, but not for the usual reasons given. You'll find no whining protest about sacrilege to movie icons here, the special editions are fabulous, as they were when originally released. George Lucas spent time and money to make his films finally fit the vision he had always had in his mind, and in doing so ties all six Star Wars films (all excellent, by the way) into a homogeneous whole. For anyone of a creative nature, it's not hard to understand the desire to make something as good as it can be, and Lucas succeeds. The films are stunning, even if a bit dated, which is, I guess, the reason why some many 'hard-core' Warsians love them. I was 19 when the first film came out, so I didn't 'grow up' watching them, so maybe there's a whole reverence thing that I just don't get, but, hey, it's Star Wars!! The packaging matches the Episode I-III box set (which is equally as enjoyable), and while some original bonus content may be lost, it won't really matter in the long run. So now, go out and buy Episodes I-II-III and live the total thrill of the 'Star Wars Saga!'

B001DEXDNI|5.0|First let me say that I am not a die-hard Lennox fan. I really know very little about her music. I bought this cd for tracks 2-4, which were the only ones I was familiar with.    But what a great surprise the rest of this cd was. Little Bird, Pavement Cracks, A Whiter Shade of Fade, Shining Light, Pattern of My Life, and Cold are all new favorites of mine. This whole collection of songs were a real treat to listen too. I am now quite a fan of Ms Lennox.    I'm sure diehard fans will find songs missing from this collection, but for a new listener, this set is quite amazing.

No longer do you look through the liner notes of SOAD's disography and have to guess who had more of an influence in the lyrics of a song when you see split credit between Malakian/Tankian.     This album falls flat on its face with abhorent lyrical content. Daron Malakian must take 5 minutes per song and write whatever elementary school dribble that pops into his head.    Musically, the album is acceptable but lyrics make it utterly forgettable.

1400063515|1.0|I loved Fooled by Randomness. I recommended it to friends, colleagues and candidates. Beside thought-provoking comments on chance and financial markets, Taleb's previous book was a cheerful but cruel variation on the theme of the confusion between success and luck, a subject which has been discussed to death in literature, and which comes down to the question which has probably agitated people ever since ambitious young men walked the streets of Sumer and Akkad, and possibly earlier, being: \\"Why Am I Not More Successful ?\\".<br /><br />In Black Swan, Nassim Taleb abandons social critique to focus on philosophy, which unfortunately was the weakest part in Fooled by Randomness. We get several hundred pages of anecdotes and curiosities about Taleb's life, statistics, finance, and more about Taleb, all in a pretentious tone, which I found repetitive and boring (but which some apparently find entertaining). In my view, his main weakness is his poor sense of History  - which could come in handy in the study of dynamic phenomena over long periods. While plodding through Taleb's ramblings, I had the impression that what's really missing is having an historical (rather than statistical or mathematical) perspective on events. As for the \\"Black Swan\\" concept, it is theoretically worthless: since any event can be explained ex-post, a \\"Black Swan\\" is merely a pretentious term for \\"unforeseen event with major consequences\\". Incidentally, I find it paradoxical that someone who endeavours to write on uncertainty should be so certain of himself.<br /><br />And don't try Taleb's approach to risk management, which is essentially forgetting about unfavourable events since they are not predictable. I seem to understand that the author takes a dim view of planning, but he should think again. Planning is what people do when they have to prepare for an uncertain future (like the military does, for example). One of the keys to good planning is general knowledge: reading the newspapers for example, something Taleb takes a misplaced pride in not doing.Taleb takes a misplaced pride in not doing.
B001WCBPCW|4.0|I'm a long time Kasabian fan.  After being let down with their 2nd release Empire I was a little hesitant about getting this album.  All that melted away when I heard Underdog and Vlad the Impaler prior to release.  Now after hearing the album in it's entirety, I'm left with that same feeling I had with Empire.     As with Empire, this release has 4-5 standout songs with the rest being garbage.  Even on the standout songs (Fire, Underdog, Vlad, Where Did All the Love Go?) the lyrics are nonsensical.  Sergio is a musical mastermind, but can't write a song to save his life.  Kasabian has always had great music tracks, but on the last two releases the lyrical quality has plummeted.  This probably has something to do with Karloff leaving the band.  I realize it's not ALWAYS about the lyrics, but it's annoying that such great music can't get good lyrics with it.    Final Verdict:  If you're a Kasabian fan, buy this.  You won't be too disappointed.  If you're new to Kasabian, start with their first CD and work your way up to this one.
B000077VOY|4.0|This series came right before Thunderbirds, and had much of the same aesthetic.  Here's the lowdown: this is the first one in color (which adds a lot to the faux-underwater charm of the sets, lots of marine greens & blues), and more importantly, this one shares the \\"freedom of movement\\" approach that the Thunderbirds marionettes had.  If you aren't aware, the series that came after Thunderbirds (Captain Scarlett and Joe 90), while still of interest, opted for a VERY restricted puppet movement approach, in order to make them more \\"realistic\\" -- lots of sitting and standing still, almost no walking.  This series, however, has the \\"marionette bob\\" when they walk, just like Thunderbirds.  I know this may sound like a slight thing, but it adds IMMENSELY to the old-school charm, letting the figures bob on their strings instead of fixing them to the floor for \\"realism\\".  Very entertaining as well, nearly as much as Thunderbirds (though the action sequences in Thunderbirds can't be matched).
B001W63DXC|4.0|As one that got the chance to see the Maiden Metal Machine on this tour twice, I don't need to say that this is a gift from the Gods! I also don't need to say that Maiden hasn't lost a step in all these years (Nicko's drumming is at it's best on this one).<br />Good sound quality and a great set-list makes this for a must-have for any metal fan. I take one star because my copy jumps at the middle of Rime Of The Ancient Mariner for no apparent reason on several CD players, probably just bad luck from me.<br />Make sure you have this on your collection!
B000M4PPM2|2.0|....you have THE SOFT PARADE, by the Doors.<br /><br />The title piece (and set-closer), \\"The Soft Parade\\" is truly one of the silliest things ever committed to vinyl. With words like: \\"Peppermint miniskirts, chocolate candy-- Champion sax and a gur-ull named Sandy,\\" the myth of Jim Morrison's supposedly brilliant lyric-writing abilities was laid to rest for all time. You can almost hear Morrison drunkenly hiccoughing during his ad-libbed \\"This is the trip\\" nonsense on what is an overlong, wincingly putrid musical montage.<br /><br />His physical damage from drug and alcohol overconsumption and rapid decline were never more apparent than on the vocals for \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Tell All The People.\\" The man's lack of sobriety on the first and unsteady weakness on the second are almost painful to experience. \\"Wishful Sinful\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" are more of the same.<br /><br />The only standouts on this one are \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Runnin' Blue.\\" My guess is Jim was sober for those sessions. The rest here is totally forgettable. If you must own all the Doors albums, buy THE SOFT PARADE last. It's that poor, and that sad. Probably should have been called THE SAD PARADE.<br /><br />SIDE ONE:<br />[3:23] Tell All the People<br />[3:12] Touch Me<br />[4:49] Shaman's Blues<br />[3:08] Do It<br />[2:41] Easy Ride<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />[2:38] Wild Child<br />[2:33] Runnin' Blue<br />[3:02] Wishful Sinful<br />[8:37] The Soft Parade<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 34:03
B0016BKTQC|3.0|WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (\\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\") or just totally stoned out of his mind (\\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the DOORS' first two albums-- tracks like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.<br /><br />Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (\\"Wintertime Love\\") and schmaltzes (\\"Love Street\\") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through to L.A. WOMAN. The DOORS were a band that the \\"Best Of\\" compilation was ideal for.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|Can these mastering engineers do anything right? There is almost no track on this CD that has been decently remastered. I guess they want to \\"modernize\\" the sound of these priceless recordings so every track is overly compressed, heavily EQ'ed, maxed in volume to virtual distortion, and so brittle and harsh sounding that the CD is barely listenable. Listen to the first guitar crashes in \\"Get Back,\\" and see if you don't agree that it sounds distorted. If you have the \\"Let It Be\\" CD for comparison you'll see what I mean. \\"I Feel Fine\\" is completely ruined by the almost total removal of reverb from the lead guitar and vocals, though I've read that the original American releases all had more reverb than the English records.     I really had high hopes for hearing these songs with updated sound, especially since the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" CD sounds so great, but the powers that be at EMI really need to rethink what a great remastering should be. These were engineered wonderfully in the first place, so in most cases \\"less is more\\" when it comes updating the Beatles catalog.
B001TODCII|1.0|This movie was awful.  As much as I love Liam Neeson, I hated this movie.  The whole premise is ridiculous.  First, it's unbelievable that as a father he would remain as composed as he did and just happen to call as his daughter is \\"taken.\\"  There's no way an intelligent viewer could suspend his imagination long enough to believe he could do the things he did to reclaim his daughter.  Set aside the fact that he becomes a totally unsympathetic psychopath during the process.  The body count is higher than a Terminator movie yet we're supposed to remain behind his cold blooded killing because he's a father who loves his daughter.  I watched this with my daughter and ended up having to discuss with her the implications of gratuitous violence and ethics - using the movie as poor examples for both.
0316042994|5.0|Originally published in 1944, and in spite of the military setting of the prologue, this novel has little to do with the World War, but is almost wholly about the estrangement of life among the upper British society as penetratingly portrayed and satirized by the antics of the Flyte and Ryder families during those years that paralleled the historical angst that lead into the Second World War.     One of the very greatest writers of the twentieth century, Waugh is a commanding painter with words:  such brilliant, precise, well-planned and placed words, much like a great work by Beethoven, ordered so inevitably that one knows that no other combination could speak clearer or louder or softer - or with more encompassing wit.  It is a delight to read - and then re-read, to savor many of its perfect passages.  Like:  \\"...their barn-yard daughters will snigger and think their father was quite a dog in his day...\\"     and: \\"Charm is the great English blight.... It kills love, it kills art; I greatly fear, my dear Charles, it has killed you.\\"    Even the surnames are characterizations:  Ryder - Charles, and even his unruffled father, smug in his mocking schemes, seemed content to just ride along with what the world subjects them to, sheltering an underlying laxness - or even care - with a smile of agreeableness and charm.  The Flytes, all six of them, denizens of a countryside castle-like manor named Brideshead, have interesting ways of fleeing reality, acting at times like automatons grasping at or revolting against selected religious catechisms, or choosing the quiet death of a passionate alcoholic.  Scenes change from Oxford, London, Venice, the Casbah or boat crossings of the Atlantic, but always, it seems, Brideshead calls.  \\"...for we possess nothing certainly except the past...\\"    Brideshead Revisited is the culmination of years of masterful writing and perhaps his very best novel:  the biting satire and broad-handed humor of A Handful of Dust and Decline and Fall have been honed by experience and refined by humanity, as we come to respect and care for all the book's major characters, while along the way many subjects and ideas are presented on the reader's stage:  faith and the role of God's Grace, independence, homosexuality, art, rights and responsibilities, and although a priest plays an important part, the reader will not be inveigled to find a confessional.  Waugh gives us \\"...one of those needle-hooks of experience which catch the attention when larger matters are at stake, and remain in the mind when they are forgotten...\\"    To paraphrase a Joni Mitchell song, Waugh has looked at love and life from not just both sides now, but countless sides, up and down, and given us the finest illusions to recall.    This is a masterpiece of English literature:  this classic cries out for reading!
0670020478|5.0|\\"What I hope you will find here is a new way of looking at your own potential and the potential of those around you.\\"    \\"The Element: How finding your passion changes everything\\" by Sir Ken Robinson is a book on passion, creativity, and, most importantly, education. In this book, he tells you how different people ranging from Paul McCartney (The Beatles), Meg Ryan (the actress), Paul Samuelson (the economist), Paolo Coelho (The Alchemist.. sorry, the writer) found their passion, their Element. His contention is that intelligence is diverse, dynamic, and distinct and typical hierachical and standardised education squandered them.    Sir Ken Robinson works in education and he caught eyes of millions in his all-time favourite talk in the TED conference in 2005. You might want to take a look at the 20 minutes talk before reading the book. I have found his talk tremendously inspirational and my review might be biased. But I would encourage you to also be biased and inspired by this intelligent and witty thinker.    Contents    (every chapter is filled with amazing stories of different amazing people in the world. In this briefing, I could not list all or even half of them) (I also copy (plagiarise) lots of words from the book and I hope it did not terribly violate the copyright!)    Chapter One: The Element  The chapter starts with Gillian Lynne and Matt Groening who were hopeless at school but ending up giving pleasure to millions around the world because they found their Element - \\"the place where the things you love to do and the things you are good at come together.\\" Sir Ken Robinson explained that the Element has two main features and two conditions aptitude (I get it), passion (I love it), attitude (I want it), opportunity (Where is it?).    Chapter Two: Think Differently  We take things for granted. When asked how many senses we possess; people normally answer five or six. That is taking things for granted. Psychologists and scientists assert that there are fourmore. Likewise, when we talk about intelligence, people often refer it to IQ. That is taking things for granted. Sir Ken Robinson tells us that three features of intelligence are that it is diverse, dynamic, and distinct. And we should rather ask \\"How are you intelligent?\\" than \\"How intelligent are you?\\"    Chapter Three: Beyond Imagining  This chapter starts with three myths of creativity. One myth is that only special people are creative. Another myth is that creativity is about special activities like the arts, design, or advertising. The third myth is that people are either creative or not. Sir Ken said they are all not true. He wrote how imagination is different from creativity and how we should develop both. There are also stories of George Harrison (The Beatles) and how he and Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne created a wonderful album and how an American physicist, Richard Faynman won a Nobel Prize.    Chapter Four: In the Zone  \\"To be in the zone is to be in the deep heart of the Element.\\" \\"...it transforms our experience of the Element. We become focused and intent. We live the moment. We become lost in the experience and perform at our peak.\\" The Zone is the place or time where we feel the true sense of freedom and authenticity. Sir Ken Robinson wrote that we are often confined in boxes like the MBTI personality test that group people into sixteen personality types. \\"My guess is that sixteen personality types might be a bit of an underestimate. My personal estimate would be closer to six billion.\\"    Chapter Five: Finding Your Tribe  The chapter starts with Meg Ryan and how she met different people who gradually shape her Element. \\"Being a part of this tribe brings her to the Element.\\" People trying to find their Element need a place to discover themselves. Sir Ken talked about two distinct ideas; \\"domain\\" (the sorts of activities and disciplines people are engaged in) and \\"field\\" (the other people who are engaged in it). He also told us the difference between the tribe and the crowd.    Chapter Six: What Will They Think?  The three circles of constraint which are the barriers to finding the Element are personal, social, and cultural. In this chapter, he wrote about the disabled artist who would not give in to his disadvantage, the story of Paolo Coelho and his family, the Huffington Post (one of the most popular blogs) founder, and Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize for Architecture who grew up in Iraq.    Chapter Seven: Do You Feel Lucky?  Attitude plays an important role in finding your Element. People who find their Element often say they are lucky despite difficulties and unfortunate circumstances. Sir Ken Robinson wrote about himself when he was very young and caught polio when he was four. He wrote about an accidentally blind John Wilson who played a crucial role in curing blindness for millions in Africa. According to the study of the psychologist Richard Wiseman, lucky people tend to maximise chance opportunities; they tend to be very effective at listening to their intuition; they tend to expect to be lucky; and they have an attitude that allows them to turn bad luck to good.    Chapter Eight: Somebody Help Me  Most people who found their Element often have mentors who help them. The important lesson from this chapter is that mentors have four significant roles, recognition, encouragement, facilitating, and stretching.    Chapter Nine: Is It Too Late?  \\"Lady Di could be bicycling nude down the street giving this book away, and no one would read it.\\" was the comment Susan Jeffers received from a publisher directing at her book \\"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\\" before it had been sold millions of copies. And she only started writing properly into her forties. People's life expectancy has risen in the past century and although we cannot be a gold medalist in Olympics when we are sixty but Sir Ken Robinson wrote about lots of successful people who found their Element later intheir lives. \\"One of the fundamental precepts of the Element is that we need to reconnect with ourselves and to see ourselves holistically.\\"    Chapter Ten: For Love or Money  Not all those who find their Element have to be professionals. Sir Ken Robinson shows us the new way of looking at amateur. The word derives from the Latin word amator, \\"which means lovers, devoted friend, or someone who is in avid pursuit of an objective.\\" In this chapter, you will find lots of people who find their Element as an amateur; they do not do it for a living, just the love of it. Sir Ken tells us the difference between leisure and recreation. While leisure offers a respite, a passive break from the challenges of the day, \\"recreation carries a more active tone - literally of re-creating ourselves.\\"    Chapter Eleven: Making the Grade  Sir Ken Robinson focuses on education in this chapter and the most renown example would be Sir Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin. The problem with an education system is the hirarchy of disciplines (subjects) in schools and the other is that conformity has a higher value than diversity. There are more college graduates now than ever and degrees worth less now. More people who graduate in this generation could not find job because they need higher degree, the so-called academic inflation. In this chapter, Sir Ken tells us the new, alternative education system that might turn schools into, an analogy of, high quality customised restaurant rather than a fast food chain with standardised and unimaginative products.    ...    I'll compare this book to an ideal business book; a book that is easy to understand, distinct, practical, credible, insightful, and provides great reading experience. Although this book is not purely business but it can be directly applied.    Ease of Understanding: 9/10: This book is written in plain English and it is a really easy read. It is very harmonious and stories are weaved perfectly into the content of the chapters. Moststories are filled with conversations and clear points.    Distinction: 8/10: We all know the power of passion and how it affects our lives. Apart from numerous stories from people whom Sir Ken Robinson encountered, there is a fundamental distinction in the book which is how conventional education system is hindering the creativity of children.    Practicality: 5/10: There are two sides to view the book; one is that the author, Sir Ken Robinson, did not offer any sound and practical advice for readers to follow; the other view is that there is no specific guideline to reach your Element. He said that intelligence is diverse, dynamic, and distinct. There are numerous kind of intelligence, linguistic, musical, mathematical, spatial, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intra-personal. Intelligence is dynamic; it does not follow a linear pattern. And it is distinctive; it is as unique as a fingerprint. Thus, it's yours to find.    Credibility: 9/10: All the stories in the book are real, not fictional or theoretical. All the findings are either scientific or psychological findings. There is no reason not to believe him. The one point taken is that although his advices in education are exceptionally inspiring and true, we do not know the extent of it. Nobody knows if we follow the advice especially in education, how it may play out. It might be good but not as great as Sir Ken expected or it might be even better.    Insight: 8/10: All the stories in the book are extraordinary and the book is a great compilation of great and inspiring stories. The psychological findings are sufficient and intriguing albeit not too deep.    Reading Experience: 10/10: This is, by far, the most inspiring book I have read. From the introduction, regarding the stories in the book, \\"None of them have \\"perfect\\" lives. But all of them regularly experience moments that feel like perfection. Their stories are often fascinating.\\" he continues \\"But this book isn't really about them. It's about you.\\" So,if you read the book with an open mind, you will find a way to discover your Element. The range of people in the book is astonishingly diverse and I hope that one of them will trigger your imagination to reach your Element. I cannot praise it enough.    Overall: 8.2/10: Am I biased? Probably. I am biased because Sir Ken Robinson gave a twenty minutes talk that changed the way I look at my life. I am biased because his book gave me inspiration that I look into the future with optimism and with passion. I am because that this book make me feel that \\"I\\" can pursue my dream with my creativity and intelligence. I am biased because this book tells me that my Element is there and it is for me to find it. So yes, I am biased in my review and I deeply hope that you will be biased like me and you will live the life you love. There is no one-size-fits-all but if any of my friends and family members want me to recommend a book on my shelf, they will fortunately get the same answer, The Element.
B000068IEU|4.0|My friends and I saw this movie when we were 18, in 1973 and it scared us so badly, we never forgot it.  We've talked about it over the years and decided to see if we could find it.... and of course we found it on Amazon.  The acting isn't the best, but the tale is frightening.

B0010VD7EO|3.0|The album is all over the place.  The few singles that made it onto the airwaves portray a much peppier music, almost dancish.  In reality, outside the singles, the album is more mellow.  While good, not what I expected it to be.
B0015L5B1G|5.0|As a hardcore Testament fan, I absolutely felt the need to have this special edition of the masterful The Formation Of Damnation, which I bought on pre-order early 2008.<br />However, after seeing the price tag in amazon at $65, I waited some months to see if the price drops but saw none of that. Brilliantly, after several months, I decided to check ebay and saw a bunch of brand new copies at $11!<br />After getting my copy and checking the bonus material, I am more than grateful of not having paid fifty extra bucks on it. The bonus material is very limited: a twenty minute making of feature which is basically someone with a camcorder at the studio, a photo gallery of about 15 pictures and some other stuff. Don't get me wrong, the material is cool but not so cool is the amazon price. The extras are not worth some extra fifty dollars.<br />If you are a hardcore fan, this edition is an absolute must. If you are a casual listener, get the regular single CD edition.
B000T2OMX0|5.0|Well, after hearing Queyras' Dvorak Cello Concerto I had to try his cello suites and I am not disappointed, especially after just having been so pleased with Steven Isserlis and Torleif Thedeen's recent recordings. I guess one can't have enough versions of Bach's Cello Suites. Queyras has a gorgeous sound and the technical quality of the recording seems to bring him right into your room. They are perhaps not as thoughtful or ruminative as some versions but they are high on beauty -- and that's a fine addition to the great ones. The only downside is the lack of jewel cases in Harmonia Mundi's presentation. Cardboard just doesn't last.
0449000729|5.0|This is an astounding masterpiece.  It's scope and research is breathtaking.  The families are believable, likable, hateable and thourally entertaining.  I highly recommend this work.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is very similar to the type of psychoanalytic work I did for a quarter century.  After I left that practice (now I just do meds for Kaiser)I felt as if I got over a 25 year psychosis.  One of the most charismatic of teachers we had said that in this work the \\"pressures are enormous.\\"  since then I have worked in places where I was hit in the head by inpatients quite regularly, and that got to be tough going, but the show brought back the tensions and agonies of the psychotherapy work in a way that I have yet to see on TV, and I admired the gal Dr. Malfi in Sopranos.  I could only wish that that my own interventions were as nicely crafted as Gabriel's.  The patient's were fascinating and well portrayed.  I want to buy the dvds and study them.  I am puzzled as to why more therapists are not captivated like I am.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I wanted to get one of these for a while now, but thought I should research it first.  All of the mixed reviews made me wary, but I figured if the return policy is ok, then go for it.  When I got it home, my husband hooked it up though our tv (we don't have a receiver).  I installed the software, put on an album and tried it out.  At first I couldn't get any sound, but a simple flick of the switch on the back of the player solved that.  I read the instructions on how to record, and away I went.  I tried recording one album in full and then breaking it down into individual songs.  The second album, I tried recording each song individually.  I found that the first option is less time consuming.    For me, I just wanted to be able to transfer my parents and grandparents folk albums, that you cannot get anymore, neither in vinyl or cd, or anywhere for that matter.  I loved listening to them as a child, and I feel that the vinyl gives a warmth to the music that you just don't get with cd's.  The software takes care of most of the pops and hisses, and the resulting mp3 is warm but not worn.  I love it!
0316017922|5.0|What determines who becomes the \\"successful\\" among us? It turns out that success depends on more than just intelligence and ambition. Instead, as Gladwell so colorfully and captivatingly conveys, success is determined by a confluence of surprising factors, including \\"fortunate birth dates and happy accidents of history.\\" In _Outliers_, he convincingly explains how  \\"It is not just the brightest who succeed...nor is success simply the sum of decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.\\"  A fascinating (and obviously successful!) book, _Outliers_ brings the \\"nature vs. nurture\\" debate about success to a whole new level. _Outliers_ offers an opportunity to truly understand the makings of success.
0307341569|5.0|This was a good book.  I enjoyed reading it and the story moved along quickly. This is pretty original in content and in the ending twists.  A good read for a summer afternoon or two.

B00164GDD2|3.0|Many scenes in this Blu-ray do look nice, but too many have been horribly over-processed.  A lot scenes have the contrast boosted so high that the highlights are completely blown-out, and the shadow detail is lost and replaced by insane levels of grain and darkness.  Other scenes are blurry, soft, and overly grainy without any extra detail.  For $15, it's not bad, but it's not as good as it could have been with less post-processing.
0375826726|4.0|Brisinger was a long wait in coming but well worth the wait after reading it.  It stayed true to the style of the first two books in which Eragon has to go on an epic adventure journey with several heavy battles and new revelations as to who he is and how he fits into the world.  I loved it and hope there are more books in this series to come.
1433502429|5.0|...though they should read it anyway :-)    Although the ESV is not my primary translation (too much \\"biblish\\" for my taste; I prefer the HCSB), all of the study material is truly top notch.  Conservative Evangelicals will find little to quibble about.  Although you may not agree with every comment, and I hope you don't, the scholarship is soild.    The Bible itself is very attractive.  It has a nice soft cover and gold-leaf edge paper. There is some print bleed-through, but it is not objectionable.  Thankfully the paper is much better than Crossway's previous Bibles.  It's a good thing that I don't hold grudges!     You could spend a lot more to buy a set of commentaries, etc., but having that material right there in the Bible itself is invaluable.  Their marketing phrase \\"To understand the Bible in a deeper way\\" rings true.
143915726X|5.0|this book is one of my favorites!  It's such a touching story of what a family will go through to save a member!  LOVED IT!  I'm so glad the movie is coming out soon!  A must read!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful, fast read that works beautifully on all levels. The characters are realistically brought to life in a story that sucks you right in. If, after reading this story, you ever look at dogs the same way again, you obviously weren't paying attention.  I am an animal lover, but I honestly don't believe that that is a prerequisite for becoming completely absorbed in this book. If you live in the Seattle area, you'll also enjoy the local landmarks. And if you don't live in these parts, you'll enjoy the visit.  Garth Stein has created a lovely masterpiece, and I only hope the movie captures its essence.

0452295548|1.0|I once had a bout with encephalitis coupled with Bell's Palsy and a high temperature; while I can't equate that to the author's stroke, I certainly don't remember much about anything other than being very scared and disoriented.  While the author has made a remarkable recovery from a dangerous stroke, the \\"book\\" is a 50 page short story padded out to make it look substantial.  I rapidly grew weary of  the author's detailed recollections of what she was thinking while undergoing her stroke which can be summarized as follows: \\"Oh, I am having a stroke and isn't it cool?\\"  I can't help but think the author made a lot of this up after the fact rather than actually experiencing it.

0525951113|5.0|DAEMON BY DANIEL SUAREZ: Daniel Suarez has designed and developed enterprise software for the defense, finance, and entertainment industries, as well as being an independent systems consultant; he's also an avid gamer.  So it's no surprise that in Daemon he has created a world and plot that involves all these facets, resulting in a fast-paced, riveting, exciting novel that is a combination of classic Michael Crichton and The Matrix.      Daemon begins with Matthew Sobol, a renowned computer programmer and video game designer, dead from cancer.  It is upon his death, when the obituary is posted online, that the dormant daemon is unleashed upon the world.  In this world - just like our own - everything is automated and computerized: banking, transportation, defense, government, patient records; there are few things remaining \\"off the grid.\\"  The daemon works fast and incredibly efficient, beginning a systematic takedown of technology and world systems, causing deaths and the collapse of companies, and a financial meltdown that is scarily similar to the current economic climate.    It's up to Detective Sebeck and computer genius Jon Ross to try and stop the daemon somehow from destroying everything.  Then there is The Grid, the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game - in the style of World of Warcraft and Lord of the Rings Online - created by Sobol, where the daemon secretly begins recruiting the disaffected but brilliant youth who play the game as part of its efforts to bring down technology and society.    Whether you're a gamer, a computer person, a network specialist, an Internet aficionado, or just someone who likes books about technology and possibly the end of the civilized world, Daemon is the book for you.  Expertly written by Daniel Suarez, who knows exactly what he's talking about, Daemon is a book that will have you on the edge of your seat from page one to the very end, and waiting for the sequel, Freedom, due out in 2010.
B001AQR39O|4.0|I gave the 2nd season of Californication 4 stars out of 5. I read the reviews that were posted and I will agree that this season isn't as \\"good\\" as the first season.  The first season gave the audience something they are definitely not used to seeing, the character of Hank Moody.  Despite all the negative that Moody creates, the audience can't help but fall in love with him in the first season.    I don't feel that the 2nd season tried to be as funny as the first. That's what made the 1st season so enjoyable, nonstop laughs in every episode. This season is far more dramatic and has a plot that starts to develop, instead of the sex, drugs, and comedy that season 1 was about. That is why I think people didn't like it as much, because the \\"originality\\" of the 1st season wasn't duplicated as much; but how long do you think the writers could go with Hank sleeping with random women left and right before it got old. I feel this season shows the development of Hank Moody far better than season 1 had created.    Nontheless, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if you listen to mine- you'll buy this set and enjoy your purchase...but please don't expect the same tone that season 1 created...I think the show is heading in a better direction

055380684X|2.0|A decent read if you are looking for something interesting but it doesnt really tell you how to develop your talent better as much as the title suggests.    As a person that actually does a lot of practice (I'm a music student) I found Roberto Moretti's book much more helpful. This book is generally just a collection of stories that, while entertaining, aren't entirely useful and can get a little repetitive.

0425223523|2.0|I enjoy these Austen-extension books in general, but this was very disappointing.  I agree with another reviewer that the writing is juvenile and exceedingly bland.  Wentworth starts out abrasively cocky during his first meetings with Anne and somehow ends up anxiety ridden and neurotic.  Part of the charm of Jane Austen's novels is that you would like to meet her men.  This Captain Wentworth can stay on the pages.
1853262390|3.0|This book proves that Virginia Woolf could write what she damned well pleased - she had a family publishing house that published all her work (is that the same as self-published these days?) and a literary salon that the who's-who of literature at the time frequented. An enviable position to be in and not have to risk the inevitable rejection letter from a publisher who wanted more of the same that sold. At one point she even celebrates the unpublished or self-published writer by saying \\"while fame impedes and constricts, obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded.\\"<br /><br />That said, Orlando is, in my mind, Woolf herself, taking a bold romp through history, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan to Edwardian times, free of the limitations of thinking in a particular sex, yet being bound by the conventions of his/her times depending on when Orlando was either a man or a woman - all the while letting us experience life in those particular times through the lenses of Orlando's thougths and through his/her biographer's descriptions and ruminations. Woolf's descriptioons of changing landscapes (London going from a clump of derelict buildings and muddy streets in Elizabethan England to a modern metropolis during the Restoration), political systems, customs (wearing a ring and being married became prominent during Victorian times), food ( crumpets and muffins were invented in the 19th century), women's sizes (\\"slim was in\\" in Edwardian London),speech (evasive conversation was espoused in Victorian England) are told in rich flowing prose that does not stint in its use of dashes and semicolons.<br /><br />Time transitions take place during sleep, while thinking or while on a long voyage at sea, where our hero(ine)remains unaged (albeit, at times sex changed) as the world changes around her.<br /><br />The pompous biographer that Woolf chooses as her device for rendering the story is also a free spirit, free to comment, jump from place to place, ruminate and sidebar - all needed in order to deliver a story of this vast time sweep.<br /><br />I wouldn't read this novel for entertainment, but rather as a study of what experimental fiction must have been in Woolf's day.<br /><br />My one regret is that with all this going for her ( no rejection slips, write whatever she wanted) our dear Virginia had to load herself up with stones and drown herself in a river. Oh, if she would only know the travails of the writer, let alone the experimental one, of today! Should we strap boulders to our necks and jump off cliffs, or like Orlando, should we just flit back ( or forward) in time to when writers were treated with more respect and given such freedom to experiment?<br /><br />[...]r to deliver a story of this vast time sweep.

B0026NWBY2|1.0|Who is this collection for?  It can't decide what it is.  As is the fault of many an artist collection, it isn't greatest hits, it isn't rarities.  What SHOULD have been done was a double CD as others have mentioned, either chronologically hitting all essential songs, or better yet, like McCartney did, they could have done 1 CD as a Greatest Hits and the other as Rarities/for fans/family choices.  I'd have to give a double CD more thought, so for starters on a single CD collection, if you simply eliminated the three \\"Beatle\\" tracks from here as well as Rising Sun, and add This Song, Crackerbox Palace, Love Comes to Everyone and Faster, this collection would be way better (as a one CD greatest hits for those who don't have any Harrison CDs).  Sorry to nit-pick, but I just don't understand the exclusion of these songs and the inclusion of the others.  Those unfamiliar would want the missing hits, fans who have all the hits would want more rarities.  I just don't understand the intention of this collection.
0060558121|2.0|The idea that gods and other mythological figures walk amongst us is clever and creative.  It is a good premise for a story, and one expects that this book takes advantage of that premise to the fullest.  Unfortunately, Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" fails on many levels.<br /><br />The introduction is good and succeeds in pulling the reader in.  In fact, the good introduction is the only reason I actually finished the book in the first place.  Dude gets out of jail and has nowhere to go until he meets a stranger who somehow knows who he is and gets hired as  a bodyguard of sorts.  It is in fact more interesting than I make it sound here.<br /><br />After that a bunch of stuff happens and the book ends eventually.  Of course, there is a twist at the end and nothing was what it appeared to be throughout the book, but I didn't care because nothing was ANYTHING in the book.  The various characters, locations, and actions are so vaguely explained during the course of the book that when they turned out to be something else at the end I wasn't surprised at all.  The author never took the time to solidify the characters, and, instead of adding to the \\"mystery\\", the lack of solidity destroyed the opportunity to create an effective twist or surprise.  Nearly every person in this book is a god, or supernatural in some way.  Wouldn't normal people start to notice these things?  And the \\"missing people\\" in the one community were so obviously sacrifices that I didn't care when it was finally revealed.<br /><br />Long story short, this book is just adult novel trash.  Anyone who thinks this is a \\"heavy read\\" should read some Neal Stephenson and then take another look.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|[[ASIN:B000KCHZK6 Not Too Late]]  [[ASIN:1423427327 NORAH JONES NOT TOO LATE]]  As an enthusiastic fan of Norah Jones it pains me to say that this CD might not be too late but it is not too good.  This singer has such range and creativity but none of this shows up on this collection.  One track sounds much like another and while Norah's distinctive voice is enjoyable there is little spark, musicality, or originality so evident in much of her previous work.  If you collect this artist's work, then, by all means, purchase this CD.  For the rest of her fans, keep believing that truly is not too late for the young chanteuse and keep watching for a future CD that will have the vitality, charm, and wit that weaves the special Nora Jones spell.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|How many times do we have to see horror stories about how our food, the food we eat, the food that goes into our bodies is handled, before we stand up and do something about it? Apparently, many because we still haven't done anything.<br /><br />\\"Food, Inc.\\", directed by Robert Kenner, and co-produced by Eric Schlosser (writer of \\"Fast Food Nation\\") and Michael Pollan (writer of \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma), takes an in depth view at a handful of various problems with the food industry in our country. Presented in \\"Chapters\\", Schlosser or Pollan introduce the various segments leading into a series of graphics, interviews, archival and hidden camera footage and more all of which illustrates the problems we are facing.<br /><br />Did you know that Chickens have been engineered to grow faster and larger, in order to produce more breast meat? The companies who provide us with chicken realized a while back that we prefer white meat. When a customer prefers something, it is more efficient to grow what the customer wants. White meat is also more expensive, so it is a win-win situation for these companies to fulfill our needs and wants. But what about the dark meat? The result? Engineered chickens ready for slaughter faster and yielding more white meat. But it also results in chickens with no flavor that are grown in very inhumane conditions. Most never see sunlight and can't walk for very long because their internal organs can't keep up with the growth of their bodies.<br /><br />For many years, corn farmers have lobbied lawmakers for protection and subsidies, and this has created an overwhelming abundance of corn. Because there is so much of the grain, scientists have worked out many ways to use the abundant staple, to prevent wasting it, and to maximize profits. One of these, high fructose corn syrup, is now in a majority of the items we consume. But they also decided to start feeding the corn to cattle animals that are supposed to eat grass. There is a by-product of this new practice; e-coli bacteria. When the cattle eat this feed, they have a higher chance of creating the bacteria. And the fact they are contained in small lots, with barely enough room to move around, standing knee deep in their own feces for hours every day, doesn't help the situation.<br /><br />Why do we raise the majority of the cattle in this country in such a fashion? Because the fast food industry (McDonalds purchases the most ground beef in the world) wants cheap beef. If they can feed the cattle more cheaply, those savings are passed on to the large chains and are then passed on to the consumer through \\"Dollar\\" and \\"Value\\" menus.<br /><br />These are just two of the stories the film follows in detail. Providing a lot of information, the filmmakers connect the dots to illustrate why our food production system is in need of some drastic changes.<br /><br />If we don't change it, we are going to continue to get sick, some of us will continue to die. And it is all preventable.<br /><br />Why do we allow it to continue? A handful of very large companies control all of the production of our processed foods. They lobby Congress and the Senate, getting the lawmakers to protect them. They don't have to do anything about it. When there is an outbreak, they make some minor changes, but as we saw from the E-Coli outbreak in hamburger, it happened a few times and will no doubt happen again.<br /><br />People are getting the message.

B0018QOIXU|1.0|I was really looking forward to this CD, but, while Adele has a lovely voice, all but one of the cuts (\\"Chasing Pavements\\") is even remotely listenable.  The rest are repetitive, uninteresting and boring.  Too bad.  I was expecting more from her.
B0000C1733|5.0|i have really enjoyed watching this band evolve over the past 20 or so years, enjoying there music in my teens and exploring it further in my early twenties, it has lead me into interesting explorations always enjoy the lyrics which often have far more historical referrance than is easily recognized. I highly recommend the Greatest Hits CD with Under The Bridge as the first song.
031606792X|5.0|Based on many negative reviews, I started reading Breaking Dawn with some skepticism. Would I like it? I poured through the book and couldn't put it down. So I emphatically state, \\"Yes, I love Breaking Dawn!\\" Although I would have changed a few things, for the most part, I enjoyed reading it wholeheartedly. It would have been more interesting to have Bella and the Cullens/friend vampires shake up the Volturi more than they did though. I like Bella being a vampire having special gifts. I'm glad she didn't have to give up nearly everything, as she thought she would, and lose her core self. I admire Bella's courage and determination. She uses her talents to benefit the Cullens and their allies. Bella and Edward's daughter brought so much more to the story. I look forward to, hopefully, reading more Twilight books yet to be written about Renesmee and Jacob. I wish I could read one now as I've enjoyed reading the Twilight saga very much. Don't listen to the negative reviews, read Breaking Dawn for yourself and form your own opinion, don't focus on the criticism others dish out. Although movies rarely do books justice, I eagerly anticipate the Breaking Dawn movies to come out!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Rock'n'Roll Seattle-style is closer to grunge and hard rock, so it comes as a complete surprise to hear the harmony-infused acoustic-folk, campfire sounds of 'Fleet Foxes'. With a debut album closer to a cross between 'David Crosby' and a 'Pastoral School Choir', than to guitar-driven rock, I really had to sit back and listen intently to this lot in case I missed something. I was glad that I took the time, the songs are great company, and definitly a world removed from most acts out there today. The pick of the bunch is 'White Winter Hymnal' with a melody so infectious that it just never leaves your head. The rest of the album is a joy to behold. It is different but yet very accessible and if you like diversity in your CD collection, then this sits just nicely. Hard to categorize and even harder to put down. Enjoy..
B001NFNFIK|3.0|I can only agree with much that has already been said:  This film is beautifully cast, respectful of its place (and shot on the sites of the novel), atmospheric, and leisurely.  It is remarkably faithful to the original novel, yet, because that novel is so interior and so complete, the movie version can't deliver the punch the book did.  (I don't think the framing narrative helped.)  The ghosts who are the protectors of the life Dave grew up in show only a little of the vigor they have in the novel; the very last scene of the film, a scene that made chills run down my spine in the novel, has no punch because there's been no setup for it.<br /><br />Really, a very worthy and enjoyable effort, but it does fall short.

1423377001|5.0|For decades the key to surviving in the world has been left-brain thinking with careers keyed to lawyers, accountants and engineers. The future, former White House speechwriter Daniel Pink maintains, is in right-brain thinkers - designers, teachers, creative and empathic professions: A WHOLE NEW MIND tells how to stimulate and use right-brain thinking for maximum profit and achievement, and this audio receives a fine reading by author Pink himself. A top pick for business and general-interest libraries alike.
B001PA0FF4|5.0|Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Father Flynn, Amy Adams as Sister James and Viola Davis as the boy's mother, all do a superb acting job in this powerful, unsettling film.  When Father Flynn is accused by Sister Aloysuis of child molestation, a story unfolds about the characters of each, the nun's deep certainty that the child is being abused and the seemingly kind nature of the priest.  There is doubt that the playwright weaves into the movie as we get to see more depth to each of these characters.  It's difficult to hate any of them because the director does an excellent job of making us look at all sides and into each personality.  Sister James kind of mirrors back the thoughts of each and you can tell she is torn between what she believes to be true and what is being told to her as the movie progresses.<br /><br />This movie left me thinking and wondering for many weeks after I watched it.  It's not exactly what I expected.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes stories that involve a lot of deep thought and a lot of character development.  Also, if you're a Meryl Streep or Philip Seymour Hoffman fan, this shows them at their best.
0765342294|5.0|Orson Scott Card is truly a master of science fiction.  I consider his books the successors to Isaac Asimov's works.  \\"Ender's Game\\" can be enjoyed by anyone from any background.  Even better, read Ender's Game and then read \\"Ender's Shadow\\" for another twist of complexity.

B0012OQZWA|5.0|I have been a fan of metal for many years, and the older I get the more I appreciate and love listening to music that challenges me. Origin has become one of those bands. I heard Echoes of Decimation a few years ago shortly after it came out, and it blew me away. I had never heard \\"technical death metal\\" before, in fact the heaviest thing I had heard was Dimmu Borgir's \\"Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia\\" or some Cradle of Filth albums. Other bands came and went, but Origin was always there on my ipod, begging to assault my ears in the best way possible...    Then I heard \\"Antithesis\\" came out. From the first second I played \\"The Aftermath\\" knew it was something special. Each song is FAST. However, they all have moments that make them unique, and the band somehow found the ability to make something even heavier amidst crushing rhythms, relentless double bass drumming and blastbeats. They change pace, employ a breakdown or two, solo, and unleash genuinely catchy riffs. I expect the drums to be triggered at this level, and it detracts NOTHING from the proceedings. My favorite song on the album is \\"Consuming Misery\\" because of its undeniable heaviness and brutal, intricate moments.  Longsreth is awesome. He doesn't sound like a soulless drum machine that pollutes much of the other tech/death bands these days. (I LOVE Braindrill, but Marco is TOO good. His blasts are beyond human, and his amazing technique is almost too much... just my opinion. But I LOVE Braindrill, and their music is still in a level of its own.)    I read that another reviewer compared Origin to Necrophagist (which is detrimental to both bands, in my opinion), and since Origin \\"only plays in 4/4\\" they are somehow \\"not technical death metal.\\" Generally, I don't agree with lumping bands into categories, and comparing Origin to Necrophagist seems, well, weird. Both bands do what they do best, and should just be enjoyed.    Music at this level is both a challenge and joy for me to listen to. Some people hear this music and call it \\"awful noise\\" while others, like me, can listen and hear a symphony of impeccable, orchestrated chaos. To me, reviews are extremely subjective, and the only way to know if you're going to like this music is to listen to it. If you're tired of modern rock, metal, et al., maybe work into this kind of music. As someone who once thought Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit were as heavy as it gets (alas, my own naivety), I didn't just one day wake up and decide to love neck-breaking blast beats and technical death metal. Give it a listen, the worst that can happen is you wasted 41 minutes of your time.

B00288KNLS|4.0|This is a really wonderful movie with terrific animation, and a great story.  It is much darker than I expected for a kid's movie though, and worried my children would be terrified.  My 9 year old daughter is repelled and fascinated at the same time, and calls it \\"creepy\\".  My 4 year old son LOVES it, and keeps nagging me to buy it so he can watch it over and over.
0802798225|5.0|Simone Elkeles has created a pair of memorable characters in her book PERFECT CHEMISTRY. Brittany Ellis wears perfect clothes, has a perfect boy friend, and a perfect life or so that's what it seems to the outside world. She works overtime to keep up this image. In reality, her world is falling apart.<br /><br />Meet Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fuentes, a member of the Bloods, a lethal Latino gang. His image of being tough means everything. That's what the two have in common. Neither one is as they appear. They might not have had this chance to discover this if not for being paired up in chemistry class of their senior year. The forced togetherness and Brittany's need to make a perfect grade was the bond at the beginning, but soon they discovered there an attraction between them.<br /><br />Some parts of book actually made me forget I was reading. I became so wrapped up in their lives. The author took just as much time with the supporting characters. Paco and the bathroom scene at the wedding was one not to be missed. I could actually smell the aftermath! If you enjoy YA and especially if you enjoy a YA love story, this is an amazing tale.
0385340575|4.0|Witnessing a suicide on a Manhattan subway, in which he feels responsible for, Jack Reacher finds himself targeted by the federal government and Al-Qaeda for his knowledge of a dangerous secret, a situation that leads to a dangerous chase through the streets of New York City.<br /> While Child's thrillers seem to be fast-paced throughout, this one took some time to pick up speed. What I found annoyinng was the endless detail of the New York City streets. That seemed to go on and on along with some other minor extraneous details. Once I overlooked that, near the middle, I finally got pulled in and I rushed to the end, which I found both satisfying and intense.
B00005221M|3.0|The success of this film helped to make Daniel Day Lewis a star with American audiences, and he has since gone on to do the near-impossible, turning in great performances for American films that do have commercial ambitions.     This is a lavishly mounted production with great cinematography and great all-around period details (at least authentic-looking enough to make audiences think they were authentic). It helped revive the western, and in particular a mostly unpopular sub-genre, the colonial-period western.    However, I always found this film marred by insufficent dialogue and character development, and by the time it reaches its end, it feels inconclusive and disjointed.     It could have been a classic if Mann had taken the same care Kevin Costner did in getting 'Dances with Wolves' to the screen, regardless of which version. In the case of this film, it seems they really didn't shoot enough film or write enough script. It's a close but no cigar, and the fault is a flawed script. Everything else about the film is outstanding. But that is a rather huge flaw I can't ignore.
1400097029|3.0|John Banville composes his work. Like a symphonic masterpiece, his words flow and ebb, weaving themselves into a clarity of expression that tell the story of a man dealing with the loss of his wife.  He returns to a sea-side village where he spent time as a child, hoping to regain a balance in his life.  The return to this village awakens childhood memories of a time spent in the company of another family of very different means.  As we walk through his memories, he re-examines the things he believed as a child and how these things take on a different patina with age.  It is an involved work full of rich patterns of language.  While I loved the writing, the actual story was less than I had hoped for.  It almost feels like the writing was on a much superior level than the subject itself.  While I usually love reading books that have been awarded the Man Booker Prize, this was not one I loved.
1400063736|4.0|At its core, Let the Great World Spin is a novel about a particular city--New York City--at a particular point in time--the summer of 1974.  McCann illuminates his subject through a series of stories that overlap in interesting and sometimes unexpected ways.  Tying the whole thing together is Philippe Petit's daring tightrope walk between the newly constructed towers of the World Trade Center, representing the idea that the \\"core reason for it all [is] beauty.\\"  While I generally avoid comparing books to other works, the similarities between this novel and Crash--the 2005 movie about interconnecting stories in L.A.--are too striking to go unmentioned.<br /><br />The diverse perspectives, voices, and writing styles make this novel an engaging reading experience.  As is inevitable, some stories and characters are better than others, but McCann's writing is strong throughout.  With books like this, there exists a danger that the constant shifting will be unpleasantly frenetic, but McCann avoids this pitfall by taking his time to fully develop each story and character.  Let the Great World Spin is occasionally messy and unfocused, and the last chapter is a bit of a let-down, but these minor imperfections are easily forgiven.  Overall, this vibrant book will appeal to many readers, and I expect it to be one of this summer's favorites.
0679420266|1.0|The Stranger is an existential story of a man living his life as a self-determing individual. He feels that nothing is truly wrong or right and therefore nothing that he does makes any difference or has any real impact except to himself.  It is almost as if he is on a stage writing his life as he goes, acting it out and the rest of the universe is merely a backdrop for whatever he chooses to pursue. It is a timeless novel that tosses out  morality and rationality as a means to make choices.  It shows a vast emptiness, a soulessness that is overpowering in its totality. This is an amazing, insightful look at life where no matter what one does, the end will always be the same. It is interesting to note that Camus while having the belief that the universe was a cold and indifferent place, still believed in the dignity of each individual being and had a  concern for their welfare.  It is one of the most widely read books, but it is bleak in an eye-opening manner.
0786838655|1.0|After starting the book,  I discovered that 30-50 pages at a time were missing--it jumped from page 89 and then the next page was 135. This happened a few times in the book.  Obviously, a publisher's reject but it was described by  seller as being in very good condition.  Would never trust this seller again.
