B002MQYOFW|1.0|If you have nothing better to read, then pick up a TV Guide. Will be more informative, creative and not written for future exploitation.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like many others, I really looked forward to this book.  I actually like \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" better than \\"Kite Runner\\", but both were phenomenal.  This one is just too fragmented, which I suppose is a good parallel for the time period covered in Afghanistan,  but as a result it does not have the emotional depth.  I still enjoyed it, though, because the writing excellent.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|I love this collection of DVDs b/c it has tons of extra scenes, outtakes and interviews that were never aired on the actual TV show.  I've waited forever to buy this set, and now circumstances dictate that I have to stay inside for the next few months.  I'm going to have my &#34;Friends&#34; to keep me company. :)
0156027321|4.0|My son read this book several years ago before he started high school and he loved this book. We recently watched the movie together as a family and we all really liked it so I decided to go back to the book to compare (my son thought the book was better).<br /><br />I found the first 100 pages or so (until Pi ends up on the lifeboat) to be very slow. I thought the movie actually did a better job of portraying his journey through spirituality.<br /><br />Once I got to Pi on the boat I liked the book much more. It is just such a very different story from anything else I've read and I think the author took it in a direction that no other could or would.<br /><br />Of course, having seen the movie, I knew how it ended but I was sad anyway. I would highly recommend this book and the movie as well.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It's been along time since I've had to think to finish a game and this one makes you focus. Disappointed ending but good work up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like  solitaire, but Spider has an added challenge to it. It's fun! I play everyday. It will relax you and you will want to play over and over.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It does what is supposed to without crashing or using a lot of power so I am satisfied with this app.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|This has to be Kubrick's finest film.  It is a tragedy (1st half) followed by a dry comedy (2nd half).  R. Lee Ermey is the classic film Drill Instructor and his act will be had for others to follow.  Amazing how Kubrick filmed the Parris Island and Vietnam scenes in London.  Realistic boot camp scenes.
B008AYA7WE|1.0|I know it's not Tetris but every 2 seconds there's an ad pop up interrupting the game, Not even worth the price of FREE&#62;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is refreshing at last to see members of the medical and research field come forward finally and speak their truth.  It is similar to what the world religions are finally admitting.....the Kingdom of Heaven is within, and each of us in on one of many paths that does not rely on medicine or religion......the great wizard of Oz has once again been revealed and we are awed by a universal energy that has and will be forever guiding each of us toward the reality of oneness that we do not earn and will not sit under judgement to obtain.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It's very fun you get to do a lot of things and build stuff and destroy you're enemies and win
B000FCKC4C|5.0|So many life lessons told in such a captivating story!  The author cleverly draws you into following this boy with your heart, mind and soul.  It is a treasure for all time.
0385347774|4.0|The author included a lot of humor when writing about serious subjects of abduction and murder.  The characters are not likable but make for an interesting read.
0743550927|5.0|Brilliantly written and narrated by Frank McCort. A bitter sweet story of a young boys survival of a very poor and harsh childhood! Told with sparkling wit and humor.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book just keeps you reading until your at th  an  cause you can  put it down till you know what happens next
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Yeah it's a chick flick movie but I kind of liked it so I thought I would change out my old VHS version of it and get it in DVD.  A lot better, I'm sure I'll be watching it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have my weather and the weather where my friends and family live. Switches back and forth between cities  efforlessly.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is wonderful. I so wish the show and others from Aardman Studios were more readily available us in the States.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a magnificent story about two noble warriors. One, was a twenty-year-old  American pilot trying desperately to get his barely flyable bomber and wounded crew home.  The other an experience German Fighter Ace who could have easily shot them down but was honorable and didn't.<br />The German pilot understood destroying the enemy is the job of the warrior, but murder is not. Long after the war, the two pilots reunited and were like brothers - the best of friends.<br />They are both gone now. May they rest in peace.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Even though each does have its own character, I see Uno/Dos/Tre as a single giant album, one whose overarching theme is a musical return to Green Day's 90s sound.  There's still some of the polish and nuance they've picked up since, but listening to this super-album takes me back to when I initially fell in love with the band.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Green Day new and old, and anyone who enjoys solid punk rock without the all-too-common modern pop gloss.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, clever, funny, fast moving. I don't watch many TV series. Found out about this one late. Watched the first and second seasons non-stop and free on Prime Instant Videos. Highly recommend it.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Even though each does have its own character, I see Uno/Dos/Tre as a single giant album, one whose overarching theme is a musical return to Green Day's 90s sound.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Now this game, i really like the concept where you can customize and upgrade your car, but you keep going on the same track EVERY TIME. They could have switched it up a little bit like temple run. But overall, good graphics and a good game.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Even though each does have its own character, I see Uno/Dos/Tre as a single giant album, one whose overarching theme is a musical return to Green Day's 90s sound.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|l like this game. it makes you think but it is not so hard that it frustrates you. it is a fairly relaxing game.
B00CW665VI|4.0|this book was the best!!!, I personally love books narrated by men, thier point of view are so much different from us women, this was a very hilarious book the characters have an explosive relationship, It was always fun and unexpective, I highly recoment it.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|Most of the good acting was reserved for the early 20th Century British Brokeback Mountain story, and some of the more well-known actors were hit-and-miss depending on which storyline they were appearing in (most of the actors play many different roles in the movie).  The theme that seemed to unite the confusing interweaving of stories was the film's view of boundaries-as-conventions as a way to transcend what the filmmakers see as predatory conservatism (i.e. whatever runs counter to the liberal narrative).  For more details, google 'cloud atlas liberalism boundaries'
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The rating is because the voices are hard to understand and the volume is soft and the loud.<br />The depiction of life of the English gentry is an education in itself. We have come a long way from there.<br />The costuming is worth the time spent watching it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really good game my mom had to help me on some things.  I had trouble with some of the puzzles but enjoyed the challenge.
145160713X|5.0|His book really brings out the personality that I imagined from listening to his lectures. I recommend it to everyone, but particularly to parents who are trying to raise children. It could spark an interest that will at least guide them through life and might even encourage them to become a scientist.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is filled with princess stuff there dresses are off the chain.coolness is made to be this game because I love it super much and I know that made no sence.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hadn't read a Stephen King book in ages but when my sister recommended this one I gave it a try.  Am I ever glad!  The characters, plot and bits of nostalga intertwine to make a very satisfying read,
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Thought it was fun and entertaining.  Maybe just too intense for very small children.  Not the old fashion story but a fresher, modern take on it.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|All of our kids love this claymation show!  There are many funny moments, without any dialog.  Well worth a look.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It was a typical &#34;Die Hard&#34; movie.  I knew what to expect and it delivered.  Bruce Willis gave another good performance as the main character.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|the movie was ok, but somehow I was expecting more. it barely made average, with overtones of mandingo, and way too many n word uses.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|temple run with fruit ninja thrown in. I like it but at least turn left or right. flying around collecting things avoiding stuff is all well and good but i expected walk around 3rd person shooter action also. it has great 3D I will say that.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I could barely do this the first day, but by the third it had gotten a little easier and I was looking forward to it a little more.  Still on the first of three, but enjoying it and feeling stronger.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Hilariously, entertaining movie dealt up with deadpan, matter of fact style. Very well thought out. It held my attention throughout. You need to see it a couple of times as there is much you overlook at the first viewing.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|It really suits the title and yet it is easy to follow. The triple spying plots mingle perfectly with the love story based on 30-year-old experiences. A pity there is a bit too much ship and sea action.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|This was a good zombie war flick, rating at about 3 1/2 stars so I rounded to 4.  My 40-year old son and I both enjoyed it.  I am very pleased to say it was NOT blood, guts and dismembered body parts.  While you see zombies from the very beginning, you just see them bite and move on while the victim turns into one of the undead (in as fast as 7 seconds)!<br /><br />The story line is the zombie viral infection is all of a sudden upon us, spreading so fast and so hard while the government is trying to stop it.  Of course, Brad Pitt is brought in to try to help. There is some standard Hollywood BS, like the satellite phones would not have been able to get a signal in those circumstances, so smack the director for not catching that one.  All said, it was an enjoyable movie and also good in 3-D.  It also sets you up for a possible Part II.<br /><br />BTW - These zombies are attracted to NOISE, so whatever you do, BE QUIET in the theater or one might just jump off the screen and come after you  :(  s-h-h-h-h
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|A story line that was new to me but needed to be told.  I enjoyed the movie even though the ending wasn't as spectacular as one might imagine.  Well worth the rental or even box office expense.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I'm still amazed at the completely violent reaction towards this movie, and until I watched it for myself the other day I allowed those reactions to prevent me from seeing it for myself--don't make the same mistake.  Perhaps it was the fact that I had such low expectations that I actually found myself enjoying most of the movie,nevertheless, I had a great time watching it, and I encourage you to see it for yourself and draw your own conclusion.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game ever voted best app  I love love love love love love love love love love it u will to buy this APP you will love no doubts BUY IT<br /><br />Best app ever
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|How can you not like these guys. Great combination of classical and contemporary. I am thinking of buying this for family for Christmas presents. We all like both and this would be great to combine those two types of music.
B0080M3OGW|2.0|...two great stars early in their careers...their talent overwhelms the script...as an alternative watch &#34;Sleepless In Seattle&#34; again...better yet...take someone to dinner..!!..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am in total awe of these guys and their work. I purchased after their show. I am very pleased.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I rated this CD a 5 because of course it's a 5, it's an  Alice in Chains CD!  Good variety of songs and riffs, but missing a little bit of the edge that previous CD's with Layne and Jerry had.  Kinda repetitive.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits has it all; good writing, good acting, and a good story line. A refreshing change from the normal series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting from the start to finish. Could not put the book down. Have purchased the next book in the series<br /><br />Easy reading
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was very sure at the direction the went. Wow. The next one has a tough job tying up all those threads!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Very good right from the beginning, could not put the book down. Have already purchased the next book in the series
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Challenging game to try to beat your best time.  I have only played it 2 days.I don't like having to write a certain amount of words for this review.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I knew this was a musical but didn't know it was COMPLETELY ALL music.<br />No regular conversation, only singing it.  If that is the kind of musical you like go for it, otherwise stay away.  It got tiring very quickly.  The old movie was much better in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely lived this book! Congratulations to the author. The book gas perfect timing! The story is timeless. I plan to read others by this author.
B00190OHD6|2.0|First part of the movie was better than the last. It got a little<br />to crazy for me at the end. Not as innocent.
193700788X|3.0|Watch/listen to this podcast...it says it all.<br /><br />http://true-blood.net/2013/05/14/true-blood-radio-205-dead-ever-after/<br /><br />I've also written this elsewhere (as a comment to a previous review) but I will repeat here (CONTAINS SPOILERS!!)<br /><br />For those who are really invested in the main character, Sookie you will appeciate this final book.There have been signs for....well since series began, that Sookie and Sam would probably end up together. Just that the timing wasn't ever right. I also really enjoyed Sookie with Eric (Dead to the world is my fave book) however to understand Sookie is to know she wants to have children and lives the sun. Also many other reasons - most significant being that these two had huge differences in the way they viewed the world. Also all this hatred over fictitious characters is just plain silly. This series is one of my fave and while I wasn't thrilled with Sookie ending with Sam I understood it and think it makes all the sense in the world. Thx Charlaine for a great series that will be missed.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I love movies that have a bit of history in them.<br />It was amazing to see what they had to go through to get them out.<br />I'm sure it was not completely accurate, but it all made a great movie.<br />I'd highly recommend.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|EUREKA was very refreshing series.  It had the comedy of The Andy Griffith Show, set in a small town like Mayberry, with all of the quirkiness of My Favorite Martian, romance and power struggles rivaling any daytime soap or prime time drama and it still gave me my much needed doses of action and SciFi; if you listened carefully, you could actually learn something.<br /><br />For me, all of those elements made it a unique and unbeatable amalgamation.  My TV time got a little smaller when the series was cancelled.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|My mom read this to me and now I read it to my nephew all the time and he loves it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun. Not so hard that I was frustrated but still required using problem solving skills. I hope the developers of this app create more levels.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One cannot review this book but simply enjoy the experience of reading it. A rich emotional journey. I can't wait for the next one.
B000VI12ZS|3.0|To start off, I love war movies so I had to give this one a shot.  It thought the concept of the movie was very interesting.  I also like that it was based on history.  Then you add in a dose of &#34;Hollywood&#34; and you have a pretty entertaining movie.  In the end, it's still a Nick Cage flick.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Enjoyed movie with our great granddaughter.  Good choice.  Language was appropriate for small child.  A+ for us. Would recommend a good watch.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Just too many unbelievable stunts and goofy plot twists. Not worth the time but I'm usually pretty tough on most movies
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|short for me but interesting and fun!! is there a second one out there? like i said it could have been a little longer.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I resisted...for a long time!  Then a friend said, really you don't want to try it...cause you will get addicted to it!<br />Well knowing that could be the truth...as it was with FB....I said ok, I'll go and see!  Well...my friend was right!<br />Addicted!  Love it! I tell people to try it!  I tell them too they will get addicted!  I've tried some of the recipes!<br />Awesome!  Now I have followers!  Who knew!  But like the saying goes....Try it, you'll like it!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This title is one of the best I've ever seen.<br />The quality is great, I play it using my 5.1 digital speaker system, and is fascinating. The 1080p resolution which you just can't miss any detail.<br /><br />The only thing that could be better was the subtitles in other languages, I prefer to watch in japanese, but in my home only my father and I can understand english.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|This book is motivational, educational and most importantly helps move the conversation forward about equality.  Reinforces that change starts from within.  If I want the balance to change, I need to change.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game!  I am not very experienced in solitaire so it is very challenging to me.  Can't wait to try more advanced version.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|Good information about how Google operates.  The book is recommended to anyone who wants to know how Google evolved from a garage company to become a multi-billion dollar organization.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Well written, funny - sat laughing - totally absorbing.<br />I am sure I know someone just like him!<br />Couldn't stop once I started.<br />My girlfriends were the same.<br />Just a good read and would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles are not too difficult but challenging. I had a good time with it, look forward to more rooms
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|If you haven't heard yet, the Blu-ray version of this movie is in 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio, the best sound quality you can get out of a Blu-ray. Shout Factory went all out with the making of this Blu-ray and it sounds tremendous. Hopefully soon they might do the same to the series itself, that would be awesome.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Could not stop playing once l started this game! It has been a long time since I played such a challenging hidden object game!
B00847UYWA|4.0|I do enjoy Lovecraft and related works, and I enjoyed reading through Chamber's stories that focused on the King himself.  Later on when it got to the French love stories, things trailed off for me as it seemed it was a very big contrast to before.  They were still good, just not what I was expecting.  In any case, this book is worth ready if only for the stories involving the King in Yellow.
B00AEBB8QK|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and am never disappointed in the storyline, the actors or the conclusion.  How amazing would it be to be transported back in time to see what things were really like.  What we imagine and what science has concluded is not always the reality.  The story transports members of an archaeology team, and the son of the missing professor to 14th century France and the 100 year war between France and England.  They must stay alive, find and rescue the professor while always racing against time to return to the present before they are lost to the 14th-century forever.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|This was an Asimov I had somehow overlooked. Entertaining as always with a good blend of science, mystery and intrigue as always from a master.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is very enjoyable to play and it is nice to.have something to occupy your time while you are waiting.
0307271080|5.0|I am a big fan of African literature and I'm glad to have discovered this author.  Read all her other books especially Purple Hibiscus.
B003U53GK8|5.0|The creators of the show tried to create different themes in the six seasons, succeeded in creating a gripping universe where each character is well defined and the threads of their lives with their struggles and actions woven into an intriguing web, but then instead of a neat ending which answers all the questions that have been raised, fizzles out leaving you with more questions.<br />I would recommend watching the show, just because it keeps you entertained and looking forward to the next episode.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful love story between two unlikely characters. Get your kleenex ready for the end of the book. Loved this book!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I loved the album as soon as I listened to it. Its so different yet  has the familiar Deftones sound that everybody knows and loves.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I bought this CD with hopes to be reminded of my cherished Roxy Music, and I was pleasantly surprised by music reminiscent of Paul Whiteman and Bix Beiderbeck.  It's now a bit of a parlor game -- can you guess which Roxy Music song this is? -- but thoroughly enjoyable whether you know &#34;For Your Pleasure&#34; and &#34;Stranded&#34; or not.  A great pick if you or someone you care for is a 1920s jazz  enthusiast.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Its one of my most cherished cd's that I have bought in years. I would recommend this to anyone. All my life I''ve listened to the Beatles greatest hits whether it be on the radio or cd and this with this set you get ALL of them
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun! You have to use your brain. It's not easy. It gives you a good challenge. I totally recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a good game/games. They could be better but its a nice pass the time game. I might recommend this to a friend, but I don't know.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|This movie starts with heart stopping action. But it holds you with a very real portrait of a flawed man coming to grips with his demons. A very inspiring story.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I Read it on my flight to Alaska. It was perfect; loved it!  It was very Beautiful and enjoyable completetly.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|There's almost no way not to enjoy this film, and both men and women that I know think that it's great. A well-acted, cleverly cast, satisfyingly unpredictable movie--recommended!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was a bit too scary for the little ones. It was less than expected and we were glad we didn't pay too much to see it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Each of the three episodes that comprise a season is a compelling 90 minute movie. This is a very satisfying addition to a quality hard-copy film library. All the production people, not to mention the amazing cast, are to be highly commended for this modern adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I felt this film was just a filler.  I think the film could have been more developed.  I have not read this book yet but intend to do so.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|The real sad story: widowing a family for a thrill. I wondered what the point of the movie? There was no point. It's a slice of life movie of a moderately interesting story.
030758836X|5.0|I have already recommended this book to several of my friends! I love buying books on line, it is so easy!
B00BF11STU|5.0|My only worry - how much of Kathryn Bigelow's Hollywood liberal bias was injected into the story? Or worst yeah, what was hidden from the story?
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite alt! Bands. I am picky when it comes to New Age stuff, but this band is Fan-freaking-tastic!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|What can I say, Joe Wright is brilliant. There is nobody like him. And Tolstoy is the king of the brilliant tragic story. Don't disrespect this movie because it's not a happy ending you think it should be. My only complaint is that there was a little too much Joe Wright'ism added to the Tolstoy story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like the game. nice and quiet right before bed. I had no problem figuring it out. nothing like 1000 floors.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of those books that you hate to put down and yet you hate even more for it to be over.  This was one of the best books I have EVER read in all of my years, and I'm OLD!!  Best one Grisham has ever written, in my opinion.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I rated this 4 stars because in this book the suspense continues and the book is a page turner that keeps you intrigued to know what's going to happen next. I thought the games were a little drawn out.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is just a great show to watch and you can follow it with out of a lot what just happen?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple yet addicting car game. One needs to know when to accelerate or slow down in order to complete the game.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I haven't yet truly listened to any of the neighborhood songs, but the second half of the album is amazing.  Crown Of Love, Wake Up, Haiti, and finished by Rebellion, is just an awesome sequence.  The songs are sorrowful and deep in an uplifting way and Haiti is especially beautiful.  Just those songs make this album worth it and I can't wait to delve into the others!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Just like the real thing.  If you can step over the premise that a day can be repeated in history enough times for a soul to learn their lessons on how to bond with another, this is a very uplifting hopeful viewpoint...
B0050OMJIW|4.0|This book is possibly the funniest book I have ever read. It reminds me so much to Monty Python's humour.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game it is not too easy nor to hard its a great way to pass time while having fun
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great story, animation and the voice over actors were perfectly chosen.  Can't wait to see the sequel and the little yellow characters.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book was a complete surprise for me. I started reading it expecting the hype for it to be exaggerated and I was completely wrong! I couldn't put this book down and this is probably one of the best fantasy purchases I've made all year. If you enjoy books like Name of the Wind, you will thoroughly enjoy this one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app a lot! I love that you don't need WiFi when you don't have WiFi  so I play this mostly when I don't have WiFi. I recommend this app for anyone!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is good for kids that want to problem solve. My 4 year old loves it and it is challenging for her.
1591845556|4.0|The basic insight of this book is useful and encouraging: with 20 hours of deliberate practice, free of distractions, drawing on guidance of others, and focused on key subskills, you can become decently proficient (by no means expert!) in just about any skill.  But keep in mind that we're talking about 20 hours of rather intense effort, not just goofing around.  Many people can find 20 hours, but far fewer will be ready to put in that effort (the 'just do it' attitude is needed here).  The author illustrates this approach with 6 examples from his own experience, and personally I found these case studies to be too detailed and lengthy for my taste, and not tied back clearly enough to the principles of the approach.  Nevertheless, this is still a good book overall and, again, the thesis is encouraging.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|great app, it is at this time all free. good song selection and easy to use. it is one of the better music apps.
B003G4W49C|1.0|My grandchildren talked me into reading this book. They are 11 and 14; this is great book for that age group, but not for a 65  year old man like myself. I read the entire book though I was tempted every chapter  to quit wasting my time. Nothing  really happens for the first 80%  of the book. The author  states that from a  letter he received the book had a profound impact on a couple of teenagers, which I think goes to prove my point that this is a young adult book and a very good one for that age group. I am at a loss to understand the awards it received. Usually Science Fiction books have to appeal to a wider audience than this one did to receive awards.  If you ever saw the movie \\"Starship Troopers\\" you will also wonder about the originality of the book.<br /><br />I am always encouraging my grandchildren to read so I  don't want them to think I dismiss what they read, just as long as they get in the habit of reading. I also read  \\"The Hunger Games\\"  at their suggestion. This is another book aimed at a younger audience though I think it is too violent for them. I also think it was not original. Watch the Japanese move \\"Battle Royale\\". It was aimed at teenagers, but when it was released the Japanese government insisted  on an equivalent X rating because of the excessive violence. The violence was in my opinion was  less than \\"The Hunger Games\\"  The author of  \\"The Hunger Games\\" when questioned about the similarities of her book to the movie she claimed she had never seen the movie.<br /><br />I think the violence in this book is not excessive, especially the way it is presented. I have no problem with my grandchildren reading it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|a gentle read about the unrealistic world of mental illness.<br />I would recommend it to those interested in mental illnesses
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is highly addictive. It's challenging but not so difficult that it is overly frustrating. I wish there were more than 10 levels.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book starts off good and keeps the reader interested! Very good story line picking up after the first book, which had a good twist!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The series starts with a bang and has been entertaining ever since.  I wish I had watched it sooner and am looking forward to seeing all the seasons.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really like this trilogy it was the first time I really got into the whole story I have watched the first movie and I really liked it so I really got to see the whole story. I plan to stay tuned into the whole story of the hunger games. I hope that they make another book to see what happens to the children that they have.
030758836X|5.0|Looked forward to picking up this book every evening.  Captivated by the characters and wanting to shake the husband Nick to bring him<br />back to his senses!<br />Have since purchased this authors two previous publications with great expectations,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a wonderful problem solving puzzle. It's great for a Kindle or tablet, but the graphics are a bit small for a smartphone.
B00826B65M|5.0|Balzac is the teacher of many novelist like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Zola, Sinclair Lewis and others. His La Comédie Humaine is excellent, with a great deal of master pieces. The Oevres complètes includes the Contes Drolatiques and others books difficult to find in commercial library. But I miss the paralipomena of the novels he was going to write to complete his Comédie Humaine. Never the lest, it is extraordinary that we can have the 101 titres of the work of Honoré de Balzac. Every author who wants to write novels most learn from these french master the art of the master pieces.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The mechanics of this game are dead simple, but the puzzles get more complex as you go. It's deceptively fun and certainly addicting.
B008A708E8|5.0|What can we said of Voltaire? He is one of the most profound and ironic philosopher, novelist, historian and dramatic author. Have the opportunity of read any of his works is  a superb experience. If any person wants to profit his time and simultaneously enjoy the only thing he most do is read Voltaire. With the Oevres completes he will enjoy the exquisite writing of these extraordinary author.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I swore I would not read this book.  It was a book club selection, and I do not read animal books.  I am such a softie, and the sadness is just to much for me.  Anyway, I broke down and decided to try to read one week before our meeting.<br /><br />To me this was such a love story between owner, family (as it grew) and dog.  Love how it was written from the dog's perspective.  His devotion to his owner was so incredible, but I think many dogs feel that towards their family.  It was such a good read, I could not put it down.  This is one animal story I highly recommend.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Love Michael Connelly books. Read them in the order they were written and you will recognize details mentioned from prior stories.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Maybe the worst album released ever. Babys name might be North but this album is going South in the charts
B00BWJARHO|2.0|It was a rainy Saturday movie.  I wanted to love this but I couldn't.  The plot went on and on with no real adventure.  Too bad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun and a bit challenging at times but finished all available levels too quickly wise more levels were out now
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I thought overall this was a good book but seemed a bit disjointed in the middle. While many things came together in the end I thought there could have been either more or less of some of the secondary characters.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|The lesson of &#34;TheTempest&#34; that we can be our own worst enemy is evident throughout this wonderful film. This was the first big studio, technicolor science fiction film and so it had all the trappings, big-name cast, special effects, and was a homage to the best writer in the English language. The Blu-Ray rendition is clear and crisp and the sound effects and electronic music are crytal clear. It's sometimes difficult to remember that Leslie Nielsen was once a serious leading man as an actor. Just seeing him makes you want to burst out laughing. I suppose his earlier films are a testament to his craft before he hooked up with the Hollywoood comedy-spoof mavens. I prefer to remember him as the dashing space ship captain in this film. Once you know the secret of the &#34;monster&#34; you also know how the film will end so it's downhill during the final 10 minutes.What's really interesting is watching how they execute the special effects combining animation and stop-frame techniques. Clearly, this is the direction sci-fi films are going to take in the future. Look where that's led us.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is a true value, but beware, it's HUGE and heavy. It weighs over a pound, I think. I love it! Keeps excellent time so far. It had the hacking NH35A SII movement that I was hoping for. Built like a tank. Knowing it was big before I bought it, I went ahead anyway but reading about it and having it in your hands are 2 different things. It WAS properly described but nothing I read compares to actually wearing it. Can't get over how big and heavy it actually is. It's a beautiful piece!
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|An old standard that I have watched many times. Had the opportunity to visit the bridge that is there now as part of a tour in Thailand in 1970. If you ever go to that country, include this tour up the River Kwai with a stop at the bridge and the monument that has been erected to honor those who died building the bridge.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved every page of this novel!  I just couldn't put it down.  The story line is unusual and keeps one guessing until the absolute end.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I bought this to digitize some old family slides. It works pretty well. It goes a lot faster than other scanners I've used. The unit tends to overexpose the slides so I turned the exposure down two notches. The resulting images are pretty contrasty, but Photoshop cleans them up. One problem is that it's really hard for me to pull the slides out of the scanner. It's too bad the slot has the small indentation around it. A pair of needle nose pliers pulls the slides out easily.  Update: After a few hundred slides I found that the inside of the scanner was covered with dust. The slides I scanned after that all had to be redone.I was able to blow most of the dust out with compressed air, but it's pretty hard to clean it out completely. The slides I'm scanning now are passable, but I might look for a scanner that can be dusted more easily.
1594135851|5.0|Good 2nd book to hunger games and the large printed version my Mom could read with her poor eyesight from macular degeneration.
B006VRLNV6|1.0|I am not going to load software on my computer that is filled with who knows what.  Never buying music from Amazon as long as they do this.
B008602KQI|3.0|I finally watched this in my hotel while traveling. Pretty good \\"popcorn flick\\" but I wasn't ravenous about it like most folks.
0132350882|4.0|I wish I had this book when I had started to write code, the usual reference manuals and tutorials always leave you with a sense that the job is done and that the comments, short variable names and poorly designed classes are an industry standard that should be encouraged.<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />This book is a must have for anyone aiming to become a great developer, one that aims to leave the code in a better state then when they found it, sure the examples are in Java but as a PHP developer I found them easy to read, follow and understand.<br /><br />The really interesting thing about the book is how Robert C. Martin`Uncle Bob' takes an established class library from Java and refactors it applying the techniques you learn in the book. As a PHP developer I would not have a problem applying the same principles to my scripts or the PHP library itself and have started to on the projects I am working on.<br /><br />If you only take one thing away from the book, be it better variable naming, refactor code early and often or that tests allow you to refactor safely then you have taken the first steps to becoming a better developer.<br /><br />I would recommend this book and the sequel The Clean Coder as I have already done to my colleagues.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Good but it is definitely not the smallest case or Bluetooth for that matter. But it's the best Bluetooth hands down
B00B7Y0206|5.0|its fast and easy to use and you have many options to choose from you cant get a better free app
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this game is simply great, but it has a few small problems in my opinion: 1. It sometimes thinks you are doing a different move than what you are actually doing, and 2. The character's and obstacles look isn't as realistic as the original TR's was.<br />But I still like this game as much as the original because it has a lot of  new features.
0545265355|4.0|We must fight against the NWO, the Globalists, and the Zionists who are destroying the planet. This book details Agenda 21, eugenics, and population control. Interesting that the movie was released right around the time of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests and uprisings...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was so well written, I felt myself on the same emotional roller coaster as Katniss! What a great end to a great series!
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Every true Megadeth fan needs to have this album.  Yeah, I know of all the negative and critical reviews, but quite frankly think the majority of those (note I did not say ALL) have unreasonable expectations of Dave & Crew as songwriters and their evolution in as much.  This album does indeed have a slightly more commercial vibe to a few tracks, but those are still very solid songs.  And there is still Dave's traditional thrashing to be found, as well.  \\"Dance in the Rain\\", \\"The Blackest Crow\\" (the bluegrass meshing with hard rock is well done; don't listen to the haters) and \\"Forget to Remember\\" are the gems of the album.  And I believe Dave's lyrical messages are as solid as ever.<br /><br />So while this isn't as good of an album as the more recent works of United Abominations or Th1rt3en, it's still great.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I didn't have the opportunity to watch this show when it started.  Thank you Amazon Prime for giving me a flexible way to watch on my ipad.  Great music and dance!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Are fun match 3 colors game with twists and turns to add excitement and adventure. I think $4.99  is too high a price, but I got it for only 99 cents so I bought this AND Atlantis.<br />&quot;
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|It's great to hear Brian Wilson's magic performed live with the rest of the surviving group. To record these songs in the studio was challenging enough, but to recreate them on stage is remarkable. Mike Love's voice is getting a bit thin with age. Too bad he didn't see the value in continuing with the whole group. I look forward to Brian Wilson's next CD with Alan Jardine, David Marks and others.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|I realize that nothing made by man is perfect, but Seikos are generally made to a fairly high standard for the price they cost. On this watch the large red split second timing hand would not rest exactly at 12 o'clock when reset. It would be a couple of seconds off. It was an annoyance, really, and the only time I can remember a Seiko watch having such a noticeable glitch, and I've been buying Seikos since 1980. If I had purchased the watch locally I would have returned it and asked for a replacement. On the plus side, the bracelet is strong and wide, the lume is strong and will last all night, the watch keeps excellent time, and it looks impressive on the wrist. .......Bumping this up to five stars as I was able to follow the directions in the owner's manual and reset the split second hand to zero. :-D
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I just finished reading the book and I was impressed by Howey's writing.  He made some hard and compelling choices with both his character's and the plot, and didn't take the easy way out when the situation presented itself.  This is a good dystopian novel and is an excellent addition to the genre.  As a high school language arts teacher who does a class on utopias and dystopias I look forward to recommending or using it in future classes.The only thing that I felt was a little contrived was the way Bernard quickly sets Lukas up as his successor.  There is no real previous connection, unless I missed it, and it seemed more of a spur of the moment thing.  I liked the development of their \\"relationship\\" from there, but I felt it was a bit forced upon the reader at its inception.  Still, liked the story overall and am looking forward to reading the other two novels in the series.  One other thing - great price for a kindle!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My sons said this set is awesome!! Being a Lego fan and Minecraft, how could you possibly go wrong!?  I would definitely recommend this to any Lego/Minecraft fan.
B00C81AVNU|3.0|Considering it won the Tony for Best Musical I found overall the songs ok but nothing special. It certainly is not up there with the likes of Hairspray . The lyrics are rather boring , the British accents are simply awful and it just does not come across as a very memorable score. Maybe it's a score that one appreciates more after seeing the show but considering Cyndi Lauper's track record I was expecting a lot more excitement.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The authors two earlier novels were so wonderful and emotionally powerful, that I found this work disappointing. The many characters seem more superficially drawn and loosely connected.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|It made Barbra Striesand a star and won her an Oscar and even today it stands as a great musical with a central performance that is simply amazing. Packed with beautiful songs like People and Don't Rain On My Parade it also has a &#34; grown up &#34; love story that remains moving and true. The comedy numbers are wonderful and the transfer to Blu Ray is amazing . A timeless film that perfectly showcases Barbra's talent . A Must See !
B001ANSSDC|3.0|thought, based on the trailers for the movie, I might enjoy this book<br />however the main character has reverted to being a five year old and<br />doesn't seem to understand that he is being a child.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My granddaughter enjoys this game as she loves putting the make-up on the princess and picking out the colors.  This is one of those games that they can play when you are traveling or just need them to have some quite time.  I would recommend it for any little girl 7 and older.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Kind of fun but not great fun. It is good to do when you do not  have to think . The pieces are very small on the bottom.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the story of Pi, how he managed to survive a terrible ordeal. Loved the unique view on the animal psychology and interaction with humans. Very easy to read, and makes you appreciate the life you have, if you haven't lived through such suffering in your life. If you have, well, now I understand what you went through, and empathize.
0156027321|4.0|But bought it for my daughter and she does not like the book at all. I saw the movie and liked that.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I loved reading this book. I admit I had to skip over the long descriptions of Waterloo and other battles. Probably interesting if you study history. For me, I was looking for the stories of the main characters, and what really blew me away was the detailed descriptios of the descent to hell and misery that any human being can experience. How fragile our human lives are!
B00A757EFW|3.0|LikePac man but hard to control on kindle. You haave to make turns at the exact time or you are eaten. It could just be me though.Tyr it you might like it.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Sheryl exposed her inner thoughts and imperfections for everyone to see. That took a lot of guts.<br />A must read for all the young women out there. Well done !
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great Product good price.Mail the way itshould be. Met and exceded all my expectations.I will do more purchases with this seller. You can get same products else where but this is the best I have dealt with
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was so good. Anyone who likes a good mystery must read The Innocent. Then take yourself right into The Hit also by David Baldacci. Awesome.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great Product good price.Timely delievery Fantastic purchase. Met and exceded all my expectations.I will do more purchases with this seller. You can get atcion fast and furious.I really enjoy it/
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I was expecting more of a romantic connection between the two main characters but it turned out different but it was still interesting, zombies brought back to life, sorry for the spoiler
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Helps keep you aware of battery. Saves by closing unused applications.Every one should at least tyr it Great Product good price. Met and exceded all my expectations.I will do more purchases with this seller. You can't get the same products else where
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I'm enjoying Feeldy so far, but currently there is no 2-Way Sync between the (Kindle)App and the web, so when I go back between the two devices, I have to constantly go through and disregard all of the items I have already read. This is a little annoying, but I am hoping that this will be fixed soon.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I have been a Blake Shelton fan for a long time.<br />This album fits quite nicely in my Blake library.<br />I love the &#34;Boys Around Here&#34; track&#34;.<br />Every Blake fan needs this album.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Enjoyed reading although I would have liked it more if some events had not taken place. Interesting reading, you might like it.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Such a sweet sounding CD.  Saxon is the kind of band that is like a fine wine.........they just keep getting better with time. From start to finish, you fist just wants to pump in the air with every song
B00499NHLC|4.0|I find the series interesting.  My only problem is that sometimes, when Cumberbatch speaks quickly, I cannot quite make out what he says, mainly due to the accent.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Let me say I was not a big fan of J Cole prior to this album release but after listening to this album for a couple days I have to say this is one of my new favorite artist. This album is amazing from beginning to end. Great work. Well worth the 14 dollars.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Very good entertainment. Not a dull moment! Keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. The characters were well developed and complete.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|I loved each and every page and know that I will pick it up again and again when I need a smile.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I wish they had done this much sooner but oh well . It is a very good album , even though Ozzy seems to be lacking energy at times. Even though I really think Bill Ward should be part of this  Brad Wilk does a great job sounding very much like him style wise. There are some great songs on this disc and it's definitely worth buying. It sounds like a mix of old Sabbath and Dehumanizer era stuff which is fine with me as I even like the Tony Martin era Sabbath.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Impossible not to see my kitty and her attitude(s) on each page. You don't need to have a cat to smile when you read this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather all I have found, free or not. Easy to use and a lot of information at your fingertips.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|It was spellbinding. I liked the details and the flow of the book. Easy to follow and it was relevant to today.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved this book! So detailed in the descriptions...could visualize every scene.  I saw the movie before reading the book...the BOOK is much better!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Its okay.  Overall worth the read because the story line is very interesting.  Often times the idea behind the story is more important than the presentation.  That is how I felt about Ender's Game.  I read quite intensely from beginning to end, but found myself not particularly fulfilled once I closed the book.  I was left with a lot of questions and felt there were holes here and there and everywhere.  There wasn't enough character development, and it didn't have to be that way.  Other than being told their ages and sizes time and time again, I never got a sense I was dealing with children - not emotionally (or even - in most cases, intellectually - with the exception of Ender's brother and sister and perhaps Bean.).  Nor did I get a sense that a child was needed to complete the mission - ESPECIALLY after the mini-twist ending.  I read the book because I want to see the movie in the fall - I don't regret it, but do feel the presentation was weak overall.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I love this thing.  It is so convenient.  There is plenty of space in the middle pocket (I often surprise myself how much junk I can fit in there - toys, socks, pacifiers etc.), there are also two cupholders which enable you to take a bottle of water for yourself and one for the baby.  It has a nifty little zipper mesh pocket where you can put your cell phone or other items that can fall out, and the velcro is super strong and durable.  I couldn't be happier with this organizer, fits perfectly on my Britax B-Agile.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Stupid and Boring and it just wasn't that good That's why I only give it a 2 star maybe 2 1/2.
0765325950|5.0|These books have to be my all time favorite books, and I would recommend them to anyone who asked if they should read them, and as far as this being the last book, it is awesome, and so captivation that you will easily stay up late into the night reading because you cant set the book down.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig and James Bond have become a blockbuster definition.  Now we can enjoy it anytime.  I was disappointed the first two or three failed efforts to download the video.  However, the movie itself is all the critics say it is.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is Amazon's instruction ebook for writing and publishing ebooks.  You need this book to get started and for reference as you continue.  It's exactly what I needed.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is a dictionary. It was cool learning new, different and difficult words. They need to add new words to this.
B005SAP45I|2.0|The movie seems geared toward kids 6 and older. It is more like an action movie, so older kids will like it, but I found it too violent for my younger kids. They did not at all like the plot. This is the first Disney movie that we have been truly disappointed with.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Totally entertaining.  Loved every suspenseful minute.  The cast and the characters thy play are superb. Can't wait for season two.
B0052WKZZ6|5.0|Mike Oldfield rocks this Granny's world...<br />And buying my favourite music from Amazon, is The only way these days...<br />Living in Australia , it is a very simple and fast process ordering on line...
B005LAIH2C|5.0|No matter how old I get certain movies are a must for me. My son brought me to the premier weekend for my birthday. Before I went in I knew I would love this movie. And I did.<br />These writers have imaginations that are unbelievable. They tie the ancient fairy tale up with a neat ribbon of witchcraft(which is in the original story) and season it with fast action/great special effects/and just good acting. No actor or actress is a disappointment<br />in their portrayals. At the theater I saw it in 3-D, however the DVD lacks nothing in &#34;punch or excitement.&#34;<br />I wonder if in the sequel there will be male witches(warlocks). Remember what century we live in? The ERA of P.C.<br />A great escape flick...enjoy.
B004TI5N38|5.0|A very talented and amazing author. Suspense all the way through. Once you think you have it, it twists and you don't. A terrific read.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|Liked the way the topic was introduced. I wish it covered the topic in greater depth! Will definitely continue to study the topic
B003UYUP58|4.0|I haven't finished it yet.  It is somewhat discouraging in that it reveals that man is not winning the fight against cancer. It almost seems that he is incapable because of his follies and shortcomings.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I found the book to be long and tedious reading.  Way too much description of scenes and the ending was as I expected.
0871164566|4.0|This was actually much better than I thought it would be.  There are some great ideas for those of us who are not beginners but need a little push into working again.  Her instructions are easy to understand and the photos are good.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Being a sappy romantic I loved the predictable ending between Jack and the Princess. The only downfall to me is a wish for better graphics. I am spoiled!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|He once again creates rich characters, but I was so disappointed with the lack of details on certain characters at the end. What happens to them?
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Great family entertainment! My children and I enjoyed watching this movie on our movie night! If you have read the books you will love it even more!!!
1594204217|5.0|This book is very well researched and gives us an inside view into how our food is processed from the birth of the animal to its ultimate arrival on our dinner table or to the seed being planted in the earth to the cooked vegetable being presented for our consumption.  It will allow me to be a more conscious consumer, especially researching how the animals are raised.  I will never again eat meat from the poor animals who are mistreated in factory farms which provide most of the food in the supermarkets.  This book is a public service.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|How interesting in a time when there is no political will to change the status quo - we idolize, and idealize, a president who was all about change and taking a stand to force it. Maybe it is human nature to try to avoid change, and maybe Lincoln was as demonized then as President Obama is now. What I liked about this movie was the portrayal of what &#34;democracy&#34; really is...
1577314808|5.0|This is THE most powerful spiritual book that I have ever read.  I am in my THIRD re-read.  It reinforces the thought that the past is GONE, the future does not exist there is only the NOW and that if we live in the now, we will change our lives.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|Good spy movie! Like the story behind the story! Not glitzy Bond nor techie (goofy) Mission Impossible. Makes me want to read some of the books that inspired this movie...
B0037KMHRY|5.0|such an EPIC soundtrack.I'm in love with it!<br />It went so well with the movie and just amazing to listen to on it's own.
0140557741|5.0|See directions under my recommendation for the other Zoom book...<br /><br />So, you do the same thing with folders and students put themselves in time order. But this second time, students need to also break themselves into self-styled &#34;time periods.&#34; This s a great way to teach them about &#34;Periodization&#34; and how historians decide on and name time periods.<br /><br />This is a MUST HAVE for AP World History teachers!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have really enjoyed all three books, this final book left me exhausted.  To think that a political power can go so far to hold onto their power is frightening.  At times I thought the book a bit long, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is totally awesome!!!! I  love the chemistry between the two! It was so intense. Once I started reading I didn't want to put the book down! Of course I had to feed the family, lol !  It had a lot of unexpected  turns! So captivating, would definitely read it again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rock I whish this game was free so I can build for free and kill monster for free
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved this series. No four letter words.  Refreshing...really get tired of hearing a bunch of trash talk. Thanks for having this in your video library.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I seriously love this app. Not only are the penguins very cute, but there is much more versatility and many more options than Temple Run and Subway Surfers. In this game, you collect fish instead of coins, and there is a wide variety of obstacles to dodge. There is everything from octopuses to slippery ice to rolling logs and boulders. I find it more exciting and interesting than either Temple Run or Subway Surfers, to both of which this app has been compared. The only bad thing I have to say about Super Penguins is that it can take a LONG time to earn special upgrades and such. All in all, I do really recommend this game and think that it is a great time waster and perfect for kids and adults alike.
B000IZ0KRK|4.0|This movie was a good example of how the monarchy treated their own relatives. This was interesting in a sense of finding out the truth of what these people did and how they put their own desires above everybody else; men and women alike. Certainly a lot of deceit and manipulation went on. This movie had it all! Amazing that there were any people left to continue the lineage. If you like history, you'll enjoy this.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Like the game. Fun to play. Good time killer. Just wish it had different backgrounds instead of the same one all the time.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|This movie was ridiculous. I only wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.  Certainly will be more careful in choosing future movies to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I  think this game is better then temple run because you don't have to tilt the screen. My father loves playing subway surfers. My brother and my mom also do.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|really good movie..acting was fun and the story was true to the disney one.  My four year old son loved this movie..really glad we purchased it
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|As above this is a good free game and will rid you of that dreaded &quot;free time&quot;. A must have for your kindle fire gaming arsenal
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|One of the best, watched it for the first time with my 13 year old son and he also loved it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Ir is a nice little game that my grandchildren enjoy. I have played it a few times and its a nice game
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Khaled Hosseini has an eye for detail that benefits his readers. He is able to bridge the gap between Afghanistan and the US f. ex. and clearly address the situation from the perspectives on both sides while exposing the hipocracy involved when too many do-gooders promise too much. He is also able to show us the determination involved in surviving and establishing a new life and the effects of those efforts on generation after generation. Absolutely well worth the read!
0689878451|5.0|I found this at the public library first and then had to have it for myself.  And it's a true story!  Expands our understanding that families come in many 'flavors' and that sharing love is what matters most.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|sooo much fun! had a hard time putting my kindle down! great hiding places and it makes you think throughout the entire game. loved it... more rooms please!!!!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|If, like me, you're tired of the conservative and liberal biases of Fox and MSNBC and the commercialism of CNN, then you'll find the reporting on the BBC fair and balanced.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I rented this while with my parents and the reviews and little description from Amazon didn't mention FULL nudity and connection to porn movies. Between fast forwarding it and then rewinding it to see what was okay, we didn't watch it, not even 5 minutes of it. Wish I could get my money back
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was looking for a calculator that didn't get tied up in all the bells and whistles.  This one fits the bill precisely.
B000GCFBQU|4.0|again  great characterization. The complexities of the personalities makes for<br />a good read. This is what i loved about her other books.
B00340I4KG|1.0|What a waste of talent in a ridiculously written script. So medically inaccurate. They merely cut outline on their faces and magically lift off their entire faces, as if there is no tissue connecting our faces to our heads. THEN, as if our skin/blood is totally compatible w/ anyone elses, not only do they surgically place Nick's face onto John's head without any resulting bruising, and implant a voice modifying device to match the other guy's, BUT the lab/docs/feds naively leave Nick unshackled, unsupervised in hospital/lab. AND, worse yet, Nick wakes, sees Travolta's face in a jar, magically knows to don it, surgically attaches it to his own face, apparently psychically figures out how to build & implant a Travolta voice emulator all on his own to impersonate Travolta.  I had to turn it off. Pathetic. Love the actors, but can't believe people rated this 4+ stars.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is an amazing book about a boy that learns people love for what is inside not on the outside.
0399162097|5.0|This is a book about love and empathy, memory and tenacity, and the consequences of big mistakes. The protagonist is smart and snarky but also sympathetic. It illuminated and deepened my understanding of what it means to be human--with our wisdom and our delusions both appearing in sharp relief. It broke, and softened, my heart and left me feeling more connected to the world and all its beings.<br /><br />As a bonus, the narration of the Audible edition perfectly complements the beautiful writing.
1449437524|4.0|If you like the Oatmeal comic or love dogs you probably will like this little book.  It was smaller than I was expecting though, but hey, it was 10$.  Dog the Paradox made me laugh many times and will continue to do so.  It is pretty clever.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The case for wheat free diet is well laid out here;'and its connection to many ailments and diseases we've come to accept as a station of life; a must read for anyone looking to improve their health or reverse more severe conditions and get rid of the medications often prescribed to treat the symptoms of wheat influence .<br />Be careful, you'll never look at wheat the same!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|While I'm sorry to see this series end, Ms. Harris could have done so much more with this character, as well as the story line.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|So glad I'm able to watch all for seasons here!  Wish it was still on right now.  It is good!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It's a great show and they did well with what budget they had. However, the camera shake was eye straining. Good watch overall.
B000TGCR38|2.0|Although supposed to have some factual basis I found the story not very believable...acting not so great. NOt up to par with so many WW II and Holocaust stories.  Disappointed.  Did have some exciting moments though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really enjoying this app.  living in the city we aren't allowed to have horses so this is my way of having a horse.  :
B009GX6SSK|5.0|This show is a nice continuation of the First Show. I'm wondering if they are going to have another spinoff called REDS. Cause it seems like it would be a nice show. And why not.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Very good book for young people to read. One of Stevensons Best concieved book and very well writen by a great author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  She plays non stop. This is a great way to learn to take care of an animal.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|It's Bogart and Bergman for Christ sakes! You know the song, Play it again Sam.<br />A kiss is just a kiss
B006T3RM08|1.0|After reading many reviews we decided this was what we needed to keep our trackpad and keyboard together but the keyboard doesn't fit in!  We've tried it every way and are not idiots, the dock simply isn't big enough to fit both.  Terrible.
B000NGTJTY|3.0|If this is suppose to be loosly linked to the &#34;Whitey Bulger&#34; the story isn't over yet. In a city like Boston, it took months just to form a jury.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Person in charge of casting deserves a lot of credit for this hit movie.  Everyone was near perfect for the part
B007PM218K|1.0|The first copy of this film would not play...there was a defect on the DVD which you could see.  I returned it and received another which flashed a picture of something red and unidentifiable in the middle of the DVD (it's a black and white film).  Don't consider this a quality product.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read very fast, thought it ended to soon! Looking forward to the next book coming out! Would highly recommend!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I heard the single &#34;Somebody I used to know&#34; on a coworker's streaming radio and instantly fell in love. I was curious about the rest of the album and bought all the songs. The album has become one of my favorites of all time.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Sherlock was recommended to me by my daughter.  I started watching & now I really like it also.  Can't wait to start Season 2
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I liked this story and it was spine tingling suspenseful. The twists and turns in the story leaves you worried about how they will ever get out of the situation in one piece. I cannot fathom how the writer's mind works or the level of research he has to do in order to keep his facts straight but this one is a page turner.
B000002AV5|5.0|Nobody does it like Sade. Fantastic CD. It captures the essence of Island music from days gone by. She is HOT!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I loved this game I think there should be scend one please make one I beg you sincerely Bob shumom
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A real eye opener. Pathetic that our country has once again let corporate money grubbers bastardize the entire food industry! Great DVD!
B0068AWO00|1.0|Though it comes close to following the original script, anyone who is a fan of the 1985 version, shouldn't watch this!!  I thought it was horrible.  Wouldnt watch again! Such a disappointment.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So I started watching Game of Thrones by randomly finding it on HBO. This was before I knew there were books so I watched the first two seasons and thought it was a great story line. Then one of my buddies told me about the book series. I'm always one for a well-written book series, and let me tell you, this is one of them. Even thought I knew what the first two books were going to be about they were much better than the TV show. Mr. Martin is a very good writer and once you start the books it's hard to put them down. I find it's becoming harder and harder to find books like that....and this is the first one I've come across since reading James Clavell's Shogun series. Anyway, I haven't watched any more of the TV series and don't plan on it until I finish the books. Then again, you might not want to wreck the picture Mr. Martin paints for you in this book. Excellent read.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|I liked the idea of the story. The ending was one I had not even considered. To me the story was hard to follow as some of it did not flow from one chapter to the next. That can be forgiven as this is a young Arthur Clarke.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|One of my favorite Iggy & Stooges CDs -- the music is powerful and the songwriting exceptional (the dark town of the lyrics compensated for by the vitality of the musicianship)...
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|Everyone you can think of is in this movie....but it gets a little draggy in some parts, and Kenneth Branagh is a tad old for the part, imho.  I did enjoy it though for the most part.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Either way it fails.  Don't waste your time or money.  I'll give you the synopsis to spare you:  rich, super good looking a-holes struggle because lives somehow not perfect.  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.  Only funny scenes involve Graham Parker.  Download his mp3s instead and don't encourage Judd and company to keep churning out this kind of crap.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Movie worked perfectly and who doesn't love The Little Mermaid?! I was excited to even find it on Amazon since Disney has it in their infamous vault and who knows when I would've been able to introduce my 32 month old to Ariel!!! Yay!!! Love Amazon and loved the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book while traveling and it made my 12 hour flights go so much faster and made it much more enjoyable.  Tina Fey's voice is so evident and hilarious on every page.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|This documentary is better than a lot of dramas that try to depict some famous sports figures.  Editing is top notch and squeezes every bit of emotion out of the available material.  I was waiting for this movie for quite a while and to say that I wasn't disappointed would be understatement.
1781162646|5.0|Loved it! It pulls you in from the beginning and you don't want to put it down! You don't see the ending coming.
B009E3EWPI|3.0|Several major issues mar this very important release.<br /><br />1. The video editing. As has been mentioned many times before, the editing is way too jumpy. Quite apart from darn near inducing motion sickness, think of the new generation of shredders and Jimmy Page wannabes. I'm certain they felt that FINALLY they would be able to study Page's guitar technique in detail. Fat chance. There is no way to do that with jump cuts every 1.5 seconds. A major disappointment and production blunder.<br /><br />2. Is it just me or did Page's guitar sound just awful? I heard a bunch what could only be described as muddy shrieking. I like distortion as much as the next guy, but Page's guitars were recorded at way too high a level.<br /><br />3. As one would expect, Plant's voice sounded every bit as torn up as the hard living which caused it.<br /><br />Now for the good parts:<br /><br />1. John Paul Jones looked and sounded absolutely fantastic. This what happens when you use good judgement and take care of yourself and your talent.<br /><br />2. Jason Bonham. Channeled his father big-time! An amazing performance and congrats to him.<br /><br />Bottom line: great historical document, but could have been so much better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Why don't we have more like this?  So great, hope there will be more seasons.<br />Since this is a PBS show why is it not free?
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows ever made. It had everything action, drama, romance all rolled into one. Great characters and actors and some great stories that really made people think. It also is a great historical series for those that love that genre as well like me. I can't say enough good things about it will always be at the very top of my list of faves.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This is a very good app. It does exactly as advertised. I use it almost every day. Well worth the price I paid.
1452110581|5.0|I had checked this out of the local library and loved it, so I got my own copy from Amazon.  This is a must for anyone who lives with and loves cats.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|I saw this German language version with English subtitles when the film first appeared in movie theaters. A English language dub version eventually replaced that, but oddly enough it lost something in the translation.  Hearing the actors speaking German during the film makes it more believable.  This is because the pace of the dialog moves slowly enough that you do not feel like you have to scramble to read them.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game is really fun for young age children. my 5 year old boy really enjoys playing it and can spend hours on it. appreciate it!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A little slow at the start and it takes a while to get used to reading the dialect, but definitely worth it by the end!
B0000E64TR|5.0|One of my favorite albums that I never owned - now come to life in SACD-DSD 5.1 surround! The surround mix is great, not gimmicky, but not &#34;phoned in&#34; (from the reviews, too many albums re-mixed for surround just enhance the &#34;ambience&#34; - heck, any half-decent AVR's DSP can do that!)<br /><br />Love the packaging - I'm guessing it's all the extras that came with the original LP, just in miniature. A great way to start my collection of hi-res/surround music.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This is a very good app. It does exactly as advertised. I use it almost every day. Well worth the price I paid.
B00CLILB66|5.0|Brilliantly directed by Dustin Hoffman, superbly acted by all members of the cast, and so funny let true to life.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved most of her books, but this one was a waste of my time and money. Really no plot, just plopped down on paper. Don't bother.
1416583408|5.0|most books tell me &#34;how to&#34; care for dog ...... coat, nails, cleanliness, etc...... this book goes far beyond &#34;how to&#34; and is a must-read for anyone who owns or plans to own a dog ...... i have a couple copies which i loan out and gladly share .......
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Context and time period depicted fairly accurately, definitely worthy of Best Picture Award. Movie is worth watching at least a couple of times.
B00008CLOA|4.0|This 5.1 SACD brings new life to this great classic - almost. &#34;Speak To Me&#34;, the opening track, is mixed just a little low. I was blown away (almost literally) the first time I heard this: shopping for a system back in '73, Dad and I were in the front room of a Glasgow hi-fi shop, when we heard and felt a pile driver several blocks away. Turns out, it was the thumping &#34;heartbeat&#34; on &#34;Speak To Me&#34; emanating from a large pair of B&Ws in the back &#34;demo room&#34;! Much as I tried, I couldn't quite get the same &#34;thump thump&#34; out of my system (subwoofer tweaked an' all), but when it led into &#34;Breathe&#34;, the significant rise in volume practically drew blood from my eardrums! Surprisingly, in the 2.0 channel AutoRip MP3s that Amazon provides for free (good thing - my Mac wouldn't read the hybrid disc), the levels were more as I remember them and I was able to get that sensory enjoyment, even at low levels, from my near-field monitors at work!<br /><br />The volume levels on the rest of the disc are &#34;normal&#34; and the surround mix is revelatory - a great new way to enjoy an old &#34;friend&#34;. I would have preferred a facsimile of the original album artwork and liners, but the reworking does include those elements, though reduced to &#34;tiny&#34; pictures.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy to have this in my collection.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This is a very good app. It does exactly as advertised. I use it almost every day. Well worth the price I paid.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|OK, so  this C-D is in French. Doesn't make a difference to me. Celine's voice makes this C-D well worth listening to. A must for any of her fans.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love his books and this was an interesting story.  It was not as complex & detailed as some of his others. It was a fast, easy read....maybe a little too fast and too easy....
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is a wonderful story of tough beginnings and happy endings that was very hard to put down.  The parallel between the two main characters quickly became obvious, which just added to the desire to learn more about each person and see how they handled the obstacles they encountered.  It was nice to see the young and the old learn from each other.  It's always enjoyable to read a story in which you root for the main characters to succeed - and they eventually do.  One of the best things about this book is that it is not a usual formula-type detective/mystery/romance/whatever-you-typically-read (and usually enjoy) book.  The subject matter is fresh and welcoming.
B00338QENI|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. It is amazing what goes on behind your back when your not looking! very interesting!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good game. like the way you have to navigate the room to find the items to &quot;escape&quot; the room. I like how it gets more challenging as you move through the levels
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I downloaded this for my great grandaughter because she loves Nemo but haven't had a chance to really watch it, I am sure it is good
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It's not a book - it's the next installment of a serialized novel - a short, light, quick read. I might have been ok with that except that it was sold to readers as the 3rd in a trilogy. It's a good series, I like the characters, but it's most definitely not a $50 dollar-read which is what the now 5-part series will cost on Kindle. The author should have come clean when she missed her deadline rather than releasing a few chapters full of teasers. Lesson: buy into a series only once it's all been released...
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I was so drawn into this book that I read it in one day!  Couldn't put it down.  I love the way that Lee Child gives you a lot of subtle clues throughout the book and helps you to solve the mystery along with Jack...of course Jack usually gets it way before I do...but I keep trying!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an awesome app I think I mean who wouldn't I have been around HORSES a lot when my father got a farm I don't see him any more though
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I'm a huge Oz fan so I was skeptical about Oz the Great and Powerful.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was and how it fit together with the original.  I saw it the first time in the theater in 3D.  It was amazing.  Even without the 3D effects, it is still a great story.
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|This movie was different from what I expected; I was somewhat disappointed, but the casting was excellent, the performances of high quality, and the special effects amazing.  Overall, it was much darker and gloomier than I expected from the reviews and previews.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the Weather Channel App all the time, great to be able to use when traveling in any area
B00899F0G8|5.0|My secret is this season is amazing. I wasn't feeling the ending due to wanting more more more however, I;m glad we bought it. Defintely our favorite season! God Bless :)
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Great item , just got season two . all good no issued . very cool . great to sit and watch a whole season
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's awesome!  A bit soap-opera'y in the beginning (first two episodes) but then it's fantastic.  I would highly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The ever haunting question that makes for great stories. Always enjoy stories of this nature and this book didn't disappoint.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I loved the beautiful, authentic scenes in the Southport area and the delightful local flavor<br />captured through the casting.  This is an A+  classic chick flick !
B0026Q8EWW|1.0|Wow how real (sarcasm). Most of the time it's the man who needs to defend himself because all the time the law assume men are the perpetrator thanks to the feminists and victim hood!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found the game to be interesting and challenging to my old brain. I like how the puzzles are multidimensional, making me put the pieces together rather than just finding objects.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Enjoyed it in Blue ray. The car chase was great. The price was very reasonable. Great cast and plenty of action.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. It is a good way to waste time and to get you thinking. Very cool.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun,  simple game.  keeps you guessing,  wish it had a hint button sometimes but over all a fun game I recommend it.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Jill Boulte Taylor experienced a brain aneurism and stroke at age 37 and fought her way back to a &#34;normal&#34; state after years of struggle.  It is a heart warming story but what makes it fascinating is that Jill is a scientist--a neuroanatomist.  she knows what is going on in her brain every step of the way, even though she cannot communicate.  It is a fascinating story, especially if you have ever had a loved one who was a stroke victim.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD [Extended Cut + Theatrical Cut] [2013] [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD] Bruce Willis Is Back In Action! Yippee Ki-Yay Mother Russia!<br /><br />Bruce Willi Is Back In Action! Here we have a mind-blowing, heart-stopping, rip-roaring action, as John McClane, the heroic New York cop with a knack for being in the wrong place at the right time. John's latest predicament takes him all the way to Russia to track down his estranged son, Jack [Jai Courtney], who has been imprisoned in Moscow. But the mission takes a deadly turn as father and son must join forces to thwart a nuclear weapons heist that could trigger World War III!<br /><br />Cast: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney, Sebastian Koch, Yuliya Snigir, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Radivoje Rasha Bukviæ, Cole Hauser, Amaury Nolasco, Sergei Kolesnikov, Roman Lukn&aacute;r, Ganxsta Zolee, P&eacute;ter Tak&aacute;tsy, Pasha D. Lychnikoff, Megalyn Echikunwoke, Melissa Tang, Ivan Kamaras and Sophie Raworth [BBC News reporter]<br /><br />Director: John Moore<br /><br />Producers: Alex Young and Wyck Godfrey<br /><br />Screenplay: Skip Woods<br /><br />Composer: Marco Beltrami<br /><br />Cinematography: Jonathan Sela<br /><br />Video Resolution: 1080p<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio: English: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish: 5.1 Dolby Digital<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH and Spanish<br /><br />Running Time: 98 minutes<br /><br />Region: Region A/1<br /><br />Number of discs: Disc 1: Theatrical Extended Cut and Disc 2: DVD + Digital Copy]<br /><br />Studio: 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment<br /><br />Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Ask any genre fan what the best action film of all time is, and a fair percentage will say Die Hard without hesitation, me included. Hell, the original trilogy in its entirety blew me away. They consistently offered tactically brilliant villains, and they went to great lengths to ensure they wouldn't be re-treads of the original. Of course, film studios never let a financial opportunity go to waste... leaving tarnished legacies an inevitability. As a result, John McClane returned to the big screen 12 years after the fact in Live Free or Die Hard, but not without its share of controversy. In order to reach a broader audience, the film was edited to acquire a PG-13 rating. Was the outrage that followed justified? Somewhat, but to be fair, it was a decent action-packed effort that featured John McClane kicking ass once again, so I found very little to complain about. Ever since, all of our beloved action stars from the 80's have made a resurgence, so it was only natural for Fox to keep the ball rolling with ‘A Good Day to Die Hard,’ is a film which promised to introduce our favourite tough-guy to Mother Russia, and with an 18 certificate, which is only right.<br /><br />A political prisoner is about to blow the whistle on a corrupt Russian official, but the criminal mastermind acts with extreme force to ensure that never comes to pass. It's an intriguing setup that comes with lots of potential, but ultimately serves as a bunch of noise behind the films far more transparent crux where John McClane's estranged son Jack [Jai Courtney] is seemingly at the centre of this mess, so he sucks up his pride and hops on the first plane to Moscow for an awkward heart-to-heart! John may be in a foreign land, but he's made to feel right at home when an attack erupts outside of the courthouse where his son is being held. Barely escaping with their lives, the father and son at odds rip through Moscow in a high speed chase that takes half the city along with it and, the rest of the film practically writes itself. Although the duo start things off on the wrong foot, numerous encounters with bad guys itching to 'die hard' force them to bond in the only way the John McClane's know-how. By kicking ass and blowing up whatever gets in their way.<br /><br />Sure, it's a great idea to have John McClane team up with his son Jack and all, but at this point it feels like the filmmakers were throwing ideas at the wall, just hoping one would stick. I can understand the Directors primary concern, was to deliver an action film first and foremost. Screenwriter Skip Woods and Director John Moore felt saddling John McClane with a sidekick was obligatory. Die Hard doesn't need a gimmicks, just put our antihero in the right place at the wrong time, and allow him to do what he does best and I felt he did his very best, despite what other reviewers gave it a big thumbs down, especially with their one dimensional views and they should get a life and leave out their negative views, as most reviewers have rubbished this film and they are totally out of order, as I thought it was totally brilliant and awesome at the same time.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – ‘Good Day to Die Hard’ makes this Blu-ray debut with an impressive 1080p brilliant encoded transfer with an impressive aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Attempting to provide a gritty visual aesthetic, especially as this film was shot using 35mm film, meaning there's a noticeable amount of grain without being intrusive enough make the grain haters cry &#34;foul.&#34; Despite the film's many shortcomings, this does help to lend the latest Die Hard with a tone of intensity, and this encode replicates the intended filmic look flawlessly. There are no digital anomalies to speak, especially of no edge enhancement, banding, aliasing or digital artefacts. The colour palette is somewhat muted at times, but the film is dominantly shown through blue and orange filters, and this artistic choice is also replicated without issue. It's an attempt to keep the film somewhat dark and moody, but it sure does help to make the reds and oranges of countless explosions practically leap off the screen. Sharpness is immaculate, although there are some soft shots inherent to the photography, while black levels and contrast remain strong throughout.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Track packs so much punch, your house will probably join the rubble left behind in Moscow. Immersion might even be an understatement and It doesn't matter if we're listening to cars get crunched off the road, or if we're under an audible barrage of bullets flying in every which direction, because every sound effect has been mixed with pinpoint precision and depth. The film packs quite a punch when things really get rough, but impressive dynamics make every shot, crunch, punch and explosion that much more impressive. Dialogue is crystal clear, and environmental ambience is so real, you'll practically feel like you're standing right next to John McClane and son while they're kicking ass. If you want a new action flick to show off your home theatre equipment, you're going to want to give this Blu-ray disc a spin.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director John Moore and First Assistant Director Mark Cotone: Director John Moore has a decent enough chat with first-assistant director Mark Cotone about the production and making a film to an already established franchise.

On top of that, 20th Century Fox has put together a fantastic Blu-ray release, with an hour-long making-of documentary, a great audio commentary, and several other documentaries, which I think is a total bonus and why you should purchase this amazing Blu-ray disc package and then it will complete your Die Hard Collection. I totally dispute all the negative reviews I have read and obviously these idiots have been watching a totally different film to me and obviously I must be a lone wolf when it comes to reviewing a film and knowing everyone else is totally wrong in their negative attitude and views.

Miller - Your Ultimate No.1 Film Fan<br />Le Cinema Paradiso<br />WARE, United Kingdomme 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Track packs so much punch, your house will probably join the rubble left behind in Moscow. Immersion might even be an understatement and It doesn't matter if we're listening to cars get crunched off the road, or if we're under an audible barrage of bullets flying in every which direction, because every sound effect has been mixed with pinpoint precision and depth. The film packs quite a punch when things really get rough, but impressive dynamics make every shot, crunch, punch and explosion that much more impressive. Dialogue is crystal clear, and environmental ambience is so real, you'll practically feel like you're standing right next to John McClane and son while they're kicking ass. If you want a new action flick to show off your home theatre equipment, you're going to want to give this Blu-ray disc a spin.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director John Moore and First Assistant Director Mark Cotone: Director John Moore has a decent enough chat with first-assistant director Mark Cotone about the production and making a film to an already established franchise.

B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Limited in what it actually does, yet takes up a lot of storage on the device.  Concept is good, quality not as much.
B00CBSYDSE|5.0|This album is pretty awesome.  Its a lot better than the last album.  I find it has a harder edge to it, but still has all the STS elements that we have come to love.  If you like animals and leaders and other bands like that, you will love this album.  Its great from start to finish, and you wont mind listening to it over and over again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book was definitely better than I thought it would be. It's immediate charm is that it takes a somewhat absurd premise and takes it very seriously. What would happen if we were to have a zombie outbreak right now? The book answers that in a way through multiple character stories. While there is the immediate threat of zombies, there are also a ton of other problems alongside avoiding the undead. Environmental pollution and refugee issues are just a few issues that people have to deal with during a war like this. The stories can vary in length and some stories are significantly better than others.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The best series and ending I've ever read. I'm planning on re reading the entire series again to make sure I didn't miss anything.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I purchased it via Kindle for my husband who is a huge sci-fi fan, but me...not so much.  I accidentally clicked on it when I was choosing a new book from my Kindle library and the first page snagged me.  The rest of the book did not disappoint.  I enjoyed each and every chapter.  The characters are well thought out and I especially appreciated that one of the strongest characters in the book is a woman and seems to be written that way on purpose. I will definitely be looking for the other books in the series.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|very good read..enjoyed it..going to read the next two in the series. unusual setting. very different circumstances for a story.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|though we didn't care for the movie (all the funny parts were shown in commercials) the quality was excellent on the Kindle Fire
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|What a great app/game. Super addictive yet totally cute and challenging. Great for all ages. If you don't have any patience then this game is not for you. But they say &quot;Patience is a Virtue&quot;, so if you want to develop your patience skills, this game will teach you all about it. Oh yeah, it's free. Can't beat that :)
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|it is a fair app to show function of weapon and how they work it can be a little tricky to do some of the functions on a small phone
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm not sure if I should be as proud of myself as I am after I finally find my way out of the rooms, but I am! Doesn't matter how long it takes...I'm addicted to the solution &amp; feel compelled to stick with it. It's a real unique concept that helps pass time (even when you don't have any to spare). Hey, we're all worth it!
B00873GRU4|4.0|The idea of life and death in a silo is a fripping read. I couldn't put it down and look forward to the next book.
B000FC146C|2.0|I felt it was time for me to know what the book was about.  It did not turn out to be anything I would recommend to anyone else.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Highly recommend if you have a child who has trouble paying attention, the game speeds up and requires focus and problem solving skills.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a great game! I love puzzle games like these but I hare it when they're so difficult! but this game its not to easy so its a bit challenging but its also not so difficult to comeplete
B009PU2SX8|5.0|I'm happy to have come across this artist, his alternative rock/ R&B effort is a wonderful homage to the past wink a refreshing wink to the future.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was really funny, touching and captured Philly so well (especially the Eagles obsession!)  The writing and acting is superb!  It really deserved all the accolades it received when it was released.  They all earned their Oscar nominations and win (for Jennifer Lawrence.)  It's a must see.
B00AFEQ4B0|4.0|Not expecting such a powerful performance from everyone in the film!  Put the kids to bed early on this one :)
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I just completed reading this Millenium Trilogy. It is a great novel and has all the ingredients to keep the reader's attention. It is an amazing page turner. When one starts the book it never lets up and all the various incidents that occur to the two main characters, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomquistsomehow all tie in with a host of other very unsavory characters which cross their paths one way or another. The book holds one in suspense from start to finish. This applies to all three books in this amazing trilogy.<br /><br />When I finshed reading the first book, I just hoped that it would continue. Lisbeth Salander is an incredible character with a super amount of stamina and strength despite her relatively small size. She had been through so much in her life that had moulded her the way she is. I felt relieved that there were another two books to go after reading the first book. Many of the scenarios are rather far-fetched and unrealistic, but this did not spoil the gist of the book. It somehow aroused the reader's curiosity even more. It did not spoil the content.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel because of its fast pace that never leaves a dull moment. The characters are well described in the book without excess verbosity and this in itself is a great talent not often found in writers of thrillers who tend to digress for too long a time that one very often loses the thread of the story. This never happens here as there is repetition of various incidents at various stages of the novel. Even if you put the book down for a while, you pick up the story without any problems because of the continuity of one incident connecting to another in various, ingenuous ways.<br /><br />It deserves a 5 star rating. I am sure that had Larssen been alive today, he would have gone on writing about Salander and Blomquist in new scenarios and situations of intrigue that would keep the reader on his toes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|number 10 is kind of hard . This game is a  that doesn't need wifi.  I beat the whole game inone day. Have fun playing.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Way too  disjointed with no real tie to the first book except for Ender, who's running from his past actions.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This and all other books by Gillian Flynn are must reads. She is an excellent writer. The characters are all interesting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game to play.  If I get really stuck I can find each level on YouTube.  If you like a little challenge this is a great game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow just wow! Such a great writer, you will love the silo series. I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed.
B0026Q8EWW|3.0|I like it, but it was from  me a litle slow  movie,  and I did not finish it maybe 5 min at the end , I guess I was too tired :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I rate this right after Kite Runner. Warm, rich and real and hard to put down. Beautiful twists and turns.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Makes one think.  Developed relationships that were complex and interesting.  Ended a little abruptly - I went on to the second in the series hoping for more but was disappointed.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|Love the idea that we can see people that have passed to the other side.  Love that the real Allison helps solve crimes and has helped many people in real life.
0679805273|5.0|We bought copies of these books to have our daughters teachers sign and write a message each year. When they graduate they will be presented with this book from all their teachers.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I have always been a fan of the angry birds, it is so much fun to play and challenging to me.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was pretty amazing! I never write book reviews but this author, well she deserves it. It was intense and very visual.I could see the characters, smell what they smelled, and feel what they felt. Awesome writing!
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|Having read the novel twice, I was intrigued to see how the story would unfold as a movie. The conceit of a staged play is an artistic choice, but its usefulness is debatable: at times distracting and often confusing (said my husband, who was unfamiliar with the story). The movie is beautifully executed: actors, clothing, scenery, etc., but I'm not sure the presentation does justice to the story or to the viewer's understanding of the plot... Maybe it's simply too artsy for me. With all due respect to the fact that the producers took on an epic, lengthy novel, I think the movie is definitely spectacular but maybe not the best adaptation.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|The original. The quality is not the highest but that adds to the experience of the horror flick. The end.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Not the best of the Transformers trilogy but still an okay film. It feels a bit dragged out. Still, you should check it out if your looking for a nice action flick.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Quick, easy to use. Weather updates are timely. Maps are good. Interface is laid out well. Easy choice over Weather Channel and Weather Bug.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|When has this ever not been amazing? Still one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. Liotta, Deniro, and Pesci are great together.
0071766588|5.0|I recommand you to buy it i took my exam last week i found the most of voc ot this book in my test and this book really prepare u to the exam and there is an anthentic tests to learn u how to do the test<br />Good luck and buy it without regreting
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I liked the movie but after seeing the original on Starz There were several segments missing to the story. There needed another disc per episode of the Spartacus series someone who would purchase this would be questioning the story.

0375869026|5.0|I bought this book after hearing some many other teachers talk about this book. I loved it. My 5th graders loved the story and we all agreed that my class should read it next year. There are so many teachable moments thought the story and it reminded me that everyone needs a standing ovation at some point in their life.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't put this down ! Loved every minute. Had a Harry Potter -like aspect. Sounds effects are pretty cool too. Tons of fun. Can't wait for the next one !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was so fun.  I really enjoyed it!  When I finished it, I immediately got back on Amazon for another.  At times it really had me but I finally escaped!  Awesome!!
0316247545|4.0|Presentation: Beautiful and faithful to the show's aesthetics<br />Content: A lot of neat little factoids about the writers but the episode descriptions seem to pad out the length<br /><br />overall: 4/5
B0072OFM28|3.0|as with the other episodes of Spartacus there were missing segments to complete the story If you haven't seen the original story on STARZ  you will be questioning the story on what is going on with the story another disc to complete the story is needed

B00BK5D95C|3.0|I really wanted to like this but after several listens, I just found it to be a little too cute for it's own good. While not without it's charms, the whole thing just sounds a bit too contrived to me, being clever for the sake of being clever. The songs often times come off sounding like experiments that don't really have much weight. I was also reminded of the most recent Here We Go Magic cd (which I love) that has a similar sonic texture, but contains a greater variety of material and depth.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of my favorite shows, so glad it became free on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />It's faced paced, extremely witty, and makes you think.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I was taken in by the first paragraph and have not been able to put this book down. I have both the book and Kindle download.<br /><br />The author reveals an unknown slice of life from the African's perspective of living in America and offers a glimpse of middle-class life in Nigeria, while exposing the vast differences between the perceptions and realities of the African and the American Black. This is a fun read filled with rich nuances and honesty, thoughtful insight on top of zesty hues of humor. I highly recommend this book!
B0094M2S5A|5.0|It is a very good movie.  I've seen it many times.  Better than the stuff they are coming out with now.
B004HW7JMO|3.0|Enjoyable ... after seeing the original series on STARZ i noticed missing segemnts to the story line. There needed be be another disc added to the pkg to give the full story
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't believe it! The book ended right in the middle. So dumb! Just trying to make money not tell a story. That's it I'm done with Sylvia Day!
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love it,  love it, love it. John Fogerty sounds as great as he ever did and this collaboration of music and talent really works . It's my kind of music.
1451627289|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but I found many of his more recent books disappointed. Not so this one. It is a superb read. For a more detailed analysis, head on over to:<br />http://stevengepp.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/book-review-112263-by-stephen-king/
B00BF11STU|5.0|There are not enough videos about strong, intelligent leaders who are women.  This story is based on a true story.<br />I've seen it on the big screen, rented it through Amazon and recently purchased it.  When over 50% of the work force are women and when  there are more females in college than men ,video creators should learn to make more videos<br />like Zero Dark Thirty.
B004LWZVZM|2.0|Slow movie , acting was ok , overall just boring. , I would not watch the movie more than once , I wish I could return it
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is addictive. Great time killer. It gets 5 stars.but it can make you forget things.so limit yourself.( :
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|So often what Hollywood produces in relation to ancient history is so ridiculous.  I thought that this series captured the spirit of the early Viking age while still telling a rollicking good story.  Keep up the great work!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This films builds suspense and terror when a true-crime author (Hawke) moves into a new home with his family.  He discovers films of murdered victims who died in the same house plus more footage of related earlier crimes that were taken by the assailant.  Hawk hordes this information hoping to profit from it through his writings, but only succeeds in endangering himself and his family.  He has unleashed an ancient demon who toys with him, yet he stubbornly wants to face it alone and somehow benefit.  He was probably doomed the minute he played the films the first time, but his own sense of entitlement and selfishness with the information help seal his fate.  This film is a solid horror picture in the genre of \\"The Ring\\" but even more foreboding as there appears to be no way to fight the terrifying evil demon. I look forward to more from Director Scott Derrickson who is talented and knows how to create suspense with his story and filming.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A new Superman, a rookie Superman.  Been a fan my entire life, and this is my favorite Supes movie.  Go in forgetting what you know and possibly love about the comics and past movies.  Enjoy!
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This movie has some good comic moments to lighten the mood of a serious subject. Hopefully the human race has made progress in its treatment of other life  in the time since this movie was made. But I'm pessimistic where business interest are concerned. Just look at the slap on the wrist BP got for its extensive damage to the gulf.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I have been anticipating the second release by Joe and Beth ever since it was announced and it does not disappoint. You need to just buy it and enjoy it, enough said !!! Well done by all involved.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have only played 5 levels but it seems to be fun. If you enjoyed playing 100floors or excape this is similar. So far so good. Keep them coming.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I've been genetically plagued by clutter my entire life. It follows me to work, an into relationships. In my mind I practice being a minimalist, however, the habit of clutter soon overwhelms me. Ms. Jay 's practical, step-by-step approach riddled with humor is an excellent teaching tool for me!  I'm off to purchase her other book, \\"the joy of less\\"
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Lots of old music mixed with new.  Silly and fun.  Bonus - I can do the cup song now.  After a bad day, this movie put a smile on my face.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I'm using this product in conjunction with a Contour HD camera to pick up the sound of my engine when I autocross. It does a great job
B008BU75IQ|2.0|First two books really good.  This one anticlimactic and boring.  Although nice cliff hanger at end, but not enough to get next book.
B00AEFYWJG|5.0|Another movie to add to my collection of DVDs.  I have always enjoyed this movie and building up me collection for when I reture.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Love this show. The music and the dancing are the best part. Guest stars are wonderful and I love to root for the underdogs!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is my first game like this. Really a good game. I am hooked. I will be looking for more games like this one. Please add more rooms.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|An excellent album, Cole gets more in depth on his path to rap stardom and the sacrifices he has to make in order to make it. A great sophomore album.
1451648537|5.0|The one thing I liked most about this book is that it's not a one sided view and reflects the life of Steve from many different perspectives. I admire the fact that it shows Steve as having insanely great and s***ty sides (to use Steve's words). I also liked the details on the stories and the fact that its not a very high level overview of Steve's life.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie for quite some time.  I have a large HD projection system with surround sound for watching Blu-ray and streaming video.  I was not impressed with the price for HD on this, $5.99 or a dollar less for the standard definition version.  But I went ahead with paying more for HD for the quality.  I could have saved my dollar.  After about 15 minutes of HD or near HD quality (not as good as Bluray) - the system stalled, then kicked into standard definition.  My Internet typically comes in around 27mbit, so even on a bad day, it should be able to handle streaming video.  I restarted the video, hoping to get a better Amazon connection.  After five minutes, it happened again.  I was using an Xbox for playback.  I usually don't have any issues on the Xbox, unlike my Blu-ray player where Amazon stalls frequently.  I am also a Netflix customer and have little or no issues with HD video streaming there on these devices.  Amazon needs to work harder to keep up with video demand.  To pay extra for HD video streaming and only get SD quality because the lines are busy is very disappointing.  The movie itself was quite good, but next time I'll get a Redbox Blu-ray disc - cheaper and better.  Unless Amazon can guaranty HD quality playback, it shouldn't be pricing videos this way.
B00AG51V8E|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and was waiting on it to come out on DVD.  Love the action and actors.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app.  enjoy that its thought provoking. passes the time and its interesting.  not too abstract either like some of the other games out there.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I am new to this market but I guess they leave out the title singer now for a separate MP3 or CD?  Otherwise, very good music.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Grand kids loved it, was a great Easter gift.much better then hipping the kids up on candy and they get years of pleasure from a great classic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just very entertaining to watch.  We enjoy the characters and drama as they go about their daily lives in the estate.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game is really fun, it's like doodle jump but batter. I was luck to buy it at 0.99 yea!!!
0783225547|5.0|Another movie to add to my collection of DVDs.  I have always enjoyed this movie and building up me collection for when I retire.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|First of all, I think the people who gave this movie 1 star have the right to voice their opinions, but to say that it was garbage and that JJ Abrhams can't direct is just wrong.  I loved it.  I even compared it with the original, which was wonderful.  But I'm probably the only one, I don't know about others, who thought this Star Trek sequel was better than the original Star Trek II.  Before everyone jumps on me, let me explain.<br /><br />With Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan you had to know who Khan is and how he came to hate Kirk and for people to know Khan you need to go back to the original series episode \\"Space Seed\\".<br /><br />In Into Darkness the whole Khan thing is explained in the movie.  And plus, the acting is not too overly done and no one person is on the screen for more than they need to be.<br /><br />I really recommend this for anyone.  Although, I do recommend seeing the 2009 Star Trek first to get to know the new crew.
B00A3XWB10|3.0|I was really looking forward to this album after the great generation wild, I as many others expected a continuation of the heavy sleaze sound of GW, but instead ended up with an album of mostly average songs and terrible production. This is easily their weakest album by far. I'm really disappointed with it. True it gets better after a few listens but cocaine cowboys is the only song that really grabs my attention, if it wasn't for that, it would only get 2 stars from me. I'm not sure how they got this one so wrong, so really hope the next one makes up for it. If you have never heard the band before then it would be a decent album but having liked the band since the first album (which is good but a little overrated) I just can't get into this album at all sadly.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|10 % is about all I could handle. I guess you need to be from the U.K in order to understand the slang in this book. I was really looking forward to a good spy read, but oh well. Another thought was maybe the Kindle translation was really bad, but I doubt that. Unfortunately I wasted 10 bucks or 6-7 pounds for my friends across the pond!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Was not expecting much form another Die Hard movie but, this one was pretty exciting.  The car chase in the start was amazing.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It's is one of  the best game I  played on the kindle or the best game graph on the Amazon app store. It has a ok story line, REALLY like the zombie zones.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Another movie to add to my collection of DVDs.  I have always enjoyed this movie and building up me collection for when I retire.  Love Bruce Willis movies.  Always exciting.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very interesting and thought provoking book. I would recommend this book for ages 13 and up. The story line was informative and adventirous.
1118156307|1.0|The book that I purchased missed about 30 pages and in turn it had double prints of 30 pages.:((( I have to re-order the book
B0063IH60K|5.0|purchased this for my cell phone.  I Play it whenever I have to wait for someone or have some time to kill and am bored.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|and intriguing,AWESOME GRAPHICS and Vivid colors(Technicolor).Weird/odd creatures.Pretty/beautiful women!Awesome storyline from the old school days with a new twist!HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The app navigation is not bad, it's really a good app. The down side for me is no subscription button, was s REALLY hoping for that, that's why this app gets a three.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The story moved along okay, but the characters were mostly stock slavery types - the good master, the bad master, the smart slave who could read, the ineffectual Southern women, the plucky slaves, yada, yada.  I did not feel I had really learned anything new after reading this book.  Julie E.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Not as good as other carte novels. The plot seemed shallow and lacking the usual carte  intrigue and chacter portrait and I suspense.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|shivers went down my back several times a great finale to a great series a testament to Robert Jordan's epic
B0063GORYU|5.0|This was purchased for cell phone.  I have on computer & play it all the time.  It can be addictive as I found out when introduced my husband to it.  Great for when waiting in doctor's office or other times.
1401907725|5.0|I love these Angel cards! I use them everyday now in my life! What A difference they make! This was a Wonderful Blessing into my life! Thank you Doreen for all of your help to me!:)
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie had all the makings for a sequel. It was a bit cheezy, but it's a teen flick. Although we are forty-something, we still enjoy these types of movies.
B00DCX08MW|1.0|The trial missions all worked fine. Purchased the discovery campaign and can't run any of the available missions. They all hang the kindle (hd 8.9) and I have to reboot
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Of course each movie in a threequel gets a little lower in quality but this was watchable. The characters were a little darker, not as comical. Shipping was very quick. It arrived safely but one false step buy the Post office and it would have been cracked. Packaging could be better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Classic escape the room game. Fun and easy to play but it only have 10 levels so far, so it ends too quickly.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|How is it that nobody have commented on the grainy pictures in this movie? OK the movie is another die hard movie and works like that. But i don't remember seeng a bluray disc whith<br />such bad picture quality!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|&#34;Return to Cranford&#34; reintroduces us to the main stable of Cranford characters, and brings several new cast members into the fold ... one things for certain ... given the &#34;quality&#34; of 19th Century healthcare, it is very easy to &#34;off&#34; any over-demanding characters (actor / actresses)!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Hello my name is andee and I'm in middle school. My whole family is obsessed with my little pony. I'm rainbowdash , my older sister Avery is pinkie pie.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|You can actually envision the journey through the eyes and heart of Pi.  This is an well written book that has constant movement.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I have recently watched the first seasons of two shows that I thought were really excellent. Both were way above what I have generally come to expect from television. The first was this show (Game of Thrones for those who have already forgotten what product page they are looking at) and the other was [[ASIN:B0038M2APA Justified: The Complete First Season]]. I do not think that it is a coincidence that both were based on novels (Game of Thrones was, of course, based on the novels by George R.R. Martin, and Justified was based on novels by Elmore Leonard). I think that novelists often have more freedom than television writers. They can make their characters more ambiguous and interesting and they can make their story lines darker. They do not have to pander as much and as a result, shows that base themselves on novels, wind up being way more interesting as a general rule (there are exceptions).<br /><br />That is certainly true about this show. The show has a whole host of really interesting characters. Way too many to list. The web of characters is quite complex but they are all drawn so well, each character is so unique and distinctive, that the viewer never gets confused about who is who. The show also has a pretty dark story line. I will not give any specifics away for those who have not watched the first season yet but the show does not shy away from allowing good people to die. The politics of the show are complex. It is really an adult show. Not only due to its complexity but also because there is a lot of violence and nudity. I applaud HBO for not ironing out all the complexity, or removing all the violence and nudity, in order to appeal to the widest possible audience.<br /><br />The complexity is really part of what makes this such an engaging show. There are so many characters, and the show shifts between story lines, and it always leaves each story line at a critical moment so that the audience is dying to get back to that story line. Sometimes when a show, or a movie, has multiple story lines going at once, some of the story lines wind up being way more interesting than others, and the viewer winds up feeling like they just have to get through one story line so that they can get back to the more interesting story lines. This show manages to produce multiple story lines (Robb Stark, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenarys Targaryen all have their own story lines) and they are all equally interesting and engaging. I have never seen a show that I thought was as successful in weaving various story lines together. That is part of what makes the show so addictive. Even when you are watching Daenerys' story line, or Arya's story line, you are eager to get back to Jon Snow's story line, or Tyrion's story line, etc.. It really is a fantastic achievement.<br /><br />I have not actually read the Martin books this show is based on but it is clear to me that Martin was successful in creating a really interesting and believable alternate world which this show brings to life. Watching the show is an immersive experience not unlike reading the Lord of the Rings. I doubt that any fantasy writer will ever be as successful as J.R.R. Tolkien in creating an alternate world but Martin deserves praise for what he has accomplished with Game of Thrones. It is the details that really make it feel like a genuine world. For example, the Northern wall, the new and old gods, the fact that Winter comes rarely and at unpredictable times, the various cultures, the death of the dragons, etc.. There is an entire mythology operating in all of those details. I am actually not a huge fantasy enthusiast. I have read very few fantasy novels, but I understand the appeal of escaping to another world, and this show allows the viewer to escape into another world for an hour at a time (or more, if you are like me, and cannot stop at just one).<br /><br />There are two more things that the show does particularly well. First, it sets upsome really evil villains. All of the Lannisters, with the possible exception of Tyrion, are genuinely detestable. They are villains that the viewer loves to hate and the hope that they will eventually get their comeuppance is more than enough to keep the viewer watching. Second, the show sets up some really interesting mysteries. What is happening north of the wall? Are we going to see the White Walkers? Are the dragons going to return? I love it when shows set up mysteries like that. I don't think I have ever watched a show that has been as successful as this one at creating a sense of unrequited anticipation in me. I am dying to see the White Walkers. The fact that we just hear stories about the White Walkers, without seeing them (at least in the first season) was genius. However interesting the White Walkers wind up being if, and when, we see them, seeing them cannot compete with the mystery (What are they?).<br /><br />The show is extremely addictive. I have to be careful starting an episode because I can never stop after just one. Or two. Or three (let's be honest). This is certainly one the most interesting, and well written, shows I have ever seen. Here is my advice to television studios: make more show adaptations of novels. You already have a solid set of characters to start with, and a story, and the show is almost guaranteed to be edgier and more interesting than anything that was developed for television (there are, of course, exceptions, like Breaking Bad, which I have heard is quite good and edgy). The success of shows like Game of Thrones, Justified, and Dexter (which was also based on graphic novels) prove that audiences crave good writing, interesting characters, and dark story lines, and are willing to follow shows with some moral complexity and ambiguity. So that is my advice for television studios. Here is my advice for viewers: watch this show! (unless you hate good writing, or are too busy saving the world to be sucked into an alternate universe for a few hours at a time).some really evil villains.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Why do I have to finish these books so quickly! They keep you entangled in their suspense and aching for more!
1481130331|5.0|Most of us are too young to remember the events surrounding the chaos of World War II. We read about dry dates, names, and places in history books or learn it in school.<br /><br />In his novel The Luck of the Weissensteiners, Christoph Fischer brings the events to life. He takes the two-dimensional, flat as cardboard, facts and through his inventive prose and his thorough knowledge of history, Fischer explodes them into stark, realistic, compelling life throughout the pages of the book.<br /><br />The symbolism of the book ensures not only does the reader enjoy the book on the surface, but also the reader's mind leaps along the stepping stones of important themes, including stereotypes and prejudice based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, and mental illness.<br /><br />In the story, Wilhelm, who works in a bookstore, is attracted by Greta, who is an avid reader. She shyly informs him she is Jewish, which her family has hidden from the census records. Although Wilhelm accepts her at first, he later turns against her in the wake of propaganda and widespread prejudices against the Jewish people.<br /><br />This powerful story will stay with its readers forever, and encourage close examination of thoughts and convictions.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|[This is copy/pasted from my review of 'Delphi Complete Shakespeare' since it's all equally valid]<br />I wouldn't claim to have read the whole thing - it's virtually a lifetime's work to do so - but what I've seen of this collection is well laid out and extremely readable. One thing though: if you're using a Kindle (as most people probably are) you have to 'go to' -&#62; 'Location' and enter '2' to get to the content menu so you can actually choose whichever novel or short story or play you want to read. Once you figure that out, the collection is near-perfect I think.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love reading all of these books, I wish they would be more of them considered for movies. The movie got me reading  the books, ten so far.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book is a historical account of the HeLa cell origin. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family add life and color to this story.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I agree with other reviewers that the writing is excellent, and the stories are hard to put down. I finished the first book and began reading what I thought was Clash of Kings.Many pages later I realized I was reading A Dance with Dragons. On my Kindle book 5 immediately follows Book 1, as the blue progress line at the bottom indicates. There are no page numbers let alone book titles at the top of the pages. So I must finish book 5 and find my way back to book 2. This combination of five books is a concept which failed in execution.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a good entertaining and somewhat thought provoking book. Great character development. The end could have been stronger. But a good read
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have heard so much about the Downton Abbey series and was afraid I might be disappointed.  I definitely was NOT!
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|This book nicely tied a lot of loose ends together from previous books in the series. As always a great read.
0307476073|5.0|Literally - I read this one on vacation, at the beach and the pool.  It is a captivating story, well-written and a pleasure to read.  I found the descriptions of the hiking experiences to be the best experience of reading it.  Strayed's brutally open recounting of her personal/intimate experiences and state of mind were a little TMI for me, but undoubtedly felt cathartic and necessary to her.  A good book from multiple angles.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A fantastic,yet guilty, pleasure! A great way to spend a rainy afternoon.  Great writing, great, costumes, great acting, great set dressing.  A good eye for period detail.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I loved this movie! (Even though I'm  18...It's a good movie for adults too! And I'm sure children will love it!) I loved seeing all my childhood friends the Easter bunny, Santa, the tooth fairy, sand man, the scary boogey man, and especially Jack Frost all meshed together in this cute movie about believing and finding what's deep inside your 'center'! I've always loved Jack Frost as a kid and every Christmas watched (and still watch) every Jack Frost Claymation movie that was out there! He had always been my favorite childhood character and I'm more than happy to see him back in action in this day and age in one of my new favorite movies!<br /><br />This movie was funny and adorable, and absolute keeper I recommend to the old, young, and everyone in-between!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Pretty good movie. It wasn't lacking in action at all and there are a couple of plot twists that you just don't see coming
B000SFD21Q|5.0|My brother in law teaches PE and recommended this. I'm a therapist and work with people to try and build a life worth living. This book is such a great illustration of how powerfully our physical condition impacts the rest of us. I recommend this highly.
B00701L5XS|5.0|COVERS KNOTS FOR ALL ACTIVITIES FISHING, BOATING,ECT  EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE VISUAL ANITIMATED KNOTS WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE KNOW BEING TIED.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great just wish there was more levels cause it is very addicting and if you start playing it you won't stop till you get to the last level I couldn't put it down
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I originally downloaded this game for my kids but I ended up playing it!  Great game for any age the kids won't be disappointed.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|She loves this movie to no end and it's been her favorite ever since it came out. So, I go this for her since she didn't yet own it, and she loves it to no end! The discs come in perfect condition and was very well packaged. I would recommend this to anyone who loves this movie! It's worth the investment :)
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great movie that helps teach the younger, modern generation why analog rules. Not only do you get to hear it but you get to see the equipment used and the people behind the scenes that made some of the greatest hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very entertaining.  It is basically  a treasure  hunt where you look through various objects to find clues in order to open the door to \\"escape\\".  Very entertaining; I cannot wait for more levels.
B005J7K950|5.0|The soundtrack really adds life to the already great cinematic story telling. Pop Star power in this soundtrack (check it out) !!! The sounds and songs really give it a modernized mass appeal which is intended for those who are not really into silent films. It's hard not to get into the story with all this ear candy thrown at you. Some of the sweetness is overkill but it works with the overall feel and attitude that this movie presents. Fritz lang is on Point with the amazing production design, camera work and story telling. However,  I'm not sure if this version is close or far from what fritz Lang intended. I think some scenes were moved around and some added and some removed but the movie's imagery and themes remain impactful to the end. Hard to believe Germans could watch such a film and let the holocaust happen as this predates WWII, 1927 (a crazy thought ). I could see Disney execs watch this version (GM 1984) and popstarify their future productions.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|One of her better ones. As interesting as some of her first books. I give this one a 4 star rating.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So addicting keeps u up all night an its a really great game for the kids to play with eachother
0547564651|5.0|What an interesting and great read if you have an interest in what goes into making a successful child. Well worth it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This novel kept me engrossed, lots of twists and turns that kept me guessing how it would all end. A good read not a great one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game that takes some thought, but doesn't frustrate you or drive you straight to a walkthrough. Onlly on level 5 so I hope there are a lot more levels.
B007SGM084|3.0|First book didn't capture me until around Chapter 10, but then I was hooked straight into 2nd book!  Felt like she was trying too hard in 3rd book.  Thought author right-clicked for the thesaurus one too many times!  And ok, sex sells, but jeez, c'mon......after the first book of sex, I just kind of rolled my eyes and wanted to get to an actual story!  Realized too late this book was actually just written for the sex, not for any kind of interesting story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a fun game for kids all ages it is so fun you get to play with friends or play alone. You get to buy characters and power with the coins you earned.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|This movie was LOOSELY inspired by the fairytale. While the storyline is marginal at best, the special effects were excellent! Otherwise I would have given it about a 1 or 2 stars. Watch it for the special effects!
B001EC3JME|4.0|I have a &#34;coast px25&#34; flashlight that I carry for work.  It came with it's own holster but it's a belt loop holster only and I needed a holster that can be used with or without a belt.  The Nite Ize LHS-03 is ~5/8 of an inch longer and ~3/16 of an inch wider than the manufacturers case which keeps it compact in size.  It takes some effort to slide the light into the case at first but after about a week it became easier, maybe just a learning curve.  The flashlight can be pulled out from the top or bottom of the holster but is held tight enough that it won't slide or move on its own even if you are climbing through access hatches and bumping into things.  One thing to keep in mind is; if your flashlight has the activation button at the but of the light, to remove the flashlight you will either have to push it out with your finger on the lens or on the activation button (unless you have a draw string attached).  The flashlight fits tight enough in the holster that if you push it out by the activation button you will more than likely turn the light on when you push it out.  The clip on the back will allow for a belt to be run through or it can be expanded (no tab so with difficulty) to fit over the belt line of the pants.  Overall, I like it and I would buy it again.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a master story teller. Poignant and majestic, he transports you to Afghanistan, and makes you believe you have been there when you have n't!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|And still more thinking with every sentence<br />One should read this when big decisions have to be made<br />Just go and try and leave the outcome to the fate.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Great for listening at work....which is where I mainly listen.  Love the songs.  Love the tempo.  Am looking for some of the artists own CDs because of this soundtrack.
145210655X|4.0|Cute book about Darth Vader and his very real interactions with his son.  Any Star Wars fan who is also a parent will enjoy this.  There is no plot..no deep meanings....just a cute little book that will bring a few smiles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this app all the time!! Its very fun and great for horse lovers like myself!! This is why i rate this app 5  stars!(:
B004L9MFM2|5.0|A rather confronting book but each time I picked up my reading I was there in the action.<br />A very interesting kingdom - I'm glad I don't live there but that was makes this book so<br />entertaining.  It's like the red queen in Alice in Wonderland &#34;Off with his head&#34; or fingers<br />or anything for that matter, heads on spikes - you've got it here.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|doesn't work on my kindle,nor shows up as downloaded. Not working at all.I have doubts about this app. and feel cheated..
B002XTBEDI|5.0|A sequel to this series needs to be done.  Seemingly ordinary lives aren't always so ordinary after all.  Love the town & countryside, the horses, etc.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Great mix of hard to soft throughout the CD.  Pleasantly surprised at Robert Pattison's song.  Love this CD to wake me up on the drive in to work.  Am looking to buy artists' own CDs due to this great compilation.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is awesome.  It has an excellent plot and creative story line.  All of the actors are well &#34;suited&#34; for the show.  The only complaint would be the use of language.  It is not necessary to use certain words to get the point across.  WE are intelligent enough to realize you are conveying that you are angry with out using God's name to convey that you are really angry or to emphasize a point.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The app is good. It's perfect for viewing vids and even better for downloading them. I look forward to updates
6305922756|5.0|Greatest spoof ever.  Listen carefully to the lyrics. Continue through the credits.  Well-crafted and superbly acted with irony dripping from every scene.  Several great cameos.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|When I went to see this, I was being paid by the other side to do so and take notes.<br /><br />I still left on Kenner's side...
B005544TRQ|5.0|The actors have great chemistry. The script is mediocre but has dry humor and sarcasm that I like. The only real flaw is getting past the \\"no degree\\" thing. It's too unbelievable the shows are worth watching.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Excellent movie! I have watched it many times! I love Johnny Depp but the whole story, cast and plot were excellent! I liked everything about it! Hope there will be a DS II!
B002DW92T8|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. A really intriguing look at the latest research on what makes people tick - and the conclusions are sometimes very surprising! Well written.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have seen this movie at least four times. I like the photography, content and all the actors do a great job. I am waiting for the next one!
1781162646|5.0|Devin Jones in his 60s now, but in 1973 when he got a job as a carny at a North Carolina amusement park called JOYLAND, he was 21 and a girl named Wendy Keegan had just broken his heart. Stephen King's new novel JOYLAND is about that summer in 1973, about the job that Dev takes and the people that he meets and the mystery that he solves. Mostly, though, it's about love. As hard as Dev wants to hold onto Wendy and believe that she'll come back to him, everyone, including down-to-earth Rozzie Gold tells him that \\"she's in the past.\\" Rozzie, whose alter-ego \\"Madame Fortuna\\" is the carnival's fortune teller is the real deal and her assessment of Dev's love life is not the last true thing she has to tell him that summer. And finding out who murdered pretty Linda Gray inside the \\"House of Horrors\\" attraction is possibly the least of the things he learns while at Joyland.<br /><br />This book deftly merges mystery and horror, wrapping both genres around a kind of coming-of-age story. The mood of the book is in the vein of BAG OF BONES or PET SEMATERY, horror that begins as a sense of unease that morphs into an awareness of dread. The horror has a slow build and it begins with the reflexive revulsion Devin feels when he hears how Linda Gray died. That murder and the supposed haunting floats like a marine layer over the landscape of the story, and every now and again, the narrative returns to it. When Dev's friend Tom sees an apparition of the dead girl, his friends know he's not kidding because he's uncharacteristically quiet. And the thing that affects him the most is that she's holding out her hands with her palms up, as if saying, \\"Help me.\\"<br /><br />That pose of supplication is one of  the details that Dev's summer landlady mentions when she tells Dev the story and it strikes a chord with him as well. And he wants to see Linda Gray for himself, a yearning that an ill-tempered co-worker named Eddie Parks recognizes and mocks him for it.<br /><br />The foreshadowing of what's to come is laid out in a low-key manner, especially when it comes to Madame Fortuna, who most of the time is a Brooklyn-bred Jewish mother who likes Devin. We have no doubt that she has\\"the sight,\\" and when she tells Dev that he will meet a little girl in a red hat and a boy with a dog and one of them will have the sight, we know he'd better be on the lookout for psychic children.<br /><br />There's a deepening sense of mystery to what's happening here supernaturally, but that's not all that's pulling us through the story. There's also Dev's relationship with a mother and son he meets on his walks to and from work. There are some lovely quiet moments between Devin and the boy, and the joyous moment when Devin helps the boy fly a kite is wonderfully cinematic as well as truly emotional.<br /><br />But as absorbed as we are in Dev's world, we also want to know who killed Linda Gray and if he is still around Joyland. The clues are laid out in a smart way, with some low-tech research and the use of Speed-Graphics cameras, which are really accurate. (In the days before the internet, it was hard for cops to \\"see the big picture\\" so Dev putting the pieces together with thhe help of his friends is not that unlikely.)<br /><br />As always in a Stephen King novel, the story is populated by a large cast of characters who are beautifully rendered, even if they're bit players in the overall narrative. They come in all shapes and sizes and ages, from the college kids who staff Joyland to the assortment of middle-aged women who play pivotal parts. We love Devin's hard-nosed but soft-hearted landlady for her willingness to fill him in on ghost stories and for her soft heart.<br /><br />Madame Fortuna/Rozzie Gold is a GREAT character. Devin is too. He's a good kid and his heartbreak over the faithless Wendy Keegan feels real and it feels painful. He deserves more than nights spent listening to the Doors and Pink Floyd. (Rozzie warns him about spending too much time listeningto dark music, but that doesn't have anything to do with second sight; she's friends with his landlady.)  Like her, we worry about Dev.<br /><br />Dev is telling the story, so we know he will survive whatever is to come, but even though he survives the autumn of the story, we know that he is forever changed, just as the kids who battled IT were forever changed by their experience.<br /><br />The novel is episodic, and King spends a lot of time filling in the backdrop of the amusement park. Dev's boss Brad Easterbrook (another delightful character) is an old-time showbiz veteran, while many of his employees just see themselves as being heirs to a somewhat disreputable tradition of entertaining rubes.  (Dev is warned straight off he'll be fired is anyone ever hears him referring to the patrons that way.)<br /><br />Ultimately, this story touches our emotions as much as it piques our curiosity. This is not your usual Stephen King book in some ways, but at its core--where people always matter more than plot--it is classic King and a terrific read.to dark music, but that doesn't have anything to do with second sight; she's friends with his landlady.)

B001NHNG64|3.0|My second Jack Reacher novel (I'm reading them in order). Nothing special to be honest.

B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|What makes this film special can be found in numerous other reviews.  I'd like to focus more on picture resolution and the extras of this version of release so that those considering getting this Blu Ray version can make an informed decision.<br /><br />Resolution<br />Compared to the Fox Lorber version there is no comparison.  The Blu Ray version is much, much better.  I'm not sure how it compares to the Criterion version.  I compared it to the instant video version which Amazon gives you to view within the first 30 days of the purchase of the disc and the Blu Ray version is far superior.<br /><br />Various language overdubs<br />Japanese, English, French, Dutch, Castellano (Spanish), Italian.  I thought that the English voice overdubs was hilarious.  Unfortunately accent sounds Chinese rather than Japanese; ala Kung Fu movies.  The clown character's singing parts are hilarious!  The first time I heard it I busted out laughing because of the translation sounded so funny.<br /><br />Subtitles<br />It's a bit different from the Fox Lorber version.  I'm not sure which is more accurate.<br /><br />Extras<br />AK (1hr 11min)<br />Footages shot during the filming of this movie.  This is the best section of the extras.<br /><br />Akira Kurosawa: The epic and the intimate (41 min)-in French<br />Interviews of various French people who were involved with production of this movie.  There is also an interview of a French intern who assisted Kurosawa during filming.<br /><br />The samurai (52 min)<br />Discusses samurai's role in their times and various social and political roles they played.  Making of the samurai sword section is interesting.<br /><br />Art of samurai(41 min)<br />Interview of a Japanese art of war expert who discusses their armors, sword, seppuku (ritual suicide practiced by samurai) etc....<br /><br />Trailer<br /><br />Other than AK, other extra stuff are not as informative or entertaining as I had hoped.<br />In summary, I'm not sure if it's worth buyingthis version if you have the prior Criterion version since it also has the extra AK, if picture quality matches that of this Blu Ray version.  However, if you have any other version and you love this movie, it's a no brainer: buy this Blu Ray.  And when you need a good laugh watch the movie in English soundtrack!

B007EE4XKI|5.0|Written by a different Author but picks up where &#34;Immortal Coil&#34; leaves off. Sufficiently invents an entirely new character and back story to occupy a good deal of the novel. Its obviously part of a greater web of characters and stories that flesh out the STNG universe of &#34;Today circa 2012-2013&#34;.<br /><br />STNG in my opinion ran its course and stands alone as complete. But suppose for a moment that it had been cancelled or cut short much like the original TOS series. And we were left wondering &#34;what if&#34; the story had gone on.. what threads might have been picked up in the later years, reflecting the challenges of their times -- for the old TOS that might have been the 70's and early 80's -- for this group of stories it would have been the 90's and early 00's, except this story was released just last year in 2012 and is followed up by at least two more direct sequels already available. Its quite entertaining to &#34;Catchup&#34; with the STNG generation just as if they were still on Air today with new stories inspired by the events of today.<br /><br />David Mack is also a supreme storyteller of rare talent. He spins a yarn broad and deep, covering the scene but also the depth that people have come to expect from thoughtful science fiction. And he honors the characters and stories that have come before, never once re-inventing the wheel. If he has a flaw its that he never descends into silly cliche nonsense even once which makes the stories all the more serious.<br /><br />Its hard to speak of the tale directly for giving up major plot points.. but I will say this.. of all the books in this new universe in which STNG lives on, this is a corner stone.. and sooner or later you will come back to read it simply because far too much foundation building starts here.<br /><br />Enjoy

B003KGBISY|5.0|Brilliance of this film can be found in other people's reviews.  What I'd like to do is speak to those who have prior version of this film and are on the fence about getting this Blu Ray version.<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Resolution<br />Hands down the Blu Ray version is superior.  I have the prior Criterion version and compared them.  There is no comparison especially if you have a large screen TV like I do.  Small scratches you see in the old Criterion version are still there.  But, the picture is much sharper.<br /><br />Commentaries<br />New commentaries by 4 film scholars: each takes 1/4 of the movie and comments on filming techniques, behind the scene stories among other information to make this commentary entertaining.  Then in a separate track there is the commentary found in the old Criterion DVD.  Both of these run the length of the entire film.  I personally enjoy commentaries of this type.  So, this was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Disc 2<br />Akira Kurosawa (49 min)<br />This is a wonderful addition to this Blu Ray set.  Some of what it talks about are:<br />-How Kurosawa and 2 other writers holed themselves in an inn for 45 days to write this.  Kurosawa had each samurai's personality, how they'd react in certain situations all preconceived already.  He even had drawings of each character-each very much resembling the actual characters in the movie.<br />-How one of the last fight scene was filmed a day after a snowstorm (picture of that day included) and it had to be melted with water before filming!  And how cold it was for everyone.<br />-The actual screenplay/script-hand written.<br />-There are 9 total subsections that discuss above stuff along with other insightful info.<br /><br />My life in cinema: Akira Kurosawa (2 hrs)<br />An one on one interview of Kurosawa that covers various topics from his early years to how he came to become a director etc...<br /><br />Seven samurai: origins and influences (55 min)<br />Various film scholars discussing what samurai meant to Japanese culture, how prior samurai films portrayed samurai, and social/political background in which Seven Samurai was introduced to the audience among many other topics.<br /><br />Trailers (3 of them) and teaser (1).<br /><br />Photo gallery<br /><br />If you love this movie, whether you have the prior version or not you should purchase this Blu Ray version.

Disc 2 is absolutely great as well.samurai meant to Japanese culture, how prior samurai films portrayed samurai, and social/political background in which Seven Samurai was introduced to the audience among many other topics.<br /><br />Trailers (3 of them) and teaser (1).<br /><br />Photo gallery<br /><br />If you love this movie, whether you have the prior version or not you should purchase this Blu Ray version.

B0067EKYS6|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> Most of the critical reviews of Baz Luhrmann's new take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, 'The Great Gatsby', focus on its over the top production values. Here are a few samples of the type of criticism I am referring to: \\"a near-constant bombardment of visual over stimulation,\\" \\"mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch,\\" \\"anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing,\\" \\"all look and no feel,\\" \\"hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment,\\" \\"baroque, overblown, megalomaniacal spectacles,\\" (with Luhrmann) \\"less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste.\\"<br /><br />Aside from the hip-hop and unnecessary use of 3-D, Luhrmann's penchant for overindulgence didn't really bother me. In fact, one of the titles Fitzgerald came up with before settling on 'Gatsby', was \\"Trimalchio in West Egg\\"--referencing the obnoxious, ancient Roman 'noveau riche' businessman in Petronius' 'Satyricon', known for his wild orgy-like feasts. I'm not sure at all whether Fitzgerald would have actually objected to all those over-the-top, gaudy spectacles, Luhrmann proffers up here in his take on the 1920s 'jazz age'.<br /><br />Getting back to the critical reviews, only Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times actually has the temerity to suggest that Fitzgerald's source material is no masterpiece: \\"Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels, Fitzgerald's \\"Gatsby\\" is in fact very much a slender reed, a tragedy in a minor key.\\" I would go further and argue that Fitzgerald's main character is not fleshed out at all and woefully unconvincing. Hence, no matter how Luhrmann 'jazzes' up 'Gatsby' (whether successful or not), Fitzgerald's source material will leave any film director handicapped from the get-go, in attempting to successfully adapt the novel from page to screen.<br /><br />The Gatsby slow-moving introduction appears intentional, as the mystery behind the elusive tycoon, is built up. Again, the gaudy production values (the costumes, the old cars, the set designs) are enough to keep one settled, until the story really begins to pick up. One notes that Nick Carraway, an ordinary 'Joe', plays the part of the protagonist's only true ally. Carraway, the film's narrator, appears to be a stand in for Fitzgerald himself.<br /><br />Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Gatsby is introduced to Carraway, his social inferior, and then takes him on a tour of 'his world' the next day, setting out in his Yellow Duesenberg (let's not be too upset that this is a 1929 Duesenberg, and the scene takes place in 1922!). Gatsby of course has an ulterior motive: he hopes that Carraway, will help him reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Carraway's cousin!<br /><br />The problem with all this is Gatsby's character. Can you really believe any of it? It's obvious that Fitzgerald, through Carraway, creates an idealized picture of a ruthless gangster, who just happens to go goo-goo eyes over a woman he fell for, five years earlier, before his 'trial by fire', as a confirmed bootlegger . You would think a gangster like Gatsby would have modeled himself on a realistic character like Tony Soprano, who never had any compunctions about going from one woman to another, disposing of them at his whim, in rapid succession. But no, Gatsby is such a noble, mushy guy, that he pines for Daisy (a complete airhead who we learn nothing about) and will even take the heat, when Daisy is on the hook for vehicular manslaughter (at film's end).<br /><br />Another convenient strategy is for Fitzgerald (again through Carraway's perspective), to ignore Gatsby's dark side by failing to show us any of Gatsby's malevolent behaviors in the bootlegger's world, which allowed him to accumulate all his money, and rise to the top. What's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'<br /><br />Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral. Why in fact should we feel sorry for Gatsby? If in fact, he resembled a fleshed out, real person, then I could have easily felt some sympathy. But the truth of the matter is that Gatsby exists only in F. Scott Fitzgerald's imagination. There is no attempt to create a real-life person here and isn't that what 'art' should be about?<br /><br />For those who say 'Gatsby' is purely a fable, I say a good fable should reflect 'reality'. Despite being a master of descriptive phraseology, Fitzgerald's characters are the stuff of cheap melodrama: a 'softy' sociopath with a heart of gold. Don't feel sorry for Gatsby as Nick Carraway does at film's end--and don't put him on pedestal. Break out some of your old Soprano DVDs--if you want a true portrait, of a REAL gangster!at's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'<br /><br />Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral.

There is a plan, send a team to this runaway comet and blow it off course.  Or.  Break it in two and create a bigger problem.<br /><br />As disaster flicks go, this one is pretty sedate.  By sedate I mean dead slow, and weirdly calm.  Which automatically makes this a strange film.  It is, after all, about the proposed end of the world not a picnic in the park.  When Dr. Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith) confirms the sighting of said comet by Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) he says, \\"well hello there little fellow.  Where are you going in such a hurry?\\"  Then he dies.  A whole year later, we're introduced to a small handful of people and all their cares and woes.  It's a soap opera that doesn't amount to much; none of these chosen few is of much interest.  As the solemn and somber President (Morgan Freeman) tells the world, continue with your lives, pay your taxes.  Don't be the least bit insulted if we chose to save a couple elephants rather than a few kids.  Hello, giraffes are more important.  The rest of you poor slobs, take the easy way out, pull a Vanessa Redgrave, doll yourself up and die off screen.<br />Talk about a SERIOUS non-action flick!  They saved the good stuff for the last few minutes (too little too late).  Did Mimi Leder miss the primer on disaster flicks?  Did she doze off during the part about suspense?  Tension, panic, trepidation, all were missing from this thinking man's version of doomsday.  I had to dig pretty DEEP to find even a fraction of excitement in the plodding plot.<br /><br />Not a movie I could watch more than once, so no point in keeping it.

Bill Karwin explains it so well in terms that the object guys I work with might be able to get it.  A violation of first-normal form is &#34;jay-walking&#34; because you're avoiding the intersection (table.)  I cringe when I see a self-referencing relationship.  It looks so simple and elegant on paper, but it's usually the first step on a journey to a bad outcome.  Bill Karwin calls this a &#34;naive tree&#34; and presents several alternatives.  I wish I'd had the next three chapters about ten years ago when we created a persistence framework at work that used surrogate keys everywhere in a concrete to the bottom implementation of object graphs with relational intergrity turned off. If you're not a data guy or an object guy, you have no idea what that last sentence was about.  If you are a data or object guy, buy the book and read it.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is the third book in Sylvia Day's Crossfire Series. IMO each book of this series just gets better and better. Just before this book was released, it was announced that there will be two more books in the series SO it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone that we didn't get an ending any different from the first two books. Picking up where RIY ended, Gideon and Eva are now forced to carry in their relationship in secret. Gideon struggles with trying to figure out what his actions will mean for himself and his relationship with Eva. Eva wonders if they will always have to look over their shoulders. Eva has no one to talk to, she cannot share Gideons secret with anyone. Her friends encourage her to move on but they don't know that she is still devoted to Gideon. I really don't want to give too much away but Eva and Gideon have so many hurdles to tackle in this book. The book dragged a little for me in the beginning until the plot starts to unfold and then I was sucked in. Eva deals with several family issues and her ever straining relationship with her mother. She also fights to find her place in the world. Gideon wants her to come work for him but she tries to make him see that she wants to make it on her own. We see more of Cary and the cluster eff that has become his life. Some characters resurface and I cannot wait to see what happens in book four. If all goes well, it should be released before the end of 2013. I know the first day it was released a lot of people were complaing about the ending and how things weren't wrapped up. Maybe I took the ending easier because I knew there was going to be another book. Yes the ending left me wanting more but so did BTY & RIY. So much happens in this installment and their relationship grows to new levels. Cannot wait to see how the next book unfolds.<br />- \\"You were with me. The whole time.

B005LAII62|2.0|I found this movie more than a little worrisome.<br /><br />The filmmakers created a dark and nasty world populated with angry abusive characters.  The prime victim of the piece is poor Norman Babcock who is consistently picked on by all and sundry, family members included.  If the message of this piece was one of tolerance they achieved the exact opposite.  The clear message here is that in order to gain acceptance (as a freak/outsider) you have to first prove your worth (in this case saving a town).  Otherwise, you aren't accepted as you are.<br />This movie made me uncomfortable and not a little queasy at times in the way it seemed to revel in the cruelty it inflicts on this one character, doubling the effect by equating him with a little girl who was murdered centuries ago for being a witch.  To make matters worse, they force a showdown between these two victims, that reaches grotesque proportions of brutality, pain, and suffering.  That one sequence alone made this film the very thing it `seemed' to condemn, making one wonder if it was condemning or promoting intolerance/hatred.<br /><br />No one should have to `prove themselves' to be considered worthwhile; that should be a given.

B000000OSE|5.0|This is the real thing - 30 slabs of savage rock `n' roll. I had selections of this release on a tape many many many years ago, but it left off 10-12 numbers that I'd never heard until I finally finally got both CDs. The funny thing is that I couldn't get Use Your Illusion in any shop in Singapore, I had to ask my wife to bring them back from Japan with her. Go figure!<br /><br />I love all the songs. Use Your Illusion I (gold color) starts of with \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\", not a great to song, but it does have a great bass intro, like so many of the band's best songs (a punk layover - Duff played in punk bands, which tend to enjoy using the bass to set up songs). \\"Dust N' Bones\\" is a weird, slow sleazy groaner, whiskey-soaked, really perfect, although maybe Axl does lay the experimental vocal stuff on a bit thick (some of it sounds like Tuvan throat singing - what is this, the Mekons?!?). \\"Live And Let Die\\" is the inexplicable Paul McCartney cover... well, it sounds okay, but I tend to skip over it a lot, since it is very repetitive. \\"Don't Cry\\" on the first disc is nice, sorta, but over-played (especially since we get a second version of it on disc two (I can't tell them apart, maybe need a few more listens - musically they're identical, but with different verses and vocal metre...). Nice, I should try the same thing with my band, just burn a bit more studio time. \\"Perfect Crime\\" kicks out the jams, sounding screechy like underdeveloped songs from the 1986 EP, while \\"You Ain't The First\\" is some sort of weird cow punk novelty song that wouldn't quite feel out of place on the Doctor Demento show, her yuck. Hey, it's a double album, lots of room to try goofy new things, no reason to write a tight, punchy album like Appetite For Destruction. But it's still a fun-enough song. Hah. \\"Bad Obsession\\" is sleazy slide guitar-fuelled harmonica rock, also something a bit different. \\"Back Off Bitch\\" is a catchy song that rocks and steams. Nazty \\"bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch\\" thing happening at the end of that. Very dramatic. \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\" is a groovy tune that nearly sounds like it could have been on Appetite For Destruction. Great solo, love this song, especially the Spanish guitar at the end. Unfortunately, it's followed by the annoying \\"November Rain\\", with its orchestras, backup singers, grand pianos, seas of roses, and all sorts of other crap. Well, whatever. Confusingly, this is followed by two songs about gardens - \\"The Garden\\" and \\"Garden Of Eden.\\" The former starts off less praising, but then Alice Cooper comes in and it gets sinister. Nice. \\"Garden Of Eden\\" is high octane, but not all that nice as Axl jibbers and jabbers and chatters. No matter, all of these songs, whether they're good or not, have a sensationally blustery Slash-driven solo. \\"Don't Damn Me\\" is a damn good song, even without the weird cartoon-character-getting-hit-on-the-head googly sound Axl makes at the beginning. \\"Bad Apples\\" gets off to a jazzy start before hitting out into some wicked honky tonk (this album sometimes sounds more like a Rolling Stones album than a Guns N' Roses album somehow, y'know?) \\"Dead Horse\\" is a catchy song that starts off mellow and then gets blazing. Nice. The last song on the album is probably the best - \\"Coma.\\" It is also the longest, and with its tricky ending probably also the most challenging to perform - legend has it that the band only performed it four times (one of which was captured for the Live Era CD). Simply and spooky intro, weird drama through voices of medics and nurses, more drama with sighs and snatches of dialogue as the dying Axl Rose's life flashes before his eyes (and our ears). The breathless singing at the end is really a wonder to behold. Who would ever want this 10 minute-long song to end?happening at the end of that.

B000000OSG|5.0|Use Your Illusion II (blue cover) starts off with \\"Civil War\\", probably one of the all time greatest Guns N' Roses songs, and the first one I heard from this album. Great use of lines from \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", awesome acoustic intro, whistling, bass, low-key singing, before the song goes mental. Better than \\"You Could Be Mine\\", which is saying a lot; not sure how I feel about Axl's \\"planning civil war\\" rap - how does it fit in? - but the song is marvelous. Next up, \\"14 Years\\" is sort of a parallel to the second song on Use Your Illusion I, \\"Dust N' Bones\\", although \\"14 Years\\" steps it up with a bit more life, a bit less sleaze. \\"Yesterdays\\" is a pretty little song, \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" is the Bob Dylan song... sorry, I just don't feel the magic. \\"Get In The Ring\\" is one of the best songs on the album in the way that it keeps you guessing what it's really about - first there are crowd sounds, then a sleazy little groove rocker, that picks up pace to some hard hitting rock `n' roll and some hate-drenched Axl lyrics, and a rant against journalists who print lies about Guns N' Roses, specifically Nick Wall of Kerrang, Andy Secher of Hit Parader and Bob Guccione Jr of Spin magazine, challenging them all to get into the ring to fight Guns N' Roses, which is \\"weighing in at 850 pounds\\". Good luck - I don't think anyone took up the offer (although Wikipedia says Guccione Jr did accept the offer, with no fight occurring). The song ends with a mysterious \\"... and to all those who oppose... well?\\" \\"Shotgun Blues\\" is a big piece of sass against some bad guy who pissed Axl off (old story by now). Great solo by Slash. \\"Breakdown\\" is one of those long, sprawling songs, with several musical sections, that proceeds well and nicely, starting off like a honky tonk with some piano, nice melodies, great singing, a wacky ending with all sorts of bizarre stuff coming from the singer, especially after the solo, \\"there goes the challenger\\", doing some sort of radio DJ/monster truck rally announcer schtick. Yes, the album is full of pretentious Axl moments and this song has more than its fair share, such as the closing words, \\"If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws, Rama provides wings to the dove.\\" Huh? \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" is a cool tune, starting off with some movie vamp, \\"the pearls of rock `n' roll decadence\\", or something like that. \\"Locomotive\\" is pretty funky and metallic, it rages and rages. The song also refers to \\"use your illusion\\" in its lyrics. \\"So Fine\\" is initially a lame pretty song, made interesting because that's Duff McKagan singing (an ode to Johnny Thunders!) the rocking choruses that follow Axl's pretty boy singing. It's a good, stripped down tune. It's followed by the bombast of \\"Estranged\\", which could easily have become another \\"November Rain\\", but it's a pretty great song, with four or five amazing solos from Slash. Love it. After that, another raging hit, \\"You Could Be Mine\\", which blasts into our memories via the Terminator 2 soundtrack (images of Arnie barreling down at us on his Harley Davidson, shotguns blazing, are quite awesome. Okay, then we get another version of \\"Don't Cry\\" (been there, done that), and then \\"My World\\", one of the strangest, most self indulgent tracks on any group album - Axl spewing ugly lyrics over an industrial beat and sound sampling the like of which has never been attempted on any industrial album, that simply doesn't suit Axl's shrill vocal chords. Apparently, the other members of the band had no inkling this had been dreamed up and were surprised to hear it when they played the CD for themselves for the first time.<br /><br />And why do I keep comparing this album to its predecessor? It's hard not to, especially when that album was the biggest-selling debut album of al time, at a time when having a smash debut is so rare (Van Halen, Boston... uhhh...).<br /><br />So, in the end, we must ask ourselves: how many of the songs on this album are as good as those on Appetite For Destruction?y announcer schtick.

I opened the game today after not playing it for two days and found that my game reset itself and deleted all of the progress I had made towards unlocking new restaurants! I am back to 0 stars and have to start completely over on my quest to unlock more restaurants. I also noticed while in the middle of playing, my screen goes blank and throws me completely out of the game onto my home screen! When I get back into the game, the progress that I had made is lost and I have to start that level over again!<br /><br />VERY DISGUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED. WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SERIES AGAIN.

B000PEX1IE|3.0|My son and I watched Ghostbusters. It was way better than I remembered it. Bill Murray's manic, madcap performance is totally hilarious, and the script is full of some pretty hilarious lines (most of them spoken by Murray). Harold Ramis is also pretty hilarious, which makes me wish I'd seen him in more films (he's also the legendary of some of the funniest movies ever - Caddyshack, Vacation and Groundhog Day).<br /><br />\\"Listen - do you smell something?\\"<br /><br />\\"Back off man - I'm a scientist!\\"<br /><br />\\"Do you have any hobbies?\\"<br />\\"I collect spores, molds and fungus.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's the bedroom, but nothing ever really happens there.\\"<br />\\"What a crime.\\"<br /><br />\\"Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.\\"<br /><br />\\"No job is too big, no fee is too big.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tell him about the twinkie.\\"<br />\\"What about the twinkie?\\"<br /><br />\\"Where do these stairs go?<br />\\"They go up.\\"<br /><br />And when they spot the Stay-Puff Marshmallow man:<br /><br />\\"There's something you don't see every day.\\"<br /><br />Nice references to Omni magazine (remember that one?) and a young Larry King.

B000000OU6|4.0|A nice little album that somehow manages to sound like sheer rock `n' roll without sounding obviously Guns N' Roses. It's Slash's own little recording (even if it does sound like Bon Jovi in parts, or maybe Mindfunk). Opening song \\"Neither Can I\\" is a nice little number, that starts off with mellow guitar and harmonica, with some groovy bluesy tuneage, before it cranks up quite a lot. \\"Dime Store Rock\\" is very much like a Mindfunk song, and the singing voice of Eric Dover (of Jellyfish fame) is sometimes a bit similar to Mindfunk's Patrick Dubar), it's a high speed rocker that sounds great, and has a cool, funky, psychedelic outro jam. Two great songs to open the album that come just before the \\"hit single,\\" \\"Beggars And Hangers-ons\\", which starts off with a bit of funky slide guitar-sounding weird funk. There's a Bon Jovi-esque opening vocal bit, and then that winning chorus. \\"Good To Be Alive\\" is sturdy rock `n' roll, as is \\"What Do You Want To Be\\", \\"Take It Away\\", \\"Doin' Time\\", \\"I Hate Everybody (But You)\\" (with its great lyric \\"If I end up getting screwed, well I might as well get screwed by you\\") and \\"Monkey Chow\\".<br /><br />\\"Soma City Ward\\" is a song that has a bit of a promise of a real Guns N' Roses riff, and the song is good fun and has beat (albeit some strange background vocals from the band itself). Great solo! \\"Jizz Da Pit\\" does too, sorta, and it has a great stomping beat... but it's just an instrumental jam-around! \\"Lower\\" is moodier and scummier, about drugs and all that. \\"Be The Ball\\" is a very good, clean, punky rocker, written by Slash. \\"Back And Forth Again\\" starts off with nice keyboards and acoustic guitar, and seems to be the only mellow song on the album.<br /><br />Gunners Gilby Clark and Matt Sorum contribute to this project, and Duff gets a songwriting credit on \\"Beggars And Hangers-on\\", although the main contributors are still the members of the band (minus bassist Mike Inez, who just played).

B00003003R|3.0|While the artwork is chock full of Guns N' Roses live concert posters going all the way back to the beginning, no show here is really earlier than June 28th, 1987 when the band played London (I don't know what the \\"93″ refers to, since the latest show on this release was September 4th 1992, a Houston show when they played Black Sabbath's \\"It's Alright\\"). Overall, there are more songs from 1992 (16 of the 21 total songs); most of the second disc is 1992 songs, although to be fair those are evenly divided between Use Your Illusion songs and songs from other albums (including the Black Sabbath cover, as a bonus). Many of the songs are highly faithful to their original album versions, while quite a few others are extended (in a good way, in the case of \\"Move To The City\\"); the only real failures are \\"Patience\\", which doesn't benefit from the added drums (and has some off-tune whistling courtesy of Axl, and an ickyly over-done version of \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", a song I wish they never covered. The band plays shows from Buenos Aires, Las Vegas, London (1987, 1992 and 1992), New York City, Paris and Tokyo (1988 and 1992). The Japanese version of the collection has a version of \\"Coma\\" (which they have reportedly only ever played live four times) from Omaha in 1993, so I guess that's where the \\"93″ in the title comes from...<br /><br />The magic of the show is the glorious crowd sounds, although when the band is wallowing in its most pompous and grandiose Axl Rose moments (\\"November Rain\\", Dizzy Reed piano solos, the reggae moment of the over-the-top \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", etc), the giant stadium crowd bellow reminds us of how over-indulgent and out of touch they were (or at least Axl was) during those years. Funnily enough, you don't hear Axl being the notorious goof that he is; to the contrary, he tells the audience not to get too worked up because they have a long concert ahead of them, that they were adding songs and extending the concert, and asking for people to take a step back so that those at the front don't get too creamed (\\"Phil, turn on the house lights\\").<br /><br />The album starts with an actual concert opener, where we hear the crowd, we get some wrestling announcer coming out sneering \\"You wanted the best? Well they couldn't fartin' make it. Instead, straight from Hollywood, Guns N' Roses\\" and a nice choo choo whistle, before the band launches into searing version of \\"Night Train\\". The first four songs are from the debut album and they just blister and are spot on, and \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", from a Buenos Aires concert in 1992, is near-perfect. So is Duff in his vocal turn in \\"Dust N' Bones\\". Strangely, the version of \\"You're Crazy\\" that they play sounds like an electrified performance of the chilled-out acoustic version from Lies, not my preferred version personally. \\"Used To Love Her\\" starts off with a lame opening \\"this is a joke song\\" excuse from Axl, the song is kind of limp. \\"Patience\\" doesn't really work either, from Axl's off-tune whistling, to the weird sound of drums coming in mid-song, and Axl's freaky extended moan and groan at the end of the song. That's followed by a Dizzy Reed piano bit, before the group breaks into \\"It's Alright\\", which is mainly Axl and Dizzy. Then there's another long Dizzy Reed solo before a particularly endless 12-minute \\"November Rain\\". \\"Move To The City\\" is quite magnificent, in a resplendent 8-minute version of the song (more than double the original) that has a long break with a great horn segment, then a cool organ and piano bit (followed, of course, by a blistering solo courtesy of Slash). Very nice!!! \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is pretty darn nice. There's a long delay on \\"Rocket Queen\\" when the band boogies for a while, and Axl does a bit of audience management - it works out nicely, because it is a great song to build up tension on. Wow! Slash does a bit of backup vocals, Axl at one point yells out \\"smile!\\" The solo's quite extended, with a bit of talk box guitarfrom Slash (or is it Gilby Clark?). \\"Sweet Child Of Mine\\" has a freaky deaky extra ending, when the band grunges out and Axl adds some extra \\"Sweet chillllllld... sweet chilllllllld.... sweet chillllllddddd...\\" Sounds kinda weird, actually... \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" is a regular big bad song, with some audience interaction, some reggae... a little bit of everything, really (and more of it!). \\"Don't Cry\\" is a pretty regular version of what's on the album (not sure which of the two it is, but it doesn't matter - it's just the lyrics that are different anyway). \\"Estranged\\" is the same, except for the bit where Axl introduces the keyboardist, \\"ladies and gentlemen, on the keyboard, Mr Dizzy Reed.\\" There sure is a lot of Dizzy Reed on this album, actually... he's also the only member of the band to be introduced (except for the horn section, which is not introduced by name, merely as \\"the Band\\", on \\"Move To The City\\"). Appropriately, the set finishes off with \\"Paradise City\\", with huge crowd roars and bombast at the end. \\"LAS VEGAS!!!!\\"<br /><br />The CD booklet is a fun little thing, with great early photos of the band, Axl onstage with cigarette in hand and tussled hair; it's cool seeing Izzy Stradlin still in the band. At one point you see a pic of Slash arching back more than 45 degrees, and you see a shot of his shoes - could those be the famous moccasins that he wore when he tried out for Poison all those many many years ago? (the moccasins actually cost him the job - good thing too) The most tantalizing thing about the package is the great gig posters shown throughout the booklet - there are 24, including some for \\"The New Hollywood Rose\\", and one that has them co-headlining with \\"the wettest, wildest bikini shake off of 1986 with a $50 cash prize to the winner\\".<br /><br />Only missing song - \\"Get In The Ring\\", which was sheerly written to be played live. I wonder if they ever did?from Slash (or is it Gilby Clark?). \\"Sweet Child Of Mine\\" has a freaky deaky extra ending, when the band grunges out and Axl adds some extra \\"Sweet chillllllld... sweet chilllllllld.... sweet chillllllddddd...\\" Sounds kinda weird, actually... \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" is a regular big bad song, with some audience interaction, some reggae... a little bit of everything, really (and more of it!). \\"Don't Cry\\" is a pretty regular version of what's on the album (not sure which of the two it is, but it doesn't matter - it's just the lyrics that are different anyway). \\"Estranged\\" is the same, except for the bit where Axl introduces the keyboardist, \\"ladies and gentlemen, on the keyboard, Mr Dizzy Reed.\\" There sure is a lot of Dizzy Reed on this album, actually... he's also the only member of the band to be introduced (except for the horn section, which is not introduced by name, merely as \\"the Band\\", on \\"Move To The City\\").

Why?!?!?!?!?!?<br /><br />Okay, it's pretty funny, and it has lots of silly scenes. I don't remember what I enjoyed the most, other than Belushi saying \\"Expelled? Seven years - down the drain.\\" (The other great line in the film is from Dean Wormer: \\"The time has come for someone to put his foot down - and that foot... is me!!). Great sexy, wacky scenes that reminded me of a big budget nutty version of M*A*S*H* (who dares to tell me that Animal House is better than M*A*S*H*, huh?!?!?). It even had Donald Sutherland (the star of M*A*S*H*) in it!!!!!!! Nice to see the film debut of Kevin Bacon, Tom Hulce, and Karen Allen (who, three years later, would appear as the love interest in Raiders of the Lost Ark... then nothing else of note). The social commentary is o-kay... Bullys, snobs, racists. Whatever, I deal with them all the time in real life anyway. Otis Day and the Knights not remembering the frat boys they played for, ha ha ha. Snobbishness and drunkenness. D-Day was good with his motorcycle, his Deathmobile; nice mustache, too.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some great extra features, namely an in-character documentary of \\"where are they now\\". Boon and Katy married and remarried: 64-69, 74-85, some time went by, Boon became a documentarian, they got married a third time, had a kid, Otis. Babs, tour guide at Universal Studios. \\"That's the table from My Dinner With Andrew and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, declared a national monument by Ronald Reagan; no one can eat on it again.\\" Dorfman - battled weight, then went on a diet of injecting the urine of pregnant women. Got into self-help through the \\"Am I Really As Okay As I Should Be?\\" movement. Savagely beaten by Mike Tyson, grew up spiritually. \\"Mike has an anger problem.\\" Still waithing to meet the right woman. Kevin Bacon becomes a right wing religious nut, saw Jesus in his food, went on self-righteous missions to Africa. Good for him! As Chip Fuller he wrote 100 novels in fie years. Wrist injury from typing. Robert Hoover, four kids, wife, two cars, has everythinga man can want. Los Angeles District Attorney called him for advice, chuckle. Dean Wormer still harboring anger against the Deltas even in an old age home, his wife is a lush in some dive somewhere, Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratten, successful gynecologist. D-Day, Daniel Simpson Day. The Yearbook - an Animal House Yearbook and documentary, gets real with the story. The producers had created \\"Laser Orgy Girls\\", which was like \\"Charles Manson in High School\\", so in order to make it they moved it to college. John Belushi had a plastic face, they do a skit on it. \\"No college would let us film our movie on their campus.\\" One in Eugene, Oregon fell for it, since they had regretted turning down The Graduate. The Deltas and Omegas, as actors, were put in opposing camps even off-camera. Elmer Bernstein scored the comedy as if it were a serious film, Landis' idea, as he had been childhood friends with the Bernsteins, and comedies have been doing it ever since (hello, Wes Anderson). First cut was 175 minutes, unfortunately we don't get a glimpse at the 60 minutes that they trimmed (AAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!). When they showed the sneak preview there was a fraternity convention in town, 80% of the audience was from the convention and it was mayhem. Bacon went back to waiting table, Belushi and writer Doug Kenny died.-righteous missions to Africa. Good for him! As Chip Fuller he wrote 100 novels in fie years. Wrist injury from typing. Robert Hoover, four kids, wife, two cars, has everythinga man can want. Los Angeles District Attorney called him for advice, chuckle.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  Not only is Diana an accomplished writer, but the story is very engaging drawing you into the plot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game is very fun! It is fun for all ages. You can earn money on This Game and buy surf boards and characters. It has a world tour going on and every time you update the game it goes to a different place. It is combined with the beach and the big city. If you ask me I would say defiantly recommend getting this game.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|Fun, game over all... but SO MANY glitches that ruin it. For example, I had a pimped out blademaster level 46 that would get owned by level 12s I. PvP or co-op due to the glitch that doesn't load your character's multiplayer stats.
B002OKGJUO|3.0|I really didn't care for an unauthorized  version, but the history behind the movie was more interesting to learn about than the movie....... Max stayed in character  through out the filming and was possessed by the vampire image.... there was a movie made about the director and actor that tells this story.  I do not know the name of this film, but i'm sure your research can find this??
B000000OQF|5.0|The idea of reviewing Appetite For Destruction in this day and age seems pretty silly, since anybody who likes dirty rock and roll has probably heard this album a million billion times. Perhaps I can make a few observations:<br /><br />- for certain moods, nothing other will do<br />- it's probably the best rock and roll album of all time<br />- it's awesome how some songs are either led by Duff's bass, or feature it prominently (his punk roots, where bass guitars are high and prominent)<br />- Stephen Adler was the right drummer for the band<br />- As a ballad, Sweet Child O' Mine is perfectly acceptable; the ballads on the band's later albums are generally unacceptable<br />- Night Train's lyrics are tops<br />- Paradise City is the best song on the album; I think it's pretty cool that they filmed the video while an opening band for Aerosmith; talk about opportunism!<br />- My Michelle is vicious; I'd hardly heard the song before, since it was not on the early \\"greatest hits\\" mix tape that I had from friends<br />- Think About You is a pretty decent rocker, but the production values are pretty cheesy during the choruses; I wonder if they ever played it live<br />- Axl's singing style on the album is generally still pretty unpretentious<br />- Anything Goes is an undiscovered gem<br />- Rocket Queen is probably the best album closer ever
0307887448|5.0|Really good read. I am sure anyone that enjoys video games, the 80s, film and all around geekery will enjoy this book.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this show and of course, I liked the DVD with it. The only remark -  in the box was damaged a fixture that holds the discs, and now that I open the box, they fall out. But the discs are great. I really love it! To the extent possible in the future I will try to ordering the other seasons.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Unlike his other two books, Hosseini has created a story in a very convaluted manner. Very confusing way of writing a story which is eventually connected. Take notes!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|i thought it was very good I really enjoyed it I have read most of his books always good read
B000000OQY|5.0|Probably the first Guns N' Roses song that I really liked was \\"Patience\\", probably also their wimpiest... but at the end of the day still one of their very good ones. I got a kick out of the video, the shot of Stephen Adler sittin' around with his drumsticks looking bored, nothing to do (there's no drum track on the album - they add it to live versions, which is just plain wrong!). Altogether, the album is a bit hollow, what with it only being eight songs, two of which are covers, one of them being a re-recording. Interestingly, the first four (live) songs were released before Appetite For Destruction when the band was getting restless about not having their dream producer and studio lined up so Geffen Records okayed a mini-release that looked like an indie release with its own fake indie label Uzi Suicide. Nice. Smart move, though, because by the time Appetite For Destruction took off like a rocket they had half of a new LP already in the can. Of the three new songs, \\"Used To Love Her\\" is a throwaway item, recorded in half an hour. \\"One In A Million\\" is one of those great songs that is both really subdued while being really angry at the same time. Sure it has those controversial lyrics, but I sometimes wonder if they even existed in the early versions, and Axl put them in later just to be controversial. I love playing \\"Patience\\" and \\"One In A Million\\" on the acoustic guitar, and not just because they both have Duff leading in with his \\"one - two - one two three four...\\".<br /><br />Of the other songs, it's cool to hear \\"Move To The City\\", probably the only Guns N' Roses song with a horn section (Slash writes about it in his book), and \\"Mama Kin\\" probably has the most sleazy rock `n' roll intro to any song ever - \\"this is a song about your fartin' mother.\\"
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Not at all consistent with the rest of the series. A sad addition to the catalog. Willis phoned it in, the action was garbage, and it just wasn't funny.
1608871452|5.0|This is actually one of the best books! Very beautiful, gorgeous decorated, very interesting, and every self-respecting fan of &#34;Supernatural&#34; must to have it. Thank you for that!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It's the best because you get to use  a original gun  that you can't find anymore. No other app has these kind of weapons
B002QNBRXS|5.0|John Lithgow is amazing. He can be such a sweet bear of a man, seemingly harmless. But when he turns on his evil side, his rage, he can be frightening. It was quite the serial killer dance between he and Dex.
B002361MLA|3.0|This book is an absolute thriller, a roller-coaster ride of spiritual enlightenment that will have you tearing pages out of it to get to the climax.<br /><br />It's also long and slow, mostly because it was telling me to shut off my mind.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I really like both of the main characters as well as all of the supporting cast. To me they have good chemistry on this show. Because it is CBS and not NBC, I have high hopes that the station will give this show more than 1 season. I look forward to the beginning of next season.<br /><br />I appreciate how they have taken Holmes and Watson's characters and made them into modern-day varieties. The early days of Watson developing under the tutelage of Holmes is quite seductive...it has kept me coming back for more in each episode. As well, I enjoy the fact that Holmes is shown as brilliant and yet flawed just like the rest of the human population (the flawed part, I mean).<br /><br />If you would like to be entertained and intrigued for about 45 minutes, take a bite of this crime drama series, one episode at a time. If you like it enough, you may end up getting the whole season. Enjoy!
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love this show and of course, I liked the DVD with it. The discs are great. I love it so much! To the extent possible in the future I will try to ordering the other seasons. Thank you!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It has COOLER ITEMS and u can do a lots more things :) you should buy if you r a fruit ninja fan!!!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Our family loves our dogs.  So maybe that is why we all loved the movie so much.  It was so great to see a G rated movie that adults and children enjoyed from beginning to end.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This is a great game!! Not only is it fun, but best of all You are not bothered by &quot;try me&quot;  annoying game advertisements.  Fun game!!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I was not expecting this to be really good, in fact I didn't expect to finish it.  Turns out, it was pretty good. Really enjoyed the movie.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Iron Man 3 follows on the events of Avengers Assemble. Tony Stark is trying to return to his normal life, but the stress of the attack on New York manifests itself in many sleepless nights and quite a few panic attacks. Sure, Tony can tackle problems like how to make his armor more compact and powerful but the problems of the soul are not his forte. He needs help. Being an alpha male, he doesn't really seek it until his back is against the wall.<br /><br />A terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been bombing various places across America and the world, accusing Americans of deceit, arrogance, and greed. The hits finally come too close to home and Tony recklessly demands the Mandarin come fight him. After his posh cliff-side home (and almost everything he has) is destroyed, Tony has to rebuild his life from the ground up.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Stark Industries and Pepper Potts are being courted by a scientific company, A.I.M., headed by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They are working on bio-tech but aren't too ethical about their practices. Killian had tried to get Tony in years before, but he hopes with new leadership at Stark Industries he can woo Pepper into a merger.<br /><br />The story moves at a good pace and is quite interesting. The dialog is fresh and fast. Performances from the cast are good and the action scenes are exciting if not overly imaginative.<br /><br />Fans of the comics might object to the handling of the Mandarin (who is well-played by Ben Kingsley) but I thought it was an interesting take on the character and worked well for the story. The theme it suggests could have been played up more in the film. The end of the film is a little robbed of drama by the more or less invincible bad guys fighting Tony and his army of Iron Man suits (which we saw in the trailer). Other parts of the ending just don't make sense. It's as if they used up the movie's quota of smarts in the first two thirds of the film.<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man 3 isa fun summer action film. It could have been smarter for my tastes but it's enjoyable nonetheless.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Picoult is good and the story was wonderfully paced. Good read when on holiday away from daily routine. Very enjoyable.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The first movie is about psychiatric medications and the possible side effects. The second movie is a murder mystery. Neither one of them is especially interesting. Anyone who has seen a few episodes of CSI will be able to figure out the murder mystery real fast. And Channing Tatum is only in the movie for about 30 minutes.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fascinating show. Keeps your interest and attention to the very end of the episode. And, has some ingenious funny moments too! Love the fact that the writers try to incorporate some of the original AC Doyle story elements but with modern twists.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A beautiful, smart game for those who appreciate the wonder of space, history and science. I need more rooms!!!  I can't wait t for more!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I enjoy the short \\"clips\\" of news and being able to choose the categories I am most interested in reading. Keeps me updated on the latest news items, trends in business and the latest results in a variety of sporting events.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Thought I was going to be laughing non stop, but it's more heartwarming than hilarious.  I liked the ending, not to cheesey
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was very helpful in publishing my own book. If you plan on self publishing, you should read it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a great book. It really keeps your interest and compels you to find out what happens to these characters.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Very authentic picture of the struggles women face when trying to have the big lives we want, when trying to be taken seriously for human beings with brilliant minds, and when trying to have all of the love and closeness we want as well.<br /><br />Perhaps Barbra Streisand's best performance depicting the particular struggles of sexism as a Jewish female in a time when Jewish women were not allowed to learn the Torah.......beautiful acting, singing, and directing.  Were it nor for sexism, Barbra Streisand would have won and Oscar for Best Director for this brilliant piece of work.<br /><br />Fittingly, Barbra was the woman to present the Oscar for Best Director to the first female to ever win that award, for directing the movie The Hurt Locker........go Barbra!!!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Nice sounds with beautiful color and graphics.  But the game is not very exciting for kids who need a little more interactive type experience.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is awesome and I like it because it got guns and teams and different people in it and it a good game when I play it and there is a lot of guns
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I have to say I read Mark's book, and was so interested I couldn't put it down many times over.  I finished it much quicker than I expected. Being an entrepreneur myselft, my main objective with this book was to read it over time to get a little inspiration.  But I found it very hard to put down. Very inspirational and full of great advice. Also a great book to come back and read when you need a lift.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|tHE BIRDS, IS A OLD CLASSIC, GOTTA SEE IT, IT SCARY AND ACTING IS WELL DONE!!!!GIVE IT A CHANCE AND GET OUT THE POPCORN!!!!
159102594X|5.0|I've been a fantasy book collector since the early seventies and I have well over a thousand titles in my library. This is my second book review.<br /><br />I'll keep it short since there are lots of other reviews before mine. I almost put this book down after the first few pages but I'm very glad that I read further. The characters are well-rounded. The story is earthy and riveting enough that I had to force myself to put it down (in order to savor it) time and time again.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are two more titles available that I intend to devour.<br /><br />If you are a fantasy reader that likes story's with a with a harder i.e. \\"realistic\\" edge I think you will like this book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great place to get up-to-date weather locally. Like that you can take it when traveling and watch for bad storms here in the south.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|She almost invites the comparisons to Jane Eyre, but you know what? That's a pretty daring thing to do for any contemporary writer. Yet bless her heart, she damn well pulls it off. I was completely hooked, the mystery worked perfectly and the atmosphere was carefully researched and thought out. I'll read her again happily.
B00AWD4I6C|4.0|One of the later Resident Evil's was on T.V. And when I figured out there were a couple before I decided I wanted to watch them in order. I found them all except this one the first. So I set my DVR to record the others and watched this one online.  It was a good series if you like this undead type of stuff. I liked it but my wife didn't.
0783225849|5.0|sCARY, HORRIFYING, BLOODY AND ONE TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!tHEY MADE OTHER pHYSCO'S BUT THE ORIGINAL IS THE BEST!!! I PROMISE!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read<br />Sex is better and hotter than 50 shades<br />You will want to read the whole series<br />Perfect vacation read
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 2 1/2 grandson loves it and is learning about what it takes to grow food. He can understand how the rain helps, etc. I would recommend it to anyone with a 2-3 yr old. Good for a quiet time.
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Pink is great.  This album does not fail.  She is a great artist.  Glad I bought this and got a great deal on it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A wonderful book about memory and family ties and relationships.<br /><br />The fable in the beginning sets the tone for the rest of the book
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved this film!  It did a great job of following the book - and I was amazed at how well the film was able to reproduce the special effects portrayed in the book!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This games moves slow and can freeze up sometimes but overall i enjoy playing this game when i have time.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|It is fun to see back stories on movies we have loved for a long time.I think we all wanted to know how the witches got wicked
B008B3MZNI|4.0|Great to see Supertramp perform so many (18) great songs from AND during their golden era, esp many from Crime. They are all really great musicians. Cool to see these guys in action. Would have like to have seen drummer Bob Siebenberg a little and more of the bassist, Dougie Thompson. Who would have known that John Helliwell likes to ham it up? The concert lighting crew was a little schizoid, but thankfully the video was NOT edited so that it jumps around too much.  Picture quality was like 720p at best and I didn't really mind that. The sound was mixed well but I thought that the high end was really weak. Is the CD like that, too? I don't have DTS-HD, just DTS-ES, but still....  kind of slopes off above 3KHz. That I minded but still a great concert. Not sure why Eagle Entertainment didn't EQ it a bit in the mastering process. Ah, if I was king of the world. Oh well!! LOL!!! Enjoy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining- Cast of Characters great! Clean script and well performed- Hope it is renewed for another season<br />and thanks for having it available to prime members so we can watch all in one sitting if we so desire-
B007HUD6OS|5.0|The Theodore Boone books are very good. I feel that all ages would enjoy these books, men, women & children.
0670014893|3.0|The usual crafting of plot one can expect from LeCarre. But this one seems a little thin in comparison with many of his previous books. The characterizations are probably the weakest point. You don't get a reasonable picture of these people. But he makes his 'grand point' that is behind the story. For LeCarre fans it is, of course, a must read. But if you haven't ever read LeCarre, this is not the book to start with.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|it is so helpful for my son to play this as we wait for appointments and such I love the game too! we have a ball
B005775OBG|5.0|Rod Redline is difficult to find so I was happy to get this car...wish it would have come separately because we already have a few &#34;Finns&#34;...good price and fast shipping!
B00124PXW8|3.0|The film has dated heavily, though Max von Sydow's performance (which makes most others in the movie look wooden) remains persuasive and brings a rare depth of humanity into a silly melodrama.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent end to a wonderful series. I hated to see it end but the ending was heart warming. More like this would be great.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Very nice effects and great acting help, but the storyline is disjointed to the point of being hard to follow.  This movie doesn't hold together like a Slaughterhouse 5; a few fewer jumps with more plot development in between would have helped.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is so much fun. I haven't gone to halls to play but this hand held fun has to be just as exciting.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Be careful about this game for the world's scariest monster has been sighted<br />This is a very dangerous action be warned
159463176X|5.0|Stifling a tear, nearly choking on a catch in my throat, I close the book after reading the last page of AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED, the most masterful family saga I have ever read. It is full of richness yet it is not a happy story. Khaled Hosseini has mastered the monumental task of dissecting in story form the multiple layers of emotion, pain, sorrow, joy and blessing that occur within family bonds. His story is not overly sentimental or intentionally complicated, yet somehow he manages to lay bear the intricate weaving of lives and experiences that bind us together with our relatives. No one else can bring such happiness. No one can destroy with words the way family can. No one can change the course of our lives in this same way.<br /><br />This is an incredible story, broad in scope, but narrow in focus. I was sorry to see it end. Abdullah and Pari will live in my heart forever, as if I personally experienced their loss. Nine chapters, told from eight different points of view, woven together by a single tragic event in time. Hosseini explores the ways family members honor, love, betray, wound, and sacrifice for each other. I understand a bit more about my own family dynamics after reading about this family.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Thanks Amazon!!  I always enjoyed this movie on TV, but it was so cut up with commercials and interruptions I wanted it for my library.. YAY!! Scored big on this buy!!!
B004J4X32U|4.0|Really practical and useful information. At first it doesn't seem that the simple techniques and actually talking- not reprimanding or yelling would work with kids, but they do and to very positive results.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The story continues and is dragged along a bit but teens will identify with typical scenarios and you can't help caring for some of the characters.
0316232955|4.0|The ending is the biggest plot twist ending of a book I have ever read and I could go on forever about how much it pissed me off. The rating is docked an entire star because of it, oh my god. Chris Colfer, what were you thinking?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was just an incredibly entertaining book.  While a bit choppy, once I started I couldn't put it down and I'm not normally a fan of the genre.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as powerful as his previous novels but still the best book I've read this year. A moving look into the lives of immigrants and a look at the way families interact across continents and generations. Highly recommend.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app functions fantastically; I freeze freeze less on my Kindle than I do on my laptop. I only wish it was easier to update, but I still highly recommend this app if you enjoy BB on your computer.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is so cool if u like ww2 weapons or just love GUNS this is for u and it will eventually update
B0037QM8YA|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS GOOD BUT ITS VILE, PRECIOUS GETS BUTT RAPED QUITE A BIT BY HER DAD WHOM SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN BY ONE OF WHICH HAS DOWN SYNDROME, DAD ALSO GIVES PRECIOUS H.I.V. ALL THE WHILE MONIQUE [PRECIOUS`S MOM] BEATS HER UP DAILY.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Mama loved the beautiful scenery of the English countryside and of course the garden itself. Glorious film and ageless, timeless, legendary.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|A great flim from the early 40's. Cary Grant and Kathern Hepburn at they're very best. A must watch if you like films of this era.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Downloaded knowing it was going to only have 4-5 levels. Quite enjoyable, pretty easy levels that took maybe 10 minutes to complete like a trial game. I look forward to additional levels to be created. Good stuff guys.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is the woman you want to be friends with and go out for drinks with after work. She's smart, cool, and just as witty as she was on 30 Rock and SNL. My favorite part of the book is when she brings her family to NYC for the holidays. I, too, have learned the hard way that you can't force people to love life in a big city, even if you put on a smiley face and beg them to love it!<br /><br />She did a great job of connecting with the reader. It felt very personal without being overwhelming or sappy. It was great to laugh out loud and I hope others will do the same when they read this book!
B0091WNK8M|3.0|I thought this movie was great back when it came out and I watched it with my two small children.  I watched it again recently and still thought it was a good flick.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|I know with all action movies you're required to suspend belief in the plausibility and not take them so serious.  But there are times when you just can't  stop from rolling your eyes. Individually these are some of my favorite actors (thus giving this movie an extra star).  Together.... Eh.  Bruce although playing the &#34;cool, calm, quiet assassin&#34; type seems to be just going thru the motions - been there, done that . Helen has her moments but whenever she fires some gun you giggle knowing she'd really be knocked on her ass. Malkovich plays his usual crazy.  The &#34;Weeds&#34; actress was the hardest sell.  Yes she's bored and sick of the life she's living, just wanting a little adventure, but she's too excepting of all the chaos that has come to her door.  Clearly some people liked this movie because there's a sequel coming, I just shrug &#34;why?&#34;.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|pretty interesting characters and plot .. of course Jude Law and Channing Tatum aren't hard to look at .. and for the guys .. the twist on the female lead characters will have their attention im sure .. lol .. overall entertaining
B009NY43NY|3.0|She pretty much included everyone from the series, but some just weren't necessary.  Thanks for wrapping it up for me.  I have loved the series, but this wasn't on the same level.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is my introduction to Megadeth, a band that has been considered one of the Big Four of Thrash Metal, who has been keeping metal alive throughout the years, and who have featured a number of musicians coming and going. This is a pretty solid album. I can definitely see why this is a classic. Dave Mustaine has a very distinctive voice and is one heck of a guitarist! Marty Friedman is also a noteworthy shredder! Dave Ellefson is a solid bassist! I can hear him even through all the guitars! (However, I find the bass to come through more on Iron Maiden's remasters. This one comes through, but not as much. Just listen to the Aces High remaster and you'll hear Steve big time!). And Nick Menza does an outstanding job providing the beats on here! Definitely some GREAT moments for this lineup!<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. Holy Wars... The Punishment Due- This starts off mercilessly and quickly gets your head moving! The riffage on this track alone impressed me immensely. It made me wonder why I had never checked this band out before! The melodies that come in over the riff are also noteworthy! The opening 1:27 intro just totally grooves! Then Mustaine begins singing and the song definitely takes off! The drumming on this is brutal! It just adds to the confusion! I knew that Thrash Metal was a lot heavier, but this is just amazing! However, having been unimpressed by Metallica, I wasn't expecting this to be much better. I'm glad I was wrong, this is more aggressive than the stuff I listen to, but it still has the melodies I love hearing! This opening song goes by quickly actually because it is actually a little on the progressive side! It is filled with different passages and shifts and let's not forget the many solos on this! Then towards the end, it picks up pace. It started off aggressively, but at midtempo and then became simpler in the middle, but then it turns into a shred-fest with some powerful and aggressive drumming! This is a definite classic song!<br /><br />2. Hangar 18- This one starts off with some interesting sounding guitar chords. Then gets to some guitar melodies and some drum fills. It then eerily grooves along and then it becomes a nice, melodic riffing song! This song was the first one I heard from Megadeth, but I was kind of thinking the rest of the album wouldn't match this song. This one is filled with so many riffs and so many guitar harmonies and melodies that I was afraid the rest of the album wouldn't match it. I was wrong about this too! While this is a better track, there are more songs that are just as good. This one's many melodies and riffs all sound really good and then it shifts gears to a very grooving backing section with lots of trading off solos between Mustaine and Friedman. Menza keeps a very good groove going in the back and Ellefson is lost in the mix at times, but he is providing us with a good amount of bass groove too! The soloing on this one is very aggressive and very thrashy! Great talent and skill showcased throughout this whole finale! GREAT song! Classic!<br /><br />3. Take No Prisoners- This one starts off with an intense riff and some very fast drum work and it's just an all out shred fest! I do like this one! It's very aggressive, yet it retains melody which is something I hold very high in metal music. Dave Ellefson has some soloing in this song! Some interesting bass riffs exposed as solos! This song is one of the album's fastest! This song did take a while to grow on me, but it is a solid track! The solo is killer! It's intense, but it's still melodic! Very nice song!!!<br /><br />4. Five Magics- This one is very brooding at the beginning. Some very eerie bass and guitar work going on to create and atmosphere until a very cool guitar lead comes in. The song then grooves along with some very good musicianship and guitar grooves. This song is one of my favorites along with the 2 opening tracks. I really like the harmonizing and leads that go on throughout this song! After the slower melodic intro, the song kicks off aggressively and is a very heavy song with some flash on-off soloing between Mustaine's vocal phrases. The drumming here is very cool indeed! I like Nick's approach to this song! The chorus on this one is very good! It's one that you start off singing along to then you instantly start headbanging to it once the instruments come in (since the first part of the chorus is bass and vocals only). I really enjoy this song because it's progressive in nature with lots of different ideas going on. And then of course there's also the shredding factor and the very flashy solos. These guys really put on a good show with this song! The ending soloing is very impressive! Good song!!!<br /><br />5. Poison was the Cure- This song is alright. It's not terrible, but it isn't essential either. It's just kinda there. I wouldn't call it filler because it's not bad. I just don't care for it much. It just doesn't capture my attention.<br /><br />6. Lucretia- This song starts off with a very melodic riff. I LOVE this riff. I like the song, but the riff is definitely my favorite part of the song! That and Nick's drumming on this one! I do indeed like this song! It grooves very nicely! Mustaine is singing rather high on this song and it sounds good! I don't mean high like Bruce Dickinson or Rob Halford high, but high for Dave's register. This song is something that gets your head moving and is still melodic enough to hum along to! This is definitely a classic song in my opinion. I could see this one being a crowd-pleaser live. Overall, nice song!<br /><br />7. Tornado of Souls- This song is another faster song! The opening riff is just SICK! It's very melodic and very sweet! This one sounds very good vocally for Mustaine. I'd say that this is his best vocal performance of the album (with Holy Wars being the second best). This song has a very grooving, brooding chorus, but the action is in the very thrashy and mean sounding verses! The guitar work as usual is way beyond that of your average metal band and the drumming one this one has some very sweet fills in places! I honestly enjoy this song a lot! I wish songs like this were in bigger supply. This song has a band that is playing together and well. They sound like they're having fun on this song! It's a very flowing song and it's very enjoyable to listen to! I Mustaine isn't the best vocalist in the world, but nobody could've sang this song better than him. Period, this song is PERFECT! AWESOME SONG!!!<br /><br />8. Dawn Patrol- This is a short, kinda humorous track. It's basically a bass line playing with a drum beat. Mustaine is using a hilarious and ridiculous voice. He is basically rapping and it's kinda funny/entertaining to listen to. It certainly beats Lil Wayne's rapping! This isn't a serious song, but for what it is, it's pretty entertaining *chuckle*<br /><br />9. Rust in Peace... Polaris- The drum intro on this song is just SICK!!! I LOVE IT!!! As a drummer, this is the kind of stuff I live to hear! The opening musical section to this is awesome! This song's groove factor is just phenomenal! This is one song to headbang to! The guitar parts are pretty good through and through and the drumming is top notch! I love songs with triplet feels and this one is no exception! There really isn't much to say about this song, it's a classic song from a classic band on a classic album! It's a straight up classic! You probably don't even need this review to tell you about the song! The riffs are outstanding, the drums are very technical for this time period, and the musicanship is stronger than you'll find on most 90's albums! Until the very last minute, this song is much more vocally-driven, but then it's more jam/groove oriented until it closes off the album very nicely!<br /><br />Yes, I do have the remastered reissue, which means I have 4 previously unreleased tracks, 3 of which are demos of songs on this record. I personally think all four of these tracks are throw-aways. The demos, while interesting, are demos for a reason; they aren't the final one and aren't as good. And My Creation, which is just an unreleased song up until now, isn't all that special in my opinion. Maybe long-time Megadeth fans will appreciate it, but I'm not very appreciative of these bonus tracks. The original 9 tracks are all this album needs. :)<br /><br />Verdict: If you like metal, buy it. Buy this album and let your ears have a taste of melodic fury. This is a classic Thrash album for a reason. It just rocks. I constantly see Metallica's Master of Puppets listed as the greatest metal album of all time...and after hearing albums like Iron Maiden's Powerslave and Seventh Son... and this Megadeth album, Metallica is probably the most over-rated metal band ever. So if you think Master of Puppets is good, just buy this and prove yourself wrong!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved this app! Kept me intrigued! I felt challenged enough to keep playing. Didn't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game keeps you thinking. You really can't ask for much More out of a free game.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|One of the best movies of 2012. The movie came in three days. Inside the box is the blue ray disk, and the DVD disk, as well as a Ultra Violet product key for the Digital Download. Its well worth the movie. I highly recommend it.
B004R1Q296|4.0|A surprising amount of typos in this book. Like the editor didn't feel like reading it. Very in depth book. Good content though
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Not as good as season one. Starts abruptly with considerable time lapses between episodes which the viewer is left to figure out on their own. Same basic story lines between characters seem to drag on forever.
B001R59KR6|4.0|This movie was inspired by the experiences of Nancy Wake who was dropped behind the lines in France.  She led a large group of resistance fighters against the Nazis.  This movie is good in its own right, but does not hold a candle to the true life adventures of Nancy Wake.  The scenery and settings are magnificent.  The English accents are at times hard to understand.  Leaving out the real life of Nancy Wake, the movie is very good drama.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've watched these types of shows since a young child and have always been fascinated with the English culture.  The English are so disciplined and self-controlled.  (I suppose since I didn't have a very structured upbringing I admire their consistency.)  Yet, at the same time, they are tender hearted and filled with compassion, it's all in the way they handle crisis that I admire.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app. is a app that has held up to every word that was described in the breif summary of facts! I have a mytouch Q... and it works good! Thanx a lot for this app
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|It's ok.  I love Jeremy Renner the man is an athlete & an actor.  So the emphasis on it being a &#34;period&#34; piece is only held up by the costumes.  The period language, accents (unfortunately American) are across the board with each character.  Then the vocabulary is across all sorts of generations.  The weaponry is a lot fun ;)  The story is pretty good.  Glad I watched it on Roku verses seeing it in the theatre.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I like this app as an alternative to Google reader.  I liked that it automatically imported everything TomTom my Google reader. The only drawback is that when I mark everything as read in a blog they all disappear. In Google reader it would just gray them out but you could still read them. If it fixed this it would get a five star rating.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This is by far the least creative, most poorly acted, and worst edition of the &#34;Die Hard&#34; catalog.  That said.  If you're looking for b rated action flick, here you go.
0761925538|5.0|This book is very clear and well-written. I personally am working on a publishable research case study and have found this book to be invaluable. I would suggest this for anyone from Undergraduates to Ph.D.'s working on case studies!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|It's good, Josh Brolin is amazing, quite the accomplished actor.  The story line is a one where it's flash backs & present day are the format.  I'm glad I rented it verses seeing it the theatre.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show with great cast and a good story line. Hope to see the next season up on amazon soon.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to people who like diary of a winpy kid or just likes comedy because there are some funny parts
B005XQLBU4|5.0|his game was awesome I loved it it was incredible. Its so good like candy. Tastes like candy so much fun and yum yum bubblegum!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|awesome app<br />must get awesome puzzles very challenging similar to 100 floors if you like that kind of thing perfect
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is one of my top five favorites of all time. I find his writing style to be awesome and probably the best read I have ever seen. His prose is superb. This is what science is suppose to be. It is a classic.
B000005JA8|5.0|What can be said of the music on 'Trout Mask Replica' that hasn't already been said: Music from another time or era?; Music from a person who wasn't interested in standard musical forms?; Music that stands the test of time?  All three of these are true, but I'm putting my money on the last.  This is a must have / listen for anyone interesting in move the needle forward in Music.  Wonderful.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie for the whole family and even better on Blu-ray. Such a poignant story line with beautiful/stunning visual representation throughout the film.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read other books about near death experiences and always wondered if some of he religious belief impacted their experience . It was great to read it from a man with scientific training. Easy to read and the story line has a good psychological view point on other personal issues.<br />I recommend reading it.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|The dog show clearly beat them so they would not get tied down with a contract that would interfere with them going off and doing another contract with Simon. They have great voice and the sound is glorious.
B005HS00V4|5.0|The sign of great songs are they are timeless and can be interrupted many different ways.  This disk supports that.  Each song played with an orchestra and minimum backing vocals really showcase the songs themselves.  A must for any Peter Gabriel fan or one who follows this wide and varying career.
B0091X2K0A|4.0|If you love war movies, this will open your eyes even more. Even though it is an old one, if you have served your country you will find many resemblances.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addicting and fun but not so hard you want to quit and give up - my 9 year old daughter also enjoys the challenge! Look forward to the next levels.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If Nathan ever agrees my wife will of course run off with him. We enjoy his humor and the character of castle being a writer and getting into the middle of it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game. Lots of levels. Easy to understand. Didn't need any instructions. Would recommend this to any gamer. Simply great!
B009CF7GRY|3.0|I love the dance related movies and by reading only the title I was thrilled about it. But it didn't come out to be the awesome movie. Acting was mediocre, story over told many times previously by much better actors and producers.
0439023521|5.0|Great book, pretty intense at times but that's what makes it so poignant. I found the story timeless and well written.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|The finale of old mans war. We return to the world of Major Perry and come to understand a hero we love and a complete picture of the world he is in.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|why is there no batman in this batman movie?  explosive concrete in the whole city?  and what's with the prison pit and the rope and all the prisoner's chanting for him to escampe.  just another dreary batman movie.  the final drop of inspiration has been sucked out of the idea of batman.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is a unquestionably a pure Quentin Tarantino film.  If you enjoy his movies you will love this one.  If you do not you will leave disappointed.  Be warned that this is a truly violent film with a lot of racist dialogue.  That should go without saying, but I have had a couple friends be surprised.
B00000DGUY|5.0|A CD full of great oldies that I love listening too.  It reminded me just how good this group were.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|If Nathan ever agrees my wife will of course run off with him. We enjoy his humor and the character of castle being a writer and getting into the middle of it.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great game! You must play it if you want a tower defense game. I played on flash and now I get it on my Kindle :)
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Funniest film to ever feature a foul mouthed teddy bear. Our daughter is terribly disappointed that we will not let her watch this...yet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Update this app to 0.8.0 I mean the pc is on 6.1.2 way not have made it the same version so update it please
B0067RQYNW|3.0|Does what it suppose to but I learned quickly I wont be righting a book on my kindle. Its more about the hardware than this software.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Best album since the good old CCR days. Not sure what to expect but was very pleased. Nice job John
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved this book as I have all whole series. I can't wait for the next book now! I will recommend this to everyone.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|For anyone who loves sci-fi this is the end all be all show. It is smart and funny with lovable characters(for the most part, Kavanaugh) and compelling story lines. The five seasons of this show are simply perfect. Anything you could want in a sci-fi show is here.<br />For this particualr season/streaming, the quality is great! The season may not be the best of the five as it took to the end of this season beginning of next to truly get its legs it is still a fantastic season!
B003L77FYS|5.0|If Nathan ever agrees my wife will of course run off with him. We enjoy his humor and the character of castle being a writer and getting into the middle of it.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|The Emperor's New Groove is a rare Disney product. Sure, it features the basic Disney morality trope at its core, but the film features a grown up sensibility and it doesn't pander to the tykes. The humor is very much in the vein of those 30s screwball comedies, with Eartha Kitt giving a knockout performance as the evil Yzma and David Spade has never been funnier to me than he is as Emperor Kuzco. All these years later I still find it laugh out loud hysterical Disney movie. The Blu-ray release is once again of those cheap thrown together packages that saddles the film with its heinous sequel and without any special features. But the actual Blu transfer is a beauty! Fresh and clean, it is certainly an upgrade over the old DVD copies. There isn't much in the sonic field, since this was less of an action movie than what Disney had been doing at the time. However, what is there is crisply accentuated and comes through quite nicely in my home surround system. No question in my mind, I made the right decision to make this a part of my Disney Blu-ray collection!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I had a lot of fun working these out. Great for problem solving. Wish we had more
B0086VWCPG|3.0|If you're a walker or just want  to track everyday walking its ok. If you're a runner it doesn't give you the ability to glance at you're wrist such as wearing a garmin to get a instant picture of you're progress, speed, distance without messing with you're phone.I upgraded to the Pro version and have been unable to connect to facebook after many tries, I finally reinstalled the free version. I do let the program run but also rely on my Garmin.
B005L193RO|5.0|It taken so long time to finished read this book because of my poor ability for English, but this book gave me the more grips to finish this book.<br />Because this books strategies makes me more happy and I could keep mind to finish to read this book!<br />Thank you! Shawn!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great for talking with friends and relatives and FB friends.  Also good for games and keeping up with birthdays and events!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Love JJ Abrams and watch everything he puts out.  This was not his best movie, but it was cute.  Sort of like ET was for my generation, Super 8 is made for this generation.  Predictable, adults have no clue, kids rule the day.  Good fun though!
B001NHNG64|5.0|The second book was better than the first. Love these books! I was worried that it wouldn't be as good in third person, but I was proven way wrong.
B001XV09UG|4.0|This was again awkward to watch, but it was intriguing.  Awkward to see Cruise & Kidman in such candor..,being that they were in fact married at the time of filming.  Now, I still find it awkward.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Pretty good.  That's why I gave it three stars.  I most likely won't watch it again but I'm not sorry that I watched it in the first place.
B005AUWY90|5.0|I love this movie its great for kids and adults , very intertaining and easy to share wiht my friends and thier family. thanks
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so cute. My entire family plays. Thank you guys for this.<br /> I could and do play it all day
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Every good book should be experienced, not just enjoyed. It should leave you questioning everything while being okay with not ever receiving an answer. That was this book to me.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|A classic!  This should be on everyone's list of books that they have read. Kurt Vonnegut is one of the greatest authors.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|Halle Berry makes a great cat woman! I had remembered movie reviews that had turned me away from it, but decided to give it a chance anyway. It's a really good movie and I'm only sorry they didn't make a sequel!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Yeah its not CD or MBDTF but was it supposed to be? I gurantee everyone hating will look back on this album years from now and see how ahead of its time this album is
B00821OX98|4.0|I love this series. I take it at face value and that is a Science Fiction TV series. I think the dynamics between the two main characters is great but I am not expecting much more.
B0090YHSFC|3.0|This is a timed game that teaches you to quickly solve the puzzle. It's a lot like Fruit Ninja. My grand kids liked it.
1609611543|5.0|After reading this book and eliminating wheat from my diet I now enjoy greater flexibility in my joints! Gluten is bad; educate yourself, go ahead buy it add apply it principles. You will be glad you did! Weight loss is a plus too!
B007SGM084|4.0|Well done , it was very thrilling and kept me glued to the pages !  Looking forward to  another just like it! Read it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I bought the book for Kindle because I wanted to be able to look up some of the words used.  Also, I had the book from our library but wanted to slow down my reading speed to enjoy and separate the wonderful characters in the book.  There are so many great stories in the book.  I am sad as characters exit and would like to hear more of the experience and life.  I think this book could have easily been at least 3 books.  The style of writing is engaging and the characters are really interesting and well developed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great relaxation ap and has enough customizable features to make it work for me. It's a great way to destress, meditate, get to sleep or keep you company.  I also use it (with ear buds and the Wi-fi turned OFF) for those tense moments of take off or landing when on a commercial flight.  Nicely done!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Great for lighting your charcoal. Lump charcoal works well in it also. I use sheet of newspaper with shredded paper from paper shredder in the middle of the balled up newsprint with a little lighter fluid on it then add charcoal. Works like charm!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Another great game from G5! Challenging without being frustrating. Worth the price even at $4.99. Story line and graphics keep you interested. Hard game to put down until you getto the end.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|When I installed this app I thought it would be good. Boy I was mistaken this is the WORST APP EVER!!!This APP DOESN'T EVEN LET ME PLAY!!Please save your money for something way better than this
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and I love it. It's got a good variety of sounds to personalize for relaxation, sleep or even meditation. Now when I travel I don't have to take a sound machine along to drown out hotel noise so I can sleep. I leave my kindle plugged in when I use this, so the battery isn't worn out in the morning. I also use it (with ear buds and the wi-fi shut OFF) to get through the tense moments of take off and landing when I am on commercial flights.  Great ap, Nicely done!
B005544TRQ|5.0|A friend of mine told me to watch the show and since episode one I couldnt stop watching it.  .
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love to play with this when I am tired and don't feel like concentrating on anything important.,  It is really fun.  I recommend it for adults as well as children.<br /><br />Lis
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|Safe Haven is a movie about a young woman who is running from her past and lands in Southport, North Carolina where her bond with a widower forces her to confront the dark secret that haunts her.<br /><br />I know this is based on a novel but I am not familiar with that so I cant say how well it was translated from the book to the movie.  I do know that the author played a role as a producer so that should help with following the book.<br /><br />Thinking this was your typical chick type flick, I wasn't too excited about watching this movie but I decided to give it a chance after hearing good things and see what it was about.  The movie at times was a little slow moving but had some beautiful scenic shots of North Carolina.  The little girl that played the daughter also was a bright spot as she seemed to bring some cuteness to the movie as well.  I felt the \\"bad guy\\" (Played by David Lyons) in the movie could have been acted a bit better though and to me was the weak point.  I just felt that he didn't play very well the drunken jealous abusing husband and that it could have been done better and more believable.  I just didn't think he played it angry enough to make me believe that he was going to do what he did in the movie.<br /><br />Even though the movie was slow at times, the ending to me made the movie a decent one to watch.  Even though this movie goes into your typical happily ever after type ending, this one has a bit of a surprise at the end that gives it something different than your run of them mill romance movie.  I won't spoil the ending for you here but the ending makes this movie a decent one to watch, especially with your significant other that will surely make her cry.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I got this for my Kindle fire and it was fun but not for very long. There is serious game lag which made it difficult to do well.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the intertwining of lives and his skillful presentation of how one act of one person can have profound effects on the lives of so many others.  Skillful writing, deeply emotional.i was able to become emotionally absorbed in the many connected stories and simply had a difficult time putting it down.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Jack is soo good you always know he will win in the end, , always turns up at the right time is too smart
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Excellent and easy read.  I love this author. I read this book over  a long weekend and could not put the book down.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and it's a great ap for getting news. I like to read what the media in other countries has to say about what's going on in the USA and the world. It's always good to know the perspective of those outside our own country. The graphics are GREAT and it loads thumbnails first so you can pick a section with the type of news you want to read ie US, World, Tech news, Science, Health etc.  Of all the news aps I have on my Kindle, this one works the absolute best. It's user friendly in ways the other news aps like USA Today and ABC could learn from.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this sleeve it doesn't unzip all the way so you can just read and keep the cover on. I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the case that also was like a stand.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book first and waiting for this to be released on DVD before viewing it. The movie stays true to the book and depicts it very well.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Was told by a friend that this book was so good.  I was very disappointed!  The characters were lame and the story predictable.  Boring!!!!
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a neat little flying game, and one I've kept on my Kindle for a long time. Game flow and graphics are decent, good for teaching strategy and spacial relationships. Busy enough to be fun.
0783225792|5.0|Very happy with my purchase of Casino. I would like to recommend it to others if they like to collect good movies..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Was looking forward to this book, after reading his first two.  His first two were better,but still entertaining.  Summer read
B007HVBW2A|5.0|The atmosphere is loaded with suspense from start to finish with very artistic renderings of visual foreshadowing. Plus the acting and character development is top notch. The special effects are a bit antiquated but very well done for the time of the production.<br />This is a true American horror classic.
B00499NHLC|5.0|These modern BBC versions of Sherlock Holmes are much better than I thought they would be.  Even though Cumberbatch is a little over the top at times with his caustic interpretation of Holmes, the tenor of the genius is retained.  Ending the season on a cliffhanger is enough to suck you in for season two.  Highly recommended...
B000P0J09M|5.0|Another good movie with Robert De Niro as usual.  I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others for viewing.
0553801473|5.0|This book was good.  So far I've enjoyed the whole series.  I thought it was going to be the last, but it's not!  Now I'll have to wait for the next to see what happens.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies now on bluray!! The older movies obviously show their age but they sound great!! A fair amount of additional bonus material is included and entertaining.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is Stephen Kings best writing yet.  Great storyline.  Especially appealing to us older folk who remember the 50's and 60's.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Ending was short. Should had a brief summary how they where able to get out of Yemeni. I enjoy the John Corey cataract because of his street smarts.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie.  I watched with my 8 year old and he enjoyed it!  I think he'll want to watch again and again.
0756655307|4.0|Great book to have and reference. It provides information on the more obscure characters and some unknown facts on the more<br />popular ones. I just wished that they were a little more detailed, but still a good book.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|It's a great game in all but I just wish it would download faster kids love it and so do I ,I do recommend it
0988936402|4.0|Huff uses an upbeat and captivating writing style throughout this novel and combines it with a story that you can really get into. He creates a phenomenal world that he shows you rather than telling you about it. Through it Huff takes the fantasy genre and runs in circles with it. You become drawn into this world, just like the characters are. You're also kept guessing, just like them. This technique really draws you in and keeps you going.<br /><br />Above all, Huff's storyline is as structurally and fundamentally sound as his writing. He has a forward progression to the story, each event leading up to the next. He also illustrates the interconnectedness between the events and characters, however separate they may seem at the time. By flipping between characters and places Huff is able to show many perspectives, including the ability for good and evil to switch sides and the lines in between the two to blur. He does, however, keep everything quite clear through minute changes in writing style and tone. Combine all of this with the author's descriptions, which are complete and awe inspiring yet worked right into the body of the story without interrupting the flow, and you have a captivating whole.<br /><br />If Huff's very approachable writing style draws you into the novel, his characters keep you there. A variety of characters and their personal stories intertwine and combine to create a unique and intricate whole. Each is uniquely developed to suit its purpose in the story, while becoming a well-developed and realistic individual.<br /><br />With this story Huff incorporates all the elements of a typical fantasy tale - mythical creatures, magical realms, war of good vs evil, etc. - into a story that can't be compared to anything I've ever read before. It was a fun and quick read that was a phenomenal escape from reality and I can't wait to read the sequel.<br /><br />Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest revieweview
B00CBKLO52|5.0|A whole lot of fun. Real fun learning controls.makes me mad I didn't get a real plane. That of change tonight.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is exactly what I needed! I was torn between getting this cheaper bag, or the Canon brand bag. I'm so glad I chose this one, it ended up being exactly what I needed for all my lenses, camera, flash, etc. It all fits neatly in the bag in separate compartments, and everything is very easily accessible. The quality of the bag is pretty decent. I think it will hold up for a few years. I don't expect it to last much longer than that, but I think thats worth the price I paid for the bag.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I'm having fun with this app after discovering a game that was new to me on a flight to LA~a new obsession :)  a no stress game to play by myself!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game!! I always played BTD 3 on Coolmathgames.com so when my friend showed me BTD 5 on the computer, I knew I had to get it on my kindle fire. It works awesome and it is so addicting!! BUY IT it's worth the money!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun and entertaining. Addictive.  Have it on my fire and phone. Glad I am on vacation. My wife has already taken the lead.  Plan on catching her today.  I'm more for speed and flipping.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|While the premise is interesting and some of the action is great, there are long peiods of dialog that do not add to its entertainment value.  It's confusing what is going on throughout most of the movie.  Disappointing!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was really, really good. It was very different from the other romances I have read.  I liked how it was from the male point of view and you really felt like you were getting into how this male thought.  I found it very, very funny and entertaining.  If you like romance novels and are looking for something different, read this book.  I would like to read more romance books like this.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|This was a really good movie. It held our attention and has a good story. I highly suggest watching it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella. This book had me laughing out loud and wanting to read more an  more. Highly recommend it! Especially for a nice light read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It can take a while, but I love it!<br />I'm not very good, but that is ok. I don't like tycoons, but this is fun.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this because it's convenient and helpful. I can use it to balance my checkbook and refer to my online banking since its on my tablet.
B00138CRFY|4.0|I'm a huge Dylan fan, but somehow this album slipped thru the cracks. I just listened to it, and it is clearly the first sign that Dylan would come out of his slump and create great music again. Some real gems that I had never or rarely heard.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved this book. The characters were easy to love. There was a part in the middle where I found I lost interest a little bit but couldn't put the book down the last portion of it. Highly recommend.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really like this iron man game!! One of my things looks creepy it's a glitch but still is awesome. One of the best games I`v played on my kindle fire HD
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully told story of family loved and lost and found again, the hardships they faced, the heartache and sometimes denial.  Truly beautifully written.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too easy, not too hard... just right. I allowed myself to escape from one room (sometimes two) each evening as sort of a &quot;cool down&quot; before settling down to read my book or catch some zzz's. Not so difficult that I felt stressed and couldn't relax, but not so easy that I was bored. My only complaint would be that I want more rooms to escape!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The writing in this book is excellent!  It is eye-opening, intriguing, heart-breaking and heart-warming. It gave me insight into worlds I only hear about.
B009R659L8|4.0|THIS BOOK KEPT YOUR INTEREST TO THE END. IT TOOK ME A FEW PAGES LONGER THAN USUAL TO GET INTO IT BUT THEN I WAS HOOKED. I ALWAYS ENJOY HER BOOKS.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the visual, and that it can be modified. It works well with my kindle fire, and performs as advertised.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I love this!  I have been an Eagles fan since my college days in the '70s and continue to love this band today.  The documentary with all the interviews and perspectives of various band members and others in the music industry gives great insight into the years the band was developing, how they got started, the rise to stardom, and their break up.  The 2nd disc is about individual paths since the break up and the story of getting back together.  Both CD's have good music snippets.  The 3rd disc is of a concert in 1977 and I could watch it over and over.  You will not regret buying this collection.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've tried some other white noise apps in the past to help me fall asleep and stay asleep.  This is the only one I've really had success with, though.  I really like the ability to be able to mix sounds so that I can have exactly the right combination, and the binaural beats seem to help me fall into--and stay in--a deeper sleep for a much longer time than I've been able to otherwise.  I highly recommend this app!
B000YENUI6|4.0|Don't watch in front of your grandmother or small children.  Sweet romance buried in the<br />gory and white slavery parts
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The show is interesting, always exciting and well done.  The characters, the scenery and the staging - all excellent.  I'm always looking forward to seeing the next episode.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesome game  but I hate the missile. Do not use all  Your crystal.They are hard to get .unless you parents buy them for you.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|Great soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has become the new master of epic super hero scores. Can't wait for more of his work.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game always reminds me of my girlfriends and how they always ran away from Mexico your big deal about the snake tracks every day to the preacher finds unusual unusual snake tracks every time you are in northern Texas and defeat defeat this deadly snake to protect the preacher to be share their lives
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Most of the DVDS have two episodes and if you choose the menu selection you can read the title and a brief synopsis of the episode. This information is also on the inside of the jeweled case. The digital remastering of analog tape is well done. They include a few episodes of Mrs Columbo but I've never bothered to watch them. If you're a Columbo fan you'll like this set.
B000U6BT40|5.0|It's exciting when science makes breakthroughs.  This show offers us a glimpse of the scientist's excitement and how it can go too far and endanger people.  It's a cautionary show while being funny and entertaining, with a host of quirky and lovable characters.  Definitely recommend it for a light, yet cautionary series.  Love it.  it warns without preaching or even judging.  As intense as it can be, I'd love to live and work in Eureka!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Obviously this is my opinion and many may be stuck on the Songs For The Deaf album (to each their own), but I feel as though with each album QOTSA releases Homme just keeps getting more and more awesome.  Darker subject matter on this one, but it seems to be a point in life many come to (hellooo...middle age anyone?!)  :)  The album flows from beginning to end, the romantic in me loves the references to older songs of time past (the do-run run, life is but a dream, etc).  Sat By The Ocean is classic QOTSA sound as is Keep Your Eyes Peeled.  Vampyre of Time and Kalopsia are such beautiful tracks...I Appear Missing got stuck in my head for days.<br /><br />Anxiously awaiting them to tour my part of the world so I can see this album performed live...
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|My wife loves this movie and the kids enjoy it also. Decent price and now it won't be scratched and set
0920668364|5.0|I substitute teach and always have this book in my tote bag. This is a great story for primary children and one many adults myself included enjoy. It's about a woman that has a baby and the stages of like and problems that go along with them. It's a story about life very entertaining for children and adults alike. If you buy it for your children or grandchildren you'll have a ringer they'll probably want to hear more than once.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Even my husband can't get enough of it!  We watched 3 episodes just last night.  Both writing and acting are superior to most shows on today.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Pros:<br />+If you're renting it, you've saved the misery of watching it in the cinema<br />+That's it, nothing else is good or unsoiled by the execrable acting and dialogue and the stupid-assed plot.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Worst movie dialogue since, erm, ever<br />-Nonsensical action scenes<br />-Terrible acting<br />-Bruce Willis quite plainly can't be bothered<br />-THe plot's incredibly stupid too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a very complicated puzzle that you go through.  The first stage is simple.  You have these 5x5 tiles, and you have to figure out how to get each on of the little dots connected to each other without going over dots.  Then you get into 6x6 then 7x7, and you keep going.<br /><br />The only annoying part, is they keep nagging you to buy it, and sometimes an ad pops up.  But it's a really good mind game because it helps you think a lot. I play it on my kindle fire a lot.  I'd only gave it 4 stars because of the ads.<br /><br />THE above was written by my 13 year old.  She only has the free version.  She said it gets progressively hard, and is almost impossible after playing a few levels.
B0012QVJXS|3.0|It's pretty good considering that it was made in 1978. My three year old was fascinated by this movie, but as an adult I find it to be at times somewhat silly. It's worth watching once or twice but that's it.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|it is ok but when you play it it gets harder and harder I don't know how to pick up the tools when you need it its hard
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This was a book selected by our book club.  On the surface it's an okay book, but digging deeper and trying to understand the<br /> other meaning of the thing was almost  too much for me.  It was another one of those  &#34;strange books&#34;.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Women in the western world have no idea of the horrors of life in a war torn country, let alone the cultural divide that manifests itself in countries where women are denied the basic principles of education, freedom to walk alone or with their children to school, shop in a market and control their own lives within their home.<br />This was a personal read for me, as I have known and worked with Afghan people who escaped their country leaving everything they owned behind-one family of 6,with a blind grandmother of 82 and 3 small children who trudged for weeks through the country and across the mountains into Pakistan. I marveled at their courage to survive in Germany as refugees and finally to arrive in the US to begin learning for a 3rd time how to build a new life. While reading this womans struggle ,I again wondered if I would have the strength to survive the tortuous lives these people faced with dignity and courage.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is the epitome of Foo Fighters energetic riffs and poetic soul.  Worth every penny!  Turn it up LOUD!!!
1932735410|5.0|Did the trick.  Passed the PMP test on 1st go.  Only source of material I used to study.  Great investment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy playing all the escape games, they make very good mind exercises with just  the right amount of difficulty. The fun is on the finding what you need and what you don&quot;t need.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This captivating saga brings to life the heart of humankind. Love is shown in unexpected ways as it meanders through the mundane and leaps through marvelous. True love endures and fades and reignites. The characters are unique and bring fresh glimpses of the human spirit.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Not sure I would have waited to watch this in weekly installments, but watched together,  the episodes are interesting enough to hold my attention from one episode to the next. Good acting and a decent script. Well done, as TV dramas go.
B009S33I68|4.0|I thought this was an awesome book. There were just too many names to follow, making me confused in the middle of the battles.
8866137634|5.0|Great product design, at the time that unpacking being too fascinated with this product, thanks to moleskine and evernote to produce this wonderful tool to capture ideas, notes and experiences.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved it!! So many creative ways to hide things especially those in plain sight. Can't wait to see new levels.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This is a must read for every person in a leadership role. I have read several of the new leadership books regarding motivation and this is the best of the group. Pink does an excellent job formatting the book to first teach then offer points that can be used to develop your own leadership style.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was looking for a game that was different and this fit the bill. It's fun and I look forward to new room challenges .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best one ive played. My kids love the game to. I want thete to be more like this game to come out please?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book is good.  It is just not great.  I got lost in some of the character development and I lost the thread of the story.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|What to say of WWZ- just sit back and enjoy the ride! WWZ is simply a lot of fun. The special effects are something we have never seen before. The pack behavior of these zombies was just real enough to captivate my interest. Watch a National Geographic show on army ants or schools of fish and you will see some real similarities. The highlight for me was the entire Jerusalem scene. The reasoning of the \\"tenth man\\" was fascinating, explaining why the nation of Israel was one of the few nations to be prepared (somewhat) for the apocalypse of the undead. It was here, in and around the \\"city of peace\\", that the \\"swarming\\" effects were at their best. The plane sequence was also very well shot- after the grenade, we get to see zombies sucked out into free falls, and the effects were superb. Brad Pitt is excellent. His character goes out in search of \\"patient zero\\", and a young epidemiologist instructs him that \\"nature is a proficient serial killer\\"; furthermore, she leaves bread crumbs- clues, as to why she is doing it. There is some truth in his claim that her most frightening manifestations also serve to hide her weak point- a \\"chink in the armor\\". In real life, the Ebola virus is an example of this. We fear it because it kills- viscously... quickly... totally, with few survivors; however, this is also it's greatest weakness. For a virus to spread, to become a true pandemic, it needs to be more subtle, with a longer incubation period, and a greater chance of host survival. Ebola is too vicious- and burns itself out before disseminated contagion can occur. It's most fearful characteristics are also it's weak point. So then- how does this all relate to the final epiphany arrived at by our hero?. In other words- what does Brad Pitt's \\"solution\\" have to do with the original \\"problem\\" described by the virologist?  I haven't a clue! But hey... that's OK- I  went to watch a massive zombie apocalypse, and boy did WWZ deliver!!ics are also it's weak point. He was a wise man- but clearly never handled a fire arm! So then- how does this all relate to the final solution arrived at by our hero... I haven't a clue- I just went to watch the zombie apocalypse, and boy did this movie deliver!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Let me start out by saying that i might be a bit biased because fantasy and shows like this are one of my favorite genres.  I have been waiting a long time for a quality show like this.  many shows like this come off as cheesy, underfunded, and with poor production values. History channel must have spent some cash because this looks like a blockbuster Hollywood movie.  The relatively unknown actors do a great job and they seem like real Vikings.  Beautiful setting, great storytelling, solid acting, and a thrilling plot make Vikings one of the best new series out right now.
B000FA675C|4.0|This was a good and interesting book.I liked the search for the Holy Grail and the adventures of the characters.Looking forward to reading another Dan Brown book.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Enjoyed but not as rewarding as his previous books. A lot of pointless characters and random stories which we not relevant.
0525478817|5.0|I initially bought this for my teenaged niece, as I had heard so many people raving about it.  I ended up reading it before wrapping it up (yes, I suppose that means she received a used gift...).  I actually just thought I'd skim a few pages, but ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting.  I loved Hazel and Gus and Isaac. They were cool and witty and clever in a way we all like to think we were at that age (but weren't).<br /><br />I won't rehash any plot points, as I'm sure countless others have done so.  I will say that I couldn't put this book down. The writing was engaging and the characters seemed authentic (if a little too cool to be teenagers, but that's what made me want to keep reading). I wanted to be friends with them!<br /><br />The writing style was very engaging for me.  John Green does a wonderful job writing about hope, loss, love.  This book made me smile, made me cry.  I was sad when it was over, and thought about the characters for a long while after I turned the last page.  That doesn't happen very often.  But perhaps the best recommendation for this book is the text I got from my niece at 2am Christmas morning.  It was a picture of the cover and it said, &#34;I'm obsessed with this book!&#34;
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I love this game. It is hard but also really fun. Except when you get past level ten the rest of the levels are &quot; coming soon&quot;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is my favorite game because it makes you want to get in the game and I was in 1st place and I hacked it
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This story amazed me over and over again.  It's fascinating to learn of the hardships Cheryl overcomes, and inspiring at the same time. She literally turns from a girl at the beginning of the book, and then the PCT turns her into a woman.  A strong, independent, confident and forgiving woman.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I like movies based on true stories and this was a good one. It was well acted , directed and very informative.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Why did you update it. It was perfect just it was! I'm unhappy and need to find some that was similar to the old one. This one is too complex.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is the best. To me I think this game is like in real life because it saves endangered animals. People who downloads this game they will be happy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Not much into reading about history, but this was fantastic.  A friend lost her husband suddenly in his sleep and this was the book on his nightstand.  With death as the narrator, it was a little creepy, but I was hooked from the beginning until the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well done.  A glimpse into the life of a family of position and means; yet, susceptible to every common challenge we all face.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I started playing this as a free version. I enjoyed it so much I signed up for the company news letter to get another island unlocked ::smile:: I was going to simply buy the full version, but I really didn't want to spend that much on a game. I've about killed my \\"game\\" budget for the year after purchasing a few other games from this company.<br /><br />Imagine my delight tonight when checking email to find the announcement that 4 awesome games are on sale at 80% off for the weekend! Needless to say, it's time to pony up the buck and have all the levels released. I love this game! The graphics on my Kindle HD are awesome, and the game play, while challenging at times, is simply fun. Finishing a level never fails to make me smile because all the town's-people cheer and clap their hands, at your success.<br /><br />Like every game this company has put out, it plays great, and is always a pleasure to open and spend time with. I highly recommended Royal Envoy!<br /><br />The other games on sale, if you are interested are: Around the world in 80 days, (paid full price for it, and it's worth every penny!), Call of Atlantis, (see prior comment), and Fishdom. I've been wanting Fishdom, and will purchase it this evening as well.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|If you  have seen the movie you know the music is outstanding.  it is a jazz take on many modern songs
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a good series. Been watching all we can. We started on ep 1 and got hooked. Cant wait till season 3 is on prime.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its a fun game needs more rooms! would play again of there was more added kept me occupied for a while
B0095P31L6|1.0|Not a good movie, not funny at all or cute for kids. Would not recommend it for anyone. Don't buy!
0486290492|5.0|I have seen the Sense and Sensibility movie several times, but have never had the pleasure of actually reading the book till now. Let me tell you, I am so grateful that I stumbled along THIS particular edition (and for an amazing price as well!)! Though it is paperback, the cover is simply beautiful with a portrait of Elinor and Marianne. I am only halfway through it so far, but I have a feeling I will have it done and reread in no time at all.<br />Overall, I love love love it! :)
B008D36INE|1.0|This woman was so self-involved and I could not relate to her<br />and her problems. I don't have any more to say!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I can't work without one with adding up hours, figuring square footage, and other things I use it for. It is truly a great tool to have.
193700788X|3.0|Mad at Charlaine Harris but Happy with Amazon Terrible ending (in my opinion) to my favorite book series. I kept turning the pages hoping for the ending i always envisioned. I didn't get mine. Really dull finalization of the book. Spent alot of time on filler rather than wrapping the series up. My least fav book in the series.<br /><br />.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|A bit slow to read at times, but an easy read and it has a good ending. A good start to the series
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|An excellent series and we have greatly enjoyed the series shown in England with the different scenes and picture quality compared to the US broadcast shows on PBS.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|still one of the best.&#34; can't leave the screne for a sec.&#34; movies.  new movies come and go against this STANDARD of the horror films!  Yeh, before the all consuming digital age.  (nothing bad there either)
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Michael Giacchino's score for Star Trek Into Darkness shows his comfort level with the material. With his score to the &#34;first&#34; movie, he was finding his way. He was experimenting and turning the traditional Star Trek score on its ear. With this score, he is still experimenting, but he's already found the sound he was looking for and so he throws himself all-in.<br /><br />This score is bigger than the previous score. It's more complex. It has many more moving parts. Yet it is still true to what he already developed. The &#34;Enterprising Young Men&#34; theme is still her in all its glory. The soft, poignant moments are still here. Bombastic, Intense, Quiet, Slow: It's all here. It is, by far, a superior score to the the first score.<br /><br />My one big gripe with this release is not the music itself, but what's missing. The full end-titles suite (with the Original Series theme) is not on this album. Granted, it is very similar to that found on the first score, but the completionist in my wants it on this score too.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game.I Think its pretty good.Give it a try and if you don't like it at least you gave it a try.
B002CNK1MK|5.0|It's an all time classic. Streamed it on my kindle to watch on a slow day free streaming for prime members.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie. I knew it was good when I was sitting on the edge of my seat, clinching my teeth even though I knew the outcome.
B0097HC8MK|4.0|Had never seen this movie.  Nick cage and Elizabeth shue are awesome.  Great acting.  Not a comedy...which I knew, but don't expect light and some funny moments.  It's brutal and honest.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Several diffenent games and lots of levels of play.  Each one a different challenge. You won't conquor this game easily.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|If you have ever played eat the candy then you will know what to do. This is basically is the same game with a few small variations.
B00A5IYC38|5.0|If you are a Who fan, this is a must see.<br />A true rock classic and Amazon is making me post more words than I need to get this review submitted. So there ya go.
0757302661|4.0|I'm not finished with the book but it has been a worthwhile read for me so far.  It suggests a link between the emotions you allow your brain to feel and the physical effect that can have on birth, either good or bad.  Our brain is the reason we feel pain, so it does make sense that by modifying our response to a situation we could also limit pain.  What women probably all need are tools to be less afraid of labor and birth, and this book is a good resource for that.
B007GE2H3G|1.0|I was going to watch this but found out that you can no longer watch Amazon Prime \\"instant\\" movies on the most common mobile device in the world: Android. Switching to one of half a dozen other services the DO support Android. Goodbye Amazon.
B0064MGU98|5.0|One of the best dramas out there! I love the strong female lead. I also enjoy the suspense and romance.  Love it!
B007YNBOJM|5.0|My lucky self got to use the new Necomimi ears while I was volunteering at Comic Con Chicago 2012. Since then I have been a little obsessed with them.<br /><br />In case you have not heard of these http://www.neurosky.com/necomimi/Default.aspx is the website. These are, for the most part, mood ears. They move in tune with your emotions.<br /><br />They are hysterical. Oh. And they really work.<br /><br />They don't work when you move your forehead muscles. (I tried.)<br /><br />They don't work on a timer. (I timed it.)<br /><br />They don't work by your temperature. (I'm always hot.) At least it seems that way to me.<br /><br />When I wore them a year ago people would ask me questions, when I did not know the answer the ears gave me away. When I got excited about something - you just had to look at those ears wiggle. I couldn't even get sad wearing them. I tried - people asked me to. I couldn't! I was too happy wearing these ears! I couldn't even really tell they were on my head except for the whirrrring of the ears when I was excited. The ear clip and forehead node I didn't even feel. I wore them for pretty much for four days straight. I only didn't wear them on the train home because that's all Chicago needs, more train crazies.<br /><br />A couple days ago for my birthday, my family finally got me my own pair. Playing with them again, I can tell still hear the 'whiring' of them on my head. That seem to be the only downside to these. They are so fun to wear. Oh - another one is I would not suggest getting them wet, as they are mechanical.<br /><br />Of course I checked out what www.Pawstar.com had in terms of covers. Black, pink, leopard, fox, perfect - now I can get rid of these white removable ones that come with the headgear. And of course I'll make my own ear covers. ;) I'm the kind of girl that will wear these to the grocery store, clothing shopping, and showing them off to all my nerdiest friends. All the while telling everyone what a great product they are, as long as the ears match my outfit of course.as long as the ears match my outfit of course.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the VERY FEW SCI FI shows I'll watch. It has great character development, killer special effects, and no character is macho bullet-proof. This is really an adult show having emotion, common sense, and the will to live in a disparate situation. It's not mindless Zombie killing for action junkies. Although there's no shortage of extreme graphic Zombie slaying AND character mishaps.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is very fun game  you should get it if you like Mario<br /> Good game .if you get it you should get LEPS WORLD 2
B005LAII8K|5.0|everything was and is amazing love it and hope to keep watching  it and  keep it forever and thank you very much

1616202416|5.0|this is the first book I've read by Adichie. It is absolutely amazing. Very powerful. I highly recommend it. After I read this, I read &#34;Half of a Yellow Sun&#34; by the same author and it was just so deeply moving, intense, and thought-provoking. It &#34;stayed&#34; with me for a long time.
B000P0J06U|5.0|Batman Returns is one of my favorite Batman films included the very first Batman film by Tim Burton and The Dark Knight. I watched Batman Returns 20 years ago I was only 7 years old and I loved it. Burton is one of my favorite directors, he wrote many great films like Batman, Batman Returns, and Edward Scissorhands, so I considered him a legend. Batman and Batman Returns are a darker version of the future Dark Knight films. Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Keaton) had defeated the Joker, but Gotham City is not free from crime. Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin (De Vito) who was born deformed, abandoned by his rich parents, and the main villain of the film who wants revenge on Gotham City by becoming the mayor to kidnap the first born children and drown them in the toxic waters from the toxic waste plant in the abandoned Gotham City Zoo. He needs help from Max Shreck (Walken) the primary villain also a traitor, ruthless, corrupted, greedy man, and the CEO of a business market who wants to get the toxic waste plants back to destroy Gotham City. This film also had a new villain, later a deuteragonist, romantic interest of Batman, and a thief in the Batman world: the beautiful, sexy, and dangerous Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Pfeiffer) who was pushed out of a window by her boss, and she wants serious revenge on him. Can Batman stop The Penguin and Shreck before they destroy Gotham City and before Catwoman gets her claws on them for revenge. If you love the darker versions of the Dark Knight, Batman and Batman Returns are a recommended for you.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Will always like Jack Bauer! One of the best character roles on TV! Looking forward to 24's limited return in 2014.
0545265355|5.0|This set of books are at a great price and are amazing. If you loved the movie you will enjoy the books much more as you really begin to understand the story.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Media articles at your fingertips! Articles not from one one media source easy to setup. Everything from cooking to world news everyday.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Entertaining, visually stimulating, thought provoking and well worth the rental! I felt like I was on a journey right along with Pi. Wonderful.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very handy app, I find myself using it all the time for all kinds of things. Try it, you'll like it.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series . . . the storyline, the actors, and the interpersonal relationships were fabulous and amazing! Don't tell me why this show was cancelled . . . it was a mega-hit. There is definitely something wrong with NBC's management!<br /><br />I watched all five seasons over seven days and wanted to see MORE!
B005OGS5BG|5.0|very good since the beginning to end. it has been always an inspirational movie. i hope there is ther secnd one also in blu ray
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I was just glad that the awkwardness of the situations weren't painfully so like on so many of these types of shows.
0385349947|5.0|I just purchased this book and timing is everything.  I recently applied for a position in my company and sadly I have to say it is a BOYS CLUB.  The position that I am hoping to get is right smack in the middle of the boys club.  Had I not purchased and read this book I don't think I would have had the confidence to go after this position.  She has taught me so much in the first three chapters that resinate with me each day.  My current position will be eliminated in October as the company is moving out of state.  I now have the confidence to keep my hands up and LEAN IN when possible.  Awesome book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was probably the best book I have ever read it was very inspirational to me and I just loved the way it made me feel. It used a variety of imagery and gave me different feelings toward the book. I loved how everyone was able to accept him as he was and the courage he had for just being him. The story gave a great plot with ups and downs which gave the reader the feeling of actually being apart of the book. It shows that you have to have strength and courage in yourself to be able to accomplish and achieve want you want.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book taught me more about statistics that I learned in college. I am on my way to a PhD now and after reading this book, I feel I have better statistical intuition for my own research (completely unrelated to anything talked about in the book), Highly recommended.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This movie will keep you in the edge of your seat.  Better than expected.  Scary without being grotesque.  I am buying it for my movie collection.
0812550706|3.0|Lots of side issues and departures.  Ender is surely over developed.  Too much time in the game theme but probably necessary to the story.  Still, for the time period, it is a good read and worth the time.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Arnold did a good job,plus it was a little funny at times. We have watched Arnold for a lot of years, & I guess we'll keep on watching.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I like the book. I read it as a kid and enjoyed it. I think the author went off the deep end lately with some of his political views, but I think this book is mostly clear of that stuff. I met OSC once and he seemed like a nice guy, signed a book for me to give to a friend. Too bad he is a little wackadoodle now.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|A GREAT movie.  I love Carell and what a crazy thing love can be at times.  Highly recommended as a good all around view.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|OK, so Gerard Butler can't sing as well as opera-trained Emily Rosum or theatrically and musically trained Patrick Wilson. But he actually does a credible job of singing - more like a rock star, but he has power behind his sustained notes and can hit the sweet falsettos to give his character tenderness and vulnerability. He also conveys the powerful allure of the phantom, especially when he replaces the lead in Don Juan Triumphant. Gerard Butler was a virtual unknown when he played the lead in this movie.<br /><br />Emily Rosum and Patrick Wilson sound amazing together. Until watching this, I never knew that Patrick Wilson was an accomplished vocalist. The story is fairly faithful to the book but the music is haunting. Acting is good too, for a &#34;rock&#34; opera, but it just got under my skin. Minnie Driver is a comic element in the story (she plays the less-talented diva, Carlotta). I laughed when she was saying &#34;He lova me, he lova me&#34; in her affected flat voice after meeting patron, Patrick Wilson.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Truly enjoyed the movie.  It's simply amazing how realistic the interaction between the giants and the people were made.  Very entertaining and never a dull moment.<br /><br />Recommend it to the whole family.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Wool 1 was interesting and had more substance than the other 4. It was like a bus ride that you enjoyed and saw interesting things on the first leg and then it traveled in to an area of blight.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Interesting game. Some of the rooms it is obvious how to find the way out. While others u work on for awhile.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This was an interesting and humble movie. I was inspired by the sugar man and his life. I recommend this movie for these who like true stories that demonstrate life's challenges.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|i needed something to take the place of my paper lists for &#34;to do's&#34; & this is working fine for me.  its convenient & easy to use
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good fun. Logical. Way better than find the hidden object puzzles. Although they can be challenging  also. Wish there were more rooms. Looking forward to the update.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|With Tommy Lee Jones and a promising plot, I thought this would be a good movie . . . I was wrong.  Perhaps I will read the novel to see if Hollywood just screwed up or if they didn't have much material to work with from the beginning.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read the other reviews before I read the 3rd book and I have to disagree with a lot of the bad reviews, some points may be true, but it was still a good read, I gave it 4 stars, even if this one left us hanging, but not with a bad ending and because I know there will be another book to clear up all the loose ends. I'm not sorry I read it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game. Looks great on my kindle fire hd. No ads and can play without having to pay real money to enjoy or to make progress in the game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Excellent story and thought provoking! The acting was great and the tiger had his own personality. Would recommend this as a lesson in God's grace and compassion.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|We're going to see the Eagles in 2 weeks.  This was a great way to start building excitement to see one of the best rock bands of all time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I just love it. I never watched it when it was on TV (don't know why).<br />Action packed and I love the characters.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|When I downloaded this, it seemed to do okay. About a month ago, an &#34;update&#34; screen popped up, so I hit &#34;update now&#34;. Well, there doesn't happen to be an update for Kindle Fire, so now I get to use an older version and constantly hit &#34;not now&#34; when the update  popup pops up.
031603441X|5.0|What an amazing life Keefy has led and very colourful ***wink*** loved reading all about his childhood and life. X
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It's unputdownable. The literary style is definitely not up to much so it does leave you feeling a bit cheap for having enjoyed reading it so much. Which is fine by me, I'm not a book-snob, and certainly don't mind feeling cheap now and again.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Spectacular costumes and scenery.  I could do without the tacky sex scenes that added nothing to the drama.  The history of the Reformation and politics at English Court was fascinating.  Each character shows and bood and bad side.  Excellent scipt.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Is a good thing I didn't buy this for me, because the graphics are terrible. Still, my girls don't seem to mind so that's all that matters. Not worth the money though. Should be more like $2
B006S009IY|1.0|So far I've watched 30 minutes and am disappointed because it features an unhappy married couple and the husband is starting to spend time with another woman. This always leads to an unhealthy relationship.  From the great orchestral music I thought the movie would be more fairy tale like.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Not a great movie, but very thought provoking. This is one of the few movies that I like better than the book (which is really saying something considering how great the book is). The layered story structure makes it a lot of fun to rewatch.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I had never read Little Women or any of her works. It was nice to be able to read them through as a continuation. I'll look for more collections for my Kindle.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My girls and I watch this several times a year and never tire of it. That's the mark of a great movie.
B009UNH0EM|3.0|Love the Legend, Hate the fact that none of the chargers from other Plantronics products are not usable. Its an ok charger, but really?
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Loved it. Very original story told well with excellent acting. And when you have a soccer mom interrogating her husband with her scrapbooking scissors and a glue gun, well.. what's not to love?
125000098X|5.0|Great story.  Looking forward to book four.  Then I send them on to a friend and he is enjoying them also.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Not anything special, just a convenient way in which to stay connected easier on Linked In. I rarely use Linked In, but when I do, this makes logging on faster.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Stole my interest and would not let go.  Would love to read more from this author.
B00008XEOI|5.0|I got this for my brother as a gift as he is a big Lion King fan.  He loved it, especially the portrait drawings.  The portraits are a little bigger than post card sized and really detailed.<br /><br />The additional stuff on the DVD's are a nice bonus.  The quality is your standard DVD quality but at least it's better than the VHS we have.<br /><br />The box it comes in is really nice and makes it really feel like a collector's item.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|God was with them that day.<br />I can't imagine going through that.<br />it would change the course of my life.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|There were times when the movie lagged a bit, but overall the acting and story was superb. Would recommend to watch.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game lets you build a city how you want it does what it says, you just have to wait and do a couple arons to get where you want, that life period, that's why I like this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is outstanding. It sure keeps you guessing in each room to get the info you need to get the the next level. I hope they come out with with another one of these games.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Great album! I don't think it's such a sad, depressing-sounding album as some people say. I think it's full of great insights and it offers a fresh, new perspective on heartbreak. My favorite line off the album:<br /><br />\\"Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.\\"<br /><br />I don't see Fiona as being completely miserable; I see a strong woman who has found ways to cope with all the sadness in her life. \\"It pisses me off to think that we're conditioned to push away bad feelings and to think that anything that's uncomfortable is something to be avoided. When things are really bad nowadays, I recognize the value in it because it's me filling my quota-- it's going to make my joy more intense later.\\" - Fiona<br /><br />The album can sound a bit off at times - she doesn't try to make things sound all pretty. But that's exactly why I love this album. It's unapologetic and raw, and that's what makes this a beautiful album.
B008476HBM|5.0|Keeps today's audience engaged as well. Classic for a reason. If you're on the fence, is recommend reading it, totally worth it
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I like, it's different there a story and you can most likely expect what's going to happen, so you can be prepared.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|IT IS GOOD TO KNOW YOUR ENEMY. THIS BOOK HELPED ME BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE MIND SET OF THE NORTH KOREN GOVT.

B000SEFNMS|3.0|It is not a &#34;I can't put this down&#34; kind of book...I had heard it was...but was disappointed in the read...

B00772M1F6|5.0|This CD could possibly be the best I've heard in the last twenty years. If you like 50's Rock N' Roll and early 60's ; thrown in with a fantastic four piece combo, you must BUY THIS CD.  Billy &#34; V&#34;  Southport, N.C.

B00CBUL826|5.0|typical Sodom awesomeness! This album keeps going where their last album left off with searing guitars, and blistering vocals. buy it.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I really liked this movie, came in with reservations but was pleasantly surprised, the story was good, the Corvette was just fantastic, nice to see Arnie playing it up, acting his age in this movie makes it more enjoyable, you feel every ache and pain that he has, in this movie you can see the actors are having a good time making it, it's not an Oscar winner, but it's really fun.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J cole, I hear your your experiences and talent! And it's nice to see artists grow up in their music! Love the music!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|As the title of my review says I loved this book, I am actually contemplating if I should start reading Little Men as well.<br />The storyline is very interesting, there are some descriptions but not too lengthy, out of place or boring, there is a good structure and it is very easy to follow each character.<br /><br />A good book all together and I recommend it to everyone, be it adults, teenagers or children.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|this series is always adventurous and entertaining.  This episode does not have any plot twists, but does have a good foreshadowing moment.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie started out a little slow, first 15 minutes did not know if we would like it or not, then it just grabbed you and held you all the way to the end, very, very different from any zombie movie I have in our collection, you feel for the characters and the acting is top notch as well, the effects are above average, though it's the story that keeps you talking about it long after the movie ends, great ending as well, will watch this one over again and again.
1451638450|4.0|While this isn't a top-class LMB book, an average book for her is better than most people can write on their best day.<br /><br />She sets herself some challenges upfront. Unlike most other books in the Vorkosigan series, this one isn't told from Miles' point of view, which instantly drops the frenetic, mad pace that only Miles can bring. He does get a brief cameo, and looms over the action in his absence. It's not the book with which to start reading the series, by the way, since it's full of unexplained references back to the events of the other books, some of which I missed myself because it has been a while since I read them all through.<br /><br />It's told from Ivan's third-person limited POV (and that of a new character), and Ivan, while not actually an idiot, is dedicated to the principle that if you keep your head down and wait things out and insist that the mad events are not your fault, things will go much better. He's also resolutely unambitious, since he has a tenuous claim to be Emperor which he has never remotely wanted to assert. All this makes him an unpromising protagonist.<br /><br />Because LMB is such a good (and well-practiced) writer, she manages to make him a protagonist anyway, by giving him something he cares enough about to fight for. He shows competence, courage and even, by Ivan standards, cunning. And, of course, in her trademark style, the author throws at the characters exactly what they least want to happen, which ramps up the stakes and the tension and drives them to show their essential qualities.<br /><br />The other viewpoint character (the two switch more-or-less scene by scene) is a Jacksonian Baronette, the daughter of a House Major. She calls Ivan by his first and middle names, Ivan Xav, and I think this is mainly so that we can tell whose point of view we're following at the time. Their voices are not otherwise particularly distinct, so a device like that is needed. She's apparently led a very sheltered life, considering that her parents are basically a cross between gang kingpins, bandit chieftains and warlords; at one point she refers to one of her father's old mercenary mates, apparently unironically, as \\"a very bad man\\". She comes across as rather naive for a 25-year-old, in fact, and that didn't completely work for me. In fact, she has a weakness shared by many romance heroines (this isn't solely a romance, but there's a very strong romance plot): it's hard to see in her the positive qualities which are captivating the hero so much. I would have liked to see her with some skill or character strength that makes a clear difference to the resolution of the other parts of the plot, makes her stand out to Ivan from his other girlfriends, and clearly explains the different relationship that he develops with her.<br /><br />My overall verdict: good, but not great.t her parents are basically a cross between gang kingpins, bandit chieftains and warlords; at one point she refers to one of her father's old mercenary mates, apparently unironically, as \\"a very bad man\\".

0765356139|5.0|I've been watching the videos of Brandon Sanderson's writing course at BYU, and it's interesting to be reading one of his books at the same time (particularly since he draws on his own writing for examples sometimes). Here is a spectacular example of plotting. At the end of each of the six parts, there's a twist or a big reveal. There are constant surprises and turnarounds, which kept me glued to the page. I was always wondering \\"How on earth is he going to get them out of this one?\\"<br /><br />There's lots of action, too, but every fight is different. He never writes the same scene twice.<br /><br />Mistborn has a couple of things going for it in terms of my personal taste, as well. I love superhero novels, and basically the Mistborn and the Mistings are superheroes, albeit in an epic fantasy setting. I'm not a fan of the same-old-same-old epic fantasy formula, on the other hand, but Sanderson puts wonderful spins on that formula. The result is a fresh story that wouldn't be quite the same if we didn't know the formula he's playing against. The ideas of the Chosen One, the Dark Lord, the wise mentor, even the returning king all get turned inside out and upside down. It's not just play for the sake of play, either. It makes for some deep and moving moments as the characters discover how their expectations were tragically wrong.<br /><br />One of Sanderson's stated goals is to achieve \\"Orwellian language\\", which isn't (as you'd expect) doublespeak, but language that is like a clear window through which you see the story, without noticing the language itself. But, he has a distinctive language quirk that occurs over and over again and which, once I had noticed it, I found very distracting. I won't say what it was to keep from driving someone else crazy with it, but the previous sentence in this review contained an example of it. It's not wrong, exactly, just unconventional.<br /><br />Other than that, I am thoroughly enjoying the Mistborn series, and will be hunting out other Sanderson books as well.ut other Sanderson books as well.

0671578855|5.0|I consistently laugh aloud every time I re-read this book, which I've done a few times now. It's always somewhere in the dinner-party scene.<br /><br />It's a gutsy move to take your military space opera series and write a comedy-of-manners book in it, and I know not every fan was delighted. I include myself among those who were.<br /><br />The dinner party is an absolute perfect storm, and the butter-bugs are hilarious.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Had never heard of this and stumbled on it one night. Got hooked and binged the whole series. Young woman discovers she has a clone - actually a whole BUNCH of clones- and someone is trying to kill them off one by one.
B009NY43NY|2.0|[SPOILERS included]  Like a lot of people, I was disappointed by the ending. I feel like Sookie had been growing and evolving as a character over the course of the series and with this she essentially ended up exactly where she started. What was the point of her journey then? The one thing I really liked, however, was that the entire town (and then some) showed up to support her when she was in trouble. The series started with her feeling so alone and here she saw how much people did really love her and support her. That was great.<br /><br />As far as ending up with Sam? Ugh, it just doesn't make sense to me. Yes, she loves him, but was she really in-love with him? I NEVER got that impression. He always seemed like that really good friend whom you absolutely adore and love, but just don't see yourself with romantically. Plus, he's now her business partner. I mean, things could get really messy if the romance doesn't last, ya know? I feel like after all these years and everything she's been through emotionally, she would be smarter than that. Not that I think her relationship with Eric was perfect because it so totally was not, but why Sam? I just don't get it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just a pleasure to watch the drama unfold. All the acting is fine. Absolutely love to see Maggie Smith do her stuff.
0756405890|5.0|I'll be honest - I picked this book because I needed something thick enough to last me through an overseas trip with a lot of time spent on planes and in airports. But it turned out to be really, really good. I rarely give five stars to anything, but The Name of the Wind deserves them.<br /><br />Not only is it a well-written, well-plotted and fascinating adventure, but it has a richness of allusion and a sense of so much happening offstage, so many threads to be woven together, that it not only keeps you reading but leaves you eager for the rest of the series. The main character is complex and multifaceted and an interesting rogue with principles who is constantly in strife. I was reminded of the Locke Lamora books, except that Kvothe is less of a rogue than Locke and at least some of his troubles are not self-inflicted.<br /><br />The editor needs to work harder - there are a few misused homonyms (\\"make due\\" instead of \\"make do\\", \\"discrete\\" for \\"discreet\\" and the like). But the writing, the dialogue, the worldbuilding and the characterisation are all very good indeed.
B004P12SSW|4.0|I am a fan of musicals and you don't see many big productions anymore.  This wasn't great acting and the story was predictable (small town girl with big heart makes it against all odds and saves the day) but Christine and Cher have nice chemistry, Stanley is always marvelous, the choreography was really fun and the songs were toe tapping.  Christine has a hell of a voice. I wasn't familiar with her before and was pretty darn impressed.

0765350386|5.0|People kept telling me to read Mistborn, and I kept resisting. I'm glad I finally gave in to the chorus of voices.<br /><br />I resisted for two main reasons. First, I'm not a huge fan of epic fantasy any more. It's so often done badly, and ends up as what I call \\"elf opera\\" or a \\"fantasy phonebook\\" (thick, boring and full of names). And most epic fantasy seems to have one of only three plots, all of which I'm sick of.<br /><br />One of those three plots is \\"low-status person in a cruel empire discovers hidden magical talents and becomes a Person of Importance in great events\\", and that's the basic plot of Mistborn. And the second reason I resisted picking it up is that word \\"cruel\\". I don't enjoy books about cruelty.<br /><br />Here's the thing, though. If we think about urban fantasy for a minute, there are different ways of dealing with sex. The urban fantasy books I enjoy most acknowledge that sex exists, that it drives human behaviour sometimes, that to some people it's extremely important, it can make you laugh, it can make you cry and so forth. They mention that it happens when it's important to the plot, but the metaphorical camera doesn't linger lovingly on every moment of a, you should excuse the expression, blow-by-blow description. Rather, it does a discreet fade and picks up again the following morning. Other urban fantasy books do the loving lingering and make it all about the sex all the time - and I don't read those ones.<br /><br />Now, for urban fantasy read epic fantasy, and for sex read cruelty.<br /><br />Mistborn is an epic fantasy that doesn't linger lovingly on the cruelty. The cruelty is there, it's important to the plot, but it's not what the book is about, and it's always clear that the people who indulge in it are in the wrong and the people who oppose it are in the right. It's not a world of cruelty, it's a world that includes cruelty, and the distinction is important (to me, at least). I don't read Terry Goodkind (who is joint holder of my personal award for most misleading author name, along with Mary Gentle) because of the pornographic way he handles cruelty. I couldn't get beyond the prologue of George R.R. Martin's first Game of Thrones novel for the same reason. But Brandon Sanderson writes about cruelty in a way I'm OK with. Part of the main character's arc in this book, in fact, is learning that not everybody is a cruel betrayer.<br /><br />Nor is he rewriting the same epic fantasy yet again. He does something different here. In fact, he plays with the epic fantasy cliches in his backstory, very cleverly. It's fresh, it's well-done, it's well-handled. As usual in an epic fantasy, The Final Empire has a large cast of characters, but I never forgot who anyone was, partly because he's good at slipping in little reminders if a character has been off-stage for a while.<br /><br />The magic system is fresh, too (though a fresh magic system by itself isn't enough to make an epic fantasy interesting on its own, it's certainly enjoyable), and again, I always knew what was going on, even though it's a relatively complex system. Again, this is because he slips in little reminders in how he writes the events: \\"She burned tin and could see through the mists that surrounded her\\" (not an actual quote, but that's one of the ways he does it). He even explains the magic system twice, once when the more experienced user of it is patrolling the city using it, and once when that character explains it to the inexperienced protagonist. I was never left confused, which when you have a complex plot, multiple characters and a lot of worldbuilding is quite an achievement.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading more Brandon Sanderson. He writes fast, which is great, because not only does he already have a lot of books out, but by the time I've read those he will probably have written several more.

0425263991|5.0|Kaleb Krychek is the most powerful Psy in the Net. He is a deadly dual cardinal with impenetrable mind shields of obsidian and has the ability to split the world in two with ease. According to rumors, Kaleb had been the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Santano, a former Councilor who had enjoyed torture and murder. The lethal telekinetic is said to be aiming for a total takeover of the Net or to destroy it. The latter would kill millions of people. No one, not even Kaleb himself, knew if he would end up destroying the very fabric of their race or not. It all depended on a single person - Sahara. And after seven years of constant searching, Kaleb has found her at last!<br /><br />Sahara Kyriakus survived seven years of imprisonment. The guards had obeyed every order from their leader. Yet no matter the pain or punishment given, Sahara kept her mind hidden deep within a mental labyrinth. She had consciously sabotaged her own mind and hobbled her abilities. She refused to break and hand over her will, because whoever controlled Sahara could control the PsyNet. But now a man has teleported her out of the white room and into a huge home - a fortress. Even though her mind is still deeply submerged, Sahara can tell that the man is dark. This man is unable to feel any empathy or sorrow for others. So why does her subconscious feel safe enough to begin unraveling the labyrinth?<br /><br />Kaleb and Sahara were on opposite sides of the line that separated dark from light, good from evil. For a few short years, until she was sixteen, they had been friends. That friendship ended with her blood on his knife. Sahara was close to death when she had been taken from him. Now that she was back in his grasp, Kaleb would never let her go. She belonged to him.<br /><br />***** FIVE STARS! Since I have not read any of the previous titles in this series, I can say from experience that you do not need to in order to fully understand and enjoy this story. The main focus is on Kaleb and Sahara, where it should be; however, the story's plot line is never ignored. (The Psy, Changeling, and Human races are being attacked by Pure Psy, a shadowy group who seeks to topple the current power structure and dreams of a world enslaved by the Psy.) Nalini Singh's writing style is crisp, vivid, and easy to follow. I, as the reader, am able to understand why Kaleb is who/what he is, as well as why Sahara believes in him, though he will always be dark. I could actually feel the characters' pain, sorrow, dread, and joy.<br /><br />If you have read the previous titles in this series, you will be happy to know that past characters make cameo appearances. Again, the author does not lose focus on the main characters and new readers will not feel as though they are missing something. But seeing who/what is the mate of who/what (such as a human with a Changeling) makes it tempting to find their stories. I will definitely be keeping an eye on this author! *****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.be; however, the story's plot line is never ignored.

B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|While listening to this record, you will constantly be reminded of classic records from the 60's and 70's, but nothing ever feels like a rip off.  It gets gloriously unhinged towards the end (and more and more Motown-y) and will leave you feeling satisfied.
044042321X|5.0|This book is beautifully illustrated. To be able to translate one of the best series of books ever written into a graphic novel is an incredible achievement. It perfectly combined my love of the series Game of Thrones, the books by George R. R. Martin and graphic novels in one incredible book. Well done! I can't wait for the next ones.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This feel good film is consistently fun to watch: mostly, the ensemble acting and nice camera.  Three stars here mean that while the film is diverting, that is, okay entertainment, it taxes neither the intellect nor the imagination.  Formally, it is a sort of a mess, starting out as a melodrama and shifting half-way through to a romantic comedy.  The best I can say is it's not boring.  Plot is mostly not believeable and characters, likewise. (Plot and characters do not have to be believable so long as there is some resonance for either in the real world.) As I reconsider, days later, I would say this film is pretty inconsequential.  It doesn't add up to anything.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|It was easy to be skeptical about a new AIC release after the 'close, but no cigar' come back that was 'Black Gives Way to Blue'.<br /><br />In a landscape where 'grunge' has been dead for 20 years and 'Rock and Roll' and even 'Metal' have strayed toward 'alternative' or 'indie', it was not crazy to think that a new album by this classic band might try and further 'modernize' (as other recently successful bands such as Muse, The Strokes and others have).<br /><br />Instead, what we get is a return to the AIC that fans knew and loved.<br /><br />'Black Gives Way to Blue' was a departure from the original AIC sound; only paying occasional respects to it. In some ways it sounded almost like an obituary.  'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' is a full-on reversal of that method.  It is a Lazarus-like revival of what we long thought extinct.  It is 90's rock transported via time-machine to the present and it sounds just as good now as it did back then.<br /><br />Granted, it's still IMPOSSIBLE to replicate the perfection of Layne Staley's vocals, but the raw licks from the Jar of Flies/Alice In Chains days have returned.  Nearly every one of these songs sounds like it could have been a B-side or near-A-Side on one of those classic albums.  Overall, there isn't quite enough to induce a full-on flashback to the 90's, torn jeans and all, but it comes more than close enough.<br /><br />'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' is the 'upbeat' and 'finger tapping' version of AIC.  It's lacking the sound and lyrics that have made some critics call the band 'depressing', and here that's a good thing.<br /><br />This album is worthy of multiple re-listens and comes oh-so-close to 5 stars for bringing back the nostalgic days of 'hard' rock.<br /><br />What I see is unreal... Alice in Chains has crawled back to start.<br /><br />4 1/2 out of 5 stars

1475143389|5.0|\\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" is a basic, good presentation of how to train and fuel the male body.  It is not new material.  It is not research. It is not cutting edge of the most recent fads / theories of body and strength building.  Nor does it have to be.  Michael Matthews has done a good job of presenting one approach to body and strength building.  There are other approaches, and perhaps some newer ways of putting out the information.  There are other philosophies about both body and strength building.  But this book will help the average man get what he wants, a bigger, leaner, stronger body.<br /><br />The information is clearly written.  The book could benefit from more pictures.  The exercises are well grouped.  The dietary information is sound in its philosophy. There are other philosophies which can be argued, but this material is sound.<br /><br />This is a good book, presenting good information well in an approach that most men can utilize and benefit from.

B008OM0EDO|3.0|I should say I'm not a Sacha Baron Cohen fan. Most of his material strikes me as a failed SNL sketch. But there are parts of this film that are so funny, they had me thinking \\"funniest thing since Monty Python.\\"  Those parts, however are few and far between.<br /><br />The opening is stale, nothing new and not that funny. But about 2 minutes into the film, I'm grinning. A few minutes later, I'm laughing. This is the part where we learn that Admiral General Haffiz Aladeen of the country of Wadiya edited the country's language, changing 300 words to 'aladeen.'  Including the words 'positive' and negative.' So picture some poor sap trying to learn the results of his HIV test.  A brief period of lameness follows, which brings us to the six minute mark, where Wadiya's nuclear bomb is revealed. It is beyond funny. So in the first eight minutes, you are alternatively shaking your head at the lameness and laughing your head off. After this, however, there is only an occasional laugh. Even my co-viewer, who claims to be a SBC fan, admitted that the real laughs were a little thin on the the ground.<br /><br />There is a plot, but it's not important to the enjoyment of the film. Did you see \\"Coming to America?\\" Combine that with \\"The Price and the Pauper\\" and any Three Stooges short and you pretty much get the picture.<br /><br />Some reviewers believe that anyone who doesn't find the movie funny doesn't get \\"sarcasm.\\" I think we do, although some of us call it satire, which implies funny.  And in The Dictator it is. Three or four times. But mostly, it isn't.  The unfunniness is so egregious, it hurts.  SBC tries too hard to squeeze in too many laughs. I mean, come on, how funny is referring to \\"The Real Housewives of Schwarmaharadarajan?\\"  Or peeing into a pitcher and then drinking it? It's pointless...even in a satire, characters have to behave reasonably. I think Cohen approached the movie the way bad soup makers make soup: if they find it in the refrigerator, it goes in the pot. If it popped into Cohen's head, he added it to the script. Sometimes a little restraint is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The four or five laugh out loud parts bring this up to three stars.e pot.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Overall, I'd say that I loved \\"Heart of Obsidian\\"; in fact, as soon as I'd finished reading the book, I started over again from the beginning, which I very rarely do.  I was absolutely captivated by Kaleb and Sahara from the very beginning and I loved the blending of their different strengths and weaknesses. It was great to finally know the identity of the Ghost and to know that I was right in my guess.<br /><br />One thing that jarred me was the fact that, after establishing with Judd in \\"Caressed by Fire\\" that it was necessary for him to do some very tricky maneuverings in his brain to free him from the effects of the dissonance, Kaleb achieved the same result with hardly any effort at all. Also, without giving too much away (I hope), I didn't believe that Kaleb could be as injured as he was in the motel scene, and still manage to live through it without permanent damage. This is especially true because Psy are the physically weakest out of the three races. However, I was enjoying the story so much that it was easy to overlook the inconsistencies.<br /><br />This was a great book in a fantastic series, and I definitely recommend it. Happy reading!
0451529065|5.0|n the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I loved all of Mitch Albom's previous novels, but this one was not one of my favorites.  I don't like giving too much away in my reviews because books like beauty are in the eye of the beholder.  His previous novels invoked emotions and stayed with me for a long time.  For me this was just a long fable that lasted a bit too long.  I selected this for my book club and there were mixed reviews.  One reader really enjoyed it, but they did not read his previous novels.  I look forward to another one of Mitch's books because I enjoy them, but this will not make any of my must read lists.

B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|4.5/5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewing books by my favourite author always proves tricky. I love each and every one of Neil Gaiman's works for different reasons and have very high expectations of his writing given the brilliance of novels like Neverwhere and the intricate, complex stories of The Sandman.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane was marketted as a 'book for adults' and I think that isn't true at all. This is a fairy-tale, a dark one as per Gaiman's usual leaning, but a fairy-tale none-the-less told to us by a man reliving an aspect of his childhood. This is a clever device as it allows the narrator to convey the whimsy of childhood with the (questionable) wisdom of adult retrospect.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected more from this book. I expected the complex layers of myth and story Gaiman delivered in Neverwhere and American Gods - two books I would understand being marketted as 'adult reads' given the convolution of the story and nature of the plot. TOATEOTL (terrible acronym but let's go with it) wasn't nearly as complex, layered, or nuanced as either of those two books. If I had to compare TOATEOTL to another Gaiman work, I'd say Stardust probably comes the closest in terms of narrative style (be prepared for a whole lot of tell and not too much show) with a smattering of The Graveyard Book given that the main character is a 7yr old boy for the majority of the book.<br /><br />I loved this book because it beautifully, gently and honestly captured a moment in childhood, a childhood infused with the wild magic that only grows in the loneliest of places. I adored the magic and really appreciated many of the adult observations made about childhood.<br /><br />What I didn't love about this story is that it was so short (I read it in a few hours) and while I was expecting more of an 'American Gods down an English country lane', I got more of a 'Stardust set in Sussex'. This book could've been so much more had Gaiman allowed it, had Gaiman used the childhood experience to show us what became of the adult man.<br /><br />TOATEOTL feels like the start of some bigger story, like it only just began to scratch the surface of some deeper, darker magical world Gaiman has yet to explore. I can only hope Gaiman revisits the Hempstocks and gives us a more meaty read next time he does.

B000001GS0|5.0|Jochum began the recording of the four Brahms symphonies with the Berliner Philharmoniker in 1951 (No.2). In 1953 First and Fourth followed. Finally, in 1956 the set was completed with the Third. The orchestra was still the one shaped by Furtw&auml;ngler, Jochum's mentor since the early Thirties.<br />The young fellow and great admirer of the elderly master offers beautiful readings, quite free from metronomic restrictions, at the polar opposite from the Toscanini readings: Jochum in fact focuses more on the complex polyphonic textures of the scores, following the tradition of the conductors of the previous generation. We have to remember that Brahms had once complained, after a performance of his Fourth in a concert, he was not able \\"to speed up and slow enough \\"(see notes on the CD booklet).<br />The best performances are, in my opinion, those of the first two symphonies: No. 2 has a beautiful freshness and liveliness and is better than the 1970s version with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (EMI). The beginning of the fourth movement of the First is powerful and the sense of expectation is carefully calculated, before the dramatic entrance of the \\"Beethovenian\\" theme. Perhaps the Fourth, even if remains on a level of excellence, lacks the profundity of the meditative reading of the EMI edition. As for audio, it must be said that the Deutsche Grammophon mono is great, especially in the Third. In my opinion You should have also the stereo cycle of EMI, with Maestro Jochum equally inspired, but more spiritual and deep.<br /><br />Booklet: offers a very interesting text about the history of the recordings, plus many critical essays.<br /><br />Deutsche Grammophon<br />2CD set - Mono ADD

B0026S93C0|5.0|Pure 80's cult film. Jennifer Beals puts on a great performance as Alex and the transfer has never look better.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Took a chance on these books and i am loving them. How did i just hear about orson scott card......i have a lot of catching up to do :-)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This third book is boring to me. I have had it for almost a year and I am so tired of the same story line. It will be hard for me to finish this book if I ever do.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|I am so glad to get this Blu-ray disks of the Eagles. It shows a lot of insight in the the group both from the beginning and also later in the history of the group.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  The movie starts off really slow which normally then loses the attention of my husband after which he walks away.  However, he stayed with this movie and it picked up speed.  The movie could have been written better.  Basically about an adult son and his mother getting to know each other on a trip.  The son, like most children, didn't want any of mom's advice, but learned in the end that maybe her advice isn't so bad after all!!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Just love it!.<br />Come on the Oldies.<br />To quote another movie - RED.<br />&#34;Retired Extremely Dangerous&#34; - in this area if you've got the skill age means nothing. R.E.D.<br />DaveT (Australia)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cool game and its not too complex or easy but takes a lot common sense and is a cool ga.e to pass the time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Needs more levels. I would like a way to receive a hint every once in a while. It is very entertaining though.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is a great family Christmas movie, one of those great Christmas movies that the whole family can enjoy.  But what really hooked me to Elf was Zooey Deschanel.  Really loved the quirky nature of her character that you see in many of her performances.  Really amazing singing voice also.  Highly recommended but especially recommended for Zooey Deschanel's performance.
1590171993|5.0|This is simply an honest story about an ordinary life, but the writer captures the thoughts and emotions of the main character so well that it's fantastically moving.<br />I was impressed that the writer was able to keep the tension and interest going without adding any extraordinary or unusual events.<br />My only criticism is that the writer didn't find much fault the main character in regards to the problems in his life.
B000SW4DH6|3.0|The movie was weird but I think i'll like it after I watch it a few more times, love the outfits.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fairly easy. but it did have some big challenges. I am waiting for the next 5 to come out
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Best album I've purchased in years live every song from beginning to end no skips.  21 songs just ain't enough and I get mad if I reach my destination before I've heard every song lol
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|I can honestly say the ending took me by complete surprise. I did not see that coming .i really liked it.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|It's hard to imagine this is a true story but it is.  Gene Hackman plays the role of commander as good as you can imagine.  He is great.  Owen Wilson gets shot down behind enemy lines and Gene Hackman is trying to get him out alive.  When I want to watch a thrilling show I just pop this movie in and I'm on the edge of my seat all over again.  Good movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free, easy and addictive.  A great way to wile away the time spent in waiting rooms .  Can not say enough good things /jld
B00DF0POXA|1.0|To call this LP a disappointment would be an insult to the other disappointments I've had. Kanye has the talent to put out quality music. That's not in question. And it is also what makes this album even more of a fail. At least his last album (MBDTF) had superb production to accompany the average and at times juvenile lyrics and guest appearances, but this album doesn't even have that leg to stand on. It's even worse than 808s and Heartbreaks which I was hoping I wouldn't be able to say. It's self indulgent industrial crap rap that makes you long for the days of College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation. There's artistic growth, and there's artistic decay. This is the latter.<br /><br />The Leonard Part 6 of rap albums.<br /><br />0.25/5 stars.<br /><br />Save your money, or buy Illcandescent by Versis if you just must by an album.
B007AFBYYY|5.0|This really shows the drive that these mountain climbers have when they want to climb a big mountain.  You can't help but feel the cold and the wind not to mention the dispair they go through when trying to get back down alive.  This movie is very realistic.  It tells the truth about mountain climbing and that is that people die.  This is such a good movie I think you'll like it too.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This is a great little game that any device should have. It's simple gameplay and replay value make this game well worth it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Rango is one of the new animations.  Very well done and gives some lessons.  The story line is great and the animation is very realistic.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This dictionary is not how it's should can't find the word that you are looking for its just a waste of your time with this stupidity!!!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Weird, hard to follow and understand since everyone has an accent. Unnecessary and strange nudity. Would not recommend this to anyone. Your time would be better spent sitting in silence
B005IQ5H7M|2.0|I love the novel but a word of warning about the Kindle version: It's rife with typos.  I'm only 6% into a re-read of the novel this time in a kindle version and I've seen more mistakes already than most entire e-books contain.  In places it reads like a translation by the same folks who send those broken English phishing emails we are all pestered by.  This really needs to be addressed by the publisher.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|Classic movie made from a very popular novel that follows the book fairly well.  The acting is well done and shows how brutal war is.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This American dictionary is better then the other one it gives you the meaning of what the word means it was just amazing!!!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This is a good example of why I hate installing apps that have a \\"free\\" and \\"full\\"(paid) version, or paid versions without full-featured test drives.<br /><br />Basically - it works.  But it's hard to see, expanding pages results in accidental redirects, and it's hard to navigate.  It's slightly better than using a tablet browser, but not enough to entice me to pay for it.<br /><br />Facebook is annoying enough without mediocre operating apps...but I guess it's still marginally better than nothing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I got the headphones for my husband, who is blind.  He loves this headset the best as he reads&#34; all the time with his digital recorder.  He says it is the most comfortable and the least intrusive.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|loads of fun.  keeps you thinking might want to grab a pen and paper to take notes. I really liked how you move around the room to search and solve the puzzles.
B00821OX98|5.0|I didn't think I'd like it but it is well written, action packed with a great story line.  I'm hooked.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Nothing ever goes wrong with this game. I play every single day even if I only have a few minutes to spare.a lot of fun for $.99. I have t o kcal all my friends and they love it too. I highly recommend it.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Many big names were in this film, but very few of the voices were quality. The background characters were far better than the big names.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Grate game I spent hrs. On it .it' keeps getting better and free is always a good price fun .fun.fun.fun.fun.fun.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An enlightening work about the 20th century's greatest inventor.  It covers the villainous behavior of JP Morgan and Edison as they worked to steal Tesla's work and ideas plus their efforts to discredit him.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|I didn't expect much going into this movie and I wasn't disappointed.<br />The CGI was pretty mundane and the story was weak.<br />I'd like to say good summer action flick to watch but it wasn't even that good.<br />.
B002VHI8DG|2.0|A bit disappointing after having read a couple good reviews. Characters are cliché, plot a bit weak, and the author is unsuccessfull in creating much suspense. Ending is also not very original nor surprising.
0316228532|2.0|The spine had damage and there was writing on some of the pages.  The cover also had dirt and wear.  The book can certainly be read, but not suitable for a gift.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I just bought this game. I think its really fun. for all those people out there wondering if this game is worth the time to buy, it is. this game is for people who like racing games. you collect coins to upgrade stuff. I recommend watching the trailer video first before you get it.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I've really missed Star Trek Voyager and am so happy to get it thru Amazon Prime.  Thanks for offering these programs.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Seven are now together. Percy, Annabeth, Piper, Leo, Jason, Frank and Hazel must now set forth from the Roman camp and head to the Old World. To Rome. And they must rescue Nico and save Rome from destruction by giants or else Gaea will rise. In this excellent installment of the series we find ourselves in an awesome-filled tale with many cool encounters. Wondering if Octavian will kill any more teddy bears? Curious to see what Heracles is up to in this day age? Want to know if the Coach will ever calm down? And most importantly, this story shows how Annabeth must follow the Mark of Athena to Rome and find out how to unite the Roman and Greek camps before one falls to the other.<br /><br />But while the story is awesome and full of cool things like merpeople and time travel and Archimedes' lost inventions (seriously, if you love classical history and mythology then you will be rewarded with all the cool stuff found here), what I really enjoy is the whimsical irreverence. Things like a Pegasus attacking your nachos and leaving cheesy hoof prints all over the desk. Or spiders who dream about their artwork hanging in the halls of Olympus and giants who wish to wear tutus and strange ballets. Or a god who prefers diet pepsi over diet coke.<br /><br />Great installment and makes me wish that the next book were already out. Ah well, October isn't too far.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was much, much more than I expected it to be. While the flight itself was nerve-wracking and nail-biting goodness, the aftermath was the emotional heart of the movie. The actors/directors/writers did a wonderful job of making you care about the characters and drawing you into their lives. I cheered and hoped and cried. Excellent!!!
B00005OM4Q|3.0|For the part I played in the purchase of this product, I can only comment on this particular aspect. It was a 'gift request' I secured for a friend of mine. I have never seen the movie itself, nor did I open the package. It went directly to him just as I received it. Subsequently, everything done from my end was more than satisfactory to me, as is the usual and standard modus operandi from the varied merchants utilized by Amazon for the products I have purchased over many years. I always anticipate nothing less...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The shows writing is so good, can't stop watching it! And the amazon streaming is clear and problem free, love it!
B0041D843M|5.0|The science behind the life-extending health benefits of a whole-food, plant-based diet are convincingly argued in layman's language. Combine reading this with Dr. Joel Fuhrman's &#34;Eat to Live&#34; and you will have all you need to avoid or reverse heart disease and Type II diabetes, and lower your risk of getting cancer greatly.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|DVD was less than expected.. but the audio was exceptional.. still give this purchase an overall 5 because of my of of Neil's music
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very Fun! I want more levels. A bit challenging but not too difficult.  Will be looking for more levels to come out.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|I accidentally stumbled across the video of one of the great songs on this album, How to be a heartbreaker, and had so much fun with it that I looked up Marina and her music.  The more I heard, the more that I fell in love.  Her music is fun and happy, while at the same time profound.  I recommend all of her work, especially this album.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Loved the cast, loved the humor, loved the surprise ending!  That's all I can say without really giving it away.  Kevin Spacey did a superb job as always.  Well, they were all good.  I went back and watched it again after seeing the ending.  Too much!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|a bit too much sex for my liking, on the other hand I am most impressed by the thoughts of Ana and the the thoughts sge ascribed to Christian<br /><br />please change my assress &#34; Oysterplates is a friend of mine in Chicago who presented me with 3 books a year ago- you have my adress ion Tel Aviv since you send me mail there<br /> best regards Helga Kronheim<br />I am delighted with the kindle and recommend it to all my friends
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Very enjoyable game with nice graphics and some challenging object usage to puzzle over. Over all a relaxing way to whittle away a few hours.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Highly recommend! Fun and a little challenging! Cannot wait for more levels. Best part was it is free! If you like escape games you wil not be disappointed.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|I really liked this movie.  This movie had a lot of unexpected twists and turns and I loved how it kind of kept you in suspense.  Matt Damon is a fine actor and capable of pulling off any scenario.  You'll love it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I actually ordered both bruno mars album online and love them both, he is an awesome artist and I have listened to this album over and over many times already
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Let me just start by saying \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" is my favorite track off the album.<br /><br />I Honestly dont have a top 5 cause i truly love the whole album,only song i skip sometimes is \\"Born Sinner\\" (featuring @Fauntleroy) cause its slow,and my mood doesnt call for that tempo track,but still a good song,deep in meaning.<br /><br />Musically:Production<br />The production is great,very on point.In the last 2 years its easy to see Cole has learned a lot to progress his production skills. Their arent many,very few & far between MC's who can produce their music on a high level and it carry an album ,which is very impressive. He is the kanye west of my era(im 20 yrs old btw,grew up on Ye,and 90's raps as well).<br /><br />Lyrics: Content<br />The content is impressive,well thought out concepts,inspiration,temptation,struggle and self struggle. Lyrically he has grown,once again easy to spot once the first track Villuminati plays.<br /><br />5 stars,9.5 out of 10 easily for me,best album ive heard since kendrick lamars \\"Good kid m.a.a.d. city\\"
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I couldn't ask for a calculator I like better.The price is certainly right.I especially like the fact it does percentages.Need a calculator? Why not try it.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|These socks are fantastic for the price these are excellent long lasting socks.  Who doesn't love that new sock feeling. I wear
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|music is typical gotye, and this album is awesome.  Would definitely tell family and friends about this album and artist
B0091REZMW|3.0|i like the game, its a lot of fun.  it does crash a lot and it doesnt always reload my energy consistently even when it sits overnight.  i havent had to spend any money yet but im running out of diamonds fast and you need to spend diamonds on many items.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Love this app.  I use it several different ways but my favorite is to monitor what my children are doing on the laptop without me hovering over them.  It is super easy to use!  Log on is quick, controlling the remote computer is easy.  JUST LOVE it.<br />ALSO....Use it in the classroom to see what the substitute may be working on with the smartboard and or on the computer.  Allows me to speak directly to a student while they are working on something as well.  So many advantages to this app.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|There is a ton of action but even in comparison with other die hards this movie falls well short.  Wouldn't pay to watch again
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I wasn't looking for a brilliant movie, just the opposite, something to entertain my brain after a long week.  This movie is awful.  I spent the whole movie wondering why these folks are married and how they wake up every morning.  It was depressing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm OT sure why there are so many unhappy reviewers on this one. I liked it. Yes, I thought it could have been wrapped up in this book. However, Gideon is just so ...hmmm...incredible. Eva actually seemed more mature in this one. Gideon..worth another 2 books!
