B000JIHP88|4.0|This mobile was a pleasant surprise...It actually was as cute as the picture, and the leaves really did move to play peek-a-boo with the dragonfly! The music is gentle, not too quiet or loud. The rain forest sounds are pleasant also. The size is not overwhelming like some of the mobiles I seen. Would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing a mobile....Patricia V.

0312600844|2.0|It's possible the fault is with me rather than the novel, but I just couldn't care less about Patsy, Walter, their neighbors, their children, their problems, moral lapses, etc., etc., ad infinitum.   Reading this book is like reading a sophisticated, at times artistic (some sentences are excruciatingly convoluted)  gossip column.  Whatever happened to novels with a discernible plot, characters with whom the reader can identify, and a thought provoking theme? (I'd even settle for one or two out of the three.)   I'm leaving about a third of the novel unread after thumbing through to the end and realizing the remaining pages are just more of the same.

0671799320|5.0|Daniel Yergin's \\"The Prize\\" is a true prize indeed. What a fascinating book ! I got it as a present in 1996 from a business relation and since then I have read it twice. It is one of the ten best books that I have read in my life, and I have read a lot ! Being 51 years of age now, I grew up with books. Although it might be branded as a \\"history book\\" it certainly doesn't feel and read that way. At more than 900 pages it is a lengthy read. I truly hope it will be available as a Kindle e-book anytime soon so I don't have to carry around this hefty but spell-binding tome when I want to read it for a third time. If you are looking for an understanding of the oil industry  and the global power it exerts in society and politics, I highly recommend this excellent book.
B003X27L9U|3.0|** spoiler alert ** An abduction story that is reminiscent of the Josef Fritzl case. The approach - the story is told in the first person by a child - is powerful, but runs out of steam towards the end. With the benefit of hindsight i'm sure i'll finds it a bit precious, but it was a pleasant read.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I heard so much hype about this book but was disappointed. I was reading, reading, reading and realized that I didnt care about these characters. Disappointing and boring.
1594202842|1.0|I can't express how angry and upset this book makes me feel.    It's because I love my wife and children that I bought this book. I thought it would help me understand of my wife's side of the family--my wife is from mainland China and I'm from Southern California. My wife is similar to Ms. Chua when it comes to mothering (can you really call it that?), and I often have to step in when it becomes too abusive--and it is abusive--don't kid yourself that it isn't. Worse yet is that abused children often become abusive parents, which is why, long ago, I decided to take action and break this cycle of abuse. I've accepted that my wife cannot comprehend my point of view and that I can't understand hers, and I think it comes down to the difference between my Judeo-Christian upbringing based on forgiveness and her Eastern culture based on shame.    You only have one chance at childhood and to steal away the joy and wonder of youth is a shame on the parents. Reading this book I kept thinking to myself, \\"where is the father?\\" So my advice is that you should go ahead and read this book but use it to reinforce how NOT to raise a child.    As Sigmund Freud said, \\"I cannot think in any need in childhood as strong as the need for a Father's protection.\\" I just did not think I would need to protect my children from their Mom!    John Wooden said that the difference yourself today and five years from now is the books you'll read and the people you'll meet. This will not be one of those books.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Using an online name generator is fine if you would like to discover your Jedi, Pirate or Hobbit name (Dotty Willowbottom by the way... It's my hobbit name) On the other hand, movie executives who use it as inspiration for the title of their next motion picture ... That's not okay!  Come on guys!  Quantum of Solace?  I know thinking is hard, but how many Emo Band Names did you click through to land that little gem?  Rage of Equilibrium, Deadly Solitude.<br /><br />All kidding aside, Quantum of Solace is actually the title of a short story by Ian Fleming in which Bond and the governor of Nassau have a discussion about relationships.  The governor says, \\"i've invented a high-sounding title for this basic factor in human relations. I have called it the Law of the Quantum of Solace.\\"  Bond replies, \\"That's a splendid name for it.. Quantum of Solace, the amount of comfort. Yes, I suppose you could say all love and friendship is based in the end on that.\\"<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what that means, I doubt Fleming did either, but it sounds cool so that's where you get the title.  Movie magic.<br /><br />Okay, so fine, that's the title.  I would have gone with \\"Hope Floats, Vespa Sinks\\" but the title is actually more of symptom than the actual problem.  This is an uninspired formulaic sequel to Casino Royale.  I have to believe that the people who gave this movie 5 stars did so for the explosions and cool cars alone, because the story line doesn't live up to the hype.  And here it is:<br /><br />A secret society of water thieves who do terrible, evil things like talking on their cell phones during the opera.  Infiltrating MI6.  And, the big reveal... raising the price of water.  Seriously, they totally double it.<br /><br />**crickets chirping **<br /><br />Not impressed?  I can understand.  Quantum of Solace's villains never really come across as anything more than Enron with guns.  (We're going to hold all of your water in a creepy mountain until you pay us above market prices!)  Compared to other evil plots in past bond movies (e.g., Taking out England from space, releasing the plague) it's kind of a let down.  Is it evil, sure.  Is it... James Bond evil, apparently it is now.  Hopefully the next movie which is set to release in 2012 will be better.  Since Jeffery Deaver has signed on to write the script, i'll go see it (Jeffery Deaver wrote the Bone Collector and THAT I can take measure of comfort in) plus...<br /><br />I can't stay mad at you, James Bond.s in past bond movies (e.g., Taking out England from space, releasing the plague) it's kind of a let down.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thrilling! What an ominous vision the author presents...it's pretty fascinating how technology is advanced but the world is so dark and barbaric. Bizarre to see how they foist the worst of it on, of all people, adolescents like Katniss and Peeta. Can't wait to continue the series and see how Katniss, who is at her nature such a badass rebel (and doesn't even know it) confronts the unfairness of her world and maybe will even bring it all down like she did the games.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is not the funniest show on TV. 30 Rock and It's Always Sunny are funnier. Community comes in with considerably less bite than other shows, but I think it has earned the title of most valuable television comedy. My favorite shows are early Simpsons and Arrested Development, but this show has won me over in a new way. Character dynamics are hilarious and genuine, episodes are mostly unpredictable and I really like these characters. An episode can win on rapid fire wit, charm, wordplay, character resolution, romance, ridiculousness or even a nice moment. Community doesn't get the ratings that it should, but it does try harder than any comedy show. Paintball wars, Charlie Kaufman spoofs, zombies, animated, paradise and space rockets are all places they go. I think the variable in their show is the controlled awareness. Shows that \\"wink-wink\\" too much can dilute the show, but Abed is so perfectly pitched and hilarious. Watch this show, it will grow on you.
B001EOOC3W|5.0|I have loverd Britten ever since I was a child, which was in my pre-Pink Floyd days.  I was thrilled to find this collection, even though I own recordings of almost everything Britten wrote (I must have at least 10 recordings of the War Requiem, my all-time favorite alongside PF's 'The Wall').  I'm a liturgical composer and admire Britten's attention to text scoring.  Well done, Amazon!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|ISSUES/DEBATE  First: complaints over missing CD's and/or songs and poor packaging..only purchase this through Amazon and not the individuals sellers at a cheaper price.  Second:  The issue over Mono versus Stereo.  I have both and I am blown away by the distinguishable voices/instruments in mono.  I also love the new stereo.  I will play some albums in the mono format and some in stereo.  Mono has everything the stereo has but more.  Also rock and roll is about beat and rhythm and the mono crushes the stereo.  The stereo versions need to be remixed with the voices in the center and not so much drastic separation.    MONO VS STEREO  Let me state what probably everyone already knows that mono was the format of the day and the Beatles put all their energy into mixing the mono release.  When stereo hit they passed this task off to others (Martin/engineers) and did not participate, therefore, more care in mono toward details.    HISTORY/FACT  I am old enough and own all of the original mono vinyl records as they were released but I also bought the stereo records when available.  With that stated I never listened to the vinyl mono recordings on a quality piece of equipment as it was simply called a record player with one speaker.  I then purchased the stereo vinyl but listened on that same cheap player.  When I finally bought a quality stereo I could hear the massive separation, which I enjoyed.  Depending on where I sat in the room would determine what I heard and over the years I would also pick up some subtleties.   Sometimes I would listen in friend's homes and the album sounded different never realizing the position in the room determined how much or what I heard.  I spent many hours at night listening with headphone. I then bought reel to reel, 8 tracks, cassettes in stereo versions and listened on good equipment with Koss headphones.  These versions are implanted in my brain forever.      STEREO (REMASTERED)  I bought the remastered stereo Box Set and loved it asI heard the same things but clearer.  Like cotton was removed from my ears.  The horns were brighter and enjoyable. I did hear or notice sounds not familiar to me but basically I heard the familiar sounds just better and clearer.    MONO  When the remastered mono set was released the cost was $400 and I never entertained purchasing as I just do not have the crazy passion I did 40 years ago to just blindly buy everything/anything Beatles.  I really thought mono sound would be inferior and not worth the price for what I thought a novelty item.  I read the reviews stating it was the way to listen to The Beatles but never gave that a thought to purchase but my curiosity was always up.  When The Beatle songs/albums became available on I Tunes the mono box set price dropped to $129   BINGO!  Got it and I would now be able to hear what all the fuss was about.  The first song I went for was Paperback Writer from the Past Masters.  I always thought that was their worst recorded song because the drums where barely audible and the cymbals were not present. That would be my barometer about all the mono fuss.   WOW!  On mono the drums are out front and the voices and the cymbals sound live.  This excited me so much I then started on the albums in order.    The main things noticeable are:  1. THE FOCUS.  Mono is mono and directly in your face/ears no matter your position to the player.  The stereo versions seem to lose or bury some sounds in the panning (separation)  I just never dreamed mono could have the quality of stereo but now the stereo versions sound thinner with the panning or me trying to strain to hear the sounds.  No need for headphones to listen to little subtleties or sounds as it all presents itself in normal listening. YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING!   2. SEPERATION:  This may sound silly but the mono has a sort of separations to the instruments, including voices.  Each sound is very distinguishable.  Crazy!  3. THE VOICES: They sound in the room and very very upfront.4. THE GUITARS. Rich, clear, clean, and bright.  You can hear the tubes in the amps (overdrive)   5. THE DRUMS AND CYMBALS.   Not only do you hear the hit of the cymbal but the entire ringing till the end.  The drums are out front equal to the voices and you can actually hear the snares (curls of metal wires under the drum)      6. INSTRUMENTS:  Actually can hear EACH instrument clearly without listening (if you know what I mean)  7. OVERALL:  POWERFUL.  I know the stereo versions backwards and forwards as I know my own name and listening to these mono CD's are like hearing these albums FOR THE FIRST TIME.  I feel the same excitement as I did when I first put the needle down on the record for the first time on release.  I will now go thru each album in general but you can basically hear new sounds on each song.  IT IS MIXED PERFECT!    HIGHLIGHTS FROM EACH ALBUM:    PLEASE PLEASE ME:  WITH THE BEATLES:  Both of these albums are bright and powerful.....very powerful    HARD DAY'S NIGHT:  Entire album has a powerful punch.    BEATLES FOR SALE  IF I FELL:  John stands out on low melody harmony.  AND I LOVE HER: George's guitar walk in chorus and acoustic guitars clear.  CAN'T DO THAT:  John's voice really stands out.  I'LL BE BACK: Voice is very distinguishable.    HELP (includes stereo version)  Tambourine stands out and when compared to the stereo version, that is included, all the mono songs have a stronger more powerful feel.  The stereo version included sounds thin.    RUBBER SOUL (includes stereo version)   I did and do enjoy the total voice separation on the stereo version because I occasionally listen to just one channel to just hear their voices but......... I am also used to the Capital version with different tracks as I have them memorized in order.  DRIVE MY CAR:  You'll sit up when this album starts  NOWHERE MAN:  I can hear John taking in a breath and that harmonic bell note toward the end is very out front.  WHAT GOES ON:  Excellent but a different ending.  The little classic/traditional guitar ending is gone.  IN MY LIFE:  My favorite Beatles song and great in any format.      REVOLVER:  Cow bells, drums, guitar, cymbals, and voices are very out front and extremely audible.  No need for headphones on this one!  TAXMAN:  Guitar is very crisp and out front.  I'M ONLY SLEEPING:   Backwards guitar starts earlier and different.  AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING: Almost can hear each string on the twelve string.  DOCTOR ROBERT: Reason for the mono.  You'll feel this one.  I WANT TO TELL YOU:  RINGO!  The percussion.  GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE:  The brass is excellent.  SHE SAID SHE SAID:  Drums and guitar jump out and are very clear and crisp.    SERGEANT PEPPER:  Pepper never had the same sound on the guitar and drums as the other albums probably due to the amount of overdubs but very different overall feel on mono.  SGT PEPPER:   Different sounds in orchestra beginning.  You can really hear the rasp in Paul's voice.  George Martin always stated, You can really hear the sawdust in Paul's voice,\\" but I never could.  Can now!  LUCY:  Has two extra beats after the second chorus.  FIXING A HOLE:  You can hear the sock cymbal (very distinguishable) and a double beat on the drum.    GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING:  Extra four \\"good mornings.\\"  SGT PEPPER (reprise):  The guitar and chicken are not one in the same as the stereo version.  A DAY IN THE LIFE:    I finally can hear the chair squeak at the end (fade).  Pepper ends and the backwards sounds on the runoff grove are here and go on for an extended time.  It is Paul saying, \\"We'll F you like superman,\\" which is played backwards multiple times. (Try it)      MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR:  Not many audible difference in this version as nothing really jumps out but......  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR:  You can hear the rasp in Paul's voice.  Same as Sgt pepper.  FLYING:  Can clearly hear all the guitars.  On the stereo always had to concentrate and focus on one or the other.  Drums. And cymbals are biggest difference.  I AM THE WALRUS:  Clean and separation.  After the first, \\"I'm crying,\\" there is no orchestra.  Did you ever notice on the stereo versions that the song changes into mono mid way?  There you go!  STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER:  The cymbal crashing.  ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE:  The chorus sounds different.    WHITE ALBUM (biggest sounding differences)  BACK IN THE USSR:  Beginning is different  DEAR PRUDENCE:  John's voice is double tracked but you can differentiate each voice clearly.  Handclaps are out front, the bass is clear, the horns are brilliant and you can hear the different instruments.  The snare drum is so bright that you can hear the snares (metal strings under the drum.)  BUNGALOW BILL: you can hear the strumming of an acoustic guitar.  WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS:  Damn!  Georges voice sounds so pure as it is way out front in the mix without effects.  You can hear the quivering and normality, if you will, in his voice as not being a true singer.  No fancy tricks to make him sound better.  HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN:  Bass sounds different and drums and tambourine are way out front. Background vocals are so clear and mixed the same volume as the lead that you can hear each Beatle individually.  I'M SO TIRED:  I always thought John double tracked his voice on the chorus but it is clearly Paul and is so cool.  Snare and bass drum are perfect.    PIGGIES:  Now you just don't hear an orchestra, you hear each instrument.  DO IT IN THE ROAD:  Drums sound like in the room.  JULIA: Pure voice.  So personal like he is sitting next to you singing.  YER BLUES:  AWESOME!  My favorite track sounds live like recorded in the bathroom.  I know they cut the track live all together in one small room and you can hear John's voice being picked up by the other microphones giving it a cool effect.  ME AND MY MONKEY:  Not just hear the cowbells, you feel the cowbells.  HELTER SKELTER:  VOICE IS PRESNET and there is no fad out and then fade back in, therefore omitting the \\"I got blisters on my fingers\\" from Ringo.  HONEY PIE:  Guitar sounds different in the middle.  REVOLUTION #9:  Talking in the beginning not on the stereo with a rhythm going on not on stereo.    PAST MASTERS:  CD ONE:  all cleaner, clearer, louder.  CD Two:  DAY TRIPPER:  Guitar even more out front with tambourine.  You'll think it is being shaken in front of you.  WE CAN WORK IT OUT: Cleaner.  PAPERBACK WRITER:  As I stated before there are drums and cymbals on this song.  RAIN: The backward guitar starts early on the mono version.  LADY MADONNA:  Very classic rock and roll beat.....the bass.  REVOLUTION:  You can really hear the distorted guitar as meant to be.  DON'T LET ME DOWN:  John's voice is clearer so more fragile.    PACKAGING:   A-100.  Absolutely beautiful!    SUMMARY:  Sound is different to different listeners and there is no definitive right or wrong because some could simply be use to what they have heard for decades.  But, you will be 100% pleased with the mono set.  On many songs the sound, the feel, the colors seem more vibrant.  This is an emotional purchase for pure dedicated Beatles fans.  If you do not own any Beatles albums then it won't matter.  If you grew up with them and are only use to listening to the stereo version on a quality player then the mono recording will definitely please you.  Not a great investment for happiness!  Beatles fans from way back need both remastered versions (mono & stereo). This is not a knock on the stereo versions just a very positive affirmation toward the mono.  Like the description stated it is for the hard core Beatle fan.    Look, I am sure most of you already own the stereo versions so at the current prices just trust me and get the mono you will not be disappointed.  ENJOY!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Even though they are messing with the tracks by having them flow from one into the next, it is masterfully done.  You gets little dabs of one song mixed in with another.  Must have for anyone that likes the Beatles.  I would say this would be a good Greatest Hits album if that is what you are looking for.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|To be E-v-I-l, you have to have a few things going for you. you need an army, a base, weapons, adn you need to know a lot of other notins. you also need backing from a financial entity, and that sometimes posesa problem. When we pick up this story we see a man that has a great plan and needs more money, but the money seems to be handed over to someone else. The thing is that a great mind has a great plan, and that great mind will not give it up.<br />Is that god? you betcha. It tastes like fun in the sun.<br /><br />When it comes to D.Me, I have Nothing bad to say. i loved this movie when I saw it. It had so many things in it that could be for kids or adults, depending. There were the minions and the things they do; in one point i thought I saw them make an adult reference while they were doing their thing, and that was odd. Still, no kids around me would have understood it and I laughed. I kept laughing as I noticed that this was a creation aimed at taking the life of a supervillian and throwing it out for everyone to see. That make things interesting and trackable, not to mention flow in a different sence. Instead of going \\"to infinity and beyond,\\" we have a cold ray freezing people's heads for the fun or it and his need to get something pricesless.<br />The only thing standing in the way is the warming of a heart.<br /><br />The wya the kids were worked in, the shame boxes, the cookies; all of it had humor but also had a comment there. i liked that because it meant something, too, and it might carry on meaning something in the mind of a watcher. i liked the books and I loved the minions and the way they reacted. Also, the movie was not slow, was great, and I can't think of negative comments.<br />You should really check it out and have fun with it.<br /><br />Thank you for your time
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I'm unable to rate this movie because it came as a DVD showing only the last part of the movie.  The seller could not get me the entire movie since it is a charitable place where products are donated.  I will have to buy it from another from another seller.
0451196716|5.0|I'm not certain what one adds to a book that has already been so widely covered. i know i like this book and then some, perhaps going beyond most of the King novels I have ever had contact with and making it one of the Top 5 he had written. This began a lot like he explained The Dome, with him having an old idea and having it set for quite some time. He eventually returned to the beast and he quickly went to work on it once more. This left something great out there and it left me thinking of just how good it could be.<br /><br />a lot of people have covered the breakdown of the book, editorals included, and i simply want to add a few things. First, I liked the way the atmopshere of this book felt. A few times I actually caught myself wanting to peek ahead just so i would know and have an answer. I did not because skipping here would have been an ugly thing to do, but it was still a thought I was running with. That says a lot about the author to me, and moreso considering I never do anything like that.<br /><br />The characters are top-rate and you really get a feel for them. In some of King's books the background is what merits attention or some item or something else. In his newer books he has gotten the characters and has been able to deliver them fully, and i like that. It was like he realized something and like he managed to put it into something that captures the noise behind the character itself.<br />Its great.<br /><br />You also have the book itself and the plot owering it, and it is a great read. I do not want to spoil anything and would say for review readers to be aware of some of that. Closing, I also want to stress the fact that this is good and that it actually was better a second time around.<br /><br />5/5 strong.<br /><br />Thank you for your time
0307346617|3.0|Not bad, not great either.    I purchased and read Brooks's other title \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" and thought this would be another well thought-out, well written book.    I was right; and that was the problem. It is too well written. It is very dry for the most part; simply people re-telling their trials and tribulations of surviving the zombie apocalypse (hence the title \\"World War Z\\"). The book is EXTREMELY light on action and compelling storytelling. Instead going with a dictation style of writing. Just not my favorite way of reading.    There are a few exceptions to this; of course. I thought the chapter about the people stranded on the International Space Station was well written and showed real emotion. But the rest is simply; this is what happened to me. (end chapter) this is what happened to me (end chapter) etc.    As I said in the beginning. Not bad, not great either.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|What happens when one rumor turns into two rumors and shuddenly you are not the person you see in the mirror? High School - or so the movie seems to suggest. Here we have a teenage girl that supposedly made out with someone - a rumor she started herself - and that gets out of hand. Then another person comes to her and wants her to be his \\"beard,\\" basically offering her money to say things happen. This sets things off and makes it like a train that will derail sooner or later.<br />The problem is that the train itself expects to be fine but what about all the people around her? That and the humor are the thing that make this movie really worthy of watching.<br /><br />To start, Easy A would not normally be my laughtrack. I don't normally go for movies that are teenage, pretend teen, or anything else that might threaten me when I am getting everything together. I can say this, however, and it is simply that this movie was good because it had all types of humor. sometimes this was a direct cause of the Easy A we saw and sometimes it was messing with family. The family unit was a good one and I liked them. There was also alittle thing that happens with the guidance counselor and, honestly, that was rich.<br />I loved it.<br /><br />Sometimes things come together and it is easy to overlook it. I'm glad I didn't and i think you might want to check it out. Know that the movie is about sex, of course, but does not contain things that are past joking. It walks a good line, keeping things funny without trying to actually create the character they talk about.<br /><br />4.5/5 - rounding to 5.<br /><br />Thank you for your time
B000059TFO|5.0|One of the most important movies in the last 25 years, and in the history of cinema itself,  is director Alan Parker's masterpiece on racism in the south in the 1960's. Mississippi Burning (1988) is not only an incredible piece of cinema with some of the most engaging and emotional writing, acting, music, and visuals, it's also a chilling and violent reminder of the absolutely disgusting behavior that human beings are possible of committing. Mississippi Burning shows us an embarrassing part of our American history, just like Schindler's List (1993) shows the equivalent for our world history. Both films do so in a respectful and powerful manner that also shows the love and acceptance that we are capable of when we fight for it and stand up to what we ultimately realize is wrong.<br /><br />This movie is controversial and serious, not exactly a movie one goes to for an escape like movies are so often used for. But movies like this are also one of the most important ways we share and communicate our history in a way that hopefully prevents us from repeating it. While a documentary about the same events in Mississippi Burning could be powerful, its the raw emotional drama and conflict of this film that permanently brands itself on the heart and minds of its viewers. I believe movies like Mississippi Burning not only reflect on our culture, but actually change it forever. I've watched this film at least a dozen times over the past 23 years and I never tire of watching it again. I'm always reminded that my words and my actions as a human being have consequences and influences not only on myself, but on society as a whole. This film is still as relevant, important and interesting today as it was when it came out, and will be for many years to come. And it definitely deserves a stellar remastering and release on blu-ray, hopefully from The Criterion Collection.<br /><br />Led by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, and Frances McDormand, Mississippi Burning is cinematic drama at its best. Hackman is absolutely brilliant, right alongside his incredible performances in Hoosiers (1986), Class Action (1991), and Unforgiven (1992). While he lost out to Dustin Hoffman, who won the Academy Award in 1989 for Best Actor, Hackman was nominated for his lead role in Mississippi Burning and was certainly deserving of winning the Oscar for this role. As Hackman's FBI superior and partner in solving the murders at the center of the story, Dafoe shows every bit of why he is one of the great male actors of his generation as well. The bitter rivalry and unity juxtaposed between these two characters makes for chewy dialogue and thrilling scenes. The chemistry between these two actors and their characters is always palpable, and while they may disagree on how to solve the issues of racism, murder, and violence, they are united on the cause to end them. Frances McDormand, as the Sheriff's Deputy's wife, is the quiet, subtle, southern lady that we would expect, torn between her internal moral beliefs and the external circumstances she is forced to reckon with. Her character's courage and strength comes out over the course of the film and binds you to the complexity of these issues and the amazing fact that we've worked our way through them as well as we have.<br /><br />The script by Chris Gerolmo is extremely well-written with juicy dialogue that pops and sizzles on the screen and feels completely genuine and appropriate. A more conservative writer, and director, might not choose to use the harsh language that was actually used during these times. Gerolmo and director Alan Parker both embrace those words, such as the N-word, as hard as it is to hear them, because they know that this is the only way to communicate on a visceral level that will have a lasting impact on viewers. The ideas, mindsets, words, actions, and behavior of the people portrayed in this movie in the 1960's needs to be real and accurate in order to portray the hard truths of why racism has beenso hard to overcome. When I watch this film, part of me feels proud of how far we've come in the last 50 years, but another part of me feels like we still have a long way to go. Because some of the ideas, mindsets and language in this film are still out there in our culture and around the world. That's a testament to the writing by Chris Gerolmo and the storytelling craft of Parker.<br /><br />Winning the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1989, Mississippi Burning is an incredible looking movie. The production design and photography are completely real, with the time period flawlessly portrayed through the sets, locations, costumes, makeup, and all the other details in the film. While the editing has a few minor flaws that I notice now simply because of my numerous viewings, they never distract you for long because the story keeps moving at a perfect pace. While you might think that a movie like this would be tough to get through at over 2 hours, it zips along fast for me every time, even when I know what's coming up. And a big part of the reason it moves so well, is the score. Music composer Trevor Jones put together one of the most finely matched movie scores of all time. The tone and beats of the music are just so perfectly paired with the editing and the storytelling that it makes me tear up every single time when its supposed to. It's one of the deepest and darkest musical scores, with its often repeating elements that are played over and over again. But that repetition works so well because it ties the various scenes and elements of the film together over its entirety. It's really hard to even discuss it, but when you experience it, you know what I mean.<br /><br />Obviously I have a passion for this film and it occupies a high place in my list of the best movies of all time. It's in my Top 50 and I give the film 5 out of 5 stars. I just can't see any way this film could be any better. There's nothing missing and it is perfect for the story it tells. There really are no equivalent films on this subject matter in my opinion. And if by some chance you or your children haven't seen this film, it's an important viewing (at the appropriate age and maturity level), so that we never see two drinking fountains side by side again they way we do in the opening shot of Mississippi Burning.n I watch this film, part of me feels proud of how far we've come in the last 50 years, but another part of me feels like we still have a long way to go.

B0046JLTCE|5.0|One of th best cd's ever by any metal band. One of my all time favorites had to have the limited edition....
B0047WJ12K|3.0|First, let me say that we liked it.<br />BUT<br />There was something missing.<br />I can't put my finger on it but, it was a very long movie and the payoff at the end was \\"so-so\\".<br />The plot was interesting but, not captivating. I never felt \\"hooked\\".<br />The actors were good - no complaints there.<br />It was a bit long.<br />I guess we were just underwhelmed......maybe we expected too much.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I decided it was time for a new watch and this one caught my eye right off the bat, it's probably that gorgeous yellow second hand, which sweeps somewhere between your standard tick and a smooth Rolex. The band is in fact duel toned as was mentioned by others and its rather shiney. Oddly enough, after I bought this watch I found that I had book marked this watch twice a few years back. It was definitely meant to be. You won't be disappointed. But at the same time I'd rather you didn't buy this watch so then there will be less people with this exquisite timepiece and I'll be all that more original. The price is better elsewhere right now, google it.<br /><br />Well worth the money!
B002ZG9940|2.0|I would have expected a better film with George Clooney.   In all a fairley good flick.  Bought it on demand.
B001JP5JRY|1.0|When Stinson dishes out some lines in the show they are really funny, but the book is not that funny! The Kindle version did not convert the pictures (like the picture when the Kindle goes to sleep) so some of them are barely readable. For those two reasons just one star.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|OK Film but not as good as the first three. Too many special effects  with no simple story line.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|My favorite Mr. Knightley, too!  It is just a joy to watch.   Both Emma and Mr. Knightley in this movie are precisely as I think of them.   I've watched several other Emmas, and this one is very definitely my favorite!      With 150+ reviews, I'm not going to write any more, but really wanted to get my five stars in!
B001TNGOXY|5.0|All I can say is that people were telling me that the movie would only be on DVD. Well one day I was going thru the Blue-Ray section of the Amazon.com and I found it on Blue-Ray. You can't beat that! Thanks Amazon.com
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I thought this was a great start of a series to follow the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series. I highly reccomend it to anyone who liked Percy Jackson or any humorous adventure novel.

B003JTHETY|1.0|Like JUDAS PRIEST, IRON MAIDEN has drifted into the awful sound of \\"Progressive Metal\\"...  They have released nothing like their glory albums of the 1980s (by choice), which is what made them so great.  Both bands have done nothing but attempt to \\"keep up with the times\\" since they reunited.  While I will still go to their concerts, I just get disgusted at their last few albums...  Both bands are done.
1453624910|4.0|This is a sort of gift to the readers of the Nightrunner series from author Lynn Flewelling, a slim volume containing four short stories, a preview passage from the next Nightrunner novel which will be published this coming autumn, and over forty black-and-white pieces of artwork produced by fans of the series. It really is intended for hard-core fans of the series and completists, and not for the casual reader or those who may be new to the series. I suppose I fall into the \\"hard-core fan\\" category; I was very pleased with my purchase!<br /><br />The only drawback, really, is that this is a very quick read indeed (only 100 pages of text); I only wish there were many more stories included. I enjoyed all the tales, but the one which is likely to be of primary interest to fans is the last, which details Alec and Seregil's first nights together as a couple (this picks up the threads of the plot immediately following the end of the text in book 2). Now, in the broadest sense of the term I suppose this book could be considered erotica---three of the four stories contain sexual content. However, this is just about the mildest erotica I have ever encountered; not very explicit at all. So, if you're looking for hard-core action between Alec and Seregil, you may be disappointed. Still, I thought the scenes depicted were very sweet; I really do like this couple. And the content is certainly more explicit than anything that appears in the novels themselves.<br /><br />It was also interesting to read the two stories showing Seregil as a much younger man, when he was very insecure and not nearly as polished and self-confident as he was when the series of novels began.<br /><br />The fan-drawn artwork varies quite a bit in quality, but the best pieces are completely professional, and it's fun to see the different ways readers have imagined these characters.<br /><br />So, a definite recommendation for those who consider themselves serious fans of the Nightrunner books.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|All time favorite KING book! He does not dis-appoint! I became emotionally attached to the characters & felt their fear with them. I must admit I cried at the end which has never happened before! Get to reading!
030746363X|5.0|This book is fun to read. I bought the droid kindle version and love always having it with me. It allows you to highlight items you want to re-read. Hyperlinks go directly to the web site. Very convenient. The pictures and diagrams are included from the paper version. I am inspired to try testing many of these things myself.
B0042LJTQO|4.0|As Alfred Brendel celebrates his 80th birthday this month (on Jan. 5), I was reminded that he is one of the most repackaged pianists of all time. His devotion to Schubert, beginning with recordings from the Sixties, has resulted in a current catalog of forty discs, not to mention half a dozen concert DVDs. There's no need to be captious; he's a celebrated artist, and one can be forgiven for not being able to keep straight such an over abundance of performances. The pianist has written that for him his outpouring of recordings provided a means to track his own musical growth. That's admirable, but frankly, his Schubert sounds much the same over the decades.<br /><br />In this bargain-priced 7-CD set of Schubert's late piano writing (1822-28), Philips did not pick and choose to find Brendel's best of the best. What we have are his early digital recordings from 1987-88 (Brendel has expressed a preference for them), and it's evident that he did not significantly rethink each interpretation, or really need to. To my ears, the whole set sounds like prime Brendel, yet it's only a shade different from Brendel at any time, even the earliest outings. Whatever subtle distinctions his devotees find, they are lost on me. If you begin with the first piece, the Sonata in D, D. 850, his style becomes immediately evident: very clear tone in a bright timbre, minimal pedaling, with alert tempos, clipped attack, discreet rubato, and so on--the familiar Brendel approach in music form Haydn to Liszt.<br /><br />Let me aver that it's a style I tend to dislike, especially in Schubert, where such brittle clarity has the same effect on me as when Boulez applies his intellect like an x-ray technician. Philips doesn't help with sound that is full enough but which retains a hard edge of digital glare at loud volume or whenever Brendel delivers his trademark punch of sforzando. Yet I can stand back and see why his artistry is so admired. There's a purity and honesty that gives us a bracing kind of musical rigor. In that sense, Brendel is a modernist among players of romantic music, as far removed from the Golden Age as any postwar pianist could be. If only it all didn't seem so mental and humorless to me. I feel the temperature in the room drop as soon as Brendel begins to play. There's never a surprise or any real gusto, either, never a moment when he seems motivated by exuberant joy.<br /><br />In the end, I am not the audience for this box set, yet I recognize that Brendel has achieved mastery on the order of, say, Wilhelm Kempff, and even if his blood runs thin, he's positively swollen with passion compared to the Schubert one gets from Andras Schiff and Radu Lupu.  Among recent Schubertians I find myself very impressed by two rising stars, Paul Lewis and Jonathan Biss.<br /><br />P.S. 2013 - As expected, four stars wasn't enough to fend off the ire of Brendel worshipers and a hail of disgruntled Unhelpfuls.of musical rigor.

B003XOAJ7E|1.0|This is from a huge fan. I only had the misfortune of owning this as I was buying the entire catalog in a misguided search for some new sounds. The arrangements of this music have taken great songs with original melodies and muddled them up with a bunch of noise and what's worse - you can tell by the horn sections and high producton values that its not for a lack of budget - these gents have TOTALLY lost the PLOT.<br />The only track on two CDs and a DVD worth keeping was Notorious - and that is one of their most derrivative pop songs. TOTAL CRAP. AVOID.
0060853972|3.0|I think Sir Terry Pratchett is the best writer England produced in the 20th century, hands down.  And I think Neil Gaiman is also brilliant.<br /><br />Which is why I was a wee bit disappointed in this team effort.<br /><br />The jokes are clever, the characters witty, the satire sharp.. but there was not one character in this book that made me really care about him or her.  Terry Pratchett's work fairly bursts at the seams with three-dimensional human (and nonhuman) characters who are smart, dumb, funny, tragic, solemn and silly -- sometimes all on one page.  Neil Gaiman has a deft touch with human beings--witness the opening scenes of Anansi Boys, where he never actually states that his lead character is a black man, but clues the reader in with tiny details.<br /><br />For some reason the characters in Good Omens never quite make it past the 'well-drawn archetype' stage.  I'm not sure why--it might simply be that GO was an early effort on both their parts, or, as a later edition says, \\"this was written before they were Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman,\\" but were only a newly-fledged SF writer and a young journalist.  In either case.. I have the book, I will probably keep it, but if I had to cull my books I would let it go before turning loose of ANY of my other Pratchett books.<br /><br />Worth reading at least once.
B004529NLG|5.0|I pre-ordered this video through Amazon.com just before Christmas.  The video shipped the day the movie was released.  We had the movie in really quick time.  My teenage son loves the Step Up series and absolutely loved this movie.  It is his favorite of the three movies and he's watched it 7 times in two weeks.  It comes with a regular DVD, a 3D DVD, a Blu-ray DVD and a digital copy.  You get a lot for your money with this combo.  Love it!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|It was a great movie before, and now it looks and sounds better than before on Blu Ray. And with the DVD copy, you can pop it in the car or anywhere you don't have a Blu Ray player available.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I personally think both the TV series and the books are incredible stories.  Of course the TV series doesn't exactly follow the books, however, how do you re-create someones imagination perfectly on the screen?  I read the books and let my imagination wander.  I then watched the series.  At first I was somewhat disappointed that it didn't follow along, however, I found it added a new dimension to the whole story.  Either way, it was a lot of fun.  I don't think it's fair to bash the TV show like some are doing, but everyone has their own opinion.  Enjoy either way!
B00304RMFE|1.0|This is the worst animation I've ever watched till date and yes I'm over 30. Basically, the story proceeds with human evolution in documentary style.<br />Story or script, is complete failure. After hundred thousands years, soldiers still utter 'Oh Jesus' in dire situation(every civilization so far don't track history more than say at least 1000 years, We don't know who was there before Jesus, but this animation simply assumes you a moron). I know it's just a figment of someone's imagination but presented in very haphazard way. At least they could have added some relevancy of the facts, that would have made it much watchable. And, if you have migraine, I'm pretty sure, this will give you good migraine attack if you keep watching that stupid watercolor style blurry, eye straining animation somewhere in the beginning. Furthermore, there are different stories attached, so, you will end up being clueless what did you just watch? My recommendation, throw it in the garbage if you are introducing yourself to HALO who has never heard of it before, played games whatsoever.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|While I enjoyed Frozen for its intense and gripping story, I also couldn't get past some rather unconvincing elements in the film. The actors are believable, but they do things that seem very abnormal. I will provide a list.<br /><br />THE CONS<br />1) It's freezing out and yet the character are sitting with there faces exposed and even have their coats zipped down to expose their bare necks!? Any normal person would cover as much of their bare skin as possible. A wool hat can be stretched down to cover most of your face and those ski jackets have huge over sized collars that will cover up half of you head. This really took me out of the film as it just seemed very unrealistic.<br /><br />2) When the plow is right under them they do not react normally. If you believe you're stranded, you thrown things at the window of the plow which is right below you! HELLO! .....not a glove a freakin' ski pole right through the window!<br /><br />3)Jumping from the Ski lift!? OK... The first thing I thought of was to climb the cable back to the ladder on the support pole. If you were to jump you would at the very least hang down by your hands on the seat or someone's legs, maybe even make some sort of rope from your scarves to make the jump 40 feet instead of 60 feet.<br /><br />4) When the girl falls asleep, she has her bare hand on the metal bar instead of her gloved hand?<br /><br />There are more little instances like these that keep this film from being as good as it should have been.<br /><br />THE PROS<br />1)Intense moments with fairly solid acting.<br /><br />2)Solid effects and fast paced story.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT!****<br /><br />3)People get eaten by wolves!<br /><br />*****END OF SPOILER*****<br /><br />I know that it's only a movie and I enjoyed it regardless of its flaws, but if the filmmakers had thought this one out a little better, this could have one of the most unforgettable thrillers in a long time.<br /><br />Open Water is a much more believable film and much better too, but if you like these types of films this one is certainly worth checking out.
0307588343|5.0|Lawrence McDonald's book provides an opportunity to view the financial crisis through the lens of a employee at ground zero of the meltdown: Lehman Brothers. The unvarnished views of the strategic direction authored by the top floor at Lehman lead to an understanding of the root causes of the crisis that produced the worst global economic collapse since the Depression. As an on the scenes account, the book is written in a fast paced readable style reminiscent of a well done thriller novel. However, it at the same time provides a deeper understanding of the events leading up to 2008. This is my favorite of the many financial crisis books.
B003YUC9JI|3.0|A 12 year old wonders around China and learns karate. The story is a little of a stretch. Chan is a good drunk and as good as ever. Smith plays his role well if not a little too cocky but you knew that was how that was going to go. Nothing surprising but a fine family evening movie. My black belt son thinks the karate looks too fake but I don't have the eye to see that.
1594202842|1.0|1.  Her relationship with her children is nothing to brag about I am told and exploiting them in this way for her own vanity is shameful - were she even anchored in human development scholarship.  Mommy Dearest and The Great Santini  profiled abusive models of parenthood by angry vain people who did not need to be Chinese to be abusive.     2. The last place her eldest daughter needed to go was Yale (early decision) where she can still suffer under Mommy's chilling control instead of making her own life decisions.     3. If school drama is so bad a use of time , why did she marry a very successful guy who studied it for years?     4. She not only belittles drama and play but with the supporting part of Villager # 6 mocked, it seems she feels President Obama belittled himself as just one of 100 senators, like JFK or Ronald Regan or FRD having been one of 50 governors and just should have avoided such little jobs and run for president like Ross Perot.     5. Speaking of belittling intellectual fields, it seems that she's not studied Piaget or any development psychology on the role of play - or ethologist on why all mammals across species practice play as part of learning.     6. If she allows nothing less than perfection, how did she miss out on getting a rare \\"Summa\\" from Harvard instead of own far more common \\"Magna\\" distinction?      7.She values scholarship but how does she feel about the reception of her own prior work minimizing the value of global democratization by sociologists, political scientists, and economists having chosen to publish in those fields with no scholarly training in those fields?  If she were not at Yale - albeit just a lawyer - no one would ever have paid attention to this angry rant.     6. If no Chinese mother could imagine their children getting anything less than an \\"A,\\"  is the grade inflation in China off-the-charts? I won't bother with Einstein's failure in geometry or J.K Rawlings initial failed literature efforts.     9.  She should read Jim Gleick's book GENIUS on Richard Feynman, Harold Bloom's own study of creative minds also GENIUS,  Howard Gardner's EXTRAORDINARY MINDS; Joseph Campbell's HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES ; James Watson's THE DOUBLE HELIX;  Lev Vygotsky's classic work on the serious learning through play - or - of course John Dewey's classic work  to see how differently creative minds really develop - using self-direction;  initiative, free choice, failure; empathy, resilience; serendipitous discovery etc. as essential experiences poor Amy and her kids seems to miss out on in their rehearsal grind of rote repetition mimicking the creation of others.   Those Beatles \\"tribute\\" bands at bars are hardly a replacement for the original.     10. It is also noteworthy that Chinese business titans and Chinese university leaders come to the US - not to learn about more technical proficiency but about how to foster creativity and innocation.     11. She might be interested to see how condemned she is on the blogs by\\" genuine Chinese mothers\\" raised in traditional Chinese families - both immigrant and resident Chinese.     12. It is astounding how someone - empowered with a JD - can seize the ownership and credibility of the platform of Yale and presume instant global authority in fields where she has no training.  I wonder what her opinion is of  -the new solar system with five planets just discovered this summer or  -her view on peripheral lung adenocarcinomas using new CT findings related to tumor doubling, or  -cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate.as a  promising new scintillator or  -; the role of risk aversion, in driving a wedge between market prices and probabilities in various derivatives markets or  - If, at a speed of 7 gigabits per second, WiGig can easily handle the transfer of high-def video topositions it as a replacement for wired HDMI connections or optical audio cables.

1592533868|3.0|This book is full of amazing quilling.  True works of art that show that the author is amazingly talented.  However, upon selecting a project to start, I noticed that the length of the quilling strips used are 10 5/8 inch (27 cm) long.  It's difficult to find quilling supplies let alone strips that are pre-measured to that length.  This meant cutting down strips to 10 5/8 inch long.  The author then has us divide the strips into 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 lengths claiming that \\"this method is easy to pick out the desired strip length without having to use a ruler\\".  This may be true, but involves several hours beforehand of using a ruler to not only cut my strips to 10 5/8 inch, but also down into further lengths.  This really complicates things and seems unnecessarily time consuming, even for quillers who have gobs of patience.  After cutting strips down, I started to put together the designs and some lengths still didn't seem right.  One pattern in particular was quite a bit larger than the photo.      Maybe for a more experienced quiller this book would be good, but as of tonight, I'm thinking it might make a beautiful addition to my coffee table.

Waking Life will answer the questions that you have about life and some that you did not know that you had. The film is animated, so it is easy on the eyes and the character deliver plenty of comic relief. The laughter is sweet coating on the pill guaranteed to cure apathy or ignorance. Waking Life is a small powerful film that will travel \\"straight to the head\\" as the young people say.

0545123275|5.0|I loved this book! The author managed to weave an intriguing story with distinct and lovable characters and a gripping plot. Her use of language is beautiful and poetic. She is skillful enough to make the switching of narrators feel seamless, while maintaining their individual voices. This is a book that makes you feel as if you live and breathe with the characters. At times it made me laugh out loud. At times it made me cry bitterly. Books like this make me love reading. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next installment!

0312360258|1.0|I read books 1.-6. of the \\"House of Night\\" series and kept hoping for it to get better. It does not get better! Each following book keeps leading the reader through the same old plot with increasingly more frustratingly behaving characters. The grammar is awful and the vocabulary, which apparently attempts (and fails) to imitate the speech of a typical teenager, is appalling. What made me dislike this series most is the lead character. With each passing book I hated her more - this girl keeps making bad and utterly stupid decisions. She has less and less redeeming qualities as time passes and I found myself wishing for the author to kill her off already. At times I actually found myself screaming at the book out of frustration. I simply could not believe the amount of stupidity that can fit the page of a book.    This series earns the one star from me for two reasons: 1) It managed to fool me into reading 6 books with a misguided hope for improvement. I assume that I was blinded by the obvious potential of the story that was hidden beneath the horrific writing. I'm sorry and ashamed that it took 6 books for me to finally give up and admit defeat. 2) Aphrodite - the only character that was believable and refreshingly non-moronic 100% of the time. All of the characters could have been wonderful with much better writing and a whole lot less brainlessness. What a waste!     I thank my lucky stars that I didn't buy these books and could borrow them from the library instead. At least I didn't spend any money on this crap!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|This box set has the done one of the best shows to ever come out of sci fi justice. It is complete in every sense spanning all four seasons to include the two tv movies razor and the plan. It is a show that is a must see for anyone calling themselves a science fiction junkie. And if you don't have them on dvd or blu ray this is the best boxset out their.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Step into the enchanting world of Beatrix Potter! Meet her friends, which are her drawings come to life. Though Beatrix is expected to marry well, she rejects all of the rich suitors that the well meaning Mrs. Potter shoves her way. Beatrix dreams of marrying because she loves the man, not to be a silly girl who marries because all the other girls do. When her mother gives up on Beatrix marrying, Beatrix doesn't seem to mind. She buries herself in her art and writing her little stories. Beatrix dares to dream that her \\"creation\\" called Peter Rabbit is publishable.  After visiting many publishers, she is finally accepted at Warne publishers. But Beatrix soon learns that the publishers have ulterior motives for accepting her book. The two Warne brothers give the \\"bunny book\\" to their younger brother, who insists on joining the family business. The \\"bunny book\\" is a project to keep their dear brother from botching other things in the company. Enter Norman Warne.  Norman however is aware of his brothers intentions, and is determined to prove to them that he is a good business man. Upon looking at Beatrix's book he is enchanted. He tells Beatrix that they will make a \\"bunny book\\" to proud of. Thus Norman Warne wins Beatrix's confidence in his abilities. Through their work together their romance begins. It is sweet and innocent, and strong as it stands the test of both her parent's disapproval and  society's disapproval. The music and the sets and costumes are quite beautiful and lend credence to the time period.  I especially loved the music box, dance scene. Through it all Beatrix becomes the most well known children's author of her time. She opens a new chapter in children's literature and illustrating. I definately reccommend this movie!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I was always a little afraid of the first season, i didn't watch it on TV and most first seasons on TV the character development takes a while. I got this as a gift and was pleasantly surprise at how good it was! Penny is introduced to all their little quirks for the first time and it's hilarious to see it all unfold. A solid first season!
0525951652|3.0|This book was well-written and very reaching in its scope, but I couldn't help feeling a tad disappointed. There were just too many characters--it was too hard to get attached. I definitely enjoyed the storylines, though. Here's hoping the next book will be better--or at least that it will be *shorter* and split into 2 500 page books instead of one massive 1000 page one.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I followed this show during the original run starting with the mini-series.  Back then, I was stuck with standard definition broadcast quality.  For the last season of its run I was able to enjoy it in HD broadcast.    Even at the current price, the complete series on Blu-Ray is an excellent deal.  The picture during these early seasons that I've watched so far has generally been fantastic, although there have been some cases in brightly lit seasons where there is a lot of visual noise in the background.  However, these have been few.    There are very few cases when I will by a television series like this.  This collection is one worth owning and one that I look forward to experiencing again and again over the years.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|First Preface: This movie was so entertaining at so many different levels that I wish Amazon could organize their movie reviews in a more dynamic way so I could \\"get at\\" the more interesting, insightful ones faster.    Second Preface: I was angry and embarrassed when Hollywood saw fit to give \\"American Beauty\\" the Oscar for Best Picture and then claim the award was all about the film's \\"transcendental irony,\\" \\"magical realism,\\" etc. \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is several times cleverer and more transcendental (magical? surreal?), and not so much as a whisper of attention that I am aware of. Never mind that \\"American Beauty\\" came out several years before this one. They should have passed over \\"American Beauty\\" anyway and held out for something that was REALLY entertaining, uplifting, AND truly out-of-the-mold, avant garde, etc.    I bought this movie after enjoying Maggie Gyllenhaal in \\"Secretary\\" opposite James Spader. When I want to see more of a particular actor after seeing one of their films, I look them up on Amazon and read the reviews of the films with the best average ratings. For Gyllenhaal, \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" attracted my attention and the list of other actors in the film sealed the deal.     As others have noted, five minutes into this movie I knew I was going to REALLY LOVE it. Everybody was photographed so well. The writing was superb... as was every actor's performance.    Some other points worth mentioning:    1. As full an experience as this film was/is, the extras made it that much more so. Generous, illuminating, and a completion of an already superb experience.    2. The integration of GUI-style graphics in this film broke new ground in my experience by adding a whole new layer of information about what the main character is thinking as he is acting, AND being narrated by the voice-over of Emma Thompson's character. How RICH and COOL is that?! Previously, a similar GUI device was used in the \\"Terminator\\" to underscore the fact that \\"The Arnold's\\"character was a cyborg. USed her with a human, it added an extra dimension of description of the (human) character. Given a choice, this film buff would prefer to see this device explored more fully by Hollywood than the rehash of 3-D.    3. I am intrigued by one of the opening scenes in which Ms. Thompson's character steps off of a tall building. I knew she was going to do it, but I could not look away. Once it became clear that the author with writer's block was not deceased, I am at a complete loss as to why it is in the film... all the more reason to watch the movie a seccond time in as many days.     4. Maggie Gyllenhaal does not disappoint. Quite the opposite. Who is this woman? In an effort to find out, I'm going back for another of her movies. Also, as a result of her perrformance in this movie and \\"Secretary,\\" I will trust the next movie that comes out with her in it... I trust her judgement that much... first rate... ditto the director.    5. For me, this movie was wonderful in the same strange and magical way as M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Lady in the Water\\" and I hope to discover others situated in this odd nether world between realism and surrealism... perhaps I will give Robin William's \\"What Dreams May Come\\" another viewing.    6. After a few days and a reading of Henry David Thoreau's essay, \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" I have an elevated appreciation for the subtext of civil disobediance undertaken by Miss Gyllenhaal's character, and by the choice to write the hero as a functionary for the IRS. As described by Thoreau, Ms. Gylenhaal's character is Thoreau's avatar in her insistance on living her life from the inside-out, and resisting the government's interest in her support for policies with which she disagrees (implied by her refusal to pay her taxes in proportion to the size of the government's expenditures for things with which she disagrees). Likewise, the fact that she becomes involved with (in essence) a tax collector who is more machine than man makes this association even more compelling. Any reading of Thoreau's essay will convince the reader that it was a powerful influence that shaped this story line. Interestingly, this is only hinted at in the special feature commentaries by Miss Gyllenhaal.
142311339X|5.0|I had really been looking forward to The Lost Hero since I finished the Percy Jackson series.  I had left school during break to go buy it. Once I got back to school, and was supposed to be doing school work I had this urge to just pick up the book and start reading.  Which I did on several occasions.     I loved that there was Piper's, Leo's, and Jason's point of views (in different chapters) throughout the book.  And that it didn't just focus on one person. And that there's some Roman mythology in the book too!    But my first impression of The Lost Hero was that it had an awesome cover, and that it was huge (500 and something pages).  Then I started reading it and the pages just flew by.  Then I got to the end, and really wanted to read the next book.
B0041KKYEW|3.0|Black Swan was a very strange movie-going experience for me.  I was moderately interested in what was going on during the whole duration of the film & never felt bored...yet, I left the theater not really \\"liking\\" the movie.  I felt that Aronofsky shot the film beautifully & the performances were mostly good.  However, there were several things going on that just annoyed the hell out of me.  Aronofsky's seamless transitions from \\"reality\\" to \\"delusion\\" felt very gimmicky like his sole purpose was to trick the audience rather than further the development of Portman's Nina.  Speaking of Nina, I found the character incredibly one-dimensional.  Yep, we get it: she's an repressed obsessive nut job who loves ballet dancing.  That's all her character is or will ever be in the context of this film & that's laid out for us in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The remainder of her story is just flogging a dead horse.  Every person in the audience knew that she would eventually \\"find her dark side\\" when LeRoy goaded her about being too innocent during the audition.  And could the character be more insipid???  I just wanted to smack her at least a dozen times.  She needed a lot more moments like the drunk scene, which is when I thought Portman was at her best here.  Kunis was fair as Lily.  Hershey was acceptable as the mother.  Again, the development of these characters was only hinted at just enough, but never were they allowed to be fully explored.  The one character/performance I thought was really good was Cassel as LeRoy.  I thought he nailed the part, deftly shifting between motivator & critic, friend & foe.  On the whole, I can't say I hated this movie, but it (and Portman's performance) certainly did not live up to the hype.

3551354014|5.0|I have always wanted to be able to read in another Language and I love the HP books in English. This book combines the Great HP story with German making it a fun way to learn another language and to read HP. I would recommend getting the HP books in German or any other language you are interested in and learn to read in that language in this manner.     I do suggest that you dont cheat and use the English HP books as a guide because the sentence structure in German will then be very confusing. Grab the HP German Book, A good German Dictionary and have fun. :)

B000DZIGDU|5.0|I am the wife of a soldier, and I highly appreciate this movie for showing how war really is. I have been through the waiting on the other side of the world like so many women. And this movie reminded me in so many ways of how the war messed with our heads. My husband has been in many war zones many times and I know reality is waiting and waiting. These guys spend a lot of time in their heads. It is hard! This movie is the best war movie I have ever seen. Thumbs up!
0143034901|5.0|There are many great novels out there that I have enjoyed reading.  But very few that I have enjoyed as much as this a novel.  The characters were so compelling and so real and detailed that I just couldn't put the book down.  The setting and the detail of Barcelona was just so vivid I felt like I was right there with the narrator.  I cannot wait to get my hands on the rest of the authors works.  If you are thinking of getting this novel DO IT!!!!

This musical is fun, humerous, and has you humming the songs all day.  Great buy.
1439107955|4.0|No doubt there are many researchers in the world looking to understand  the biology of cancer and to find therapies of all sorts. There is also a lot of money, from governments and NGOs, invested in the research and more money industry is investing. If you think about the incredible amount of money invested so far, the Return of Investment doesn't seem to be a very good one, not taking into account the value of life itself.<br />Reading the book, I found two issues that jump to my mind. The process by which discoveries are taken to the clinic seems incredible prone to pure luck. What if Slamon would have been discouraged by Genantech and did not push it forward? How many other \\"Slamons\\" are there that were discouraged by companies or institutions and gave up? How much knowledge is already there that, since it is probably unconventional for its specific time, it is disregarded? From the book I infer that most of the advances result from specific individuals that keep things  going, sometimes with good results and others with not-so-good results like Bone-Marrow transplants and others. If we want to increase the rate by which advances are brought to the clinic, shouldn't we have a good look at the whole process from idea (or hunch) to clinical trials, FDA approval and therapy?<br />The second issue is funding. All the researches had to have funding to conduct their experiments, in the lab and in the clinic.  Government and NGOs give a lot of money for research, but how is it distributed? And then the costs of clinical trials? Isn't that huge cost a serious impediment? I don't know the answers to the questions but seems to me that without answering them we are slowing down considerable the advances in dealing with Cancer.

0385040253|5.0|I have owned Ashley's book for over 4 decades and have found it to be the bible of knot books.  All other knot books I have read pale in comparison.  I still find myself refering to it for a specific knot in an application.    As some reviewers have noted, there is some repitition.  There are a couple reasons for this; 1) some knots covered are combinations of other knots; and, 2) Ashley not only explains how the knot is tied, but also different vocations/instances where the knot was traditionally used, which are in different sections of the book.    Another critical issue brought up by some reviewer's is the the appear's to be geared toward those with previous knot tieing experience.  True, there are some very complex knots and rope work contained with the pages, in fact quite a bit.  However, the book begins with the basics, such as a simple overhand knot and moves on from there.    Of particular note is the use of drawings as opposed to photograph's, making the illustrations easy to follow.    If you're looking for an all inclusive, easy to follow book of knots, this the only one you will ever need.
006123141X|1.0|This book convinced me to make a charity donation to my library; I gave all my other James Rollins books to them.<br /><br />This book is equivalent to the old cowboy serials in the 1950s.

Then it happens again and again until the last chapter and the good guy wins.<br /><br />I don't think it takes much to write these books;<br />  1. Think of some way to destroy the world that makes no sense<br />  2. Create a hero and some very nasty villans<br />  3. Place the good guy in a situation that he barely escapes<br />  4  Repeat step 3 for 500 pages<br />  5.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I almost never write reviews on here, but after reading several negative reviews I felt like I needed to because many were looking at this series in the wrong way. As my title suggests, the biggest mistake a person can have going into this series is to compare this to Band of Brothers (BoB from here on out). I will get to the differences soon enough, but that mindset seems to have been in far too many people's heads and caused several to judge this series unfairly. I do want to make it clear though that I'm a huge fan of both the film and book version of BoB.    First off, I watched this on Blu-Ray and it's a great example of why the format is so impressive. The audio and visual quality presented on the set is top notch and will give any high-end system a good work out. This cinematography here is of excellent quality and a big reason to why it pops visually so often. It is practically required at this point for any war film to have excellent audio and a great score, and this series is no exception especially if listened to in DTS on a high-end system. Basically the transfer here is how the series was intended to be viewed and it does it justice.    The Pacific though is a great series with some flaws. The series focuses on three Marines' stories during their time in the Pacific theater of WWII. Problem here is that the three generally never fight together, nor are they for the most part in the same unit. This forces the series to jump between a few different groups and leads to characters not always being fully developed. The series tries to combat this problem by focusing generally only on one soldier and maybe cut to one of the other soldiers from time to time. I felt like this worked well, but not at first. In my opinion the first few parts were difficult to understand because many of the characters were two dimensional and forgettable, and by the time you get to know them the series moves onto the third soldier and most of the original characters aren't broughtup again till the final part. If my review was based on the first four parts though, this series would be given about 3 and a half stars. Once Eugene Sledge is introduced though, the series begins to find it's own voice. Sledge's segments were some of the most memorable and emotionally wrenching interpretations of war I've ever seen on film. I'd strongly suggest that if you have mixed or even bad feelings of this series during the first four parts, at least watch to part 5 and I think you'll see the series begins to pick up more. I don't want to ruin anything though as the series does begin to make the audience care about these characters much better here on out and it is better to simply watch it all develop rather then read on it.     Now to deal with some of the criticisms. Like I said before, this isn't BoB, but unfortunately many people went into this series thinking otherwise. I noticed several negative reviews saying that this was a poor representation of the war in the Pacific and that several scenes were gratuitous. Many reviewers particularly cited the few sex scenes toward the beginning of the series and the amount of vulgar language used throughout. First off, this is a mature series and not intended for younger audiences. Secondly, I personally felt these scenes were not unnecessary and were helpful in developing the characters. Thirdly, find me a mature war movie without vulgar language and then you can maybe cite this as a reason. Even then I'd still argue it because these soldiers aren't saints and vulgar language is going to occur amongst a group of men, especially given the circumstances. BoB is often cited by these reviewers as a shining example of a series without these but apparently many reviewers forgot that these things occurred in that series too. It may not have been on the same level, but sex was discussed and presented in the film and it had it's own fair share of cursing throughout.    Lastly, several mention the historical inaccuraciesand the differences between the novels the series is based on. This is easy to address. First off this is not a documentary, this was made for entertainment so some liberties are going to be taken if it helps tell a more complete story. Secondly, even if some events portrayed by the characters in the film didn't happen to the real people the series is based on, they likely happened to other marines and the series is simply trying to convey the emotion and events that occurred outside of the main characters.      To end this off, I felt that this series was great in it's own right. I believe many people went into this series with the wrong state of mind and many were disappointed in how it turned out. Unfortunately this caused many others to miss out on this series altogether because they were told it sucked. I'm here to say it didn't and that it stands right alongside BoB as a great interpretation of the second world war. If you have any interest in this series, give it a chance and watch the entire thing and I promise it'll be worth it in the end.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Nothing but a Dances with Wolves remake,(by the way Dances with Wolves is 100 times better than Avatar anyday.) I went to the theater to see this movie, I left when i saw it was nothing but a remake of Dances with Wolves. Whats really cool about this movie is the Academy Awards/Oscars knew what this movie was, GRATS and THANKS to them for knowing. If you really want to see this movie for what it is watch Dances with Wolves (Winner of seven Academy Awards®, including Best Directing and Best Picture) By the way Dances with Wolves just came out on Blu-ray (Dances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Extended Cut) [Blu-ray] (1990)).
1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua has written an authentic, funny and self-deprecating parenting memoir. This is not a guide on how to raise your children, nor does she suggest that it is. And, contrary to some comments found on the internet, Chua does not declare anywhere in this book that the \\"Chinese\\" parenting model is superior. Rather, the book is a moving portrait of her evolution from her initially very strict parenting view to a more nuanced approach - as can be seen from the book's very cover in which she highlights how she was \\"humbled by a 13 year old.\\" This is a hilarious, beautifully written, and touching story filled with love and high hopes for one's children (which pan out, as can be seen in the book and in the interviews Chua and her daughters have done). It is a wonderful read and I devoured it in a matter of hours. I highly recommend this book - the excerpts and articles about the book have generated a lot of publicity but do not capture the author's parenting evolution. Only Chua's witty, unflinchingly honest, and tongue-in-cheek descriptions throughout can convey this to her readers.

0786955554|5.0|I have been a GM for some 20+ years and I remember when the very first tile set came out.  A friend of mine picked it up and we used it to plan out maps (before that it was a mat and a dry erase marker).    The one downside to the original tile set was how few tiles it gave you, and how it only gave you one blank dungeon floor tile.    When I heard they were making this set, I was a bit skeptical at first.  I didn't want to put down the money if it was going to just be a reprint of how the first \\"dungeon tiles\\" set was going to be.    You are given a lot of tiles in this set!  And, on one side of just about all the tiles is a blank dungeon floor!  That's right, nothing is on it!  Now, I can make a dungeon on the fly with these tiles and have the image on the tile actually be a feature of the room, but not everyone can do that.  So, if you want a featureless room, you can make that now with these tiles.    Yes, there are reprints from older sets, such as Arcane Towers and Halls of the Giant King.  But, even if you have those sets, this set is still worth it, for the extra tiles.  I am considering getting a second set so we can have enough tiles for our table.    The box the set comes in is rather durable and can carry the set easily.  Unlike previous sets which had no such feature, you could easily fit this tile set and another \\"standard\\" set.  It just makes it easier to transport your tiles to wherever you may game with your group.    Now for some bad news; they do give you a few black squares, which seems like a bit of a \\"cop-out\\" to me.  I could go and just get some black paper and cut squares if I wanted a black square or two.  Also, they give you two \\"element\\" tiles - both reprinted from Streets of Shadow.  Why you would need a whirlpool or a fire square that big is beyond me.  I personally would have like to have seen the altars from Fane of the Forgotten Gods reprinted, or some of the tiles from Arcane Corridors brought back.    I would still recommend pickingup Arcane Towers as a complimentary set to this one.  With Arcane Towers, you can make a circular tower in addition to a dungeon.  Is it necessary?  No, but it helps round out this set.  Still, this set gives you plenty of dungeon tiles to make a dungeon for any game.  I would recommend this set for any GM - new or experienced, whether you already own some tiles or this is the start of a collection for your group.
1416972250|5.0|This is actually my first review but this series has been so good that I felt I needed to share with the world. I highly suggest this book to all.  The characters have depth that I don't often find in books (it's as if the author could answer any question about these characters from their name down to their favorite breakfast cereal). The plot and romance is believable and not shallow (for a change from many YA fantasy books including the paranormal).
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love how all these people call the Hollywood studios greedy for their high prices. These are probably some of the same people who download pirated copies online, the very reason most of these studios charge such high prices these days. Get over it kids, it's just the world we live in now, twenty dollar cds and fifty dollar tv shows are par for the course now.    Anyway, this is a truly superb show, one I would recommend to zombie fans and dramatic tv fans alike. All signs show that fans of the comic won't be so jazzed, but nothing new there. I have several films based on books and I make it a rule to watch the film first... always. I thought everyone had that rule...

1594202842|3.0|It is understandable that reviewers who do not share anything in common with Chua's background (personal, ethnic, social, etc.) would have difficulty approving of her professed behavior as a parent.     To those readers who have complaints about generalization and one-dimensional stereotyping, testifying all kinds of valid exceptions, let it be noted that Chua clearly and emphatically expresses her awareness from the opening.    As an 2nd generation Korean-American, I can relatively empathize with her story. I was not at all appalled by her treatment of her daughters, her generalizations, her tone, etc. My only indignation is that Amy Chua is a snobby, egotistical, ivy-educated, snoot. Good for her.    Everyone is entitled to their own definition of success. I suppose drastic assertions create more controversy and therefore sell more books. Nonetheless, reading this was more patronizing than inspiring. And we all paid her for it.
0307272702|3.0|This book is well written and I found Gary's arguments to be well formed and sound. I think Gary's suggestions of foods to eat and foods to avoid eating work and work well to allow one to lose weight and reduce the risk of developing forms of illness (particularly cancer, heart disease and diabetes) that he discusses throughout this book. I've experienced the benefits of lowering my consumption of carbohydrates while simultaneously increasing my consumption of meats (primarily chicken and fish (salmon, mahi-mahi, sardines in spring water)). The benefits have been increased \\"steady\\" physical and mental energy throughout a day, a leaner, more lithe body and reduced cravings for carbohydrates. And so, basically, I agree with what he wrote throughout the book, especially based upon my diet/nutrition experiences.    The problems I have with a meat based diet aren't due to what Gary wrote in the book, but what he left out of it. Granted, I don't feel a writer can, or necessarily should, include every possible factor involved with an issue s/he is arguing. But the fact that he avoided discussing the environmental impacts of a meat based diet (degradation of topsoil, waste runoff, increased use of grains fed to animals), it's public health consequences (massively increased spread of antibiotic resistance in humans) and it creating increased suffering for animals being eaten are to me major weaknesses of the diet he promotes. I know I'm going to take some heat from folks reading this review due to my concerns here, but these issues are simply too important to avoid discussing, as they are immensely magnified by the fact that there are over six billion human beings now living on earth. I mean, sure, I'd like to eat meat a lot more than I presently do because it tastes damn good and provides the multiple health benefits Gary writes about. But this isn't the year one when there is estimated to have been 300 million people living (20 times less than the number of people presently living) or even 1750 when there is estimated to have been 795 million people living (eight times less than today, see [...]). That makes a much, much larger impact on our environment, and especially so if many more of most people alive were to wholly adopt Gary's diet recommendations. I think Gary underestimates, or simply hasn't estimated through a cost benefit analysis, these factors that are involved (despite his lack of addressing them) in his diet recommendations. And I guess I just can't dismiss the gnawing feeling I have that animals killed for eating do suffer greatly, and more often now due to the increased number of people consuming them. I just can't ignore that, even though I like to eat them, there are clearly severe consequences to doing so. And I think it's important to allow oneself to experience these conflicting thoughts and feelings regarding the consumption of meat, even while eating it. It's easy to take an extreme position on anything, including what type of diet is best for people's well being, and that's not my intention in this review, nor do I think it's Gary's intention in this book. But the consequences, the problems created by hundreds of millions/billions of people eating a meat based diet, remain for us to ponder and hopefully resolve.    And so I recommend that you read the book for the good things it can offer for your life, but I also recommend that you challenge yourself to consider the issues he has failed to address. I mean, how do we reconcile these conflicts regarding the benefits and the detriments of a meat based diet? And, I welcome Gary and others to comment on and address these issues here or elsewhere, though I hope that comments on this review (if any are written) don't devolve into a meat versus vegetable diet \\"thing\\", because that's honestly not the problem I have with Gary's ideas.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I use this several times every day and love that it is much easier than a regular broom.  It works very well on all types of surfaces and with many types of \\"dirt\\".  I would recommend this product, but it does not keep a charge as long as I was hoping.  It seems to wear down quickly on carpeted surfaces and area rugs.  Overall it is still much better than dragging out the regular vacuum as often as I need to sweep.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Although I thought this movie would probably be mainly for children, with a few adult moments; I found myself enjoying it a lot.  I loved it, and will definitely watch it again.  It was like the original Popeye cartoons where kids loved it despite the fact that the adult humor went right over their heads.  It was also a lot like a James Bond type movie, which I liked as well.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Great blu-ray product of rocky horror.  It has the same extras as the 25th anniversary dvd but with added bonuses such as watching a live shadowcast of the film as you watch with performers from the \\"best\\" shadow casts across the globe.  No Tim Curry commentary which is sad.  It has a great factoid feature that pops up with very recent facts and data about the film.  I also enjoyed the blu-ray menus which have rare posters of the film that shuffle through in the back ground.  The selecting the 35th anniversary blu-ray shadow cast segments weren't that interesting and could have been better produced.  Overall a great rocky horror blu-ray and a must have if you are a fan of the film.  Wait for this to go on sale.  I don't believe its worth anything over 19.99.
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol was a very exciting and entertaining read. Without giving away the details of the story, it is a thriller and a very good one at that. The story will have you turning pages with new surprises at the end of every chapter. This was my first Dan Brown novel and I was very surprised at how good the book was. Others state that The Lost Symbol isn't as good as his previous novels, but I cannot comment for I haven't read the previous novels. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to the reader looking for a thriller and who might learn a thing or two while reading.
1594202842|2.0|I first heard of Ms. Chua on NPR and read her book in a single setting. As a mother adamantly in favor of emphasizing education, I actually went into this thinking people needed to worry more about what kind of parents they are, then about Ms. Chua's (or anyone else's) childrearing philosophy. I feel like the world would be a far better place if we all focused a whole lot more on what WE do, and a whole lot less on what others do, or don't do. I still believe that, but admit I was completely turned off by the smugness and arrogance which dominates the telling of this tale of a tyrannical mother who controls every single aspect of her daughter's lives.<br /><br />This is not so much a memoir of motherhood, but a manifesto to justify what frequently veers into abusive behavior, in a 21st century parent of any ethnicity. I gave the book two stars because it was certainly thought-provoking (even if the thoughts were of disgust and anger), but, while I found it a quick read, I didn't think the writing style itself was compelling and can't even recommend it as entertainment.<br /><br />Ms. Chua's congratulatory self-delusion that she has improved her childrens' lives and made them such amazing successes is wildly premature, to cite just one of many problems with her hypothesis. Neither of her daughters has yet to reach adulthood, and their future, successful or otherwise, is very much a moving target. As someone educated at Harvard who now works at Yale, as Ms. Chua points out ad nauseaum, the author should be well aware that success in the classroom is NOT directly indicative of success in life.<br /><br />Any college graduate, from either the best or worst school, knows that grades matter little after graduation, and if you're still talking about your cum laude at 40, it's likely because you've done very little since. The only thing it appears to me that Ms. Chua's Ivy League education taught her was that controversy clearly sells books.<br /><br />I found nothing edifying or redemptive about this story. The turn around hinted at in the subtitle, Ms. Chua's so-called \\"retreat\\" after her youngest teen daughter calls her out (for the umpteenth time), seems disingenuous, at best, especially since it is followed by quite a bit of self-praise for said daughter's tennis prowess, which Ms. Chua once again credits to her mothering methods, despite the fact she previously didn't allow her daughter to participate in sports. Sure, Ms. Chua is no longer denying her preschoolers potty breaks or throwing them into the snow ... But only, I'd argue, because she no longer has preschoolers, not because she actually thinks she did anything wrong. Allowing her younger daughter the merest sliver of self-expression is kind of like dropping a grain of sand over a cliff and claiming you've filled the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />For those that say Ms. Chua's writing is \\"witty\\" or \\"self-aware,\\" I also disagree. I concede that she seems honest (though we can't know what she withheld; she certainly knew what she did share would be seen negatively by most), but she is the farthest thing from self-aware I've ever seen, blindly insisting that her methods were, in fact, \\"successful.\\" She actually seems, up until the final page, quite proud of herself. Not her daughters, mind you, but herself. For Ms. Chua, parenting is an ego trip, pure and simple.<br /><br />And funny? I could see where she was trying to lighten the darkness of her daughters' tale, but it came off as clunky and stilted and made this reader feel decidedly uncomfortable.<br /><br />To call this style of parenting \\"Chinese\\" is Ms. Chua using her ethnicity solely for sensationalism. Her shameless use, and mis-use, of Asian stereotypes and misleading statistics is not only ill-considered, but downright implausible. Parents of her ilk have always existed, in every society, but the style has never emerged as an accepted standard, perhaps because it doesn't, despite Ms. Chua's insistence, actually work all that well. In short, cruelty, no matter what your skin tone, is not a successful parenting strategy. At best Ms. Chua's method will lead to technically astute, but emotionally stunted individuals incapable of free thought or self-motivation. Well-designed followers with modest expectations of fulfilling ONLY the minimum required to avoid reprimand; all of which is the exact opposite of exceptional.<br /><br />Perhaps even more offensive than her personal tale, Ms. Chua also uses this book as a screed against what she terms \\"Western\\" parenting, in which she contends that anyone who dares to raise their child with kindness, affection and praise is condemning them to a future of, \\"you want fries with that.\\" If there is anything less attractive than her attitude towards her own family, it is Ms. Chua's undeniable Schadenfreude in describing children she thinks have gone awry due to what she feels is lax parenting. You can practically hear her cackling with glee as she describes mothers who \\"allowed\\" their children to be second-best, therefore, by Ms. Chua's twisted logic, giving her daughters a leg up.<br /><br />And though Ms. Chua praises herself endlessly for how much harder she works as a mother than any \\"Western\\" parent, I agree with another reviewer who said she's actually doing the easiest thing of all: letting anger and frustration guide her actions; enacting petty revenge on her daughters every time they fail to perfectly please her. Those are the actions of a petulant child--'You didn't do what I want, when I wanted it, now I'm mad at you and am going to make you mad or sad too'--not a Harvard-educated adult.<br /><br />Of particular interest was Ms. Chua's proffering of \\"proof\\" that she loves her daughters, and they love her in return, by pointing out how after her worst outbursts they would often climb into bed and cuddle with her. Has this very smart woman never heard that seeking affection from an abuser is a classic response by the abused? And I'm not giving Ms. Chua's husband a pass either ... No parent should be allowed to stand by and watch his childrens' dignity repeatedly destroyed. That this book exists is a testament to how stupid two really so-called \\"smart\\" people can be. (I would argue Ms. Chua has displayed a stunning dearth of emotional intelligence, a critical component of intellect, in both her writing and defense of this book.)<br /><br />What Ms. Chua provided with her \\"Battle Hymn\\" is a startling, and sad, example of parents who gave their children every material, genetic and educational advantage, but still left their children woefully emotionally needy.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that overly permissive and \\"self-esteem boasting\\" parenting of the kind that refuses to keep score at soccer games or awards every child a medal because, \\"they're all winners,\\" is an issue in American society today. But the answer is not the opposite extreme; just as the solution to America's obesity epidemic is not anorexia.<br /><br />To be clear: what is appalling about Ms. Chua as a parent are not her expectations, but her methods. You can make the argument that setting such lofty, almost unattainable, goals is too much pressure, or you can say it's inspiring--both positions have merit--but it's the physical and mental manipulations Ms. Chua applied to achieve her end result that should set off alarm bells. Depriving her daughters of every social tie, regularly shaming and humiliating them in the most abject and cruel ways (in the name of \\"encouragement\\"), verbally destroying them on a near daily basis, threatening prize possessions, withholding basic affection and even sustenance, denying physical pain, ignoring illness ... All are not a differing parental philosophy, but out-and-out abuse. As she describes standing over her not-yet-school-age children for hours on end, denying them sleep, water and bathroom breaks in an effort to gain proficiency on instruments not of their choosing, which Ms.Chua has no desire to see them excel at beyond college application fodder, I thought: this isn't a mother, this is a prison warden.<br /><br />The reality is that Ms. Chua's daughters, so meticulously guided and bullied, are not very different from a child allowed to run completely wild, and I'd venture that both parenting styles leave subjects in serious danger of long-term negative consequences from their respective childhood experiences. Mostly because neither imparts the most important skills any parent can bestow on their child: the ability to accurately and independently assess a situation, including their own innate strengths and weaknesses, set goals and intuit a way to achieve them independently. Those are the abilities that truly indicate who will be a successful as an adult, not test scores, piano concertos or even IQ.<br /><br />In fact, you can easily argue that the most successful members of any society are those that veer of the traditional educational path. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Jerry Yang ... All revolutionary minds and unquestionably some of the smartest guys alive. And all billionaires that dropped out of college to pursue a dream that changed the world. Even if Ms. Chua's daughters were to have an idea of such staggering brilliance, Ms. Chua would never allow them to pursue it, robbing them of the very greatness she thinks she's instilling, all because of her rigid rules.<br /><br />You can stress education, optimize an environment for success and encourage your children to hold THEMSELVES to very high standards. You can make sure they have the best teachers, the best materials and the best opportunities available, but you can NOT \\"make\\" your children \\"the best\\" at anything. After all, statistically there can be only one \\"best\\" at any particular endeavor, but many who are worthy. Ms. Chua's delusion that being ranked No. 1 in an arbitrary group or class makes her daughters \\"the best\\" borders on pathological.<br /><br />Ms. Chua's comments about her daughters' weight, along with class rank, early Ivy League admission status and \\"the right\\" public performance (i.e. Carnegie Hall), are very telling as to her utter superficiality. She doesn't really care if her daughters ARE successful, as long as they LOOK successful. Ms. Chua's own admission that she is unable to be happy should be proof enough that a degree from Harvard is not a good life guarantee.<br /><br />In the end, Ms. Chua's conclusion that her parenting style was triumphant based on a Carnegie Hall performance and Yale early admission is simply nonsense. Does she credit the fact that as a published Yale professor the odds her daughter would be accepted increased exponentially? And, not to deride her daughter's efforts in any way, but performing at Carneige Hall is as much about who you know, who your teacher is and where you train, as it is about talent and skill. Yes, you have to have the latter, but it's clearly easier for a New England student from an affluent family, with a teacher that has ties to the New York City classical scene, to score a performance slot, than even the most gifted prodigy from, say, small-town Iowa whose only guidance comes from a retired school teacher that lives on their block.<br /><br />In fact, Ms. Chua ignores or diminishes every factor---genetics, money, privilege, outside educators, nannies---other than her \\"Chinese\\" parenting style, that contributed to her daughters' undeniably impressive academic and musical accomplishments. Unfortunately, Sophie and Lulu will never know if they could have been raised with kindness, affection and joy AND excelled academically and musically. They will never have the chance to discover what else they may have been great at, or where their own interests could have taken them, because autonomy didn't fit into their mother's plan for their lives.<br /><br />The odds I most hope Ms. Chua's daughters can beat are those that would indicate they will be emotionally stunted and damaged by their mother's actions, as she clearly was by her own oppressive parents. I fervently hope they will break that cycle and reeducate themselves to what is truly valuable once out of their mother's destructive sphere. And if Ms. Chua's daughters do achieve true success in life I firmly believe, after reading this harrowing tale of their childhood, it will be in spite of their mother, not because of her.isn't a mother, this is a prison warden.

B00275EHJG|5.0|My kids grew up on Buzz & Woody.  They are now 12 & 24 years old.  Toy Story 3 tells the tale of what happens to toys when their owners grow up.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|The seller stated that it was just the CD that was in like new condition.  It was an original CD with no original case.  The case did not matter to me, only the CD did.  It was perfect.  I am very happy.
B004529NKC|4.0|A young man arrives at NYU and he encounters a dance crew that needs to win a contest in order to maintain their living arrangements. Loud Hip-Hop music and street dancing punctuate this story of a college freshman trying to balance dance practice, with commitments to schoolwork and loyalty to his best friend. This is an entertaining romp if you like the loud pulsating beats of Hip-Hop.
1878424319|5.0|The best thing was these ideas are things you already knew just seen through new eyes.  It was inspiring because it reinforced my own deep beliefs from a new perspective or world view.  It has helped me recognize what I needed to recognize; the right & the need to say no without guilt when you need to do so. To expect more of me and others.  Read it you may just recognize yourself here.
B0041T52S6|4.0|A young man falls for a woman he meets, but he must defeat her seven evil exes before he can date her. This unusual film combines the reality of human relationships with the fantasy world of video games to keep the viewer entertained. This is a movie aimed at a young audience, and it is right on target.
B002ZG994U|4.0|I'm always wary of remakes as hollywood seems fond of trading our childhood dreams in for cold hard cash.  Thankfully, the A-Team did not disappoint.    They did a great job of assembling the team quickly and in a believable way.  Immediately, they establish the tone of the movie and within five minutes I knew that this would be a great film.    The acting isn't bad and I was surprised by Rampages performance.  I expect to see more of him on the big screen.      I was worried that all the characters would come off cartoonish (especially Rampage) but they didn't.  They managed to make the characters their own and grow into them.    Plot is decent,its a wild ride.  Villains are hilarious.    Overall, they knocked this out of the park. Which when you think about it, is hard to do with a TV series turned movie.      Great job guys.
B002ZG980U|4.0|A team that is able to infiltrate someone's dreams in order to extract information is asked by a businessman to insert an idea into the mind of a competitor. The team leader undertakes this in order to return to his children, whom he has not seen since being falsely suspected of murdering his wife. This is a complex film that at first appears to have differing illogical sequences, but these are dream sequences, which cannot be fully controlled. The team has varying members of different skill sets, in order to maximize their ability to manipulate the dream environment. This is a visually stunning film, and if the viewer has patience and focus, \\"Inception\\" will payoff in the end.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I was a little wary because the trailer looked 'too good' and we all know how those usually go... However, this film lived up to the hype.      First, the acting was just so spot on.  Ben and the cast just nailed that white urban tough gritty characterization.  You feel like one of the guys.  And then, they were SMART about how they did things and didn't fall into the cartoonish trap that inflicts other films in this genre.      The plot wasn't contrived and felt organic.  Similarly, the plot progression was very natural in the chaotic way that is true life.  You didn't quite know what was coming but when you arrived you had that \\"it felt right\\" feeling.    This is film is in the top ten of bank robber capers, easily at the level of Inside Man or Ocean's Eleven (minus the comedy).      Get this film, you will not be disappointed.
B003YLK2RI|2.0|Okay, we have another DVD from Slipknot, my favorite heavy metal band. The first disc is nothing more than live scenes from their tour spliced together. A complete waste. The second disc contains three different elements. Footage of the shoot of one of their videos, which is only moderately interesting. The second part is the videos from their latest CD. Outside of Psychosocial, I don't think their last effort was very good. Lastly, there is concert footage from a festival in London. I would have liked this better if it had been concert footage from a show in a relatively small arena, it would have a better feel to it. The good thing is that it was professionally done, and you get some great songs that were not on Disasterpieces. If you have Disasterpieces, I don't know why you need this one, other than to see songs like \\"Before I Forget\\" live.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|I've known about The Killers since they came out, but I didn't get really into them until last summer when I first listened to Day & Age in it's entirety & then heard this solo album. Flowers is the band's lead songwriter, so you can expect another album full of songs written by him released on an album under his name would be just as good, right..? Correct! This album is excellent, sounds very similar to the later stuff by The Killers. It displays Flowers' excellent song writing & singing capabilities. Any Killers fan would be wise to purchase this album.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Another solid effort in the animation category, this time with Steve Carrell as the voice of a man vying to be a worse villain than his competitor. Three orphan girls enter his life, and after initially using them to assist in his endeavors, he warms up to them. Good fun for the whole family.
1416549447|5.0|ChiRunning has definitely made my running experience more enjoyable. All the techniques described have greatly alleviated my pains felt during and after my runs. I highly recommend to all beginner and advanced runners. I would also recommend to buy both the book and the video. The video so you can visually see what is proper technique. The book because it provides a more thorough view of the methodology. I LOVE ChiRunning!
B003L20ICE|5.0|A lesbian couple has raised two children. Coming of age, the kids contact their biological father, and the dynamic that he brings to lives of the family creates tension within the household. This is real-life drama that grabs the viewer with its honest look at a family in crisis. The acting is solid throughout, with the emotional strain of a marriage on the verge of collapsing bringing an edge to the dramatic events that transpire.
0143035711|5.0|I have read 30+ vietnam era memoirs but if your looking for how it was as a Huey piot in the war. This book is the one for you. Mason does an excellent job depicting events. A masterpiece, a must read.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Two scientists have been fusing the genes of humans with other living beings, trying to create a new species. They secretly create Dren, a human-like creature that changes the dynamic of the relationship between the two scientists, who are also lovers. This is a gripping and intense thriller without the blood and gore common in today's horror films. Very well done.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I bought this concert video for my husband.  It's a fantastic filming of the Melbourne concert produced by Glenn Frey.  Includes some interviews...very funny moments.  Almost as good as being there.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|A group of mercenaries are hired by the CIA to remove a businessman from power because of his brutal dominance of a small island nation in the Caribbean where illegal drugs are being manufactured and sold. Plenty of action abounds, along with some graphic scenes of violence in this exciting guy flick. Many stars of modern action fare are present, and seeing them all together is quite a treat for those who enjoy fun summer action films. The requisite humor is present, which lightens the mood of this movie loaded with guns, fistfights, and explosions.
1407115561|5.0|Book excellent - colourful and with just the right balance of \\"education\\" for a 5/6 year old. Thoroughly recommended.    However the delivfery was VERY late, well after Christmas.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|A young woman has to locate her father after he has skipped out on his bail. She, her mother, and her siblings are in danger of being evicted from their home. A realistic look at the hardscrabble life of those living in the dirt poor Appalachian region, where drug labs are common, and the locals struggle to get by. No significant dramatic turns, or action sequences, but a powerful look at the difficulty faced by a girl who is trying to keep her family together in spite of the problems presented by her absent father.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|If you loved Avatar this is a great buy.  The additional 16 minutes are cool - I liked some of the scenes and disliked others, but none really contributed significantly to the movie, so if you already own the original you may not find the additional scenes in the collector's cut worth it.      But if you held off on Avatar until now this is the one to get.    The extra features are kind of cool.  I liked the never-before-seen scenes because many of them were unfinished, so you could see how they went from actors running around in electrode suits, to rough, blocky animation, then into the final product.    My only complaint is the DVD case.  It is really hard to explain the posterboard origami concoction that they turned into a DVD case.  It is cardboard and after handling it twice I accidentally snagged it on something and now the paper cover that the picture is printed on is coming unglued.  The three DVDs themselves are tucked into posterboard - type envelopes that slide out of posterboard \\"pages\\" within the cardboard fold-out cover, like three drawers.  Although mine are still intact - for now - it is not hard to see that after a few viewings the posterboard envelopes will become bent, torn, or otherwise start falling apart unless I am incredibly careful in removing and replacing the DVD in its posterboard envelope-drawer thing.  Also the crisp folds make some of the posterboard tabs stick out and risk scratching the DVD as I remove/replace it.  And keep it well away from the coffee table or anywhere you might spill anything on it because a single drop of moisture will go right through and warp if not disintegrate the case.  Cool in concept but flimsy in practice.  I don't understand why they would take this fancy collector's edition set and stick it in a cardboard/posterboard case.  Why not enshrine your masterpiece in sturdy, water-resistant plastic?  You can mold and design plastic and make it look really nice.  You could even keep the drawer concept with somecreativity.  But no.  They chose paper.    If you are buying this for kids they will probably destroy the case in days if not minutes, so have a blank DVD case (or 3) ready.  But they will still love the movie!
B002ZG99CC|3.0|A mother moves her son to a new home, where he encounters some local bullies, who don't appreciate his affection for a local girl. After a few beatings, he is trained in the martial arts, in order to prepare for a tournament. Sound familiar? If you've seen 1984's The Karate Kid, you've seen this film. Jacket on, jacket off isn't quite as memorable as wax on, wax off, but this is an effective follow-up to the original.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|A CIA agent is suspected of being a Russian spy who will attempt to assassinate the Russian President. She claims a set-up, and must either prove her innocence, or carry out the assassination, depending on what the truth is. The agent's role is difficult to determine throughout, and despite some implausible stunts typical of such action fare, this is good summer popcorn fun.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Woody and the gang are back. Andy is going off to college and the toys have been donated to a daycare center. Woody must try to return his friends to Andy, despite being unsure of their fate if he does so. This film captures the sentiment of the original. It is an exciting action adventure that may bring a tear to your eye in the end.
B002A4Q652|5.0|I definitely do not consider myself someone who likes metal. I do not like thrash or death metal, but man, if you put in some symphonic  aspects with a beautiful singer, I guess you can call me a metal-head. This is my favorite album that I bought in 2010. Charlotte has a beautiful voice, the band sounds great and I can't stop singing along. Cannot wait until their next album comes out! I am definitely expanding my musical taste here since this album has opened up more bands that I like as well: Within Temptation and Epica are two that I like so far.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|A hired assassin finds himself to now be a target, and he commences one final mission in Italy. While there, he develops a relationship with local prostitute, and suspects that she may be involved in attempts on his life. The thinking man's action film, this movie's slow pacing saps the thrills out of what could have been a riveting action drama. All is not lost, though, as the movie does just enough to keep the viewer interested, and how the film plays out is an interesting topic of discussion as you leave the theater.
B003DZX3US|5.0|I saw all the Disney Princess movies in theaters growing up.. starting with the Little Mermaid and I can tell you it looks better than ever! Unfortunately Disney only keeps them around 6 months or so before there back in the vault so take advantage of this offer!<br />And I would also add that Amazon shipped me a replacement DVD after I found out my Blu-ray didn't work. Without waiting for me to send my copy back, that's service! Thank you!

B0034G4P7Q|1.0|I was never quite sure if I wanted to see this film or not. After reading so many raving reviews and actually seeing a preview that made this movie look interesting-I gave it a rental. I will always be happy that I rented this and did not purchase it. This movie started out ok. Mark and his girlfriend are having a discussion where it comes across crystal clear what type of personality he has. It is not a very likeable one as he seems to be spoiled,selfish and definately thinks he is far wiser than anyone else. She breaks up with him so he goes back to his dorm and gets drunk and blogs about her,while he does something he calls \\"face smash\\" where the guys of the college look at pictures of their female coeds and decide which one is prettier. He gets asked by two brothers to help them develop a website for Harvard students where they can share their info and put up status's and things. He decides to create his own site instead and when it goes up online the brothers feel that he stole their idea and decide to take him to court.<br /><br />  I am a fan of Fincher. Well I enjoy Fight Club. Now THAT was a far superior film than this. I do like Jesse Eisenberg. I thought Adventureland to be a pretty decent film. I felt that besides from being extremely over-hyped, that The Social Network was just plain unentertaining and boring. I couldn't even finish watching this. I just watched Apocolypse Now the day before and that is a much longer movie but SO much better..I would even sit through the boring Redux again before I would ever,ever,ever watch The Social Network again!! The main character was so dislikeable that you didn't even care. Since I couldn't even finish watching the film it has come to my attention that he did have to pay financial compensation to the brothers and his ex best friend. Even so..two hours to hear arguing back and forth over whose idea was whose just wasn't for me. I did enjoy the performances of Eisenberg and Timberlake-just not the movie. Everyone has their own opinions and personal preferences and I am not knocking anyone who found this enjoyable.<br /><br />  I would definately recommend you rent this before purchasing. Don't buy into the hype until you have seen it first and don't always believe a slew of \\"five star\\" reviews. I feel people are far too generous with their rating system as it is. Five stars should be applied only to a film that truly deserves it like The Godfather. When people give movies like Step Brothers and Dinner For Schmucks five stars I really start to wonder. No wonder the studios keep popping out mindless fare.eir own opinions and personal preferences and I am not knocking anyone who found this enjoyable.

B003L20IHE|4.0|After his younger brother is killed in an auto accident, a young man plays catch with his dead sibling in a cemetery each day at the same time. Their bond is threatened by the emergence of a young woman in the man's life, and he has to choose between the two worlds. The film climaxes with a daring attempt to rescue the woman when she is lost sailing. A film that has been unfairly maligned by many critics, this was an engaging drama that pulls the viewer in with a story line that intrigues, and acting that is top notch.
B00427X9WI|2.0|This movie was not at all what we expected. Based on the cast we expected more than just a story with some actors that moved way too slow with little purpose. Wasted our money on this one.

030746363X|4.0|I ordered this book a few weeks ago and have been gradually reading it and following the slow carb diet. So far I am down 12lbs in 2 weeks, which is awesome (haven't even implemented the workout yet). Like Tim says in the book, you almost only need 150 pages of this book, but overall all the experiments featured in the book are interesting. Be skeptical is also another rule in the book, which with all the negative press that has been surrounding the book lately, this may be a page that people forgot to read.    Overall, I have enjoyed this book and the experiments that Tim features. I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for an interesting and odd way to start off your new year. While Tim may not be a Dr, he worked with many on the creating of The 4 Hour Body and any way you look at it, this is a good read.
030746363X|4.0|There is a little something for (nearly) everyone in this book.  While Tim doesn't go far enough down the rabbit hole of nutritional corruption that is the \\"modern\\" diet of nutritionally denatured food for my liking, he certainly can't be faulted too heavily for that given the already copious amount of content presented in a very meticulous fashion in his book.  Nonetheless, following his recommendations of grass-fed beef, raw milk and free range eggs will make a huge difference in nearly anyone's health.    In practical terms, the book has peaked my interest in kettlebell swings (did them for the first time last night, and loved it) and corrective pre-hab movements (chop & lift) as well as showing that it's easy enough to learn how to swim while ALSO demystifying the female orgasm.  Truly a cornucopia of physical delights.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I received an ipad for Christmas along with a lot of wonderful accessories.  This was not one of them.  I have a Canon 20D (DSLR) and the camera connection kit won't read the right type of card.  I tried to plug a USB thumb drive into the USB connector the kit came with and got the error message that it used too much power to allow the device to operate it.  Same error when I tried to attach the camera via it's cords directly into the USB connector.  Same error again when I tried to plug my photo vault into the device.  I would love to know what types of devices DON'T use too much power . . . .
B003INBNXO|4.0|Ip Man tells the tale of a Wing Chun master living a life of ease, then suffering the horrors of Japanese occupation of China in WWII.  Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), desperate for food, finds that a Japanese general will trade rice for sparring partners for his men.  But when his friends are killed in the process, it then becomes a matter of honor, not hunger, that drives him.<br /><br />A secondary plot is when Ip Man fights a number of bandits trying to rob a friend's factory, and Ip Man trains the factory workers to protect themselves.<br /><br />After the war, Ip Man develops a martial arts school which produces Bruce Lee, among others.<br /><br />Much of the conversation seems stilted and shallow, but I suspect that was due in part to the translation (the film has subtitles in English).  I understand that there is quite of bit of artistic license used in this story.  Ip Man was a policeman himself, and he never battled a Japanese general.  Regardless, the fight scenes were action-packed and ferocious, while Ip Man demonstrated an interest in avoiding conflict whenever possible.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I liked this movie as much as I liked The Hurt Locker which in my opinion was one of the worst and overrated movies ever. There is barely any dialogue in this movie and the plot is just super boring. Good thing I rented this for free from my local library but I can never get back the 2 hours I spent watching this junk.

0545265355|5.0|When I was seven I had read all the Harry Potter books to date. A year ago I sat on the primary school playground reading Twilight while the rest of my class played tig and argued over who was \\"it\\". Yesterday in the high school P.E. changing rooms my friend was wide-eyed wondering how I could read a 500-page novel in a night.    I'll tell you how - it was Mockingjay.    Katniss Everdeen lives in a futuristic version of the United States, now named Panem. It was \\"a shining Capitol bordered by thirteen outlying districts\\" until the citizens rebelled one day seventy-four years in the past. The Capitol won, destroying the thirteenth district in the process, and - as a reminder of the Districts' helplessness and their superiority - they invented the cruel, sadistic Hunger Games. Viewed as entertainment by the Capitol citizens and torture by the Districts, they are a brutal fight to the death between twenty-four tributes - a boy and a girl aged between 12-18 from each of the remaining twelve districts. Only one can win, and they are given a life of comfort and ease.    Seventy-four years later, some districts train eagerly for the games, and easily volunteer to try for the riches winning can provide, whilst others - like in Twelve - hold a crippling fear of it.    When Katniss' little twelve-year-old sister Prim (although I must say twelve-year-olds are NOT weak and helpless as all adults assume :/ I'm talking to you, Year 9s pushing in the dinner queue!) is reaped for the arena, Katniss volunteers, shocking all. Even the bonds between family members only go so far on the day of the Reaping. Alongside Katniss is sent Peeta - the sixteen-year-old baker's son who saved her life in a most unramarkable but memorable way when he threw her the loaves of bread that saved her and her family from starvation and encouraged her to begin hunting illegally for food.    They are trained up on the way to the arena by Haymitch - a drunken former victor - and Effie Trinket - a practical yet flamboyant Capitol citizen. They are shown off in front the whole country and Katniss and Peeta both know it is a message to today's District inhabitants to never, EVER repeat their ancestor's action. They are portrayed as friends, oddly enough, but Katniss decides to brave it alone in the arena, so she won't have to kill him herself. However, her resolve is broke when Peeta reveals at the interview the night prior to the Games his love for Katniss!    By the Mockingjay's epilogue many of Katniss' promises - both to herself and others - are broken but she handled herself beautifully through the entire trilogy. However, she's realistic. She - most of the time! - reacts to the sometimes painfully gruesome situations much like I suppose most of us would, by blocking it out. (Happened to me today in Science when our teacher told us about ebola... gruesomem, much?) She's ruthless and competitive, and - unlike many of today's YA \\"heroines\\" - has a lifelike kick. Most girls nowadays would not stand for being pushed about, and she does a fantastic job of showing it.    The world Suzanne Collins weaves with words is just as realistic as it is horrifically gruesome, and the characters' death (which are many) haunt you. For me, this is mostly \\"little\\" (OK, she's small but being twelve does not guarentee you are LITTLE!) Rue's, Cinna's - Katniss' daring and cunning stylist - and probably surprisingly for most Katniss' school friend Madge's. I won't mention the obvious fourth, for spoilers' sakes.    One of the most satisfying things about this series is that it doesn't beat around the bush. It describes, doesn't scoot around. Twilight - as much as I love it - has a blatant habit of doing this. While it can barely mention a cut, The Hunger Games describes flesh dropping off peoples' bodies. Twice. Katniss might have been hallucinating one of those two, though. YA fiction just grew up.    The characters are rich and interesting, full of depth and emotion. You feel bad for seeing people who have been barely mentioned - maybe not even at all - suffer because of the way Collins portrays human life. This book will either have you completely disgusted or having a double take at the worth of life.    I love this series, I must do to have just spent a whole hour writing about it! Buy it if you don't mind getting a bit grossed out and being exhausted from staying up until 3:00am reading, but it really is worth it. The writing is FABULOUS an dthe whole thing is great.    Hunger Games forever. <3
0525423273|5.0|It takes a certain style of writing and an element of charm, romance, realism, and characters who I completely fall for, for me to truly fall in love with a chick lit book. Let me just say Stephanie Perkins delivered all this and more in Anna and the French Kiss.<br /><br />I completely love Anna, our main character who I related to on some levels. She's a little bit uptight, a little OCD, and what I loved most about her character is how fun she is and independent she becomes. Her character grows a lot through the course of the book. Anna's famous father, a southern romance author, decides she needs to spend her senior year abroad, in Paris. If that's horrifying enough, she'll be by herself. No friends, no family and in a country she's never been to before.<br /><br />Once Anna is at the boarding school, she discovers herself, new friends and of course her own Mr Darcy in the form of Etinne St. Clair. Have you ever hit it off with someone so well, only to realize that the connection you have with them may never go further than friends? That's exactly what it's like for Anna. Etinne is the perfect match for Anna. They have a lot of fun together and an amazing chemistry, but the only problem is he's got a girlfriend. Stephanie captured the romantic tensions between the two perfectly! I felt that I went from the reader, to being there with the group and watching Anna and Etinne interact with each other. Their stolen glances, their undeniable attraction to one another, even though they both deny it. Etinne, known as St. Clair is a modern day Mr Darcy. He's the hot guy, with a great accent, has silly quirks and completely grounded. Plus he loves history, which I loved about him. It was so unexpected. Who wouldn't want to fall for him? Anna is the more reserved, quiet type, who dreams of being a film critic. Together the two of them have such a realistic chemistry that I just wanted to shove the two of them together and tell them to live happily ever after. Like life, their friendship and relationship isn't forced, but one that continues to grow and isn't without doubt, fear, love and insecurities.<br /><br />Anna and St Clair bring the best and the hidden things out with each other. They confide in each other, and through the course of their realistic relationship of ups and downs, frustrations, happiness and fear, they both find something within each other, and that's an inner strength. Anna goes from being scared to be away from home and to walk around Paris by herself, it finding it's okay to be on your own. By the end of the book she's ventures out on her own and ends up enjoying where she is in life. St Clair is the hot guy on campus, who doesn't seem to ever let anything effect him. What he's hidden from everyone else, is the one thing that Anna helps him find the courage to face. I won't lie, Stephanie sure knows how to write a heart breaking scene.<br /><br />Let me talk about the setting for moment.... Paris! Can I just say I'd like to book a round trip ticket to Paris please. Having never been, I felt that I just taken a guided tour of Paris, thanks to Stephanie's richly detailed tours that Anna goes on with her friends. From the descriptions to the people, the theater, the land marks and food. It's breathtaking and vividly beautiful.<br /><br />There's so much more I'd love to say about Anna and The French Kiss, but that would mean I'd mention spoilers, which I won't do. I freely admit that Anna and The French Kiss now has a place on my favorite reads shelf. I'm still blown away that this is Stephanie's debut book! I am really excited to know she has more books coming out and I can't wait to read them.ir friendship and relationship isn't forced, but one that continues to grow and isn't without doubt, fear, love and insecurities.<br /><br />Anna and St Clair bring the best and the hidden things out with each other.

One gets the impression that he is wailing - always with a wonderful voice, of course. The songs he is now writing, some in collaboration with Dan Wilson and others, sound somewhat like hit songs by David Foster.

I was hesitant with all the negative reviews and I have never read a graphic novel aka comic book as an adult. ha!<br />I LOVED THIS! It was a great way to re-read Outlander again ( I have read all up to Echo in the Bone) and was surprised how much I enjoyed it, a bit more information and oh so much fun to see flesh and bone compared to the way I saw Jamie and Claire in my mind.<br />I do hope there are more as I would buy a second in a heart beat. Thanks for the unique book!!!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|\\"Departures\\" is one of these sublimely inspired masterworks that immediately become part of your aesthetic memory.<br /><br />Due the fatidic announcement the dissolution of the Orchestra he belonged, a sensitive young cello player must redirection his talent and so the first step is return to his birthplace , where he'll find a new job that could not be more opposite: to prepare the dead for their new stage.<br /><br />In the second movement of this symphonic picture, he decides to hide the nature of his job to his wife, on the other hand we witness the hate for his father (whom he never saw) and his relationship with his childhood neighbors. Meanwhile his artistic job elicits the secret admiration of his employer.<br /><br />The third and last movement is one of the most encumbered and heartfelt finales we have seen along the entire history of cinema.<br /><br />Charming, haunting and arresting film that will capture your soul, where the sense of life, forgiveness and redemption will shake hands.<br /><br />In sum, one of the three best films of 2008 that deservedly won the coveted award as best Foreign film in that year.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|All great things come to an end. Who doesn't love Stars Hollow and all the inhabitants. It makes you yearn for the quirkyness of small town America. Yet the finale was disappointing because it sort of closed it down with bad results. Dean said it best to Luke in an earlier episode, they need more, meaning they weren't the guys for either Lorali or Rory.    It made sense that Lorali would seek Christopher for solace after Luke turned down her ultimatum as the cliff hanger season finale. He was a lingering constant from her past and she knew he cared for her when Luke couldn't/wouldn't decide. He would be the arms she turned to. Where they went with that story line could have been vastly improved.     Luke proved a bad match when he was on the valentine weekend, he couldn't alter his routine or step out of the diner w/o being a fish out of water. He was and always would be small town. A good friend who helped Lorali with her life but not a good life partner. She came from a different world, she retreated to a small town to raise her daughter, but she wasn't really small town. She probably would sell the inn and take to traveling like the offer her dad mentioned being a consultant for a major chain of hotels. With Rory not there, she wouldn't have a reason to stay, she was up for grander adventures. And though I didn't like the way the plot unraveled between her and Christopher, I think the date night was awesome with a mustang, a barn and an old movie, he was on the right track in Paris, and with his new found means, he would have been able to show her the world. They were more in sync, having similar backgrounds. He got her, Luke never did. I didn't like that they have him wimp out. I don't think coming from the background he did, he wouldn't rise to be the man she really needed. He made a go with Gigi, so he would have figured out a better stragedy with Lorali. He wanted to make it right, and first loves are powerful, it had so much possibility to tap into and theytanked it badly in my opinion.     Rory, she tested the waters with Logan, and he showed her the benefits of being of the Gilmore background. But he wasn't what she needed either. He was trying to force her into his life TOO MUCH as the fix it piece. A world that she didn't like because he used people and his priviledge in the wrong manner. She would never be Huntzburger material, she was ABOVE them all. She wanted to conquer the world and so her going off on a campaign trail w/o Logan would be the right move for her. That was the right story line ending there.      Lane, her and Zach, ah NO! She was smart, she went after what she wanted despite her restrictions. She found creative solutions. She WAS the band, they didn't do anything, she pushed them to success. It made NO sense for her not to get out and explore the world she was kept from and hooking up with Zach, who was slow and not motivated at all was a waste for her enterprising character. They could have done better by her character out exploring the whole music scene or bringing it to town and it creating havoc. She was more than waitress material, more than just settling to be a mom of twins at an early age. Not with all the spunk and determination she displayed throughout the show. She deserved to shine a bit before settling down to momhood. She could have shown Stars Hollow how to ROCK, ha!     Luke, nice hometown guy who did right by people. He was better off with Anna and April. They should have put them together and left them in Stars Hollow. Have them rebuy the Twickham Mansion and populate it, more believable then he and Lorali. They had tension, a bit of heat, but no real staying power for a lasting relationship. She would have been bored in 6 mths after a marriage to him. He saw to her needs, but he didn't stretch her, she was always pulling him to expand and her character wouldn't stick with that long. Besides flannel and army jackets never mix with designer dresses and heels, be serious! He wanted to camp out, she wanted a 4 star hotel. No real common ground.     I think it would have been best to have glimpses of Lorali and Rory reminiscing on Stars Hollow from the future. Sort of like a back to the future episode plot all done from the dining table of Emily and Richard, looking at how the town was right for them until their lives would part after Rory's graduation. It was a great place to rear Rory, but then it birthed them to greater things outside once she was raised. Life would go on there quietly as before. The Bon Voyage was appropriate, but it should have been both of them leaving and going on adventures. As they were destined for so much more!!!!! Rory a news correspondant, and Lorali a consultant, and finding more suitable men...    That would be my ending, ha!
1853261211|5.0|I hadn't read the entire Christmas Carol in quite some time, and I was very pleased to find an extremely cheap paperback that was NOT an adaptation.  As far as I can tell, this is the complete and unabridged version, with a few illustrations.  It's very inexpensive, but is not made as cheaply as some paperbacks, so I don't think it will fall apart immediately.  Here's hoping!  So far, it seems as sturdy as any other well-made paperback, and we really enjoyed reading it this year.
0439023513|4.0|I loved Mockingjay, but thought it was a bit weaker than [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games: Book 1]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].<br /><br />At the end of Catching Fire, I found myself dying to find out what had happened and immediately plowed into reading Mockingjay (thank goodness I didn't start reading until all 3 books were released, I don't know what I would have done otherwise!). Mockingjay follows Katniss after the Quarter Quell, and ultimately through the rebellion by the Districts. While I still love Katniss as a character, I found her frustrating at times in this book; she (and the reader) spends a lot more time in her head, which was good for character development but at times slowed down the pace. Peeta has been one of my favorite characters throughout the series as well, and I found the path that his characters takes through the novel especially interesting. I don't want to spoil it, so I won't say more than that. The book is far more political than the first two but I actually found that I really liked that -- it carried the message of the destruction of war very well, that it takes two to tango and that often the lines between good and evil start to blur.<br /><br />All in all, I think Mockingjay was a fitting and wonderful ending to the Hunger Games series and I'm so glad I finally picked up these books. They're definitely new favorites, and are going on the shelf for many future re-reads.

030746363X|5.0|I've read a ton of books and am very familiar with physiology and science. I think Tim has done a great job of featuring new ideas / techniques for body transformation. He has uncovered a lot of information truly only available through self experiments. Granted much was studied or documented in other ways, but I think the rubber meets the road when you see physiological cause and effect through his journals and lab results. In all things, people are different but I think this book offers great advice for anyone trying to redesign their body in the most effective ways. Everything I've implemented from this book has worked fantastically, shockingly easy in most cases.     I think there are a lot of people who are not comfortable enough with self experiments and will immediately reject the ideas in this book on the basis of statistical relevance, scientific method, or any number of cop outs, without actually giving them a try. I will say this, if you can keep an open mind and try some of what Tim suggests, you will see results. The closer you follow, the better your results will be. I'm a skeptic and a self experimenter. I have seen results, dramatic results.    On a side note, I love Tim's writing style. Very informal, and funny. Its a great book, but only helpful if you actual try what he recommends.
0446619078|5.0|Harry is vunerable, sexy, and unpredictable in this thriller.<br /><br />Added bonus: amazing insights on politics and overall BS in government run agencies.<br /><br />The day-to-day stuff fascinated me. I related as an adoption social worker working for the state.Homicide detective and Child protection worker? Hmmmm. Both on a mission and both dealing with paper pushing,(numb)er based decision makers.<br /><br />Go Harry!<br /><br />Go Social Workers!<br /><br />Beth O'Malley
B00130VLZ4|5.0|I like the case very much.  It fits the camera perfectly.  It does have a little strap that you can fasten around the neck strap of the camera.  Other reviewers didn't like the fact that there wasn't one, but there is.  It is a little awkward to use.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|This album takes us on a journey through the African-American experience--from the early songs focusing on poverty and suffering to the last uplifting tracks that carry the message of enduring faith and hope.  The full, rich range of the African-American musical experience is here--hip-hop, rap, soul, funk, R&B, gospel, pop and more.  The album carries the timeless message that the one thing we always have is the hope that tomorrow will be a better day--and that we can make tomorrow better by taking responsibility for our own actions and our community/nation/world.  Track 10 is a beautiful rendition of the 1973 Bill Withers song \\"I Can't Write Left-Handed\\"--not just a powerful comment on war and the young people who die or are maimed fighting the politicians' battles, but a wonderful example of the intricate connection between the gospel and pop music traditions.  And I dare anyone to listen to track 11 and not feel that tomorrow will indeed be a better day.  Bravo and thanks to John Legend and the Roots for this amazing album
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is one of the few sequels that I have to say I loved every bit as much as the first book. The beginning of the story finds Katniss and Peeta back in District 12 but instead of celebrating, they've now become the poster children of a rebellion against the Capitol thanks to Katniss's actions at the end of the Hunger Games. Let's just say that President Snow is not too happy about that at all -- he warns Katniss that he will kill everyone she loves if she doesn't keep up the facade of her relationship with Peeta to help quell the rebellion. Katniss struggles between her hatred of the Capitol and President Snow and her desire to gain her life back; but this year there just happens to be a Quarter Quell (an extra-special version of the Hunger Games that occurs ever 25 years), so of course things won't be as easy as she might hope.<br /><br />Everything I loved about the first Hunger Games book continues through Catching Fire -- the tight, face pace of the book and the powerful emotions. Katniss is definitely still a favorite, though I really fell in love with Peeta and Gale in this book as well, and yes, even Haymitch. I liked that Collins was able to develop the main characters a little bit more in this book, as it made the twists and turns of the story even more compelling and heart-wrenching.

B002ZG98CS|3.0|This movie started out as a joke. This was never meant to be an actual movie, it started as a joke, a mock up trailer for the Grindhouse movie. A bunch of directors made a bunch of mock up movie trailers... Rob Zombie made Werewolf Women of the SS, Eli Roth made one about a Thanksgiving day massacre. They were all jokes to give a more theatrical feel to the Grindhouse release.     Direct from IMDB: Grindhouse (segment \\"Planet Terror\\" / fake trailer segment \\"Machete\\")  2007    Opening credits list \\"introducing\\" Don Johnson an obvious joke (see the 80's G.I Joe movie) for an obviously not intended to be serious movie... it's a time killing good time movie full of explosions. Honestly I was going to skip it altogether but my wife saw it with some friends and didn't shut up about it for a week and she hates these kinds of movies.    After seeing the trailer for Machete the other director's had to jokingly say something like \\"too bad that movie cannot be made.\\" To which Robert R said \\"Challenge accepted.\\" It's goofy, campy, waaaaaay over the top, violent and full of nudity (Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, some random hot Latina and Alicia Marek, but nothing from Michelle Rodriguez) and goofy dialogue... most of those qualities are defining elements in most of Rodriguez's work. Sin City, From Dusk til Dawn, The Mariachi Trilogy, Planet Terror. Honestly if you don't know what to expect walking into a Rodriguez movie by now than you have no one to blame but yourself.    Everyone is entitled to their own opinions of movies but if you hate these kinds of movies to begin with but insist on watching them then you're clearly just looking for a platform to complain from.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I been watching martial arts movies for over 20 years since I was a kid but very few martial arts movies stands out. I been a big fan of Donnie Yen for many years and he is finally getting his recognition as being one of the best action star in china today as well as martial artist. Ip man delivers a great fight choreography that you have to rewind it back because thats how awesome the fight choreography is. Theres been some Wing Chun movies and series but nothing like this. I say this is one of the best martial arts movies that came out in the last 10 + years and thats watching tons of martial movies !!!
0439023521|5.0|WOW.<br /><br />I purposely avoided The Hunger Games for a while because I was admittedly a little afraid of all the hype surrounding it. Before picking up The Hunger Games, I had only read one other YA book since the Twilight series (Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater, which was okay but didn't particularly rock my world or anything). Suffice it to say, I was wary of YA lit after Twilight not because I actually hated Twilight but because I can't stand Bella. Bella is such a weak character, and her relationship with Edward is so borderline abusive that it drove me absolutely nuts. I finally caved and read The Hunger Games out of a desire to read something faster-paced and at an easier level than some of my recent reads, and I'm so glad I finally did. Katniss Everdeen is definitely no Bella Swan.<br /><br />The Hunger Games grabbed me from the first few pages, and didn't let go until I finished Mockingjay (the third book in the series) three days later. It is the story of a dystopian future in which North America lies in ruins and has been replaced by the nation of Panem, with the Capitol (as in the capitol city) ruling over 12 districts. There was once a 13th district, but a rebellion led to its being annihilated, and in order to keep the memory of what happens to rebels alive, the Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games. Though there's a little more to it, essentially the Hunger Games is a battle to the death on live TV between 24 kids -- one boy and one girl from each of the remaining districts. Katniss, the main character, is one of the competitors from District 12 and the book follows her through her struggles to stay alive and beat the Games.<br /><br />One of my favorite genres is dystopian fiction, and The Hunger Games absolutely lived up to my hopes for it. The emotions that ran throughout the story were raw and powerful, and I found myself on the verge of tears along with Katniss at a few especially heartbreaking moments and cheering her on the whole time. Katniss is also one of my favorite heroines, living up to her characterization as a survivor in every way. Suzanne Collins did a great job of developing the characters as well as could be done in a book where people are being killed right and left. I felt like I was able to learn enough about the main characters to be sympathetic to them, and yet enough was left in the air that I was still able to be surprised at the twists and turns of the story.<br /><br />I simply could not put the book down and when I was done, I couldn't wait to read the next one. The pace of the book kept me on the edge of my seat at all times and the straightforward, no-frills writing was perfect for the story. Ultimately, The Hunger Games is not just the story of Katniss, Peeta, and the others -- it is an amazing psychological novel about both the cruelty of power and finding the strength to overcome it.e heroines, living up to her characterization as a survivor in every way.

030746363X|5.0|This is the most comprehensive diet/workout book on the market. And I've read them all. It is practical, easy to apply, and provides you not just with advice, but with the all important why of everything that is recommended. All other books are a waste of time. If you had to choose one book to provide you with guidance on your journey to transform your body, make it this one.
031603438X|5.0|I've enjoyed the Rolling Stones for many years, heard all the stories the media has printed about Keith and thought he was some sort of nut.  This autobiography pretty much debunked that.  Despite the help he may have had writing the book, it still comes off as a nice long chat between Keith and the reader. It was a fantastic glimpse into his life, but more importantly it shows who he is as a person--to his family, his friends, his fellow musicians.  I could not put this book down.  Long live Keith Richards, the real deal of rock and roll!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Loved every minute of the show.  Lots of action, finally, a little show of love and affection.  Truth and honor prevailed.
B0047ZF5VI|3.0|I'm a big fan of Daniel Lanois, as a producer and a musician on his own solo albums - he was wonderful when I saw him live as well.  I was very excited for a new album, but I must admit that I'm disappointed hearing this now.  Trixie Whitley's vocals are the reason - too overwrought and unnatural.  I'm sure she has a fine voice, but it sounds to me like she's trying too hard for a style and sound that doesn't come easily to her.  The musicianship and production is what I expect from Lanois, and there are some good songs on here, I just wish it was Dan singing them.  I know this is a new band and not a solo album, but I can't see myself listening to this much more.
0786868724|1.0|The title tells you to \\"have a little faith\\" but all the author says, in the end, is \\"i'm in love with hope\\".  I understand the two are borderline the same thing, but not when it comes to God.  I find it hard to be inspired when the author isn't even inspired. He meets two VERY inspiring people from two different religions and still has no strong faith in one or the other.  He almost sounds as if he is trying to be liked by every religion, but what does it say when he can't even say he has faith in his own God.  What Mitch needs to do is humble himself take a good look at the people he has been blessed to meet in his life and give God the credit due.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh takes a long time between albums, but it is worth waiting for.  No matter what language he sings in, it is always beautiful and relaxing.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy this one.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|The 2009 remaster is really brilliant.I love the sound and the artwork/booklet.This is really a nice improvement over the 1987 release.To be fair,the 1987 release of Pepper, did have a nice booklet, compared to the other releases from that period.The sound is the main reason for this upgrade,not the artwork.You can at once,notice the sharp,clear tone of this music.Pauls bass is much more distinctive.It jumps out at you,as do the background vocals (see A Little Help from my Friends).Listen to Lucy,then play the old version.Johns voice is so loud and clear,as is Pauls background vocals and his bass.I never noticed(heard) his bass lines like this,they are climbing up and down the frets in the background.Shes Leaving Home sounds so good.The violins are louder,and more precise.I always loved this underrated,sad song,about a teenage runaway.Johns background vocals are crisp during the whole tune.They were always there of course,but now they really stand out.Mr.Kite just blew me away.Johns voice,Ringos highhat in the background,then the wild,circus music,just simply flys out of your speakers.Just fantastic sounding.Lovely Rita,at the 27 second mark,a horn jumped out of my speakers and it really shocked me.There are moments like this,all over this remaster.<br /><br /> That being said,I always felt Srawberry Fields/Penny Lane would have  made this LP one of the best ever.Hands down.George Martin has said,many times,his biggest mistake was allowing those 2 songs to \\"get away\\".I also felt,George Harrisons Only A Northern Song (recorded during Pepper),would have fit in quite nicely, instead of Within You/Without You.Imagine side 2 of Pepper,starting with Strawberry Fields,Only A Northern Song,When Im 64,Penny Lane,Lovely Rita,Good Morning,Pepper reprise,A Day in the Life.Much better,stronger release, IMO of course.I always felt side 2 was,missing something.Try Pepper in that order,with those 3 tunes added in,to your own version of Pepper.Cheers.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|My wife and I rarely watch any TV shows, but we go out of our way to catch up on Castle.  Interesting plots and characters, witty writing with enough depth to keep you guessing.  A nice blend of crime drama and comedy.  She bought season 1 for me for Christmas, but it didn't take us long to re-watch those episodes.  We were lucky enough to snag season 2 here on Amazon for an incredible price right after the first of the year.
B00275EHJG|1.0|First of all this movie should never have been given a \\"G\\" rating. It's dark, depressing, and has some very intense scenes. I wish I would have rented it first, I never would have bought it. I am seriously thinking of returning it. Terrible. Not even close in quality to the first two Toy Story movies. Again, to parents and grandparents, this is a very dark Toy Story. Scary and depressing.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|**Slight spoilers** But don't worry, the movie sucks anyways***<br /><br />This is one of my most hated movies of 2010. The implausibility of it and the ridiculousness. This movie really had no reason for it to be made. The whole movie, until the end, you aren't really given a good idea of who's good and who's bad, which could have been cool, but it just failed. The background story was alright, the idea of Russians taking in young children and training them as spies. I wish it was more about that. Anyways, this movie sucked.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|There were times when I chuckled but overall I did not like this book. I was always fustrated<br />for the characaters.
030746363X|5.0|The thing I like about Tim is he always provides practical, empirically tested wisdom. Do I agree or wish to apply all his maxims? Of course not but I do find his advice and thoughts very provoking.    This book has great insights on how to workout effectively, eat right and a whole bunch of other great stuff. Now stop reading all these reviews and get the book already!
B001TH8UUA|1.0|Bought this to connect my new Xbox 360 to my receiver or my HDTV. Cable creates significant, experience-destroying distortions (pixels flash green, flash red, TV shows a message that it's a \\"mode not supported\\", etc.) whether plugged into the receiver or directly into the TV. Using other (non-AmazonBasics) cables, Xbox works great plugged in directly to TV or via receiver.    Clearly you get what you pay for?
B001QXE0OC|1.0|My 7-year-old daughter is into these Disney singers (plus Miranda Cosgrove), and I expected this album to make me cringe just as hard as the others through her bedroom door. The surprise was that this one is much, much worse than the others, just intolerable (so bad that I am actually here writing a review!). Selena Gomez makes Miley Cyrus look like Janis Joplin and Miranda Cosgrove seem like the second coming of Madonna (assuming this is a good thing). Disney needs to either put brakes or a heavier filter on their star-making machine, because with this (and let's not forget about Mitchell Musso's dying digital gasps), they, well, you get the idea.
B001NHZ2KW|5.0|In case you are like me & wonder which version is the same one you can get through Netflix (because it was so stinking good you now need to own it), this is it. Amazon lists the title exactly like this:<br /><br />The Who: The Kids Are Alright (Special Edition) (2008)<br /><br />and it's the one with the Ox Cam Bonus Feature on disk 2 and the wonderful long interview with Roger as well. Freaking Who Fan heaven.<br /><br />There's also a beautiful little booklet that came in this special edition. I feel like a teenager again flipping through it. I'll stop gushing now. Go buy it. Just make sure you get the Special Edition with the bonus disk, not the Deluxe Edition that only has 1 disk.
B000W3Q1HG|5.0|I loved this book. Regardless of your religious or non-religious beliefs, this book allows the reader to deal with lifes problems by looking at 'the bigger picture'. My only complaint is that it ended too soon! I'd highly recommend it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is an outstanding movie.  What a classic!  Such amazing restoration and digitization.  Already enjoyed the colorization as well as the classic black & white in tape formats but I never viewed such clarity with an old movie as with this work.  Simply fantastic.

B000784WMW|2.0|This is the first production of Jane Eyre I've seen.  I was rather disappointed in the story.  If you like the story, the presentation itself was good. Seemed a little long and boring.  Also, they said several times that the Timothy Dalton character was not a handsome man--but then they should have gotten a less handsome actor to play it.  This is not a movie I will watch again and again.  Maybe once every 5 years.
B002ZG9940|1.0|Without question the single worst waste of time and single biggest waste of money all rolled up in one.  Clooney has really never made a good movie, but this movie sets the low bar lower.  It just goes to show how desperate worn out actors are for money to agree to \\"act\\" in this pathetic movie.  Don't waste your time on this one,.
B001IF252M|1.0|The bad:  Max resolution 1600x1200 @ 60hz = super lame, especially if it's going into a CRT--not enough refresh. This is not specified anywhere. SO BEWARE.  The screw threads for the vga cable are set way too deep inside the adapter; you'll be lucky if you can get 1 1/2 twists on the cable's screws.  The good:  It's all sorts of pretty and white.  So typically Mac, with looks superseding function.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and new right away this was a keeper!  We have the old version and they are both great.

It came in just a matter of days after placing my order.

0802473156|5.0|The author takes a very casual approach in analyzing atypical problems in short term and long term relationships. It's very eye-opening to be able to take a step back and look at the reasons marriages fail and relationships fall apart. Just like the average person has their own fortes whether it be sports, cooking, math, or art, each individual has their own way to express themselves. It's just the same with emotions. No two individuals express themselves in the same way. We're all raised differently and in different environments which results in various ways of expressing and desiring affection. This book will help understand these ways and if the author's words are applied, will also help improve not just your marriage but all of your relationships.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|Careful.. I have a Vizio VBR 100 with the latest firmware update, and this is the only blu ray disc that will not play on it. It loads to about 80% and then stalls completely. I even talked to Vizio's tech team and they cannot find issue. Sony has some technology on it, and prevents from reading on some players. I've played Star Trek and Avatar special editions with no issues.    I saw the movie in the theater and it was great, so I have to at least give Angelina Jolie a few stars. My disappointment is with the technology.
037571457X|5.0|OK I didnt really read this book.  I hate required readings, even if its a good book.  This was a required reading, so I hated this book and avoided reading it as much as possible, but it had good pictures that kept me awake during lecture.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Great special effects.  A little violent, but what can you expect from a gladiator series?  Also, not for the young, as there is a lot of sex, but the end is excellent!  I can't wait for the next season to come out.

B003PIUC02|4.0|I already loved the season after watching it on Starz. So it is awesome. I bought it on blue-ray to collect it but was a little bit disappointed with the packaging. The packaging seems too \\"Cheap\\" it could use some improvement.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I was practically born a Jane Austen fan, and when I heard that they were making another version of Emma, my initial reaction was to roll my eyes. Only minutes into the movie, I knew that my first response was completely wrong. Everything about this movie was wonderful! I have watched it several times in spite of it's length. Although I still love both of the 1995 versions for different reasons, this is my favorite adaptation of one of my favorite novels.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|If the political subject of the film was just a way to interweave the Rodriguez violence and interesting characters (Trajo would make an awesome leading man, but he just came across as a slow hyper-sexual idiot....somewhat retarded even) then I would have no problem, but the attempt at political and moral lessons are not only present, they are all pervasive.....and extremely infantile and just plain wrong.    There are no moral characters in the movie yet Rodriguez presents it in a way, shoves it in your face in every scene, that there are the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" and it is done in a way that a 6 year old might do it.     I don't care that much, it is just a Rodriguez film and it is not that depth was expected, but neither was the attempt at depth which was ever-present and failing miserably.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|It was nice to buy the entire series in one shot rather than piece together seasons and half seasons. Deleted scenes answered a number of questions as well.
0783229372|3.0|\\"The Hindenburg\\" (1975) was directed by Robert Wise (The West Side Story, The Sound of Music, Andromeda Strain). The movie covers pretty much all of the theories about the crash of the Hindenburg from the bomb theory to the leaking of hydrogen gas.The film begins with a Universal Newsreel that gives a history view of the lighter-than-air craft, and ends with actual black and white footage of the crash which is weaved with invented footage. George C. Scott portrays Colonel Franz Ritter who has been placed on board the Hindenburg with the intention of protecting the air ship since numerous threats have surfaced preceding the flight. The film creates a sort of perfect storm of problems that possibly besieged the flight which led to its fate. All in all the film is an effective dramatic portrayal of the speculated events, with perhaps the real highlight being that one has the chance to see a recreation of the mammoth air ship (245 meters in length) from the outside, and within its interior labyrinth of metal corridors that ran through the frame. The creaking frame seemed to portend to its fatal demise.<br /><br />The DVD has not been remastered, and is very grainy, as it resembles a VHS digital transfer. There are many instances of dust showing, but the colors and black levels appear quite good.
B003Z9Q4Z8|4.0|History Of Modern is the long awaited return for OMD, their first album released in the US in fifteen years. A band that for the most part thought lost in the 80's since the acclaimed \\"Crush\\" and \\"The Pacific Age\\", they had a few album released in the 90's that tried to fit the sounds of the time but were for the most part ignored. Mounting a comeback in the 21st century would seem a daunting challenge but one OMD picks up none the less. History Of Modern harkens back to the well produced and thought out albums like Crush. The go back to their signature sounds of electronic strings and chorus-like vocals. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys high tenor voices sound just as good as back then. They go back to topics they've covered before. Religious themes like Sister Marie Says (available for free at the OMD website) sounds like an updated version of Anola Gay. The refrain of \\"New Babies: New Toys (\\"It's better for the girls but it's bigger for the boys\\") has all sorts of possible imagery. \\"History Of Modern part I\\" is a techno-dance track with a philosophy of nothing today really matters as the moments move away. Many other tracks song of love and loss. Probably the most catchy song is \\"Pulse\\" which has a very strong to the classic Laidbach dance track, \\"White Horse\\". This is unquestionably one of their best efforts. Not a perfect album by any means especially \\"Sometimes\\" with the constant refrain of \\"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\\". But OMD has successfully managed to bridge the decades together to put together a winning and provoking album.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|What's not to like?  A very enjoyable movie.  The extra features are worth what amounted to a small difference in price.
1594202842|2.0|Just as reality TV stars try to be exceedingly mean, rude, or painfully stupid to ensure attention and air time - this author has done the same.  If she wrote the typical Chinese mother story it may have included intense pressure and efforts to promote excellence in specific categories but it would have probably been as dull as the children this author has produced.  So, she took it to the extreme to make some money - perhaps to pay for all those lessons she poured $ into or to make up for the lost income on her career.  In any case, she is pimping out her daughters, and shaming Asians everywhere to make some money - sad but true. I guess she really needs the cash or she is hoping some college will take her daughters based on pity because over-achieving Asian kids are not a hot commodity in college admissions these days - dime a dozen.
B00436GNVC|1.0|I almost bought this cd based strictly on how much I liked ROCKFERRY. Then I read some of the reviews here. Glad I did. I checked out a copy and found this dreg almost unlistenable. Duffy-Please don't put out any more garbage like this. And get out a new cd SOON!!
B003EYVY04|1.0|I as well am very disappointed that this and the 4th do not have extended editions of the movie. that is the ONLY reason that I bought the 1st and 2nd ultimate editions. I bought the 3rd without reading the cust reviews so my bad there, I doubt it very much that I will be buying the 4th. I don't think I will even be watching the 3rd since it is the same as my 2-disc set. :( very poor planning of Warner Bros. when getting these together.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie it was in 3-D. As usual, the 3-D glasses were dirty. We tried to clean them with the supplied cleaning cloth but it did not help much. We then spent about 15 minutes trying to get a different pair of clean glasses. We finally settled for the least dirty ones we could find.  It was like watching a movie through a dirty window.  THIS WILL BE MY LAST 3-D MOVIE EVER.    About a week later, we saw the movie in 2D, it was FANTASTIC! I now have to agree with Roger Ebert, see: \\"Why I Hate 3-D (And You Should Too) by Roger Ebert\\".    There is only one part of the movie that was completely unbelievable. Three little girls waiting to be adopted. There is a hyper shortage of adoptable children in the United States, in the real world they would have been adopted in a nano second. (Yes, I know, it's only a movie.)    Shrinking the moon would be easier than finding three girls to adopt.    The minions are adorable. They are hard workers, and eager to please.    I purchased the Blu-ray version of the movie, it included a standard definition DVD and a digital copy. The digital copy loaded into my Macintosh without incident. I appreciate having the standard definition DVD for older players.    My only criticism of the movie (or rather the DVD authoring) is that it is time-consuming to get the movie to actually start. The introductions are too long and the menus are too complicated.    I highly recommend this movie, it's not just for kids.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Without a doubt ,one of the best movies I saw last year,Wife loved it,kids loved it ,grand kids loved it.
B003HYNB34|5.0|At first I was a little put off by the better CGI, HD image and higher production values in general.  Seemed a little non-Doctor Who-esque.  But those things fade to the background pretty quickly.  The 11th doctor is much funnier than the 9th or 10th.  Whereas the 10th was very friendly, smart and melancholy/serious...the 11th is friendly, smart and funny.  I like the \\"bowties are cool\\" trope...it's funny.  Looking forward to season 6!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|My husband likes Clint Eastwood so I bought him this movie. We have watched it prior to buying it. I thought it was a good movie. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but still good & worth buying.
1439107955|5.0|Have you ever lost someone to cancer? Have you ever wondered about the history of cancer and how treatment of the disease has evolved throughout medicine and society? Do medicine and science interest you but you don't have a specific background in either? Alternately, are you a practitioner or scientist who is interested in learning more about cancer? If so, then this book is for you.<br /><br />The Emperor of All Maladies is an riveting biography of cancer that reads like a novel. Mukherjee writes in a clear and concise way that is not too difficult for the layman and not too repetitive for those more schooled in the subject. Through reading about the history of cancer and how remedies have been approached over the centuries, we learn more about ourselves as humans.By the time I finished the book I felt as if I had a better understanding of the struggles Mukherjee faces as a doctor and the pain involved in trying to understand the disease. The book is lengthy but is written with exquisite style that is it easy to burn through.I could not put this book down and was found each chapter intriguing. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever dealt with cancer in any way or simply wants to learn more about this enigmatic disease.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|bought this as a gift~The recipient loves it! As a matter of fact,I think this is one of the better movies I saw last year too.
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|...then don't expect this to be a Killers album.    Brandon Flowers seems to have grown as a musician and you will understand when you take a listen.  Brandon writes and sings about his struggle for spirituality in Flamingo.  Some might find singing about spirituality is cheesy but something about Flamingo, sparks a flame into your soul that has you thinking about your own self.  I for one love a album that keeps me guessing about myself.  The music keeps you entertained, the vocals are tight and the lyric's will haunt your soul.    Don't pass up this album, you will be sorry you missed something amazing and very underrated.    Key Tracks:  Only the young, Hard Enough, Jilted Lovers and Broken hearts, playing with fire, crossfire, jacksonville, on the floor, Right behind you
B004BRP7R4|2.0|I listened to this today.... and it was disappointing.  Nothing about the CD engaged me - the voice wasn't powerful enough to impress me, there was nothing in it to move me, and I found myself skipping to the end of a few tracks after 3 minutes of boredom.  I loved the earlier work, and there was nothing here for me.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This was a great choice for my kids ages 3, 5, and 8. They all love it and my husband and I think it is great too!
B0036EH3X4|5.0|We were so excited to finally have Lost's final season!!! We have been so eager to see the extra footage and learn more about what happened while Hurley and Ben were still on the island. Being that this was a blu-ray box set the quality was amazing! I'm so glad we chose to spend the extra money and buy the blu-ray.
0743298039|4.0|Fantastic book that was different from the moment i picked it up till the day i put it down (2 days later!). Had many twists, kept me guessing, an interesting heroine and a great setting - enjoy!

1594202842|1.0|As an Asian American woman and a \\"Chinese\\" mother, I find this book disturbing in its negative stereotyping of Chinese and Chinese American parents.  I have known dozens of \\"Chinese\\" mothers - immigrants and American born alike - and none who have parented as this author.  As a Harvard undergraduate during the years that the author was there, I do not recall the author attending any of the many meetings or social occasions held by the Asian students on campus.  Although the book discusses the author's \\"Chinese\\" upbringing, and refers to the Chinese food that she loved as a child and the \\"high culture\\" of her Chinese ancestors, there is little in the book to indicate that the author is, or considers herself to be, part of a larger community or network of Asians or Chinese in America, an affiliation that's critical if the author's voice is to be heard as at all representative of that community.  Chinese and Asian parents run the gamut, and there are certain to be extremes, as in any race.    The author's statement at the beginning of the book that she uses the term \\"Chinese mother\\" loosely, and that the term \\"Chinese mother\\" can include non-Chinese mothers and even non-Chinese fathers, does not save her from a perception among many that she has exploited her ethnicity -- and Chinese people -- to sell this book.  If the definition of \\"Chinese mother\\" is that loose or broad, why use the term at all?  The author tells readers that she knows \\"some\\" Chinese mothers who don't practice her method of parenting, but she doesn't tell us how many Chinese mothers she knows that employ her parenting method, or, as importantly, what proportion of Chinese or Chinese American mothers have parented their children as she has.  Her book leaves the unfortunate impression that the extreme practices she employed during her daughters' formative years - practices that have been roundly condemned by the American public as extreme and abusive - could well be the norm among Chinese American parents.  That impression is reinforced not only by the many references in her book to \\"The Chinese way,\\" \\"Chinese parents,\\" \\"Chinese mothers,\\" the \\"Chinese strategy,\\" or the \\"Chinese method,\\" but as well by her standing as a Yale Law School professor.    What the author presents in her book as \\"the Chinese way\\" is based not on any unique research she has undertaken, but on her own upbringing by ethnic Chinese parents who grew up in the Philippines, and emigrated to the United States from there, not China.  The author refers to \\"tons of studies out there showing differences between Chinese and Westerners when it comes to parenting.\\"  What the author doesn't say is whether the Chinese parents surveyed in those studies adopted the extreme tactics - withholding food, water, and other basic necessities - that were publicized in the mainstream media as \\"the Chinese way.\\"      In recent days, under fire from both Western and Chinese parents, the author has \\"retreated,\\" reversing course and shifting her emphasis in comments that have appeared in written, audiotaped, and videotaped interviews in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, CNN, and the Today Show.  She is uncomfortable when asked about \\"the Chinese way,\\" and says that her story is really an \\"immigrant\\" story, using phrases such as the \\"strict immigrant model\\" and the \\"tough immigrant way.\\"  She emphasizes that her book is a \\"memoir,\\" and not a how-to manual.  And she (to CNN), and in one interview alongside her husband (NPR), has stated that the \\"Chinese\\" values embedded in her book are really \\"traditional American\\" values that today's generation of Western mothers have lost sight of.  With these statements, the author is effectively acknowledging that her book's repeated references to \\"the Chinese way\\" and to \\"Chinese\\" parents, mothers, methods and strategy, were poorly chosen and unsupportable.  But is a one week publicity tour adequate to address a defect of this importance in a book that remains in print as originally written?   Might a responsible publisher, and an author whose life work is supposedly dedicated to scholarship, consider altering the book to remedy this defect?    Having read the book, I do not deny that the book is at times funny, the author at times self-deprecating, and that at the end of the book the author is humbled.  But there are also instances in which the author is dead serious, as when she introduces the story about her daughter's perfecting The Little White Donkey with the sentence \\"Here's a story in favor of coercion, Chinese-style,\\" and congratulates herself by noting that her reluctant husband agreed that the coercive tactics she used had achieved her goal.    If some parents find value in reading this book because it causes them to reflect on their own parenting styles -- even if they deplore or disapprove of the author's parenting method -- fine.  Had the book's storyline been presented as a \\"memoir\\" written by a daughter of strict, high-achieving immigrants, the same reflections about parenting styles could have occurred.  But this \\"memoir\\" -- written by a law school professor in whom the general public might otherwise have little interest -- would not have captured the attention of the American public without a hook.  A book written about \\"Chinese mothers\\" and \\"the Chinese way,\\" however, might intrigue the American public.    The important lesson to be learned from this book is found not within its pages, but from the public outcry that ensued.  We are reminded of the importance of playdates and socialization, and the dangers of pursuing academic excellence and perfectionism to the exclusion of everything else.  A child raised in that fashion might become overconfident, unaware of or indifferent to the society around her, and write a book about \\"Chinese mothers\\" that isn't really about Chinese mothers, all the while believing that the benefit to society from a book written in that fashion could outweigh the harm it could cause.Reviewer's note:  The above is an expanded version of a review I wrote on January 12, 2011.  This expanded version was written on January 19, 2011.
B0015HZAK2|5.0|I am completely satisfied with my music purchase from Amazon.com. The cd that I ordered arrived quickly and in great condition. The cd sounds awesome...I have no complaints. I would not hesitate to make another music purchase from Amazon.com
0765326353|5.0|The of Kings is a terrific book that will suck you in from beginning to end. I found myself reading it every second I got, between classes, while eating lunch, the works. I highly recommend it. Sandersons way of writing is one that really captures the readers interests. Its full of detail and placed in a new world, and keeps you on your toes throughout the book.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This heatsink keeps my i5-750 well below what the standard Intel heatsink did, even at about 150% of its original clock. I'm running it at roughly 3.8 GHz, and my temperatures at idle are around 30C. Under normal use, I've yet to see more than 45C. Very well designed product, and it's cheap! Really a win-win situation for the consumer.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Despicable me is a Fun , entertaining story for people of all ages!I am so glad I purchased this dvd, and I hope that you will be as well. Have fun and enjoy! :)
B000WZB944|5.0|I am completely satisfied with my music purchase from Amazon.com. The cd that I ordered arrived quickly and in great condition. The cd sounds awesome...This is one of the best cd's ever released. After U2 released this cd, they really became one of the best bands in the world. I have no complaints. I would not hesitate to make another music purchase from Amazon.com
B001E45XT4|2.0|I've had these for 4 days and they weren't worth the price. Anyone in the house can hear what you're listening to, the sound is poor, the cloth ear pieces are unnatural, feels cheap. Bleh find something better.
B00447G2PM|5.0|Awesome, best 3-D technology I have ever seen, this is the movie we put in to demonstrate our 3-D TV !
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|This has a lot of great country music, and I am very glad to have the tracks by Gwyneth Paltro and Leighton Meester.  Who knew these actresses could sing so well?  I definitely recommend this to any country fan or any fan of this movie, which is so great.
B00013F35I|4.0|I purchased the DVD in mid December 2010. I have always respected the Boss, especially coming from Cleveland, a city that has embraced him second only to his east coast home. I embraced the Rising and  consider it one of his greatest pieces of work. I saw this tour and was excited to buy this disc. The song selection and concert is Awesome, but the recording at times can be muffled and distorted. Thus the four star rating. Still worth purchasing...
B000066C1N|5.0|Item was in great shape. Shipping was prompt...even during Christmas. Love the music,very inspirational. Lifts your \\"Spirit\\". Highly recommend the movie it's for also.
B004856SQ8|4.0|What I Can Tell You:<br />I never watched the original A-Team with Mr. T and Dirk Benedict but my grandparents watched it weekly and any repeat that aired. I was excited to see The A Team mostly because well...to be honest...Bradley Cooper is in it.  I am also a Liam Neeson fan so, I thought why not!?<br /><br />As a movie it was good. I thought there was some great action and as someone who doesn't know the story behind the original A-Team, the movie stood alone.<br /><br />This ragtag group of Army Rangers lead by Liam's character Hannibal are the Army's answer to superheros. They can pull off anything and do. If they weren't working for the Army, they would be dangerous criminals.<br /><br />There is a ton of explosions, car chases, funny lines, and fun. And, if this is not enough to make you want to watch it....there is plenty of Bradley Cooper minus his shirt or even with his shirt!<br /><br />Really fun movie. If you have a guy who loves action but you just can't sit through another shoot up/explosion movie. I promise you will be able to sit through this one.
B003XU75QG|5.0|Taylor Momsen sets herself apart from most musicians her age with Light Me Up, not only with her edge, but with her heart. With Momsen as a frontwoman, The Pretty Reckless accomplish more in one album than Taylor Swift does in three.
B000067J1Q|4.0|My daughter had heard the song \\"My Favorite Things\\", she started to search YouTube for the song and had memorized it in a day. It was important for us to find the movie so she could see there were many wonderful songs in addition to her new favorite. This movie, new, was not something I had anticipated to be over $50. Thank you Amazon! I was able to search for many reasonably priced used movies.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|Maybe I was expecting too much from this book.  A lot of reviewers have talked about how they couldn't put this book down. There was a lot of build up like something was going to happen...a twist...a shocking turn of events...but then...nothing...predictable and downright tedious at times.  I'm glad that I read it just to see what all of the buzz was about; but that's the only reason that I'm glad I read it!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I just finished reading Room and felt compelled to write this review because the characters in this book are so dull.    Kidnapping, imprisonment, sexual crimes, dangerous births - all great material for an interesting read.  Unfortunately, those topics cover about 1% of this book.  The other 99% is a 5 year old talking in toddler speak about things you couldn't care less about.  Further, anything interesting you'd like to know you have to hear about it like it's being explained to a five year old - because it is.    The mother in this book, for having such a \\"unique\\" life, is unbearably dull.  The 5 year old's biggest struggle's mostly include not understanding TV in some form or another, so he's really dull.  The evil man that's responsible for their unfortunate situation?  Some how the author makes him dull too.      Just not worth the money, plain and simple. You'll get 25 pages into this book and hope it gets more interesting - let me tell you - it doesn't.
B002ZG97EC|3.0|Bawdy humor? Check...    \\"A list\\" voice cast?  Check...    Overly simplistic plot? Check...    Textbook dance scene with stereotypical 70's classic? Check...    Like Shrek, and countless others of this vein, \\"Despicable Me\\" is as textbook (non-Pixar) animated as you can get. It's at the point of being laughable..but not in the way you WANT it to be laughable. It's more of a pathetic variety. This movie is so incredibly predictable and doesn't have the heart that so many of the reviews here claim it has. The children are bland and unoriginal (the smallest is a carbon copy of Boo from \\"Monsters Inc.\\"...just not quite as heartwarming). The story is just so cookie-cutter that it almost insults the intelligence (even the intelligence of the target 6 or 7 year old audience). With the exception of \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\"...these films should be left to Pixar. PERIOD!!    90 minutes of Steve Carell's bad Russian accent is enough to drive anyone nuts.     It was....just okay. Not good...not horrible. It was just...there. Which is a shame because I REALLY wanted to like this movie based on the reviews I read here.     Three stars is a gift.
B00001OH7V|4.0|If my title description hasn't clued you in yet then let me be plain: \\"Heros,\\" as are \\"Low\\" and \\"Lodger\\", is not meant to be heard as just a collection of clever pop rock, but more so as an experiment in modern sounds. The uncanny fidelity to these Modern Sounds - the elegant whirring and clunking of disinterested robots, as everything else around them crumbles and decays - is reason enough to listen to these albums. There's a few good, even great songs strewn about this trio, but their most impressive aspect is their cumulative effect. It all adds up to a grand, spectacular audio Polaroid snapshot of that moment in time. Bowie recorded these three albums while living in Berlin but they are infused with the potent visions he experienced on his recent tours of the USA. Just as Germany was echoing and reflecting the cataclysmic shifts in culture that America was undergoing, Bowie from a distance was moving sympathetically to our cultural spasms. At that time, when America sneezed, the Western World got pneumonia.<br /><br />Alienation is a fancy word for the uneasy feeling that many people had then, that things were going more than a little wrong for America. Most American's didn't want to hear about it so Bowie and Eno coded it, disguised it as music, or something like music. It's sometimes annoying, often disturbing, and always fascinating to hear an enlightened stranger's opinion of our own fiercely proud culture, and just so bizarre when they are so accurate. Bowie, like any worthwhile artist, was responding directly to the conditions he was encountering. Once he had gotten over his infatuation with our Philly Soul and the reality set in of just what was going on over here, he began to describe it very honestly. David always had a somber, minor key inflection to his art, but on these three discs he deflates his galactic bluesy crooner persona down to a lowly insignificant blip. He's hardly recognizable as the once pompously overblown opera cartoon of his previous albums. He's been devoured by the Great American Machine, reduced to an insignificant diode on the vast circuit board of US culture. But he's so very intent on telling us just what it's like being trapped inside here. And that's a very cool vantage point from which to issue snide commentary of our gargantuan, lumbering consciousness. If you can set aside your preposterously overblown pride, America, then I'm sure you'll discover some remarkable vistas here, on these three amazing albums. Like post cards from the belly of the beast. Thanks Dave.He's been devoured by the Great American Machine, reduced to an insignificant diode on the vast circuit board of US culture.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|This movie was by no means an action movie. It was not what I would categorize as a drama, although there it is certainly a tragedy. Although there is tragedy in the movie, contrary to impulse the movie is rather intentionally muted on the emotional level. I suspect that this was on purpose, perhaps to give the viewer an idea of the emotional sacrifices necessary when serving in clandestine services.    For many the main character's apparent apathy is a turn off. However, again this speaks to the purpose of the film. It shows the features needed in a member of secretive services, that is quite contemplation and calm mind. In fact, one might say that only people with this type of mind would be able to enjoy this movie. But I digress and propose that unfortunately many will not be able to appreciate the movie's value. It is indeed very cerebral.    So what is the movie about? Sacrifice in the name of patriotism. If you patiently watch this movie and consider what would be necessary to make such a contribution to one's country you will be able to appreciate what kind of life those lead in the actual spy world. In the real world it is not all the dramatic action as seen in the 007 movies. Consider that by definition most secret operations are meant to be kept quite. If such operators went around blowing things up and behaving in said manner nothing would be kept quite. That being said this movie is a better representation for those wanting to know what secret service is all about.    All in all I must say I love this movie. For me, it was amazing. But then again I've always had the type of mind that is suspicious, contemplative, loves detail and complication. So for those of you who are more prone to enjoy the simple things in life and detest complicated matters, you may want to avoid this movie as you'll likely find it long and boring (which it is indeed fairly long - about 2.75hrs).
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I enjoy movies, even ones that are WAY out there.  And this one was.  But I still liked it - escapism at its best.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is beautiful even when thin; I enjoy Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.  All three have great screen presence.  The action sequences were exciting even if not very believable.  I watched the theatrical version.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot and it kept me guessing (I figured out some of the plot twists but not all).  I would watch a sequel of this movie.<br /><br />My only small complaint - does anyone really think they can disguise Jolie when she has those lips sticking out in front of her?
B0015DROBO|2.0|this book moved really slow with way too much character development. even duringthe climax of the book i still felt it was forced and i could never get fully into it.
B0043EV774|5.0|Directed by Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp. Two of the best, this 3D version of a sequel to Alice in Wonderland (not a remake) is great! If you have a 3d TV this is a must have. I have also seen it in 2D (very good). The melding of animation and live action is nearly flawless and highly enjoyable, the 3d effects are superb. This is entertainment at it's best and I highly recommend it.
0345501292|5.0|This is a very cool comprehensive book.  I got it for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he loves it.  We are both big fans.
0141036249|4.0|Outliers is an excellent book which questions the way in which we think about successful people and success. It tries to emphasize that there is a lot more which goes on behind the scene in making someone successful, than just sheer brilliance. The book draws upon numerous examples from the lives of rich and famous people like Bill Gates, Bill Joy, Beatles. Outliers says apart from their intelligence, there was also a right mix of opportunities, people they knew and resources they had access to, which lead to their success. It also gives example of people with really high IQ who didn't become successful just because they didn't have all the right ingredients. The second part of the book is also very interesting as it analyzes the crashes of some major airlines with respect to the cultural background of the pilots. Similarly it also questions the schooling system of US in terms of the workload, the number of hours and such.    Its a very interesting analysis and fun to read. There are a few problems I have with the book. Part I and II don't really blend well together with respect to the message being delivered. Even with all the analysis I think you have to give it the talent of the people who made it to where they are. I think the book is a bit unfair on that aspect. Hence, overall a pleasure to read with a pinch of salt.
0061245097|5.0|\\"One Foot In The Grave\\" is a sexy, wild ride on the Cat and Bones train. It starts a bit slower, compared to \\"Halfway To The Grave\\", but maybe that is just my desperation for Bones to return. Jeaniene Frost's teasing writing style draws you right into the story. As usual, she does not disappoint. She knows exactly what we want more of - Cat, Bones, romantic scenes, vampire vanquishing, kickass fight scenes, sass, and spunk.<br /><br />The characters are deeper in this book. Emotions and relationships are more calculated. Cat and Bones have more between them than unsatiated lust. Cat seems to have grown to be more independent and surer of herself, but this has not at all affected her thoughts and feeling for Bones. Bones has more tricks up his sleeve and secrets to reveal. A huge revelation about Cat's father is unveiled. And there are two twists at the ending that literally left me with me with my jaw hanging.<br /><br />I like that other undead characters continue to have a spotlight. Rodney, the ghoul, returns to help save the day. I like that the ghouls aren't minions, rather just different from the vampires. I also appreciate that Jeaniene Frost didn't go for the obvious and use weres.<br /><br />Although the addition of the government team and Cat's new-to-us best friends help the storyline and the increase the possibilities for future sequels, I am not terribly fond of the new `Scooby Gang'. I have a secret desire for Cat and Bones to work alone with no outside influences or distractions, in an us-against-the-world sort of thing. The new characters may have a place in the book but have yet to find a place in my heart.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />There is no disenchantment or let down in the second book of the Night Hunter series. Emotions run high, excitement abounds, and sensuality oozes from the pages. \\"One Foot In The Grave\\" leaves me with the familiar desire to immediately pick up the next sequel.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Bought as a gift for someone who has run their vch down and needed to upgrade. thanks for the great buy of a classic.
1594484775|4.0|Nick Hornby surprised me with this book. Mostly positive of course. In the beginning I thought the story was going to be about Duncan, a devoted fan of Tucker, who is an old rock singer in decadence. Duncan is quite standard. Young sprit, who is involved in several funny situations and is ready to do whatever it takes to remain as the person who knows the most about Tucker, his music hero. Duncan catches interest from the very first line.<br />However, different from what I was expecting, the story makes a shift to Annie, Duncan girlfriend over the last 15 years. Here, the book gets much more serious and adds a lot of psychology and feeling to the drama.<br />A book to like but not to laugh as much as what I was expecting from Hornby. The story is written in a quite seroius mood with few exceptions such as that of Jason, Tucker's youngest son being a very important exception throughout the full story.<br />The book is about making a shift in personal life (with all elements; family, career, sex, internet, music, heroes) before it's too late. While reading the book, it is very easy to end up asking yourself the same questions that Annie, Tucker and Duncan bring to the story. It ends up being very intimate novel, I think.<br />A couple of negatives. I never ended up liking Annie for example (not that I was needing to like her but I felt like the absence of more fun situations from such an outstanding author), and Tucker is too anti-hero, I guess.<br />Anyway; an excellent, easy to like and contemporary book.
B00402FGE4|2.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  We were going through withdrawal from Stargate sg1 and Atlantis - they were so wonderful.  We couldn't wait for a sequel.<br />But, sadly, Stargate Universe bored us to tears. It barely tied into the earlier series. Nothing similar to wraiths, no replicators, no guo'olds, no interesting aliens.  The world supposedly had years of stargate experience and space travel, yet they sit on earth, helpless to try to find the Destiny where the characters are stranded.  They make no attempt to contact any of their alien allies to get help.  They just rely on the memory stones, which conveniently were brought on board the Destiny in the emergency evacuation of Icarus.  They are used too much, and not explained well for people who haven't seen the original series. There must have been different writers than the ones who penned Stargate 1 and Atlantis because it plodded along without much excitement.  The characters are weak, or just downright uninteresting. Cloe is young, worthless and oversexed, yet included in decisions by Colonel Young - why?, Eli is silly, stuck on Cloe who uses him.  Colonel Young is indecisive and terrible leader making unbelievably weak or stupid military decisions.  No one could have reached the rank of colonel with such inability to lead.  The plot? struggles along, peppered with unneeded sex scenes.  Young's ex lover, Johansen, is beautiful and totally devoid of emotion or personality.  Young has fathered a child on her, but doesn't act all that interested. There is little connecting Universe to the original Stargate series except short guest roles by Jack O'Neil, Sam Carter and Daniel Jackson.  One would think if people were living off planet, and soldiers who supposedly are experienced off world, they would show some training based on the years of knowledge gained by others in Stargate 1 and Atlantis.  But no, you have seemingly untrained military and a few semi knowledgeable civilians all acting like they need to be told when to eat dinner.  Scientist Rush is about the most interesting and maybe Greer - at least they have a personality and initiative! At the end they throw in the Lucien Alliance and unless you have seen the original Stargate, you have no idea of what is going on at first.<br /><br />It actually started to become interesting the last two or three episodes - I'm hoping maybe year two is better?  I'll borrow it from the library, certainly won't risk more money on it.
0345457692|5.0|Richard K. Morgan weaves a pretty damn good web of detective/cyberpunk with his first novel in the Kovacs trilogy.  The premise of the interplanetary empire is rather simple but intriguing, people are not limited to life by the body they first inhabit, humans are now stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain.  Some groups, such as the Catholics, feel that you lose the soul through such a transition.  The lead character has changed bodies at least a couple of times to our knowledge, and has experienced violent death.<br /><br />He is brought to Earth to solve a murder, and who hires him but the man who was murdered?  I'm a police officer and that made for an intriguing job, actually having the victim there to talk to is an interesting.  I would recommend someone to pick it up if they enjoy cyberpunk, sci fi, and/or detective fiction.  This is a book full of sex, lies, and death and Takeshi Kovacs makes it a fun ride.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed it so much that I have already ordered the rest of the authors work.
B003YLM780|5.0|Admittedly, My wife and I love White Christmas, but seeing the predecessor \\"Holiday Inn\\" was nice because you get to enjoy another act with dancing and singing during the Christmas season.    Although White Christmas is my favorite, I still give Holiday Inn 5-stars because the acting was great all-around, and the music and dancing (especially Astaire's solo) can be enjoyed again and again every year without feeling old or out-dated.    The love-plot was simple and not overdone, and even though one may balk at the superficial nature of business and love, Holiday Inn does well to help one find that traditional home-centered love (Crosby & Reynolds) at the countryside Holiday Inn.
1400079144|3.0|The book is good and engaging. In the beginning you want to know how it ends and will continue to read. However as closer you get to the end you feel you will be letdown. The end is thoroughly disappointing.<br />There is no secret, no answer, no solution, only a word lost that will solve all problems. It was like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, when you pull the curtain away it is a disappointment. As is the end of this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you've not read this book and consider yourself to be into science fiction, then you are a living paradox.  Well written, living characters, moments when you catch yourself holding your breath as you read - fantastic book.
0399536108|3.0|I like this book. It teaches you some novel ideas and ways of thinking and doing things.<br />However, it is not as engaging as The Four Hour Workweek. That book is much more exciting. If you have money for only one book, buy the Four Hour Workweek. If you have money for two books, buy both.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Polanski's \\"The Ghost Writer\\", sees the director in fine form.  Like a well written suspense thriller, keeps the viewer enthralled from start to finish.  The concept of a \\"ghost\\" writer is very interesting, and not something frequently explored in cinema and Ewan McGregor's performance is intellectually passionate and fits in with the overall look of the movie, dominated as it is with rain and sea.  Nice to see James Belushi on screen again and a nice turn from Timothy Hutton, but was particulary happy to see a turn from the great Eli Wallach with Olivia Williams outstanding as Pierce Brosnan's political wife.  Pierce Brosnan himself gives one of his best performances in years.  Won't go into plot details, but found it wanting in the overall raison d'etre, but still well worth a look, and will keep you watching.
B0041T52S6|4.0|OK, not exactly.  But if you grew up with old-school video games at a time when arcades were popular, then you'll immediately get a feeling of happy nostalgia.  For that matter, if you're a bit younger than me, but are familiar with games like DDR and the Moral Kombat series, you'll get the video game references too.  As another reviewer said, it's a feel-good movie that makes you want to reach for your guitar or drums, break out the old video games down in your basement, and and just have some fun.  I enjoyed the comic book series, and while there is clearly a lot left out, the movies feels true to the spirit of the books.

B0042U94UQ|4.0|Sometimes, famous actors voicing animated characters are so recognizable that you can't help but picture the actor in your mind, slightly taking away from suspension of disbelief.  That is not the case here, and both the animation and the voice acting are absolutely delightful.  Great for all ages.
B0032JTV74|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my teens for Christmas as we weren't able to watch the series on TV. WOW! I so love this series! My daughters love it too. We also bought one of the music CDs which we play all the time. Wonderful cast, great singers, cute story & the cheerleading coach (played by Jane Lunch who just won an Emmy for her role) is an overgrown, mad, former cheerleader who just won't let the Glee club alone! I am waiting to buy Season 2. This is definitely one of my favorite shows on TV.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|This CD was a gift for our German son-in-law; it was on his wish list. I was not familiar with Norah Jones, so I was intrigued. He played it in the car while we were visiting them and I really enjoyed her music. The CD was good quality and a good value.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I first fell in love with Kenneth Branagh's interpretations of Shakespeare with his rendition of Much Ado About Nothing.  I was 13 years old.  It sparked a long and abiding love of Shakespeare, and when KB came out with his own version of Hamlet, with the full play, I was awed at how magnificently well done it was.  I can't say I was surprised, but indeed, I was awed.    What is there to like about this over other versions of Hamlet?  Well, for one, it's true to the original.  EVERYTHING is there.  What's also to love about this is that it DOESN'T include the ridiculous notion that Hamlet has an Oedipal Complex.  The Mel Gibson version incorporated that idea, and it came off as utterly absurd.  It doesn't fit.  Nor does the notion that Hamlet is crazy.  He's NOT crazy.  He's perturbed.  He's emotional.  And with good reason!  (Double entendre, sorry folks!)      Hamlet expressly says, just after learning the fate of his father, now a ghost: \\"Line 171 As I perchance hereafter shall think meet   Line 172   To put an antic disposition on\\".  His purported insanity is but a charade and a cover for his seemingly wild antics.  The play, with KB as Hamlet and director, then takes on a clear meaning as Hamlet's quest to take a survey of whom he can and cannot trust and how to deal with each and all accordingly.  Unfortunately, the line I cited above gets a bit lost in the moment, as Hamlet (KB) is still quite manic after speaking with his ghostly father--and who wouldn't be?    KB captures this well as the cast aptly demonstrates the confusion and misconceptions of the other characters regarding Hamlet and his behavior.  Hamlet didn't want to shag his mother:  he was angry at her for insufficiently loving his father that she could so quickly and so callously move on and marry the brother of her recently departed husband.  He is still grieving for his father.  And then on top of all, he discovers that his uncle/stepfather was the murderer!  That his own mother may have been complicit!  Who could one trust in such a situation?    Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet rendition is actually in Denmark, though at a later period than when Shakespeare was alive.  It's beautiful, dramatic, philosophical, poignant, emotionally keen and accurate, and the best you will ever see.  The music alone is a masterpiece, and paired with the film is beyond inspirational.  If I could give this a 6, I would!    - Jessica Adams
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was a little bummed about how it turned out, that it seemed another way the Hunger Games could have been written. But alas, one can't just skip a book in a series.<br />I read through it staying up late. It was exciting just seemed like a second version of the first.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know some of the other reviews indicate disappointment in the end of \\"Mockingjay\\". I read some reviewers also complain that the ending seemed \\"rushed\\". For me, the end of this series was perfect and exactly what I expected as I got toward the end of the story. I cannot even begin to think what Collins should or would add to the final chapter. I really like the entire series. Mockingjay was undoubtably the hardest read. I kept having to put my Kindle down for periods of time because of the intensity. It was also my favorite of the triology.    I started out reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" with a skeptical attitude. The fact that it was for a younger audience and the basic description of the book left me with little desire to read it but my new book group chose it as the first book. Suzanne Collins is gifted at setting the scene and introducing her characters to her readers. She is descriptive without making the books too long of a read. The attachment one feels for the characters and the feeling of being \\"in\\" the moment with them is what kept me reading these books. As each book ended I found myself immediately downloading the next in the series. By the time I got near the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" I found myself going back and reading pages over again to allow myself to truly enjoy every moment of the text. I rate Collins in the same class as Stephen King and JK Rowling as a master in keeping their audiences attention.    Excellent read!
B002ZG980U|4.0|Like Hitchcock and Kubrick, Nolan has the tendency to work out every last detail of his characters as if they were algebraic equations, to be worked out but without the existential heart or mystery.In the factory of dreams that is film, Nolan has developed an idea with such breath-taking virtuousity,planned action sequences of great splendour,that we are apt to overlook his inability to create believable characters that move you.Still you know this film could only get made using Nolan's expertise and DiCaprio's star power.The beating heart of the film comes from Mal(Cotillard) locked up in the subconscious of Cobb(diCaprio).Elaine Page(Ariadne)is an androgynous figure, explaining to the audience via questions or to provide exposition on her own terms,eg when Cobb lays down the rules of shared dreaming to us through Ariadne.     Since The Dark Knight,Nolan has been handed the keys to Hollywood to open up a Pandara's box of special efx,making a Faustian pact with the machinery of film, emphasising tendencies already latent in The Prestige and Memento to use trickery to hide a hollowness in his story-telling,a lack of soul,hidden by trap-doors,symbols,hidden secrets. The striking visualization comes from poverty rather than wealth.The plot needs explaining as it proceeds, disengaging you emotionally. Nolan has learned all the techniques of direction at the expense of emotion. Everything is done by sleight-of-hand as in previous films.His staging of dream-within-dream and dream-within-dream-within-dream,are cleverly conceived,highly-wrought constructions,with the conscious levels realized at the expense of the subconscious levels,affecting the latter dreamscape with meticulous,crafted logicality. Most breathtaking are the implosion of a Parisian boulevard, a runaway train careening down a Los Angeles thoroughfare, and a midair tussle in a hotel corridor.     The team members break off in rear-guards,defending one level so the rest can continue on in dreams-within-dreams. Nolan cross-cuts between each stage as synchronized alarm clocks tick toward zero, while surface actions send rippling reactions along the chain.On each level time runs at a different rate.There are hard-and-fast rules in this psychological pinball-in-a-dreamscape.The dreamworlds are carefully constructed by imaginative architects like Ariadne.Mess with the physics of the dreamworlds too much, and peoples' minds that are being heisted by extraction or inception,rebel against the unreality. The main characters are trapped four levels deep within a dream, racing against time, unable to tell real from fake and trying to escape up the chain of dreams before it all collapses into mind-melting nothingness.At the lowest level there is a James Bondian assault on a snowbound fortress,that seemed a cliché. Extractors are skilled in the art of inducing a dream in their target, creating an imaginary world in their mind, occupying that world, and using that imagination against them to find and steal their secrets.     Nolan plays around with the idea that reality is a construct in our heads,how real is the `real' world?He has no distinction between waking feelings and dream thoughts and feelings. There are derivations from other films: 2001, eXistenz,Cocteau's Orpheus,Last Year at Marienbad and The Matrix.Cobb is similar to the character DiCaprio played in Shutter Island,driven by memories of a dead wife. \\"The catharsis\\" at the center of Inception is based on Cobb's choice: whether to go on permanent vacation with his dream-memory of Mal, or to return to real life. It's deciding between eternity with a bitchy wraith, presumably sexless, like all of Inception's subconscious, or . . . that recurring sentimental snapshot-memory of his children?Nolan needs to just deal with ordinary people in the real world,bringing in more real world topics and concerns.Pare down,cut back.Become like Beckett to Joyce.              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B0042816YK|4.0|I bought this as a raffle gift for a small party I had with the girls. We enjoyed watching it and someone went home with the prize. My friends were excited, and everyone loves to win something! Obviously, this is not my kind of movie to keep and watch over and over. If it's your kind of movie, then it's a keeper. The acting and overall movie is well done, and the locations are stunning. If you are a fan of the book, which I'm reading currently - some of the stories/scenes differ in dramatic ways. That's Hollywood for ya.

142313494X|5.0|I had to read this book after watching the film. The Lightning Thief is a great young adult novel. It has all the elements that resonate with the Middle School-aged student: a child who feels left out, a step-parent that acts horribly toward the main character, a loving mother, a place where the unique, out-of-place youth can identify with others, and a major quest that only the youth can accomplish.    In this way, Percy Jackson is a lot like Harry Potter. Instead of witchcraft and sorcery, we're talking about Greek mythology and the gods.    Riordan has hit it out of the park with this first book. I'm looking forward to continuing this series.    The book is much different than the movie. Because of time constraints, much of the story needed to be condensed; but here, in the novel, you will get the full brunt of the betrayal and the insidious plot behind the stealing of Zeus' bolt.    The book is much better than the movie because the big reveal sets up the rest of the series.  The movie is better than the book because there aren't too many villains and backstabs to follow and some of the extra story is left out to streamline a well crafted visual representation.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I was a big fan of the original series and so far have been very impressed with the rebuild of evangelion project.  This is truly an anime that can take advantage of bluray quality as well.  While this movie encapsulates the original episodes 1-6, you'll see small divergences that really make me wonder whether this is a remake or some kind of sequel.  I'll leave that discussion to otaku forums though.  In short, if you were a fan of the original series, you owe it to yourself to see this.  If you were turned off from evangelion before because of all the Shinji head case stuff...it's still there!  However, I feel it works a lot better in this format and overall comes out a lot more balanced and enjoyable!  Casual anime fans should not miss this movie.  Once you see it, you'll be chomping at the bit for the next ones to come out!  Think the release of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, except this endeavor is a tetra-logy!
006176759X|3.0|I decided to pick up this series to see what the \\"hype\\" was all about. I heard that Lauren Corad's books were \\"really good\\" from a couple friends. It starts out as expected..but 200+ pages into the book, I was still bored and waiting for something interesting to happen. It was as if I was reading a manuscript of The Hills (maybe that was the intended purpose). It honestly DRAGGED until the end, with it's cliffhanger. And im not too fond of the way it was written. It was obviously written for young adults..or younger.<br /><br />That being said, it's not necessarily a bad novel, it's completely what you would expect it to be. Im still going to read the second novel...since you have to in order to find out what happens..and since I purchased them as a set lol.<br />Just don't go with the hype and expect it to be phenomenal. You'll be more satisfied if you begin reading it with the impression that it's going to be boring or worse.
1594202842|1.0|If she is trying to be funny, I find her writing more disturbing than funny and I find her tone unclear. Moreover, given that there exist a few parents who use her unusual techniques, it isn't funny to know that there are children familiar with the types of scenes she describes. Furthermore, she perpetuates stereotypes by calling her more extreme methods Chinese. Her writing spreads misleading information and hinders a true discussion of a topic that is complex and worth delving into.     Perhaps there is more clarifying information on her biographical information than what I have seen--did she grow up in, live in and/or work in China? From what I have seen, it does not seem she did to any great degree or that she did any particularly in-depth study on this topic.     Was she mothered by a mother who was born in and lived in China? From what I have seen, it seems her parents lived in the Philippines. It is very strange to be told by this author what it is to be mothered by a Chinese when I was mothered by a Chinese, who lived in China then in the Republic of China, where she went to school and began raising her older children. My mother was influenced by her Chinese mother and also shared insight into Chinese mothering with me as pertained to how my father was mothered in China. The author, however, is a Chinese American from what I have seen. The author's parents seems to have been ethnically Chinese minorities in the Philippines though perhaps there is more information on this.     Strangely, though, the book title sounds befitting of a stereotypical, exoticized, western perception about the Chinese though her book is written in English by a Chinese American who seems to spend much of her life speaking English with her Jewish American husband and half ethnically Chinese, half Jewish-American daughters. The book cover gives me the same impression though the book was written about life in the U.S. and is being publicized in the WSJ to a primarily U.S. audience.I have not seen the author clarify this except to qualify in her interview that, contrary to her posture, she wrote a book about her individual experience not about Chinese females. If that is the case, then why does she not refer to it as the Amy Chua way of mothering?    It is perplexing to read her unusual measures and watch her ascribe them to me and my family, particularly with the strange, unclear tone she uses. She does not seem to take into account the many factors that influence mothering. Various Chinese mothers mother differently. My father's mother tended toward permissive parenting. This was understandable given my father's family situation. The author has some valid points but veers toward the misleading, which I find too high and dangerous a cost. What I have read of her book is more than enough to raise these questions. I have a similar background to the author in terms of profession, associations with the same schools, firm and ethnicity and U.S. education from childhood onward, and it is strange to read this author's writing with this tone.    P.S. I was standing in line then waiting for the book I'd put on hold to be found (it had been misplaced) for so long I read this book at the store. (I was over halfway done by the time they found my book so I stayed & finished it.) Basically, almost a century ago (in the 1920s & early 1930s), the author's grandparents moved from China to the Philippines. The author's mother is the closest person in the book to a Chinese mother.  She moved from China when she was two to the Philippines. She disagrees with the author's approach & says so several times. The author repeatedly talks about how her behavior must be attributed to her being Chinese though how she comes to this conclusion is pretty strange, considering her own American background & her family's Filipino background. She even points out that someone says to her, \\"But you are not an immigrant\\" yet she persists in chalking up everything she does to her Chinese bloodlines. She focuses on her Filipino-born father's parenting approach for her approach as a Chinese mother, instead of her mother's, which also seems disconnected & pretty random. Mostly, the book is disjointed, digresses a lot & lacks structure. It is also pretty strange. Some moments are humorous & there are a few nicely written details, but the author simply comes across as not a balanced person & one who has a lot of deep issues she has not fully looked into & doesn't understand about herself. By the time she includes her very strange, long-winded notes to Lulu about violin practice, she seems very, very bizarre, like she & her children could benefit from some sort of intervention. The book strikes me as how I would imagine a very rough draft private journal of someone who has just begun therapy & will need several years of serious treatment finally to understand why she vents on people & intrudes so much on her children the way she does.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|While I do think Amy could use a little more humility, I heartily agree with the idea that self-esteem is built/created in not bestowed upon a child.  Praise not connected to performance is empty.  We have scads of kids who become insecure adults because their parents told them for decades how fantastic they were without helping them learn that lesson themselves by doing something remarkable...pursuing and achieving excellence.  When they finally unravel that mystery (if they ever do), it is like learning that Santa isn't real...a disservice to the kids.  I found the structure of the book to be a bit disjointed at times (so much for that Harvard education...Vanderbilt might have served her better :-)); however, she makes some excellent points with which I completely agree.  One need only look at the TIMMS scores to see the differences at a global level.  The end result of her mothering certainly seems to be an enormous success.  Kudos to her!    If nothing else, her book will make you stop and examine your own parenting.  A little self-evaluation never hurt anyone.

0205632645|5.0|This book is short, concise, and filled with information. Strunk and White have formed an ageless writer's manual and reference book. From basic grammar and punctuation with the first chapter 'Elementary Rules of Useage'. Rules two through five are helpful to curbing my long term love affair with the comma.<br />Chapter two 'Principles of Composition' is brimming with many tips are very often overlooked by amateur writers such as, 'Put statements in positive form.'(rule 15), 'Use definite, specific, concrete language.' (rule 16) 'Omit needless words.' (rule 17).<br />Chapter three 'A Few Matters of Form' gives quite a few references as to some advanced presentation and grammar. Such as the use of hyphens, parentheses, and margins.<br />Chapter four 'Misused Words and Expressions' has become a dog eared section in my book, I am learning that if a word or phrase sounds too neutral, degraded, confused, or cliche it probably is, I avoid the words 'nice','so'(as an intensifier), and 'literally'.<br />Chapter five, 'An Approach to Style' deals with common approaches to writing, such as 'Work from a suitable design.' (rule 3) which encourages writers to find a system to construct their writing.  'Use orthodox spelling.' (rule 10), while spellings such as 'thru', nite' and 'pleez' have become integrated into the English language, these words and a few others sound awkward and unintelligent on the written page. 'Do not construct awkward adverbs.' (rule 12) Adverbs are the dandelions of the parts of speech. These innocent looking -ly words can become troublesome pests and there are often unpretentious adjectives or particles already available without the -ly being attached. 'Do not inject opinion' (rule 17), Sprinkling opinion gives an egotistical tone or the opinion can be improperly timed and create a negative impression with the reader.<br />Overall 'The Elements of Style' has a great deal of examples, cover many subjects sprinkled with humor in a very organized book.

B002N5N5LG|1.0|I have tried several times to watch this series and don't like it.  I don't like the storylines or most of the characters.  I will try again because all of the people that gave this a positive rating must be seeing something in it that I don't.  I have quite an eclectic taste in DVD's and it is seldom that I don't find something in a show that I like but I couldn't with this one. Sorry but I would not purchase it.
1594202842|5.0|Since the book was just released on 1/11/11, clearly none of the 11/1/11 reviewers have actually bought and read it yet.  It's quite unfair to rate the book so poorly without having bothered to read it first.      The author's position may be extreme to some, but it has also worked for many parents.  I look forward to reading the book and plan to keep an open mind.  Remember, you can always learn something new -- even from those you disagree with.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|Easy A was amusing and took an interesting premise and ran with it pretty far. Emma Stone does her job efficiently and with appropriate levels of teen sarcasm and uncertainty. On the other hand, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson do as well as they can, but their characters are ridiculous cartoons. This is always a problem with teen movies, going back to Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause. They are the 21st century version of the girl's parents from Valley Girl - painfully hip and free and understanding. The mom and daughter talk towards the end was almost unbearable. Can't parents be written more believeably instead of like ridiculous cliches?<br />Nearly all of the problems I had are related to my a) watching a light-hearted movie too closely and b) being 47 and not 17. For the record, my youngest two kids (14 & 15 as I type) thought it was great. First - the concept seemed odd to me. I kept wondering why a girl having sex in high school was seen as so horrifying. Am I to believe that in 2010 (when the movie was released) high school students having sex is seen as taboo and the fast track to character ruination? I graduated in 1981 and I can tell you for certain - that wasn't the case then. Have we actually gone backwards in our social view of teen sex? Someone please contact you local conservative tea bagger and let them know the good news. To that point then; if that's the case, then why do so many of her peers want to be viewed as non-virgins as well? Is it the gender double-standard or is it a problem with plot consistency?<br />Spoiler alert: Secondly, when has a teacher having sex with students been treated with such a casual attitude? Not only does Emma Stone's character volunteer to assist the teacher in getting out of her mess, but she seems totally unfazed by it.<br />Lastly, the heavy handed nature of the movie is problematic. Not only the Scarlet Letter part, but the Christian bashing. Trust me - I am no fan of religion whatsoever, but this was simply over-the-top. It's this kind of blatant attack on religion that get the right all pissy about Hollywood. If you're going to bash religion - great - contact Bill Maher and work on a plan. But in a teen movie that has a fairly light tone, the sarcastic mockery towards Christians was like shooting fish in a barrel. It might've felt good at the time but it comes across as a cheap shot.<br />Like I said, I watched this far too closely and critically, but my review is more for the people who are from my generation. This movie has a target audience and I wasn't a member. I laughed a little, smiled a fair amount, and rolled my eyes as well. There's my review in a single sentence.e-top.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|This book is very inspirational.  I was raised in a household where my feelings and emotions were prioritized over my intellectual potentials.  And believe me, this does not make a happy adult.  Instead, I feel the pain of not having the opportunity  to achieve higher goals.  This book does not tell us to strictly follow it.  Instead, it simply tells us the importance of allowing our children to explore their potentials.  The very negative comments in here show how hesitant we are about allowing our children to become intelligent adults with plenty of options in their lives.  Enough with lazy children that just want to spent most of the day in front of garbage television.
B004FVHBXY|5.0|This movie is incredible!!  I have watched this movie numerous times and it never gets old.  Everyone I know that has seen it loves it too.  Such a great deal for such a great movie!  Two thumbs WAY UP!!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Bought this as \\"Used - Like New\\".  Not a scratch on it.  Great condition. Would buy from again. One thing to note about this movie is that it really is for teens and up.  Some of the ghosts are kind of scary to the kids.  You need to view it before the kids see it.
030746363X|4.0|I know that is hard to believe, but this great book, with all the great tests, needs more access to the data.  As an example, with the 4 horsemen, how long before he saw results?  The Results with them alone?  I admit, I have not read the entire book, but I do plan on doing my homework. Thank you Tim for laying the ground work.... and please post more data. LOL
B003V1WTMM|5.0|As always, Kate Morton has done a wonderful job of weaving a story that will keep you up because you can't put it down.  I love her sense of history as well as her descriptions.  I will read it again in a couple of months..and find things I missed the first time.  She is one of the few authors that I read over and over again.  I can't say enough good things about this author and her books.
1594202842|5.0|Asian pupils are have been renowned for high achievement for decades, at least as far back as when I went to school in the 1950s. The value of this book is not derived from relating how a 'Chinese-mother' in America drove her two very talented daughters to incredible academic, language, and music accomplishments through extremely demanding expectations (\\"nothing less than an A,\\" achieve the #1 rating, two hours of Chinese study and six hours of music practice/day - even on vacations, no TV or computer games) and closely supervised school performance and music practice. Nor does its value lie in reporting how an overly-demanding mother lost touch with reality, and almost her daughters and husband as well.<br /><br />The value of Amy Chua's \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" comes from providing some sense of how Asian (Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, Singaporean, South Korea, and Japanese) parents and their children strive much, much harder for achievement than Americans. That coupled with the fact that credible studies repeatedly conclude that Asian IQs average about ten points higher than Caucasian, a politically-incorrect topic we cannot even discuss in polite circles, goes a long way to explaining why America is losing in both academic and economic competition with the Asian Tigers and its Dragon. Her statements, though obviously extreme in some instances, parallel the findings of the late Professor Harold Stevenson (Univ. of Michigan) who compared pupil achievements and parental attitudes of Asian and American mothers, and are not to be dismissed lightly. A Hong Kong mother, writing in the 1/14/2011 Wall Street Journal, reports that many local kindergartens require children to prove language proficiency and be interviewed for admission when only 2; mediocrity is regarded as taboo. Chua also reports that a study of 50 Western American mothers and 48 Chinese immigrant mothers found about 70% of the Western mothers believed \\"stressing academic success is not good for children\\"; Chinese mothers, on the other hand, unanimously disagreed with most believing that getting children to be 'the best' students was the parents' job. Other studies found that Chinese parents spend about 10X the time that Western parents do drilling their children in academic activities.<br /><br />The essence of Asian pupil success is that their parents assume the children are competent, and that hard work produces accomplishment, which produces confidence and even more accomplishment; conversely, if you don't succeed, it's because you didn't try hard enough. In a less strident tone, Chua explains that it's all about making children the best they can be - one of her sisters had Down's Syndrome, and her mother never expected great academic results, instead spending hours and hours teaching her how to tie her shoes. (The other two also obtained PhDs.) Discerning readers will also sense that American parents pursuing high achievement for their children face a difficult and lonely job, and gain an understanding of why our school reform efforts haven't succeeded, and never will.n\\"; Chinese mothers, on the other hand, unanimously disagreed with most believing that getting children to be 'the best' students was the parents' job.

0060936223|5.0|\\"For all those years you protected the seed, it's time to become the flower.\\" (Stephen C. Paul).  This book would make an incredible film.  It is a combination biography (about Robert Mapplethorpe) and part autobiography about Smith.  She traces their early pre-fame years, framing their individual artistries in the innocence of youth  as they searched with hope of becoming their true selves. Things were different in the 60s, as we tried to experience our new-found freedom and shape our identies.  It is also a remarkable love story of two people who shared a love that went far beyond physical attraction and common interests.  Theirs was a deep and nonjudgmental love of the soul.  We should all be so fortunate to experience something even close to their love for each other.  Smith nurtured Mapplethorpe and helped him find and shape his true artisty while seemingly putting her own artistic dreams on the back burner.  Even when they went separate ways and Smith's own incredible talent was finally recognized, they remained spiritually close.  I lived through these times and for anyone else who also lived through these days, you will make personal connections to the events and happenings Smith cites as road markers along her own journey.  So many times as I read this book I recalled my own parallel journey.  If I had the money, I would positively buy the movie rights to this endearing and unforgetable memoir.Back then we were all just kids.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|David Fincher's THE SOCIAL NETWORK has created a lot of hype; as expected, the film itself doesn't quite live up to all the talk.  It is still, however, one of 2010's better films (in a year that produced quite a few good ones).  It's the story of Mark Zuckerberg, who created a little website called Facebook, and was subsequently sued by his friends for theft.  Whether or not this is the true story isn't important, of course--it's a movie, meant for entertainment.  And the surprising thing is, it does in fact entertain.<br /><br />The entertainment factor is largely due to Aaron Sorkin's fast-paced script, replete with quick scene cuts, a back-and-forth storyline, and dialogue that hits fast and hard.  It's a script that is perfect for Jesse Eisenberg, perhaps a little too perfect; he never really gets a chance to come into his own until the final third of the film (the final scene is a killer, mainly because of Eisenberg's wordless performance).  It's the supporting cast that really anchors the film: a gripping Andrew Garfield as Zuckerberg's friend and co-creator; Armie Hammer in a duel role as the twin brothers who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea; a surprisingly strong  Justin Timberlake (joke all you want, he's a pro here) as Napster founder Sean Sean Parker; and an under-used Rooney Mara as the girl who sees straight through Zuckerberg's act (the opening scene between the two is stellar).<br /><br />The other main highlights of the film are the seamless interplay between Fincher's top-notch directing (the beauty of BENJAMIN BUTTON combined with a twenty-first century sleaze) and Trent Reznor's pitch-perfect (pardon the pun) soundtrack.  The whole product isn't much more than the sum of its parts, but it doesn't have to be, with parts this great.  THE SOCIAL NETWORK isn't just \\"the Facebook movie;\\" it's a high-quality drama about business intruding on personal friendships, and the prices the individuals involved have to pay.
0810979772|5.0|My kids love this thing! Like the best Mad magazine ever! Got one for each--they gotta have their own! Too great! They read it, they write in it, they read it to each other! What a blast for the kids. And Amazon has the best price for this. (It's about $10 at brick-and-mortar.)
B000FC10MU|5.0|This is a strikingly original, beautiful book. It's a fun read full of clever references, clever dialogue, good characters, good plotting, and witty dark humor. But beyond that it's hopeful and original, capturing something about the essence of what America is all about in a way that I've never seen it done before. It also subverts and alters a number of tired tropes in very creative ways, an experience I always find mind opening.
0316098337|1.0|I am so upset that I spent money on this novel.      I purchased based on the number os positive reviews from others.  I should have gone with my original gut that I would not enjoy it.      The book is written from the perspective of a 5 year old trapped in \\"Room\\" with his mother.  I found reading this \\"thoughts\\" annoying.  I figured I would get used to it; it only annoyed me more the more I read.  I found his level of maturity and intellibility inconsistent and strange.  Everything is a noun, which I don't understand.  He is stuck in a room with his mother all day and speaks in verbs, why doesn't he.  For a 5 year old, he is able to read words like \\"conditioner\\", really?    From the start, none of these characters are likeable.  Yes, I get it, mom is tramatrized (as she should be) so she seems flat but the annoyed grandmother, weird brother and his wife (who also seem annoyed that they have to deal with this kid in one part).  Also, the fauz Oprah after 6 days; I know that she is \\"trying to get Jack college money\\" but knowing our society that interview could've taken place months later.  Where were the MD's to stop it?    Also, the breast feeding is disturbing.  I understand they were locked up together, \\"why bother stopping\\" but why continue to discuss it such detail.  No other bodily function was constantly discuessed but we were privey to all of his thoughts (including sucking on a dead tooth from his mother).  The whole kissing the breasts goodbye at the end was just too much.    This book was predictable.  I think the positive reivews might come from the disturbing nature of the story as a whole but what a terrible book and read.  For this reason, I will never read another book from this author!    Stay away, there are much better books to spend your time on.  I cannot get the minutes back I wasted on this!
030746363X|5.0|Read the book, did the diet, lost the weight. Period. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is tired of killing themselves in the gym and starving-but not seeing results.
B0042MDAL8|1.0|The single disk blu ray edition is a joke! It does not have extended features!! Which DVDs / Blu Rays do not have extended features/scene nowadays? Also, I heard that the Blu Ray /DVD combo version is another insult to the Twilight fans. If you would like to share the DVD or Blu Ray with someone, you are stuck as the DVD and Blu Ray on either side of the disk and not on 2 separate disks.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I just bought this movie on Blu-Ray, and the high definition really does show. The Social Network gripped me from beginning to end and left me just enjoying every minute of this movie. It truly is a beautiful piece of cinema. David Fincher definitely knows how to do visuals, and Aaron Sorkin's script is just well-written. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games takes place in a future dystopic North America, where (as penalty for a previous rebellion) each of the twelve districts is required to give up two randomly selected teenagers to the participate in a televised fight to the death. The story is told, in a first person point of view, by Katniss, the female competitor from the poor District 12. She and her fellow competitor, Peeta, are wined and dined in the Capitol, primped and preened for the audience, and then finally dropped into the arena to kill and hopefully survive. Various alliances are formed, competitors are brutally murdered, and in the end a rebellious statement is made to the ruling Capitol.<br /><br />The plot is generally compelling, and I found myself reading on even as I was unconvinced by it. (For example, District 12 has around 8000 people, the size of a small town, and yet it digs enough coal to fuel all 12 Districts and the Capitol?) There is enough drama, brutality and anxiety to make even a slightly interested reader curious as to the outcome, but our heroes kept getting off easy, not having to make the compelling life and death decisions that the other contestants were making; things just worked out around them. Then comes the end and it's a cliffhanger of sorts, a \\"buy my next book\\" ending, if you will, instead of just wrapping it up. I didn't appreciate that obvious ploy.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of stories told in the \\"simple present\\" verb tense, and the author shifts subtly here and there, unable to keep it up herself, creating a distracting method of storytelling that takes away from the actual story. Granted, this is a YA book, and the intended audience might not be so grammatically picky, but it was a problem for this reader.<br /><br />Katniss herself was not, to me, a sympathetic character. Her moods and personalities were too extreme; she felt like a larger than life character, rather than a believable hero. Peeta was easier for me to sympathize with, even though he is only seen through the eyes of Katniss. He came across less of a stock character and more real. Many other characters (just for instance: Prim, beloved by everyone; Gale, the boy that is good at everything; Rue, the ethereal fairy child) seemed very much like stock characters, seen in most fantasies, fairy tales and moral stories.<br /><br />Overall, the story Ms. Collins is telling is certainly an interesting one, but there were just enough snags in it to keep me from finding it a good read.ough the eyes of Katniss.

B002ZG999U|4.0|... based on all the negative reviews from all the critics bashing this film up one side and down the other.    Folks say this film hasn't much of a plot; I say that isn't so.    It's called mini-plot.    There are three kinds of plots:  Arch-plot, mini-plot, and anti-plot (see Robert McKee's excellent \\"Story\\" for a detailed explanation of what makes for a great screenplay, along with more excellent discourse on character, plot, etc.).  \\"The Expendables\\" is mini-plot (conversely, something like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" would fall under the arch-plot umbrella, for example).    There isn't any great objective to be obtained here, like blowing up the Death Star; nor is there any \\"oh, now they all understand, and isn't great that they're all better people\\" moment either.  What we have is Barney Ross; we drop into his life, go along with him a ways, share an adventure, and then, once he's rescued the girl, we part ways.    If this isn't your cup of tea, then \\"The Expendables\\" isn't for you.  However, if you want to see a great action picture that does, indeed, establish camraderie between yourself, Barney, and others in the cast, then you'll enjoy this film.    Stallone has developed into a first-rate action director; one need only look as far as the recent films \\"Rocky Balboa\\" and \\"Rambo: Burmese\\" to see this.  He's quite skilled behind a camara; one might even call him an artist.    (That stands to reason, since he's delivered some excellent paintings over the years.  Don't believe me?  It's called \\"google\\".)    Stallone has an eye for a great scene; he always know just exactly how to use the camara to bring his audience right into the center of the action.  The action choreography is spot-on first-rate here; it's just impossible not to have fun watching this film.    Personally, I didn't have any issues with the dialog here, since tough guys do tend to talk like this.  I will say that hopefully, as this series continues, Stallone will flex his screenwriting muscles a bitmore; \\"Rocky Balboa\\" contained some of the best dialog he's written in years, so hopefully, as he writes additional material for this series, he'll invest himself a bit more in what his characters have to say.    (Personally, I think Stallone chose this vehicle because at this point in his career, he wants to go out strong, and yet he also wants to re-establish himself as a major-box office draw.  This will, in turn, provide an opportunity for such artistic endeavors as \\"Poe\\", and also his possible upcoming portrayal of John Gotti.  In order to get people interested in those projects, he's got to get them in the habit of going to see his movies again. \\"RB\\", \\"R:B\\", and \\"TE\\" provide a pathway to do just that.)      If you're looking for a well-directed action film, look no further.  I very much enjoyed this picture, and am looking forward to a sequel.
B002ZG97E2|4.0|Although the primary character in the movie is Gru, the Minions steel more then the Moon, they steel your heart.  This is a sweet and warm movie and it makes you feel so good.  I am going through my second childhood, but would have loved Dispicable Me even in my first.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who is young at heart and wants to smile.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Got this for my 8 yo nephew with High hopes for Christmas fun since he is a huge a Lego fan right now. There is a lot of flexibility on How you can ply the game, including keeping score but no score cards were included. There are 3 levels of play and some of them are extremely difficult (even in the \\"easy\\" level) and time consuming to put together. No were near the fast paced game of pictonary. It got a little boring since people were taking so long to make these complex structures.
B003UESJJC|5.0|This movie had a tremendous impact on me as a teenager and still gives me goose bumps every time I watch it. It looks great on Blu-ray. I'm of the opinion that the original theatrical release is the only version of this movie. The \\"Redux\\" version is garbage. The originally cut scenes in the \\"Redux\\" version, especially the French Plantation scene, simply take away from the dark, haunting original version and add nothing of value to the story. I don't care what Coppola says.    I was exceptionally pleased to see that the documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse,\\" directed by Coppola's wife Eleanor, was included in this collection. I had never seen it before because I could never find it. I only knew of it being on VHS tape and kept hearing that it was out of print. It was worth the wait.    Great movie and great edition.
B000J233SK|5.0|With Loreena McKennitt's beautiful, ethereal voice painting stories over over a hauntingly exotic soundscape, listening to this album is like dreaming while wide awake. I wish I had better words to write, the album certainly deserves it.
1594202842|5.0|This book is a great memoir of child raising, with many issues that we can all relate to, and written in a personal engaging style.  While the author occasionally goes too far in her quest for perfect children, the story of her family, even the way her own success-oriented mother dealt with her disabled sister, is touching. The true sign of her father's genius, beyond his MIT PhD, is that Ms. Chua's act of rebellion was attending Harvard. In fact, by putting academic achievement at the top of the children's priority list, but still being a loving mother and decidedly putting her children at the top of her she is a worthy example for showing how much she cares.  She is likely off the deep end for many, but the world would be a much better place if more parents moved a least a little bit in this direction and demanded their children work harder at their education.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I don't care what the reviews say, this movie was great...plus I love Bradley Cooper!!!  I really like that this came with a digital copy so i watch it on my iPod touch while i'm working out at the gym...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Well the only complaint for my is the straps are somewhat short. (im 6' 2\\" so in my case they are short) So the backpack fits me a little higher on my back that what i like. But besides that the padding is great, good quality. The fact that the bag has no logo is also awesome. My friend has the canon version of this and he turns the bag over in his car so you cant see the canon logo. (people will see canon and automatically think its a camera and might try to break it) its almost the exact same design like the canon version but in my opinion better. The tripod straps are definitely better than the ones on the canon bag, but the placement could have been under the bag rather than on the side. Not a big deal. I store both my film SLR & my digital SLR. Along with a 250mm zoom lens, and two other lens and spare rolls of film, lens hoods, and memory cards. Plenty of space and great protection.
B0042816YK|4.0|I bought this movie for my mom & we watched it over the holidays! This is a really inspiring, feel good movie, that is fun to curl up with your favorite blanket & your drink/food of choice! I will be purchasing a copy for me! ;o)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was introduced to Settlers of Catan many years ago; it was the third edition then.  This fourth edition's artwork is beautiful!  The interlocking frame is so much better for keeping the board together; and the organization tray in the box is a welcome addition.<br /><br />My friends and I play every Sunday and we are not the run of the mill SoC players.  We play with all the expansion packs combined, but that is really for the dedicated, hardcore board gamers.  Most people will be more than content with this base game; it will provide hours and hours of fun.  It is never the same game twice if you just randomize the land tiles and numbers.  There's a bit of a learning curve because there are many rules, but once those are under your belt, it really is a great way to pass time with friends and family.  Wheeling, dealing, stealing....it's all in the name of the game!<br /><br />If you want to play with up to 6 players, be sure to purchase the extension too.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This movie is so entertaining to watch, not only for the story line, but to see all of the affects that went in to making this movie! Definitely one of my holiday favorites that my family & I will be watching over & over! Enjoyment and captivation for all ages, from my daughter's 5 year old step son to my 61 year old mom! Enjoy!
0312340958|5.0|This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered.  Since I was a religious and left, I found a lot of what she said helpful in validating my experience.
0756655730|5.0|Excellent pictures, photos, graphics. Clear explanations of different topics.  Not only dinosaurs are covered - there is so much more in this thick, heavy book - from early days of Earth history to the current days.     Highly recommended for adults and teens.
030746363X|5.0|Very good book.  The ice pack method is easy and not uncomfortable.  The kettlebell swing (and the instructions on how to build a cheap kettlebell) is exactly what I'm looking for: a simple way to incorporate strength training in one exercise. That way I only have to master the form on one exercise.  Many other suggestions are worth trying, too.  I have been eating an 80% Paleo diet for the last 9 months and have lost 67 pounds without exercise.  I'm sticking with that, but it's the same as Tim's diet without the beans.
1401307450|5.0|This was one of the best biographies I've read in a long time.  It's dark, honest and brutal.  The type is small which makes it long but I didn't want it to end.  If you love Anthony Kiedis and/or the Chili Peppers, you will love this book!
0740797719|5.0|I am ecstatic about the contents of this book! Whether you are an artist that leans towards a gallery mindset or more of a commercial illustration mindset, you need this book. Gurney leans more towards oil painting and traditional drawing, but I believe this book is helpful to artists using all mediums (including digital artists). The book cover says, \\"A Guide for the Realist Painter\\", but this book will also help those who are interested in creating semi-abstract or pure abstract artwork as well; with abstraction, it's all about color, composition and light anyway, so this is why I say it will help those who are interested in abstraction. It's all about lighting, color and... wait for it... your set up. Gurney basically suggests that you must practice your craft but don't forget that you also must regularly create colorwheels, color studies, sketches... in order to get to the final work. This book is amazing.
142311339X|4.0|My son really enjoys this author.  We both read this book and enjoyed it.  He liked it more than I did, but that is because it is geared more toward his age.  There was more \\"romance\\" than I expected for this age-group, but it wasn't inappropriate--just maybe not necessary to the story.  My son loves learning about mythology through these books.  Thanks for another page-turner Mr. Riordan.

B00192IV9U|5.0|I was hesitant about buying this since there were people out there complaining that most of the songs are not Michael!! I am a HUGE fan and always have been, and when I listened to it .... It was definately Michael!  There are some other artists singing in the background and some who wrote a few of the songs... Lenny Kravitz who wrote \\"Another Day\\", Claude Kelly and Akon who wrote \\"Hold My Hand\\" etc... But it was Michael!  I love this CD and would recommend it to ALL MJ fans!!!!!  It just makes you realize how many years more he would have continued his amazing musical talents ( Not to mentions his unbelieveable dancing )  He is truly \\"THE KING OF POP\\" and ' I love him more!'
B000BKHL1K|5.0|We have been wanting to get a wine rack for a long time but could never find one that we liked. We hung this in our kitchen and it looks great! I also like that it gets the wine bottles out of the way. This wine rack is very modern and looks very stylish on the wall. Everyone always comments about how cool this wine holder is and wants to get one too.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I like the movie, but I have to give the Blu-Ray version only 1 star because it won't play on Sony Blu-Ray players (both stand alone and PS3). It used to work but Sony shipped firmware to add 3D functionality for other titles and it broke the ability to play this disk. When you play the movie, the video commentaries come up picture in picture style and you CANNOT disable the pop ups. It has been broken for half a year now and despite two firmware updates from Sony it is still broken. Don't buy this disk if you have a Sony player until Sony fixes this.    Update 01/19/11: Fox has fixed the issue (unknown if it was actually Fox or Sony's problem, but Fox fixed it.) I received a free replacement disk. Make sure if you buy this and you have a Sony player, you get the latest version of the disk which has a UPC code ending in \\"82\\" and not the broken one ending in \\"80\\".     Broken version gets 1 star. Fixed version gets 4 stars.
0062064304|5.0|Finally. FINALLY! An \\"Art of\\" book that actually has art in it. And not just the approved art, but loads of concept art to boot. More so than even I thought had been created. It's always so frustrating when a movie studio releases a \\"Art of\\" book on a movie and there's very little to show for it. I don't want to see movie stills. I want the process that arrived to that point. What did they do for the first three months of production? Did they immediately arrive at the final product? Were there even artists hired to do concepts? I don't need to know the actor's schedule, or the conditions they had to deal with on set, or even a production diary. I want art! And this book delivers.    You have to hand it to the folks at WETA, they've done it again. I haven't been disappointed yet by one of their productions and their latest release doesn't disappoint by a long shot. I'm always amazed by the spectrum of talents by the WETA team and have been religiously following them since before The Frighteners. And, boy, do they fill this book with concepts. Like:    Did you know there were actually two exo suits? Well, they're there in all their biomechanical glory.    Or that the aliens were actually lumbering brutes meant to be portrayed by a man-in-a-suit? Dozens of concepts of aliens based on Blomkamp's original short film are there. Many are a radical departure from the approved aliens in the movie. You'll be amazed by the routes that could have been taken.    How about this. Did you know that in the original treatments, Neil Blomkamp had a slaver race of aliens that ran the show? Oh yeah. Wicked creepy. Buy the book and see them.     This is a great book. Even the design harkens to the imagery seen in the film. It looks remarkably--on first glance--like a book on street graffiti. And considering how the aliens plaster themselves in refuse and how their writing captures a graffiti-like look, it's not hard to see why.     I can't give enough praise for this book. Go on, add itto your collection. I'm more than happy I did.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I LOVE this series!  It has very well drawn and complicated characters.  It also has a wonderful \\"outer space\\" atmosphere that really \\"takes you away\\" from the \\"real world.\\"    These characters are very much like people in \\"real life\\" but just in a Sci Fi environment.  They have the same worries, weaknesses, strengths, and \\"complications\\" of life that \\"real people\\" have.    The strength of this series is in the characterization and the wonderful acting skills of this unique cast!    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series!!

1594202842|1.0|This is a sensational book about a mother who uses her Chinese ethnicity to cloak her cruelty. She reinforces and creates new and detrimental stereotypes (about Chinese women and Chinese parents) to sell this book. I am ethnically Chinese; my parents were never cruel nor did they belittle me. My sisters and I all went to prestigious universities and have achieved in our work lives. Parents do not need to be sadistic for their children to succeed.    One message that I don't think the author addresses is how she expects her children to treat others if they learn from such a mean unpleasant role model. The author is very physically beautiful though, this is probably how she herself was able to succeed in life as such an unpleasant and hard working \\"smart\\" person (not everything is grades, as I've learned in the real world).      This book will either be the joke Xmas gift, another William Hung of American Idol, (a woman writes a book about parenting b/c she has children. A guy sings b/c he has a mouth) to laugh at or will be a read for all the unfortunate Chinese children who were raised like this and now hate their parents. (every Chinese person I've talked to whose parents weren't like this are right now, yes, at this moment THANKING their parents).
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I always disliked the redesigned the PS3 controllers, but i've just gotten used to it. I recently bought a DualShock 3 controller and i wanted to check these out. These are the best! It makes you feel like your playing on an old PS2 controller. I've read a few reviews that they may pop off during intense game play, i haven't had that problem and anyone that is squeezing their controller that hard, should probably take a break.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Flash Forward was simply one of a few intelligent, thought provoking series to hit our airwaves ever and it was cancelled way before its time. what we really need are more CSI, law and medical dramas, right America? At least there are quite a few people that agree with me on this show.   Asking tough questions like: do we have free will, why are we here, what is this all about....all packed in an action character format that never bored nor failed to spur the imagination. I do not watch much television because most of it is reality trash and murder dramas (why do we focus on the lowest common denominators in our culture?); when Flash forward appeared it was a breath of fresh air. It actually appeared like mankind was progressing in our entertainment tastes and was moving toward thought provoking material. Flash Forward never hit you over the head with any of this but it sprinkled in real physics and science of the day.  What a great concept.....I miss this show every thursday!
1439156816|4.0|This book is funny and sad and pragmatic and playful. King gives us glimpses into his boyhood, his near-fatal run-in with a reckless driver, his process, and even provides lists of his favorite books. I'm not a huge fan of King's books, but this one came highly recommended to me by a member of my book club, and it's a gem.
0143144901|5.0|I read High Fidelity years ago and absolutely loved it, and since then, I've read almost everything that Hornby's ever written. I've come to respect him quite deeply as a unique author who writes with intelligence, humor, and heart (three things that seem rarely to be combined). Nevertheless, in considering Hornby's other works, I'd rate only one of them (How to Be Good) as poor and all of the others (About a Boy, Fever Pitch, A Long Way Down, etc.) as very good--but none of them as worthy of being called great. Writing a lot of very good books is a fine accomplishment, but I'd gotten used to the idea that Hornby would never match High Fidelity.    I think I was wrong. He's at least gotten very close, in my opinion, with Juliet, Naked. The novel exhibits his trademark first person narratives, in this case told primarily by two characters Annie and Tucker. Annie is a British museum curator who's been sunk in a long-term relationship with Duncan, an academic obsessed with an obscure American musician named Tucker Crowe who decades ago mysteriously dropped off the planet. One event, Annie's surprising posting of an article contradicting Duncan on Duncan's Taylor Crowe website, starts into motion a chain of events that leads to her beginning to exert independence from Duncan in order to create her own, happier life and meeting Tucker Crowe himself.     And Tucker Crowe is the second protagonist, a brilliant songwriter who, overcome by what he considers his own shallowness, left off his career and has been something of a loser ever since. His own uncharacteristic decision to contact Annie following her article is the beginning of his own reemergence.     As with all of Hornby's books, the narrative is believable and entertaining, concerning two characters about whom we care trying to deal with having wasted so much of their time and talents trying desperately to put their lives together again. Both protagonists are funny and self-aware (at least pretty self-aware). And Hornby is, again as always, insightful regarding the nature and value of music and fandom, the transience of life, and the importance of relationships. Juliet, Naked is Hornby's finest novel in a long time, really a success on many levels.
0452289963|5.0|A writer friend had raved about \\"The Power of Now,\\" and I bought the book, but could not get into it.

The concept of the \\"pain body\\" rang true, as did the rest of the book, which sometimes seems so simple and yet is so profound.

B000YABIQ6|2.0|I finally decided to go out on a limb and purchase Mad Men Season 1 when I was on break from  school. I had heard all the hype it was getting as well as the multiple awards it had won. In my opinion the show is really not as great as everyone says. Sure, the acting is good but you can get that with every other great show on TV that gets nowhere near the hype Mad Men does. I'm a fan of shows like Breaking Bad, LOST, 24, Dexter, and formely The Sopranos even though the last few seasons were not as great as it once was. With Mad Men I see most of the charcacters as very arrogant and unlikeable. It really is not addicting as everyone says. There isn't anything exciting about it. It has nowhere near the quality of a show like Breaking Bad. If you missed the boring slowness of the last few seasons of The Sopranos than watch Mad Men. Even The Sopranos never got as much praise as Mad Men. I'm writting this review under a different name because I fear that I will be assisinated by the liberals at the telivison academy for condeming a show thats so higly praised by everyone when realistically it is just an overhyped period drama that is most likely not historically accurate. If you want a great show watch Breaking Bad on AMC. That is the best show on TV right now not Mad Men.
0307592839|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than anything I've read in recent months. \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" is funny, sad, creative, endearing. The writing is spectacular--smart and apt, with an absorbing natural flow. The characters are fully fleshed, thoroughly flawed, and extremely winning.<br /><br />Like most \\"post-modern\\" fiction, \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" is highly structured, with a somewhat nebulous plot. Each chapter follows one of several interconnected characters, all linked (occasionally though several degrees of separation) to record producer Bennie Salazar. The novel opens with Sasha, Bennie's klepto assistant, in contemporary New York City. It flashes back to Bennie's youth in the 1970s San Francisco punk rock scene; follows his producer-mentor on a family vacation to Africa; introduces his son, his (sometimes ex)wife, her journalist brother, and her boss, struggling publicist Dolly. We meet troubled actress Kitty Jackson, Bennie's high school friends, an unnamed dictator, and Sasha's closest friend. Characters occasionally surface unexpectedly in the midst of other character's narratives. The narrative slides smoothly through time and place without fanfare, a series of loosely connected anecdotes gradually building toward a climactic moment some ten or twenty years in the future.<br /><br />The chapters are written in a variety of styles. Although a standard intimate third person past tense dominates, there are segments of present tense and first person, a mock-celebrity magazine article complete with footnotes (a staple of all post-modern fiction), and even power point presentation (which I have to say was surprisingly awesome--usually I'm annoyed by this kind of device, but this came off beautifully).<br /><br />Though the thematic core of the work centers on loss, on the slow chipping away over time, it's surprisingly not nostalgic (except perhaps as concerns the music industry). Egan exhibits throughout an acute sense of humorous perversity, making the novel light and fast even in it's more depressing moments. This book is both extremely well done and completely entertaining--a rare combination.en in it's more depressing moments.

B003568FR6|5.0|I bought this Jillian Michaels: 30 Day Shred AROUND $8 and it included the DVD and Digital download, so I first watched trough the Digital download, the quality of the download was kinda slow ...   Apart from that this is one of the most intense, the MOST intense, thorough, 20 minute workout that consists of three circuits (9 min total) of strength, (3 min total) of cardio and (6 min total) of abs exercises. I love the fact that I can play this on the DVD or on my laptop anywhere, anytime I want.  These 3 workouts (level 1 through 3) are fantastic as they each take about 22 minutes including warm up, the exercises and the cool down, they are highly intense, Jillian didn´t even stop for a sip of water or to take a breath. You will need is two 3 -5 lbs dumbbells and a mat. A lot of plank exercises, specially in level 2 and 3, and they alone work your abs far better than crunches, so no worries about your abs being shortcut.  I recommend this DVD to everyone! After day 1 I did feel my legs, abs, and arms very swore, I even took some Naproxen Sodium (like Aleve) to reduce the swore. [[ASIN:B000HCXK44 Naproxen Sodium 220 mg - 400 Caplets,  Compare to the active ingredient in Aleve]]  Jillian will actually reinforce through out all the DVD that if you are a beginner (like me)quality is always over quantity, so first watch how they do it a couple of times and then try to copy their movements, putting your back, legs and hip align in the correct suggested position.

B000024D4R|4.0|I'm certain that anybody who has even the least amount of musical knowledge has heard of the Floyd's more seminal works like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"The Wall\\". But, \\"Animals\\" was released in 1977 and as far as the band's peak stretch of creativity goes this record is probably the least known of that period. Compared with the two aforementioned landmark records this one is much less ambitious. The album or cd cover features the iconic photo of the inflatable pig above the Battersea power plant in London, England. It starts with a simple acoustic ballad, \\"Pigs on the Wing, Part 1\\" from Roger Waters before moving to \\"Dogs\\" which starts off with another acoustic intro before easing on to David Gilmour singing the lyrics about Dogs as powerful, untrustworthy and aggressive leaders of society. The lyrics are based on the George Orwell book \\"Animal Farm\\". The song features some of Gilmour's best guitar work and after his opening vocal the song shifts over to Waters who then dominates vocal duties (as well as song writing) on the remainder of the record. The next song is \\"Pigs\\" which is about the fat, wealthy upper-class of English society. The song references a UK moralist name Mary Whitehouse who used to target Pink Floyd. Waters takes the opportunity to include her in this reference to Pigs. The song features Gilmour's use of a guitar talk-box (think Frampton Comes Alive) to mimic the sound of pigs. The last full length song (there are only three) is \\"Sheep\\" and as you would expect, this is about the meek and lowly inheriting the world. In fact the song features a modified Psalm 23 at the mid-point using a vocoder aided voice to recite the words, which are a bit silly. However, it was 1977 and artistic license was more available in those days. The cd ends with \\"Pigs on the Wing, Part 2\\" which is another simple acoustic number. With only three primary songs, each one contains its share of extended instrumental breaks as well the assorted use of sound effects that youexpect in a Pink Floyd record.   You can hear that Roger Waters is really starting to exert his influence over the band by this time but it's still a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan or somebody looking to expand their collection. Not a 5-star, but a good solid record from one of the 70's best outfits. If you only want one Floyd record then DSOTM is the best choice but \\"Animals\\" is a great mid-tempo record for those who enjoy epic length tracks with large doses of electronic instrumentation.

B000024E9M|5.0|Genesis is usually divided into two distinct phases; the Peter Gabriel version or the Phil Collins one. Both versions have their positive attributes and both represent different eras in music. Peter Gabriel was there at the beginning and left in 1975 while Phil Collins lead and then dominated the group in the late 70's and throughout their more commercial period in the 80's. Like I said, both had their merits as well as drawbacks. But, in the Gabriel led era there is no better, prettier, or complete record than this one. Unlike the heavy handed complexity of 'The Lamb Lies Down... .' (the follow-up and last with Gabriel) this record has a sweet and sophisticated appeal that makes it a standout in the Genesis library. The album's centerpiece songs; 'Dancing with the Moonlight Knight', 'Firth of Fifth' and 'The Cinema Show' all feature extended instrumental work. Both keyboard player Tony Banks and guitarist Steve Hackett really show off their skills on this record. In fact all musicians are exceptional and the combination of Gabriel's singing and the bands instrumental breaks and solos makes for a soaring and majestic collection of songs. 'Isle of Plenty' closes the record with the same melody and theme as 'Dancing...' which focuses on the downturn of England as a once powerful country in the late 20th century. In 1973 England was going through a change from an industrial society to a service based economy (sound familiar?) and the lyrics and attitude on this record reflect the negative aspects of that change.  But, from a musical perspective Genesis created arguably their most appealing musical statement. The performances and song writing are first rate and each song has its own unique melody and feel so the record is always interesting and very satisfying.

B00008DDSC|4.0|`Secretary' is at film about the relationship between a secretary called Lee, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and her boss Edward played by James Spader. Initially it starts out as quite a sedate film with the boss being arrogant and rude, then he starts to humiliate her for minor work infractions, moving up to spanking, before their relationship takes a deeper turn. Much has been said about the sexual and deviant nature of this film and to be honest I have to say that is a lot of hype and over exaggeration. There is a sexual current running through the film, but it isn't anywhere near as deviant or shocking as some may make out. This film is more about one woman's development from a naïve young adolescent, into a mature sexualised woman. Lee starts off by being unsure and shy and by the end of the film she is confident and sure of her feelings and wants out of life. This is slightly kooky and offbeat and Gyllenhaal turns out an excellent performance, managing to be by turns funny and kooky, sweet and innocent and sexy and self assured. All impressive stuff in what was one of her early movies. This has now become something of a minor cult film and if you enjoy unusual films and don't mind some risqu&eacute; themes then this is well worth watching at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001UV4XWY|3.0|There are very mixed reviews for this film and to be honest whist it isn't outstanding, it isn't that bad either. This is set during the seventies and follows a young couple who receive a box and are told that if they push the button inside someone they don't know will die and they will receive one million dollars. They agonize over the decision and then the consequences of what they finally decide start to become apparent as the film unfolds. The original premise is great and you start to wonder what you would do in the same situation; you also start to question certain events as the film progresses and this quickly becomes quite a tense sci-fi thriller. The acting is ok (although a little wooden at times) from most of the actors, but Frank Langella is particularly good and note worthy. The story is engrossing and fairly original and whilst this ends without any real conclusion (which detracts from the film slightly), it does manage to keep you entertained throughout. Overall this is a good film and although slightly aimless and kooky in places, it is still worth a watch at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001FB5634|3.0|`The Road' is a bleak and unrelenting film about a post apocalyptic world. This follows a man and son (whom we never learn the names of) who are travelling south to reach warmth and security after a nuclear war. They have to contend with hunger and lack of water, as well as roving bands of cannibalistic bandits and thieves. That is pretty much all the film is about and it doesn't have a strong plot with twists and intrigue, just this simple premise. This is shot very well and portrays the bleak landscape very well, with washed out colours and plenty of grey ash this film feels dark and inhospitable. Mortensen is excellent as the father and really carries this film, although there are great performances from the likes of Charlize Theron, Guy Pierce and Robert Duvall as well. I enjoy post apocalyptic themes to books and films, but to be honest this doesn't add too much to the genre. It demonstrates the hardships the survivors have to go through and the dangers that lurk around every corner, but it has no hope or redemption and your finish it feeling rather deflated. This may be the point of the film, to show how this kind of world would be unrelenting and hard and have no true end in sight. A worthy point to make no doubt, but a dark film to watch. This is still worth viewing, but be aware of it's dark themes and ultimate outcome and you should be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Well, I bought this game for a xmas gift for family. It is definately a great game to enjoy in a game night, something to enjoy with the family, that will definately bring lots of fun and hours of sharing. The only thing is that only 4 can play at a time, so it might be worth to buy an expansion set. Also, the pieces are as detailed as the German version. In any case, as my friend would say, it pays its costs.
B000000OU0|5.0|After claiming they'd get back together when `Hell Freezes Over', The Eagles did exactly that and this excellent album is the result. This starts off with four new studio tracks before moving on to a live performance. The opener `Get Over It' is a full pelt rock track that will get your foot tapping and juices flowing and I still love it even after repeated listening. Standout tracks have to be `Hotel California', which has an amazing intro that still leaves my jaw gaping and the wonderfully brooding `New York Minute'. This CD is very strong throughout though and showed new and old fans alike that this band most definitely still had it. Despite friction within the band and later line-up changes, this is a snapshot of very accomplished musicians and an appreciative audience enjoying a night of magical playing and it rates very highly in my music collection. It is an album I recommend for those who are new to The Eagles or those who are fully aware of what this band has to offer, as it has some great renditions of some timeless tracks. Great stuff.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001PPLIFU|4.0|`Quantum of Solace' is pretty much your typical James Bond film. Bad guy has fiendish plot to control a world resource, Bond foils the aforementioned plan whilst kicking bad guy's *** and bedding the beautiful girl. All formulaic stuff but beloved by generations of Bond fans. `QoS' has these elements parcelled up in a modern day action movie wrapping and the car chases and parkour roof top running scenes make impressive viewing. Craig makes for an macho Bond and there is a gruff hardness to him, rather than the suave sophistication other actors (Connery or Brosnan for example) brought to the role. This film sadly lacks the multitude of gadgets, or even the usual Q segment where they are all introduced. Dench is great as M and the other supporting roles add the right levels of sexiness (from the Bond girls) or sneering evil (from the villains). This is best viewed as the second part to `Casino Royale' and where that film provides the set up, this film provides the release. Both aren't too great in their own rights, but together they make one verygood Bond film. This is worth a look at some point and a worthy addition to the Bond franchise. Lets just hope the next instalment can stand up on it's own two feet and win some of the doubters back.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001UV4XUQ|4.0|`500 Days of Summer' is kind of an anti-love story and follows Tom, who is a greeting card writer, when he falls in love with Summer. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer doesn't believe in love and as he falls deeper and deeper under her spell, she moves further away. This the basic premise but if offers up slightly more than that. This has a slight down beat, mildly melancholy, feel to it and although it has funny moments throughout and I laughed at numerous points, it has a poignancy not hinted at in the trailers. It also has a great soundtrack, which features The Temper Trap, which only adds to the film. Both main actors play their parts well and there are some unique and stylish direction techniques used. This makes for 90 minutes entertaining viewing and as long as you don't expect a full on comedy, you should enjoy this a great deal.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0000026WD|4.0|There are probably only a handful of Jackson albums that are truly required listening `Off the Wall', `Thriller', `Bad' and `Dangerous' and in my opinion this is one of the best. This has some great songs on it and showed Jackson was still able to create top class music after the huge successes of `Thriller' and `Bad' when people doubted he could do it again. Stand out tracks for me have to be `Who Is It' and `Give In To Me' and this last track has an excellent solo played by Slash that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. There are softer songs here like `Heal the World' and whilst these are well written, I have personally never been a fan of Jackson's ballads, but there is something here for everyone. `Black or White' is probably one of the most well known of the tracks on offer, but as you can quickly see there are so many tracks of note here and overall this is a very polished and worthy album in Jackson's back catalogue. The booklet artwork is great and you get the lyrics and some photos inside. This still sounds great even after repeated listening and considering it is nearly twenty years old that is very impressive. Well worth adding to your Jackson collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00006LLNV|4.0|A stand out feature of the film `Frida' was it's music and upon buying the soundtrack and listening to it again I fully appreciate why. This offers up music with passion and depth and whilst it was fitting and appropriate to the scenes in the film, this CD also gives us credible and moving music in it's own right. The original compositions by Elliot Goldenthal are among my favourites, but tracks by Lila Downs and other artists conjure up the feel of the film and Mexico perfectly. This has an excellent booklet with a short essay on the films music, lyrics in both English and Spanish and stills from the film itself and this is one of the better soundtrack booklets I have seen. Frida, the artist, was unique and produced stirring art and this soundtrack is just as unique and stirring and I have yet to tire of listening to it. Well worth a listen if you enjoyed the film or enjoy Latin American music in general.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
030746363X|5.0|So far, this book has worked GREAT for me. Like many reviews before, there's nothing earth shattering in here, but Tim puts it in a way that keeps it simple, keeps you motivated, and is a very good read to boot. For the same reasons people like Dr. Phil became so popular, so has Tim Ferriss. He explains things that have been staring you in the face for years in a way that allows you to recognize and act on it.    I've been on the diet for a couple weeks and I've lost 11 pounds and 7 total inches off my original measurements.     Weight training starts this week. I've never liked being in the gym (and I played football for 12 years) so what I really like about the \\"building strength\\" section is that the total time working out in a week is going to be 30 minutes.     Awesome.    Anyway, I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will, too.
B002VECMAO|4.0|`The Men Who Stare at Goats' is the hilarious film about a psi-ops unit of the American army and a reporter called Bob (played by McGregor) who learns more about them. The leader of the unit hasn't been heard from in a while and Lyn Cassidy (played superbly by Clooney) uses his psychic powers to find him in the deserts of Iraq. This film follows the founding of the unit, as well as the events in Iraq and alternates between these two stories. This film is quirky and fun and I laughed out loud and enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. Clooney is a wonderful comedic actor and makes this film extra special, but to be honest the whole cast is great (Spacey, Bridges and McGregor all compliment) and play their roles excellently. This is a relatively short film at just under 90 minutes, but it is perfectly formed and keeps you hooked for the duration. On a more serious note some of these kind of things actually took place, whether it be the interrogation techniques used in Iraq, or the psi-ops experiments in the 60's, 70's and 80's, but this film puts a delightful comedic slant on them and makes for a great, light hearted adventure. Well worth checking out and highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
030746363X|5.0|The 4hour body is a fantastic overview of some fun and rewarding body transformation techniques. I've been doing crossfit for a few years, eat a paleo-ish slow carb style diet, and know the basics of most the plans Tim lays out. The book helped me on two levels. First, it gave me a few nuanced pointers that elucidated faults in my own bodily habits. These were unique to my situation and much appreciated! However, on a much more important level, the book addressed the necessity of frameworks, plans, goals, and data. The first 70 pages of the book have very little to do with fitness, yet they contain the fundamental outlook critical to success in any goal. The power of actively tracking data is truly fantastic.

B00018TI5E|5.0|I forget how good this album is until I dig it out and play it again and realise what accomplished song writing and playing is on this CD. From the opening `Carvel' you know you are in for a treat and this is one of my favourites on the album. This has a good mix of acoustic folk type songs, as well as some more upbeat tracks and although there are a few, shall we say more experimental, tracks on here that you can easily skip, they do add a certain atmosphere to the entire album. If you come to this expecting another RHCP album you will most likely be disappointed, but if you come expecting solid song writing and some high standard songs then you will eventually come to love this album as much as I do. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

076790592X|4.0|`Tuesday's With Morrie' is an inspiring book from Mitch Albom that recounts a series of conversations he has with an old professor of his called Morrie Schwartz. The twist is that Morrie is dying from ALS and has plenty of advice to impart before he goes. This book is extremely easy to read and you will fly through it in no time and the message it shares is one of love, compassion and bravery in the face of adversity. This shares aspects of both Morrie's and Albom's life and they cover topics as diverse as marriage, growing old, regret, family, money, forgiveness and more besides. This is very much in the genre of book that offers up a meaningful message in an accessible format and is comparable to `Way of the Peaceful Warrior' by Dan Millman or `The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. This has some good advice and Morrie comes across as genuine and heartfelt, but I found this to be lacking great depth at times. Don't get me wrong, the sentiment and message is great, but it didn't try to dig too deep, it scratches the surface and leave your wanting more. I found this to be better than Albom's other book `The Five People You Meet In Heaven' and I could relate to the story told here better, it even got me thinking about past relationships and had me choked up towards the end. All in all this is an accessible read and shares a worthy message and way to look at life. A positive, heart warming book to read and share.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have to start by saying that despite the slightly formulaic storyline `Avatar' is quite simply an exceptional film. I have rarely seen such landscapes, beautiful rendering or detail in any film, let alone one with such a high level of CGI involved. Other reviewers have stated here, and I have to agree, that this film makes a wonderful demonstration film for a Blu-Ray player; I was kept spellbound and in awe by the rich detail for the entire duration.<br /><br />Following a paraplegic marine called Jake (played by Worthington) who functions via an Avatar, we learn about the planet Pandora and it's inhabitants, the Na'vi. They are a race who are minutely in tune with their environment and who resist the human invaders who wish to plunder their land for the (ridiculously named) mineral Unobtanium. We see how Jake develops his relationship with the Na'vi and starts to understand their viewpoint on their world and the humans intentions. There is more to the film than that, but that is a basic synopsis.<br /><br />This is easily a film that could be watched again and again, if just for the amazing scenery, and it offers enough detail and beauty on-screen to keep you coming back for more. Like I started by saying, the film is a little formulaic, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as you can sit back and easily immerse yourself in the world created for you and enjoy the plot and story as it unfolds for what it is; great entertainment. There are minor flaws in the film, things like occasionally ludicrous and unrealistic dialogue and accents, or clich&eacute; characterisation, but these never detract from the overall experience. There won't be anything like this again for quite some time, so fully enjoy that first viewing and breathtaking cinematography. No doubt you will want to be returning to the stupendous world created for you again and again and I'm sure it will be just as delightful the 20th as the 1st time.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|With hints of dub, traces of Lanois' earlier songwriting and healthy helpings of his signature guitar stylings, featuring stellar musicianship by Brian Blades, Daryl Johnson, and Trixie Whitley, the album moves through folksy territory, island soundscapes, ambient exploration, to jazzy new New Orleans avenues, with side-trips to gospel choir churches, even visiting propulsive pop neighborhoods, Black Dub covers a lot of ground in several  styles.    Reading some of the other reviews, I think some reviewers' ears might need a check up. YouTube vids sound better than the CD? From a simple sound-quality point of view, this strikes me like saying I enjoyed watching the movie on my computer more than in the theater w/ THX audio. But enough nit-picking. Lanois' steady hand on the board is evident throughout, harnessing the big power of diminutive Trixie Whitley's impressive pipes, catching the crisp edge of Brian Blades' filigreed fills, as ornate and regulated as New Orleans wrought iron, and building the solid foundation stone by stone with D Johnson's pulse-measuring bass.       And the songs! \\"Canaan\\" evokes associations with \\"The Maker\\" while reflecting significant spiritual empathy with its down-and=out residents. \\"Sing\\" makes me want to. The eerie lostness--\\"black ice was everywhere\\"--of \\"Silverado\\" haunts. And I believe in \\"I Believe in You.\\" Go Trixie!    I play this constantly. If you buy it, so will you. (And all your friends. 'Cause you gotta hip your friends.)
B00005QGAV|4.0|There are probably only a handful of Jackson albums that are truly required listening `Off the Wall', `Thriller', `Bad' and `Dangerous' and in my opinion this is one of the best. This has some great songs on it and showed Jackson was still able to create top class music after the huge successes of `Thriller' and `Bad' when people doubted he could do it again. Stand out tracks for me have to be `Who Is It' and `Give In To Me' and this last track has an excellent solo played by Slash that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. There are softer songs here like `Heal the World' and whilst these are well written, I have personally never been a fan of Jackson's ballads, but there is something here for everyone. `Black or White' is probably one of the most well known of the tracks on offer, but as you can quickly see there are so many tracks of note here and overall this is a very polished and worthy album in Jackson's back catalogue. The booklet artwork is great and you get the lyrics and some photos inside. This still sounds great even after repeated listening and considering it is nearly twenty years old that is very impressive. Well worth adding to your Jackson collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B004G6009U|4.0|TANGLED<br /><br />STARRING: The voices of: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Ron Pearlman, M.C. Gainey and Jeffrey Tambor,<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Dan Fogleman<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Nathan Greno and Byron Howard<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 24 November 2010<br />Review Date: 31 December 2010<br /><br />Now here is a film I was not expecting much from, that delivered an amazing time at the movies! What a discredit to the film, the trailer for Tangled was. It's a take on the timeless tale of Rapunzel: the girl with incredibly long hair who has been locked away in a tower. Disney has revamped the story, complete with some zany modern day jargon and the vocal talent of Mandy Moore.<br /><br />Disney takes us back to the likes of classic stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Tangled is a much simpler film than those, as far as plot and characters are concerned, but it feels just as magical. The animation is stunning, and there is some amazing cinematography; something I really enjoy seeing amidst the colorful backdrop of an animated landscape. Oh, Rapunzel's tall tower, tucked away at the edge of a forest by a waterfall. It reminded me of something Lara Croft would stumble across in a Tomb Raider game.<br /><br />The movie is also very funny. We meet a guy named Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) who much like Aladdin, is a thief but isn't the worst of guys. He's hilarious, charming and cunning and he's about to meet his match: Rapunzel.<br /><br />Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kidnapped at a young age by an evil woman fed up with her aging looks. She took her from her home because she possesses a few very strange gifts that allow her to work miracles. The one of most importance to our villain being that when she sings, her hair glows and can transform the decrepit old woman into one hot little animated dish of yummy. The woman raises Rapunzel as her own daughter.<br /><br />Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, magical lights that hold meaning to the story, light up the sky. She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window. For fear that she will be found out; the mother forbids her from ever leaving the dusty old tower that is so high up, access can only be gained by the lowering of a very long rope. Or a very long ponytail!<br /><br />Naturally, Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower by mistake when fleeing from someone he's just robbed. While her mother is away on a three day trip, Rapunzel decides to call on the aid of Flynn. Stashing away his precious stolen high dollar item, she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights before she will return it to him.<br /><br />And thus their adventure begins, and only looks better in 3D, so go see it!She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window.

This book will help you do anything you want with your body, whether it be losing 100 lbs of fat or gaining 100 lbs of muscle.

1594202842|1.0|I am a Chinese mother with two daughters. I have a Ph.D. from Yale, so I am not one of the \\"losers\\" described by Amy Chua. I am absolutely appalled by her characterization of \\"Chinese mothers\\". None of the hundreds of Chinese mothers I personally know is like that! I was not raised like that, my Chinese friends were not, and most definitely I am not raising my daughters like that.     Amy Chua is doing a lot of damage to a lot of people with this book by serving her own need of \\"sharing\\" and \\"therapy\\" - her daughters, her family, and the Chinese American community. What concerns me the most is the damage to Chinese American children. They are already needing better grades, better record, more extra cirruculum activities and what not to get into college or post graduate schools than their counterparts in any other groups. Now they have to deal with the stereotype of having a \\"Tiger mother\\" behind their excellence, too?     But I doubt Amy Chua would worry about that, given what she put her own children through in the name of \\"love\\".

B003XKPPOU|5.0|I'll just say that I just ordered the 4-disc combo pack, even though my kids received the single-DVD movie from a relative for Christmas.  Why, you ask?  Well, I was pleasantly surprised at the $22.99 price for 4 discs including Blu-Ray and Digital Copy, but there is a more important reason why I placed this order--because I am a 44-yr-old single mom of a 6-yr-old and a 3-yr-old, and with all the pressures of life I've just forgotten so many things about when I was a child.  The Toy Story Trilogy has helped me lremember how to be a kid again, and that is a gift you can't put a price tag on.

1591841666|4.0|From microeconomic theory a capitalist firm seeks to answer three related questions. The first question is about how much to produce. The second question is about what (how much) price to charge for what is produced. The last question deals with the rules of thumb for shutting down, and whether to shut down temporarily or permanently.    Non-economists find the first two questions interesting, but they are not nearly as fascinated by the third question as much as economists are. They (the former) would say a firm must quit if and when it is losing money. Such an answer isn't entirely incorrect. However, a world in which firms close shop whenever they are losing money would be a messy place for all, indeed. Considering the recent global recession many of us would be without a livelihood by now. This means that often firms operate on loss, suggesting that there are some specific rules for deciding when such operation becomes uneconomic and quitting is the only economical alternative. The \\"dip\\" in this little book is a general and fine application of the shut-down rule.    This book, The Dip, is wonderful! I am still not clear about the definition of \\"the dip,\\" but I am clear about the content of the book and its message. From childhood we are all taught not to quit. What this book says is that the problem is not about quitting; it is about quitting successfully. Winners  \\"just quit the right stuff at the right time\\" (p. 3), whereas losers quit the right stuff at the wrong time. \\"Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations\\" (p. 16).    So what is the right stuff to quit? There two generalized curves that lead to failure: the cul-de-sac, and the cliff. As the name implies the cul-de-sac comprises things that lead nowhere. Those things may be safe and usual, but not rewarding since the doer is unwilling to invest in things that are average (i.e., everyone is already doing them the same way).  Cliffs are situations, like smoking, that are hard to stop even as the smoker knows well that the end is probably not a good one.  Only \\"the Dip creates scarcity; [and] scarcity creates value\\" (p. 21). Hence, \\"quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea\\" (p. 31). The book lists seven reasons,  which prevent us (people, organizations, etc.) from becoming the best in the world (p. 33ff).     Quitting is hard because we are taught to think of it as a bad thing; it is a cowardly surrender. Strategic quitting is actually a renew start. This is a difficult book to read, emotionally; it hits you hard and frequent, and I am a slow digester. I hold to it to see what happens, but I recommend it highly to all, especially professionals at all levels.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|It's inevitable that a series as intriguing as Lost would have a finale that's extremely polarizing in its resolution. What started off as a great series eventually got mired in its own mythology to the point where none of it was going to pay off satisfactorily. The overall problem is that Lost is a show that relied on a serial format and with a serial format, you have to give fans enough of a reson to keep coming back - unfortunately, that can sometimes lead to a wild number of implausabilities and half-cocked explanations. I consider myself a fan of the show (and I still enjoy it on the whole), but I'd be lying if I didn't say that it seemed as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner they couldn't get out of (and all the flashbacks, flashforwards and flash-ups and downs in the world can't mask sloppy writing.) The fact of the matter is this: it feels like a cop-out for a show as initially well-written as this was to simply explain away its own internal logic with explanations like \\"it's magic\\" or to introduce deus ex machina devices in the end in order to wrap up storylines that otherwise have no explanation. Sure, I enjoy ambiguities, symbolism and metaphor as much as the next viewer, but to simply assume that the series \\"is all about the characters\\" in an effort to get away with not having to explain some things feels a little lazy. I'm okay with having some mysteries left unexplained and I'm okay with whipping a little quasi-religious allegory in a show that's otherwise meant to intrigue people, but man... did it ever go overboard in this season.    Ultimately, there's no way to predict how the average fan of this show will view this final season - you'll either love it and accept it (flaws and all) or you'll hate it and feel cheated (while also wondering why you devoted so much time to a series that wrapped up so haphazardly.) In all honesty, this is not the season that best represents this show (for that, I would point you to Seasons 1 and 2) and it's unfortunate considering it's the season that provides the most answers to the island's many lingering mysteries. I suppose it's easy to complain that the series eventually collapsed under the weight of its own mythology (and the \\"we're more clever than you... oh, and we totally know where this is going\\" attitude that emerged in Season 3), but it was definitely one of the better shows of the past decade; otherwise, why would people spend this much time debating the nuances (subtle and otherwise) of it? Your enjoyment of the finale will depend largely on how far you're willing to go with your suspension of disbelief and how much you're willing to be satisfied with less-than-definitive answers.    For me, I came down in the middle. I love the show (and still do), but am perfectly willing to admit to its many flaws. There definitely seemed to be a sense of  the writers making cool stuff up as they went along with no thought as to how they'd resolve, explain or allude to the backstory of a large number of things and that's too bad. In the end, after this 6th and final season, the creators of the show seemed to be just a little foresight shy of creating a genuine masterpiece. Take that for what you will, but it's just one fan's opinion.    Oh, and for the record: \\"Across the Sea\\" was probably the worst episode of the entire series. How this ended up as one of the series' penultimate episodes is beyond me. If it was entirely within the realm of possibility, I would punch this episode in the face. Romulus and Remus/Cain and Abel-type nonsense and crazy Allison Janney for an entire hour? Really? Again, just one fan's opinion, but you'd probably be better off skipping this episode on this box set.    I love this series, but I do admit the ending left me wanting. If you've gone through the prior 5 seasons, you do owe it to yourself to see how they ended this thing - just don't expect it to end as wonderfully as it began.

B001CWOCUO|5.0|I have to admit i've been somewhat of a casual Rihanna fan for a while know, but after watching this Blu-Ray I've become a Rihanna convert. Rihanna starts off with her explosive debut single \\"Pon De Replay\\" then she transitions to the fun and danceable \\"Break It Off\\" w/ Sean Paul heard in the backround. Then after the energetic \\"Let Me\\" and sassy \\"Breakin Dishes\\" comes the slow down songs of \\"Rehab\\", a cover of Bob Marley's  \\"Is This Love\\" (which is very well done I must Say) and \\"Kissed Don't Lie\\" After a dance interlude of \\"scratch\\" comes her first #1 U.S. single \\"S.O.S\\" which immediately brings flare back to the show, after that comes a medley of slow songs which includes \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\", \\"Hate That I Love You\\",\\"Unfaithful\\", and goes into the whimsical sensuality of \\"Sell Me Candy\\" before transitioning to the party anthem of \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" before going on to the more Rock influenced \\"Push up on Me\\", and \\"Shut Up And Drive\\". Finally the Show takes a more captivating spin when she sings a personal and confessional ballad called \\"Question Existing\\" in which she asks the audience in the middle of the song if they ever would think of her as a normal person whose sole career is just to entertain? And the moment the audience and the viewers have been waiting for as she performs her longest running #1 hit \\"Umbrella\\" with the Audience who humorously opens up their Umbrellas while she's singing before exiting her show. I have to admit allot of concerts on home video sometimes don't work, but for Good Girl Gone Bad you would get a run for your money as the blu-ray shows striking visuals, sweat, detail of fabulous coustumes, and great digital HD sound.

B003JYOFIW|2.0|I was a diehard Devotee way back in 1980. When most people were trashing them and never giving them airplay on the radio or on MTV, I was BIG into these guys. Didn't always understand what they were talking about, but I liked them. Now you hear commentators say how ahead of their time they were, and all that, when you know they actually hated them back in the day. My respect for them started to die when they referred to Reagan in filthy, hateful ways. Then Alan left, supposedly because he felt like he wasn't being used enough and ignored, and something changed. I grew up and got out of that rebellious phase. Then I saw other things with these guys that were hypocritical. They once criticized the idea of Devo Dolls in their firat video release, yet they sold Devo figurines in stores. They made fun of heavy metal groups (Evil Clowns anyone?) but then take on a former druggie metalhead as drummer. They screamed against capitalism but set up shop on Sunset Blvd and wrote music for commercials and movies. Sold their song to a floor cleaner commercial. Jerry once made fun of people \\"sitting around drinking Bud\\" but let their song be sold for a beer commercial. Devotees refuse to mention the insidious CD of kids singing Devo songs because it was another sellout. So they are back and I listened to it. I have to say the songs sound alike to me. It's kind of hard to tell one from another, unless I want to listen to it a hundred times. One song goes after Bush. (YAWN). The easiest thing to do is go after America, Bush, capitalism, etc etc ad nauseum. There's no guts in that. I suspected them of being leftist when I saw the silly Chinese American friendship pins or suits, whatever it was. That's not what fuels my dislike, it's just that nothing is new. If the music was really awesome and different I would like it. Devo, like every other band, set out to change the world. Now they complain it's still bad or worse. Guess their work never changed a thing. I don't know what their message is, unless it's marketing themselves & making money.essage is, unless it's marketing themselves & making money.
B001KP2J3U|4.0|John Guillermin's \\"Death on the Nile\\" (1978) makes for a pleasant two and a half hours, as long as you're willing to participate in the conventions of the Hercule Poirot murder mystery as set forth by Agatha Christie.  Guillermin, who had previously worked with an all-star cast in \\"The Towering Inferno\\" (1974), effectively directs a comparable cast of luminaries here, led by Peter Ustinov as Poirot and also featuring, among others, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy, Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Maggie Smith, and Jack Warden.  The conventions that one must accept, if one is to enjoy this sort of film, include the following: 1) A murder will be committed in an enclosed space (here, a Nile River cruise boat); 2) the murderer will commit his or her crime in spite of being aware of the presence of a world-renowned detective who has never failed to solve a case; 3) virtually everyone on the boat, with the exception of said detective, will have a plausible motive for having committed the murder; and 4) all of the suspects will sit together, quietly and cooperatively, in a comfortable parlor at story's end while said detective identifies the murderer and explains how he solved the crime.  In the case of \\"Death on the Nile,\\" the victim is wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway (played by Lois Chiles), and the motives of the various passengers on the boat range from broken love to financial self-interest.  Ustinov makes a fine Poirot, though I prefer Albert Finney's portrayal of the same character in Sidney Lumet's \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (1973); the rest of the cast provides solid support.  Future TV sleuth Angela Lansbury seems to be having particular fun as one of the suspects, a sex-crazed romance novelist.  The film also features gorgeous photography of ancient Egyptian sites such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel, along with Academy Award-winning costume design.  And I was impressed with how fair-mindedly Guillermin as director scattered clues throughout the film, in a manner that is faithful to the spirit of Christie's work.  If you like watching film adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels, this film should not disappoint you.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|I have listened to just about everything dio has recorded. I always fall back to the 1983 recording of Donnington. There is no comparison! This was metal at it's best.  Vivian cambell was the icing on the cake. Your money will not be wasted on this purchase. I can't believe they finally have it for sale on amazon!
0783240287|2.0|This filmed version of the play is both enjoyable and annoying. The story is a tuneful, mostly cheerful telling of Joseph's story from his coat of many colors to slavery to power, but those looking for a reverent Bible story will be disappointed in this mocking and sarcastic show.  On the plus side, Donny Osmond is quite appealing as the innocent Joseph and sings with ease and emotion; his scenes are the best.<br /><br />My problems stem from the structure of the show. The action takes place on a school stage with the students often chiming in as a choir and it just doesn't gather any dramatic steam. The composers were only 19 and 21 when this was first conceived and their music is catchy and the rhymes are clever, but there's no continuity or sense of serious theatre. One never suspends disbelief because we are constantly reminded it's just a school play.<br /><br />The songs range from sweet to kitschy in pop, calypso, disco, and cowboy-country style. The props are painted cardboard and the costumes go from period to techno to kid-unfriendly suggestive. The narrator (Maria Friedman) has the most screen time and she's an annoying know-it-all who continually grabs the spotlight away from the action.<br /><br />Several of the songs are quite nice and will stick with you, especially \\"Any Dream Will Do\\" and \\"Close Every Door,\\" and Pharoah's Elvis impersonation is funny, if weird. The show was originally aimed at children, but I think they might lose interest. The play lacks the substance of the composers' later \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" but is nice for Donny fans.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I just watched this movie on a recorded DVD a friend owns. I'm not sure where his original copy came from. UNLESS the DVDs offered here have added time and added scenes and longer torture views with close-ups, I can only say the following!  They are posturing asses, I've seen worse in a lot of movies. The acting is awful!  As usual when there are subtitles the actor talks for 2 minutes and the sub states \\" huh\\". Come on!!!! As for any fear factor, there isn't any. I've had more fear crossing the street in midtown Manhattan. The version I watched didn't have any extras, ie: interviews with director, cast etc. Just the movie! It was 734.2 mb in size and 1 hour 51 min 49 sec long.   My recommendation is if you are thinking of buying this, donate the cash to charity. Don't waste it on this piece of whatever.
142313494X|1.0|While I realize this was written for 9-12 years old children, I still feel that this was not a well rounded adventure story. I expect the film version to be disjointed and choppy trying to quickly cram as much scenes from the book in a possible. I do not expect the book to read like a disjointed script. There is little depth, warmth, or even amazingly entertaining action scenes. I do not feel the book was however a rip off of the Harry Potter series. It is just the tried and true children's fantasy adventure story formula. The Lightening thief does not even try wow the imagination but churns out a mythology mish mash  that should be entertaining and fun but just falls short. The only thing I can recommend is the adoption of a  dyslexic hero, something my nephew could enjoy, however though it claims that this problem is due to half blood demi-god status of Percy. hmm.

B0011EP0S6|5.0|What can I say about this movie? It's simple yet poignant. The music moves the story forward and what beautiful music it is...
1594202842|4.0|On the surface level, this is a superbly told self-deprecating account of raising children - an irony because the author tells it with brazen self-confidence. On a deeper level, this is a story of clash between old and new, 'Asian' way and 'Western' way, the politically incorrect and the  politically correct. And most of all, this is a thesis about building real (based on evidence) self-esteem and faux (based on empty compliments) self-esteem. Reading this book, you'll at least smile, or even laugh, even still learn something as long as your mind is not tightly closed to the point of non-movable defiance.

B0042EJD8A|1.0|This is a movie with flaming faucets and little science.  Gasland features wells from three Weld County landowners, Mike   Markham, Renee McClure, and Aimee Ellsworth. A thorough investigation by the   Colorado Department of Natural Resources showed that the Markham and McClure   wells had biogenic gas which had nothing to do with oil and gas drilling.  There   is biogenic gas everywhere in the air and in the earth. Cows belch it; swamps   emit it; and it forms all over in the earth's crust. If your water well hits some, and   there is very much, you have to start over.    There is also thermogenic gas which comes from all forms of oil and gas   drilling. Ms Ellsworth's well had some of both kinds, and she reached a   financial settlement with the driller. The film also deals with a wetland owned   by a Lisa Bracken.  Nine different tests from 2004 to 2010 determined that all   of the Bracken property gas is biogenic unrelated to drilling. There were other   instances in the film of seepage from oil and gas activity resulting in   penalties assessed against the operators, but affected homeowners may not have been properly compensated.   There was more in the film which the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) found to be baseless.   COGCC Director, Dave Neslin, offered to speak with Gasland's producer, Josh Fox,   on camera during the filming of the movie with COGCC technical information. The   offer was declined by Mr. Fox.   In 2010, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission appointed a 3 person technical team to review Pennsylvania's regulation of gas drilling.   The team included WILMA SUBRA who appears in this film. They found that Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection was doing an effective job.   This is a film with good intentions, but it is one for the heart, not the head.

0440243688|4.0|I shared the disappointment of many fans over the previous Lee Child/Jack Reacher product \\"Nothing to Lose.\\" Well, I thought, all good thriller writers hit the wall eventually. Ian Fleming was only saved by dying of a heart attack at 56. Then, on a recent vacation I found \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" in the bookshelf of the condo.  After a phenomenal first chapter in which the subway riding Reacher spots a woman who fits the profile of a suicide bomber, Child constructs a roller coaster ride around New York City involving a cell of al Qaeda terrorists who, along with the NYPD, FBI, Reacher and unnamed government agents are in pursuit of a MacGuffin: a memory stick belonging to a deceased mid-level clerk.  Never mind that the contents of the stick and its location turn out to be rather pedestrian. The twists and turns along the way are worth it for the expected shark attack by Reacher on his enemies.

0439813786|5.0|Originally I borrowed a copy of this book, but before I'd dipped in too far realized this was one I wanted to own. It's beautifully illustrated and bound, so it's a great addition to anyone's collection. Also, it's a really good story, one I'm sure I'll want to reread someday. In the opening pages we learn through the drawings (before we read a word) that young Hugo lives and hides in a train station in Paris. Meticulously, he sets the station's time clocks -- and when you learn why, your heart will go out to him as mine did. He's a great character, a boy who, when faced with tragedy, learns to live by his wits without losing his dreams or his kind and open spirit. Hugo also is working on the invention to which the title refers. In the course of this, he makes a friend and uncovers the secret of another character. I'd love to say more, but don't want to give away the twists of this lovely, gentle tale. I can say this -- if you're a old movie buff, you're in for some treats as well. Selznick is also the grandnephew of film legend David O. Selznick's first cousin, and he pays this aspect of his legacy a loving tribute.     This is marketed as a children's book; I read and loved it as a grown up and think many others will feel the same way. The story line and narrative are well suited to kids 9 through 12 or 13, but the size of it -- it's over 500 pages -- might discourage children anyway, as most books targeted toward them are significantly shorter.
B002ZG976U|4.0|My husband and I debated if we wanted to see this in the theater or wait for DVD. Being the Cher fan that I am- I finally talked him (and myself) into seeing it in the theater. First off, nowhere near as bad as we expected. No, Christina is not horrid as an actress but definitely should look into some serious classes. She is NOT terrific as some reviewers claim. Cher- she played herself and that is not a bad thing. Tess: Strong, a veteran entertainer of the stage, demanding, sexy, able to dust herself off after nearly losing her livelihood and admired by younger performers. Need I say more? The music is better than expected but not radio friendly. Cliches' abound nearly every few minutes. But you know what? Despite the critique here- both of us walked away entertained. Cher is so darn likable, Stanley Tucci is sexy, Julianne Hough is great in her acting debut, Eric Danes- well, let's just say we did not like the ending where he is concerned. Not one bit. We will buy the DVD/Blu-Ray for sure. I mean- it IS Cher and we are kind of obligated as gay men. LOL!! =)

The pictures and music are beautiful and soothing. We watch it all winter long. Why watch dark and wierd Polar Express when this is such a classic. Stores need to carry this so more people will know about it. We give The Snowman as gifts and the response is where has such a sweet movie been!  Our 28 year old requested it for her new baby.  It arrived in 4 days.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The book was good, but like a previous reviewer, I kept waiting for something more, more detail, more insight, instead the book focuses on the authors thoughts, and wants and needs, instead of more on the actual day-to-day life of prison.  It was just not what I had expected and definetely not something that I feel would give a good insight into life in prison.

030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson had plans for a ten novel series before he suffered a fatal heart attack.  Luckily, the Millennium Trilogy had just been delivered to his publisher, but the world is deprived of any more of his fast-paced, award-winning works.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the first book, deals mainly with discovering the trail of a mass murderer and the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, and we learn of the amazing powers that the diminutive and often sullen Lisbeth Salander possesses.  In the following two books, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, we learn bit by bit of the savage abuse she was subjected to up through her teens and the present-day hunt to silence her by allies of her Russian ex-spy murderous father, as well as a secret governmental agency that wants to re-bury her in a mental institution, and a vigorous nationwide police hunt - a hunt based on prejudice and haste that erroneously concluded that she has just committed three murders.<br /><br />These books move at an impelling pace and I found it difficult to leave off to do necessary chores -  I think I read them in record time.  But there are other layers in these books that make them much more than crime thrillers:  they are significant novels exploring poignant moral and ethical issues.  In Larsson's own words:  \\"When it comes down to it, this story is not primarily about spies and secret government agencies; it's about violence against women, and the men who enable it.\\"<br /><br />Larsson is exceptionally skilled at splicing action with dilemmas of right or wrong such as press freedoms and governmental accountability, weighing responsibility and obligations, the angst usually being worked right into the plot or into one of the several intriguing sub-plots.  When Erika Berger, one of the main characters, takes a job as Chief Editor in a large daily, she has to remind an underling what the job description of a reporter is and is not; and during a fight with the publisher, what the responsibilities of stockholders are in a capitalist society.<br /><br />Larsson gives us great, memorable characters like Salander herself and the blond giant Niedermann who has the power of a truck and a medical condition that prevents him from feeling any return pain, and Salander's own father, mysterious and ruthless who puts a bullet in her brain.  And sex.  Investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist, the main character, gets to sleep with all the females - well, almost all.<br /><br />The whizzing pages teach us so much in a small avalanche of topics, e.g., the child labor involved in Asian toilet manufacturing.  Larsson was bubbling with things to show and tell us.<br /><br />And agonizing choices - the ethics and morals thing I mentioned before:  should Blomkvist expose the recently killed mass murderer, but in doing so devastate a large family company - of which the now-dead killer was a leading officer - and that thousands currently depend for their livelihood?<br /><br />In a way these books are like candy - but there's meat and potatoes there as well.  Candy in literature is when the author clears all objects in a believable way and our favorite character is able to leap hurdles and out-think all adversaries.  It is when we want to look the other way when good guys take legal shortcuts because we know their actions will be justified.  Their little tricks have to be not-for-personnel-gain or gratification, but for greater justice.  We root for Salander as she gets fantastic results getting the dirt on bad people even though she employs illegal means to do so.  We see her get revenge; we see her dispose of two bullies ordered to kill her; we see her calculating complex mathematical formulae just for fun, and finally we see her in the last pages head to belt-buckle with the giant - who has all two hundred of his brain cells shouting - Kill her!<br /><br />If these books are about violence against women, they are about our justifications as well.  Salander steals millions - billions actually - but no tellers or pedestrians were hurt or inconvenienced in the process, nor was a single shot ever fired.  It was okay, because she was just steeling from organized crime.  But she spends very little and gives some away.  We just know that in the books that will now never be written, Salander would turn out to be a world class philanthropist and a fighter for just causes.<br /><br />She's just smart.<br /><br />It is so rare in literature to have the mechanics of how things go wrong shown us; and even better, and rarer, to be shown the mechanics of how to put things right again.<br /><br />Thanks, Stieg Larsson.  We do need to slow down and think.  And think not just for our own well being, but how we all fit together.tually - but no tellers or pedestrians were hurt or inconvenienced in the process, nor was a single shot ever fired.

B002ZG976U|5.0|What's up with all the flack this movie's been getting from critics? It's absolutely dazzling! This has to be one of the best musicals of the past decade. The musical numbers are phenomenal, the costumes are fabulous, and Christina is just marvelous. I've always known she was a great talent but I think this movie is just what she needed to showcase that talent. Her acting was good, her dancing was on point and what can I say about that voice? I'm not a fan of Cher but I really enjoyed her in this movie. Christina and her have great chemistry. The love story was also really cute. I'm salivating for this to come out on DVD/blu-ray so I can watch it over and over again!

0595440096|4.0|Lisa Genova presents a wonderfully and realistically woven, touching story about Alice Howland. Mother, wife, esteemed Harvard Professor, Research Analyst, Thesis Advisor- all around very important woman, busy and in full control of her life. Slowly, instances begin to pop up that seem strange and disconcerting, but also fleeting. She feels ridiculous even making mention of them until they start happening with more frequency and severity.<br /><br />It begins with losing a word, here and there. Forgetting a name. The fact that she just met someone and forgot that she met them. Completely missing a flight to speak at a conference. The panic begins to set in when Alice goes out for a run and is momentarily frozen in fear- she has no idea where she is and how to get home. Unexpectedly, her memory snaps back, but the rising doubt within herself remains.<br /><br />A visit to the neurologist confirms the unimaginable. In her early 50's, a young, virile, brilliant Alice has been diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's. The news is a blow, but Alice tries to remain calm and steadfast, seek answers, prepare herself for what she knows is going to be a humiliating end.  \\"I am no longer a Harvard Professor,\\" she tells herself, after deciding to step down from her duties at the University. Alice begins to lose bits and pieces of herself, pieces she knows and can remember but seem to be lost inside her, swimming in something, being held back by a thickness that she can't navigate. Alice will eventually have to be cared for. She won't remember those who love her. Will she remember those she loves? And that she loves them?<br /><br />Amid this story of awakening and an unremarkable strength is a tale of coming apart and gluing back together. Once at odds with a daughter who always paved her own way, her illness allows Alice to form a special bond that \\"old Alice\\" may never have allowed to form. At the opposite end, what was once a comfortable existence with her husband John begins to fray at the edges and unravel quickly as the disease progresses.<br /><br />Still Alice is a moving, gripping story. At several points, I teared up, feeling the emotion with the author as she took us through the gamut of emotions- confusion, fear, anger, frustration. We feel, see, hear everything through Alice's eyes. That view is revealing, a trip into dementia and Alzheimer's that those of us on the outside of a debilitating, degenerative illness will never know.<br /><br />I think one of the points of the story that was most moving to me, was the letter that Alice wrote to herself, back when she was lucid and of sound mind. The daily tests she gives herself and, upon failing, the instructions she also gives herself. I find it ironic that lucid Alice, as much forethought as she put into planning ahead, never imagined that she wouldn't even be able to carry out her own instructions. And, thank goodness she couldn't. She would have missed out on so much.<br /><br />Genova does a superb job telling her story.

B00005O5CM|4.0|I think this movie is generally under-rated. My expectation was one long blonde joke... but I was pleasantly surprised to find some substance there, instead. The underlying messages are admirable: that you should not judge people based on initial appearances, and that women should create their own destinies, rather than passively hoping for \\"happily ever after\\" with the man of their dreams.     The main character, Elle, is very feminine, but also very smart and very resourceful and very strong. She's hardworking and honest and fiercely loyal. She sticks by her principles, even in the face of strong pressure to do otherwise. Over the course of the film, we see her progress from a girl whose happiness depends entirely upon someone else's behavior, to a woman consciously guiding her own future. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job with the role, playing up the comdedy without allowing the character of Elle to ever be a bimbo joke.     The only scenes that had me rolling my eyes were the \\"bend and snap\\" segment in the beauty shop, and a few moments in the final courtroom scene.     Overall, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is a surprisingly good movie -- very engaging and upbeat entertainment.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|\\"So it's 1969, Okaaaaaay?\\" howls Iggy Pop in the first song on one of the most notorious albums ever released. The Stooges were the anti-band, the angry answer to hippie-lovefests and Woodstock. There was no peace and love vibe to be found here. The result was, to underplay the influence somewhat, a revolution. Other than fellow underground types, \\"The Stooges\\" was either ignored or derided.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't discover them until I was in college. It's easy to see why 1969 listeners blew their noses all over this album. John Cale treated them like they were arty like the Velvet Underground, but no-one in The Stooges was that sophisticated. Ron Ashton wields a primal guitar, heavy of fuzz and wah-wah, long of unruly solos. Iggy sneers and snarls like a million bored and angry teenagers; both \\"1969\\" and \\"No Fun\\" are as basic an Eff-You to the world as it gets. It would take The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and The Clash to pull Iggy and The Stooges after them in their wake, but for good reason. Nobody was making records like this then. The hypnotic sleigh-bells that drive \\"Now I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" finds drummer Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander pounding out some kind of mutant Bo Diddly beat while Iggy barks<br /><br />\\"So messed up, I want you here<br />In my room, I want you here<br />Now we're gonna be Face-to-face<br />And I'll lay right down<br />In my favorite place.<br />And now I wanna Be your dog.\\"<br /><br />I always wondered if the Ramones swiped \\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\\" from \\"Now I Wanna Be Your Dog.\\" The fact that it's taken almost 40 years to get the full Stooges discography updated and re-issued tells you how long their influence gestated among the Punks in the late 70's  You still have to listen to some really off the wall tracks even by The Stooges standards, like the ten minute psychedelic drone of \\"We Will Fall\\" to get to the good stuff, but the best of what's here shows just how far ahead of their time \\"The Stooges\\" is.
014144116X|5.0|Two well-meaning English women - Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested - go to India some time during the first two decades of the last century with the desire to see and experience the real India.  They do not share the disdain for the natives that prevails (except for the schoolmaster and freethinker Cyril Fielding) throughout the community of British administrators who govern and run the nondescript town they visit, and they accept an overture of friendship from a Moslem, Dr. Aziz, in the form of a tour of a local geological curiosity, the Marabar Caves.  But the expedition to the Caves goes awry in numerous ways, culminating in a mysterious insult to Adela Quested, which leads to charges against Dr. Aziz, a trial, civil unrest, and further polarization of the British and their colonial subjects.<br /><br />The most common and most facile reading of A PASSAGE TO INDIA is as a critique of imperial Great Britain, its colonial policies, and its treatment of the native Indians.  And in fact the novel is an understated but nonetheless searing indictment of British imperialism as well as expos&eacute; of British racism.  It is one of the foremost \\"anti-colonialist\\" works of literature.  But it is much, much more.  It is one of the richest, deepest, and most multi-faceted novels I have ever read - and one of the very best.<br /><br />E.M. Forster borrowed the title from Walt Whitman.  In 1868, Whitman, excited by the soon-to-be-completed Suez Canal (and similarly excited by the transcontinental railroad in the United States and the undersea transatlantic cable), wrote a poem \\"Passage to India\\".  He celebrated these technological and engineering developments, and not simply because they facilitated trade and transportation.  More important, they enabled<br />\\"The earth to be spann'd, connected by net-work,<br />The people to become brothers and sisters,<br />The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,<br />The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,<br />The lands to be welded together.\\"<br />In his exuberance, Whitman also expressed the further hope that these developments provided passage to \\"more than India\\" - to wisdom and even to God.<br /><br />Another facet of Forster's novel - in addition to the anti-colonialist one - is as a rueful rejoinder to Walt Whitman.  For A PASSAGE TO INDIA highlights the gulf between East and West, between the suspicious mind of the Oriental and the \\"hypocrisy\\" of the Westerner.  Cyril Fielding (to my thinking, the principal character of the novel, who surely is modeled in many respects after Forster himself) believes that the world \\"is a globe of men who are trying to reach one another and can best do so by the help of goodwill plus culture and intelligence\\".  A noble and enlightened sentiment.  But try as he might, despite bounteous goodwill and culture and intelligence, Fielding is unable to bridge the gulf with Dr. Aziz, the novel's most prominent Indian (though a Moslem with an Afghan heritage).<br /><br />And it's not just the West versus the East, or the British versus the Indians.  Even amongst the Indians, there is a divide between the Hindus and the Moslems, and between the Brahmans and the non-Brahmans.  But that is not all.  On a personal level, even among individuals of the same race and culture, there are repeated failures to connect, failures of communication.<br /><br />And still, I have barely scratched the surface of the novel.  It has a depth and complexity that makes me think of the best of Joseph Conrad.  (I wonder what Conrad thought of it, assuming he read it.)  A PASSAGE TO INDIA also touches on the broad concepts of religion and civilization and the even broader ones of Infinity and Eternity; it raises, implicitly, the question of whether humanism is illusory; at times it assumes a rather mystical atmosphere; it contains marvelous descriptions of India (on a par with those of Kipling); etc.  That \\"etc.\\", by the way, is not so much laziness on my part as a signification within the confines of an Amazon review that the novel is extraordinarily rich.<br /><br />In addition to all that, the underlying story is a very engaging one; the novel's major characters are fully and sensitively developed; and it is gracefully, and superbly, written.  I first read it more than 35 years ago.

B001U3Y5XE|3.0|this game is much harder than i anticipated.  i consider myself a pretty creative individual and i am very familiar with Legos and the concept of thinking outside of the box to create more than what the instructions give.  That said this game will stump you at times.  it will certainly force you and your kids to be REAL creative.  In many cases that means going beyond the legos themselves.  The pieces provided are very limited and some of the items you are trying to create or mimic are VERY difficult for youngsters.  We've had to allow or kids to use motions and sound effects to aid in getting the correct guesses.    cons:  -limited pieces make it almost too hard for kids to interpret the given picture into building a like alternative. (heck even the adults will struggle with this) The box indicates it is for ages 7 and up, but unless your child is VERY familiar, I mean, like \\"plays with them everyday/future engineer\\" familiar with Legos they will likely get frustrated with this game and/or need help.    -the game does not include really anything other than the legos pieces, picture cards and a simple booklet containing vague instructions on 4 or so methods of play. It would be nice if there were some form of game board, a dedicated way to track scoring or something else to drive the competition a little bit. Most games in this genre have some type of board where you move your piece based on successful guesses and you \\"race\\" to the finish. This would be a great way to improve the overall feel of the Creationary game. The included instructions reference the use of a timer, which is not included. This would also be a nice addition as it is kind of annoying to  to run to/from the oven for the use of a timer.    pros:  - a great way to promote higher level thinking with kids and adults.  Many of the pictures require you to be extremely creative.  -It's Legos!!  Come on what's not to like, right?? worst case you just sit around and build stuff, having a good time with your kids laughing at how silly your robot looks with a air hose and satellite dish coming out of its head!    All in all i like this game, as do our kids. The concept is there, but i do think it needs a little tweaking to make it a family game night favorite.
1400049628|4.0|....to sit down and read it like a novel it gets old pretty quickly.  For a zombie, survival, apocalypic fan the information given in the book is 5 stars.  To sit down and read the whole thing through as if it were a novel its more like 2.5-3 stars.  The book just becomes repetitive, as has been mentioned before, after a while you just sit there and say yeah, we get it, do this not that, go here not there, etc.  There are only so many ways you can say things before it feels like your just reading the same thing over and over after a while.    For those true zombie fans though this is classic stuff...you'll eat it up.  I really enjoy this genre as I already mentioned and read through this fairly quickly but I certainly got bored with it at points once we got the idea of what the author was trying to get across.    So for what it is and what it gets across it's great...but to sit down and expect to read it through like a novel and not get bored with it is kind of a struggle.

0060557818|3.0|It's been a year or so since I read this book and I can remember, at the time, that I was enjoying myself and had a good time reading it but now that I think back on it, I can hardly remember all the details...hhmmm.  Nothing really sticks out to me, no great scene or section of the book, no favorite characters...it was more of a good time at the time but not so memorable that I can think back on it a year later and recall every detail like you can with alot of other books.    You might ask yourself why I review a book I don't remember but it's not really like that...I remember the idea of the book...I remember enjoying reading it at the time...I remember starting and finishing it fairly quickly but isn't it telling that if you read something only a year or so ago and have already forgotten the details?      So...with all that said I'll be reading this again at some point soon...it's good enough to do that with and who knows maybe it'll all stick with me the next time around.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just finished watching the prequels and noticed further changes not reported elsewhere... in Episode 1, as Padme walks past a sleeping Jar Jar on their way to Coruscant, I noticed that Jar Jar now moves his toe! What an innovation! In Episode 2, Dex's Diner now features a Keurig coffee machine. No joke! In Episode 3, the Smurfs now have their own box in the senate. Ridiculous!!! George Lucas can do whatever he wants to HIS movies, love the changes or hate the changes (he still didn't fix the Death Star schematic in episode 4, LOL) ... I still enjoy that galaxy far, far away... finally on crystal clear blu-ray.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I really like toy story 1 and 2 but I think the 3rd one is the best. This movie was funny and cute and sad at the end. They did a great job with the ending. I loved Lots-o, he was adorable even though he was mean. This is a must see movie. I rented this movie on demand first, liked it so much that I bought the blue ray copy. I watched this movie with my 2 1/2 year old son but I think some parts of the movie scared him a little, like the part with the monkey and I don't think he really liked big baby ESP the part with him sitting on the swings and when he heard the alien fall big babys head turned all the way around. So some parts may scare younger children a little, but the movie is definitely great for older children and adults. I hope they make a 4th but I doubt it.

B001DCQI8W|5.0|This cycle is the keystone of any Bruckner collection. Other than sonics (what a dog-lazy company DG is nowadays, with apologies to Fido) there are no weaknesses here, only mastery of the highest order.<br /><br />Firstly, a word about this provincial music-teacher from Ansfelden and his long-winded yarns.<br /><br />\\"The most crucial difference between Bruckner's symphonies and his church compositions is that the former seem to go beyond religious dogma to express the more fundamental, primitive stratum of feelings that gave these beliefs birth: a sense of awe, born of the naked wonder; and the fear and delight of humanity when confronted with the beauty and power of Nature and the vast riddle of the Cosmos.\\"<br /><br />Now to the cycle in question. The world has changed. The chances of the same degree of mastery being replicated across the canon at some point in the future are bugger all.<br /><br />1 - Karajan recorded the First in early 1981. Thankfully he opted for the Linz version rather than the 1890 Vienna re-write where all the exuberance of the work was leached out by the composer himself. The First is a Masterpiece: it is far more worthy of a 'Titan' epithet than the Mahlerian alternative. For years, I was somewhat deterred by the opening bars. Learn from my mistake. The slow movement is as much of a nocturne as its counterpart in the Fourth. And the last movement has no peer in Bruckner's work; it really is, as the composer said himself, someone barging through the door. The Berlin Phil play peerlessly.<br /><br />2  - Karajan opens up many, but not all, of the cuts in the 1877 Novak. It is a pity that a clarinet rather than a horn closes the slow movement. But again, this is a superlative performance - and it sounds better than the First which was recorded in the same month. The Scherzo is a heavenly little movement and Karajan is equal to the task.<br /><br />3 - The 1887 re-write is used here rather than the 1873 or 1877 versions. As commentators have noted, while it does not particularly work on paper, orchestras usually prefer this 'fail-safe' edition to the two alternatives. And how it blazes with glory. I was in Rome and beholding the Arch of Constantine when I fell in love with this work and its final coda. Even with the passage of years, the thrill is still mine. The slow movement is numinosity incarnate.<br /><br />4 - It really is a case of 'Choose your own Adventure' here, as Karajan uses a different text than his 1970 recording on EMI. A cymbal in the last movement does not bespeak Bruckner's own hand. Mind you, the 'Holy of Holies' chorale in the middle of the first movement benefits greatly from the additional timpani, be it authentic or otherwise. These mundane considerations aside, this is a great performance - a journey into the heart of the forest and beyond. It exhibits similar 'grip' to the Seventh below as if Karajan had been preparing for this performance all his life. And the opening horncall is not mere notes.<br /><br />5 - Karajan takes this symphony where few others dare to go - perhaps it can only be likened to Celibidache (who would spurn the comparison). The Adagio is heavenly slow: the conductor's concentration and the playing of the Berlin Phil sustain it. The Finale blazes forth appropriately. Does Sirius shine any brighter?<br /><br />6 - This is the one problematic performance - in a way -  though Simpson was correct in his assessment that only Karajan, at the time of writing, made sense of the Finale. Criticism of this performance centres upon the opening movement. The Berliners would not have been overly familar with this work and it was never part of Karajan's core repertoire (much like Furtwangler). Accordingly, they sound jumpy at the start as if they had not been afforded opportunity to digest the Sixth over time. I daresay several takes were used: by the time the famous 'timpany recapitulation' arrives, some eight minutes in, the Berliners have regained their customary composure and the coda to the first movement is magical - 'Homeric Seas' indeed.<br /><br />7 - This is the best Seventh in the marketplace. It is arguably the zenith of Karajan's 30 year relationship with the Berlin Phil. Perhaps only Furtwangler has approximated the mastery that is evident in the coda to the first movement. Karajan's grip on the slow movement is infallible - when the great climax comes, one is almost compelled to stand to attention. All in all, this is an overwhelming performance that leaves one smouldering in its wake. It is the Logos, empurpled and enthroned.<br /><br />8 - This Eighth served its day superbly but according to consensus it has been overshadowed by the alternative that Karajan recorded in Vienna in 1988. The 1957, aptly remastered, has also come into its own. Even so, if this version had been Karajan's only contribution to discography, we would still be declaiming a genius. The Berlin Phil do not falter once. In train, one travels further through the cosmos than Voyager 2.<br /><br />9 - This is a great 9, and I prefer it to the 1966 alternative. Once heard, the cellos in the coda of the First Movement are never forgotten. As always, Karajan's sense of pacing is unerring. As the finale draws to an end, one is reminded of Lenny's dying words: \\"What is this?\\"<br /><br /> All in all, this is life-changing, much like seeing the windows of Chartres for the first time. The original artwork was famous in its own right - the carving of the wing taken from a Greek temple - and it still symbolises the opportunity that is afforded to you, dear reader, if you undertake this Odyssey.posure and the coda to the first movement is magical - 'Homeric Seas' indeed.<br /><br />7 - This is the best Seventh in the marketplace.

0525951652|4.0|The book moved fairly fast..more so at the beginning.  It was interesting to read the thoughts and happenings that led up to the beginning of WWI.  We can already see where Follett is going with his characters...Lev will become a successful bootlegger in Buffalo, NY and probably become involved with gangsters.  Fitz's son and bastard will learn they are brothers and there will be problems over their father's estate...or Fitz and son will die and Eth will help her son fight and inherit the estate.  Maud will move back to England from Berlin prior to beginning of WWII for safety.  Among all of this will be the rise of Adolph Hitler in Europe and prohibition in the U.S. amid the universal economic depression.    Wonder how close I am to what the second book will be.

B004GNYGTI|2.0|Take what you have seen in all 3 Bourne Movies, add in the same plot twists they used in \\"Get Smart\\" (only this isn't supposed to be a comedy) and the same set pieces you played in the latest Call of Duty Black Ops, and you have Salt. Its uninspired, poorly paced, at times frustratingly outrageous, and unsatisfying. Also its one of those films that intentionally leaves the end open to make it into a trilogy. At least the Bourne franchise had the decency to wrap up the story in the first one, leaving it as an ending that was actually an ending.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|I loved The Social Network, saw it 9 times in the theaters. Just got my 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD, and the packaging is terrible. The outer photo slicks come right off, and they're not keep-able. So you're left with an awkward, black slipcase that takes time to open. I would greatly prefer the traditional plastic case, which preserves the case artwork and titles and credits. Whoever designed this DVD package is just dumb.
0393061310|4.0|I was given this book by a friend for a gift and enjoyed reading through the material.  It chalenged some of my pre-conceived ideas about the rise and fall of countries and civilizations.  I had never before considered the idea that germs could have had such a great impact on the development and decline of civilazations.  My only criticism of the book is that Diamond seems to write as though no one else has ever considered these issues before.  The fact is many other scientists, economists and philosophers have developed theories and concepts which Diamond does not seem to consider.  Overall though I enjoyed the book and even watched the documetary that was made from the book.  I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone who is new to this field.    Douglas Geyman
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Quite possibly Hugh Grant's best ever performance, About a Boy is both funny and enticing.    There's two elements to the storyline.    The most obvious one (and the one I honestly believed would dominate most of the storyline but I was wrong) deals with Hugh Grant playing the role of a single guy who's always interested in meeting women, and seems to be proud of the fact he has no life or any real motivation to do anything.  Somehow, he always impresses the ladies and they don't seem to care about the fact he does nothing but sits around watching television all day.    The next part of the storyline is the superior one because it involves Grant's character getting to know a little boy who continues to visit him.  We actually get to see a good chunk of the little boys character and all his many problems (constantly getting picked on in school, having other kids throw rocks at him while returning home, and a constant need to fit in by listening to rap music).    Actually the message I got out of the film is that, you have a grown 38-year old man with no life, and a little kid struggling to get through school and meet friends.  The message being, no matter what the age, your life is probably going to be stuck in a rut at *some* point.    The humor came whenever Hugh Grant would lie as a way to try and impress the ladies.  One scene in particular was great the way he just made up the fact he had a younger son and when the truth was revealed, he just blew it off like it was no big deal.    Overall, it's got comedy elements, and a messgae that displays honesty and maybe even familiarity too.  Some guys can relate to this storyline I bet.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|I admit to being a fan of Angelina Jolie. She is an actress with enormous talent who can play a variety of challenging roles. I personally like seeing her in action roles such as the two Laura Croft movies, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Wanted.  SALT is my favorite Angelina Jolie film at this time.  SALT is an action packed film that feels like a roller coaster ride. One of the many things I like about Angelina is that she actually does most of the stunts in her films, which makes it more real for me.  This DVD has 3 versions of the film.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like seeing the beautiful Angelina Jolie moving like a well-trained professional assassin in a fast-paced action packed film, you will want this DVD.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.

B001FB5634|2.0|After seeing this received an A on yahoo reviews, I was sure I was ordering a good movie.  However, it was not to my liking.  It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the best.
B0045HCJG2|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that while Cobra isn't a masterpiece by any stretch, I don't think it really deserves the backlash that it's gotten ever since its release 25 years prior.  Cobra is one of those movies that doesn't break any new ground or provide anymore insight into the \\"dirty cop\\" or \\"vigilante\\" genres pioneered by such movies like Dirty Harry (1971) and Death Wish (1974), but I'd be lying if I told all of you that I didn't enjoy watching this one.  I say that Cobra is Dirty Harry's more aggressive little brother because much like Dirty Harry, it's about a cop who feels the police procedures and the rights of the accused are holding him back from catching the bad guys, but unlike the Clint Eastwood crime-thriller classic, Cobra glorifies the brutal vigilante justice committed against the antagonists of the movie.  I believe casting Andrew Robinson (the Scorpio killer in DH) and Reni Santoni (Chico Gonzales in DH, whose also named Gonzales in Cobra) was deliberate as to draw in the Dirty Harry crowd.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />A cult of serial killers lead by a psycho named the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) is terrorizing Los Angeles, and when a model named Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) witnesses a murder by the Night Slasher's cult, she becomes a target.  However, a specialist cop named Marion \\"Cobra\\" Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) and his partner Gonzales are assigned to protect Ingrid and find the Night Slasher.  Cobra is best known for his unorthodox methods in dealing with criminals that would normally break standard police procedure, and has anger problems.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />To be honest, don't expect much depth out of any of the characters.  However, there is some good characterization for select ones.  Cobra doesn't really have any depth, but he spouts out lots of cheesy yet memorable one-liners like \\"Go ahead, I don't shop here\\" and \\"You're the disease, and I'm the cure\\" that'll make any 80's action buff happy (like myself).  Also, Stallone does a good job portraying the vigilante cop with a charmingly one-sided right-wing view on how to deal with crime as he's all muscle and has absolutely no regard for the crooks.  Brian Thompson plays an excellent Night Slasher since he looks and acts like a beast.  I'd normally scorn the fact that his character lacks depth as we really don't know why he leads a cult of murder other than the whole \\"kill the weak so only the strong remain\\" brute philosophy, but I find the simplicity in this charming because for a simple 80's action thriller like this, it feels perfect that the antagonist is evil just because.  The Night Slasher's followers, especially the one who holds an armed robbery in a grocery store in the beginning, are delightfully over-the-top in their \\"evil\\" factor.  I personally wish that Gonzales had more screentime because I found his dialogue with Cobra about junkfood entertaining precisely for how hokey it is.  Ingrid is a bucket of cliches since she's an ideal embodiment of the \\"damsel in distress\\" since she always needs Cobra and Gonzales to protect her and has no depth to her.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />Cobra is pretty off-kilter compared to most other blood-soaked 80's action flicks because in the beginning, it feels like it'll be a slasher thriller given the ominous main theme and the shots of the Night Slasher cult clinking axes in a derelict warehouse and the scenes of the Night Slasher slaying his victims in the dark.  However, easily by the halfway point of the movie, it takes a steep turn into action territory when the Night Slasher's gang ambushes Cobra on the road and it ensues into a giant chase scene, and after that, dozens and dozens of the killers storm Cobra's hideout and surprise surprise, Cobra's prepared with a submachine gun (complete with a giant laser scope) and grenades that result in a huge body count.  The action scenes are pretty darn cool because it's just so much fun to see Stallone hiding in a trailer house landing perfect shots against the scum on motorcycles and dishing out rather painful deaths to the cult in the factory.  Some examples of these are when one of the killers walks through a series of flammable pipes, Cobra releases the gas valve, which shoots out flammable gas near open flames and torches the creep.  The other is when Cobra hides behind a barrel of fuel, a rifleman accidentally shoots the barrel and gets soaked in gas, then Cobra drops a lit match on him, which leads to some pretty bright and hot results.  The final confrontation between Cobra and the Night Slasher at the end is one of the most brutal I've seen in a movie like this and like any well-made 80's action flick, is loaded with brutal violence (too good to spoil, you have to see it yourself).<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />The soundtrack reeks of the 80's (in a nostalgic, fun way).  It's a mix of 80's synthesizer instrumentals and popular pop rock from the decade.  The pop songs add that mandatory 80's feel to the movie and the synth instrumentals have some diversity.  The main theme is the most memorable as it's a primarily synth-based composition with a wholly dark tone (it somewhat reminds me of some compositions at the hands of Brad Fiedel from the first Terminator movie), but some others have much more of an upbeat feeling to them and would probably fit pretty well in a Sega Genesis-era Sonic the Hedgehog game.<br /><br />PRODUCT PLACEMENT<br /><br />The product placement in Cobra is pretty amusing and given the numerous shots of Pepsi signs and Pepsi display items (such as that huge cup with the spinning transparent spiral caramel rod that looks like pouring cola in the grocery story, which I fondly remember seeing in my own youth), I'm having a  really tough time figuring out who placed the most funding for a product plug-in compared to the other products clearly featured in the movie (like RC and Coca Cola).  I don't know why, but the really vintage Toy's R Us Christmas commercial playing on the TV in Cobra's apartment really stuck with me.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Cobra isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't a terrible movie, either.  If you're a junkie for simplistic 80's action  and thriller movies with all the cliches you've come to expect with a few original nuances, then this will sit comfortably in your collection.orcycles and dishing out rather painful deaths to the cult in the factory.

0451228731|5.0|If Isaac Asimov had a son who was a computer programmer, than I would imagine Daniel Suarez to be that person. He has taken some great computing and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts and turned them into a compelling novel. It gets a bit over the top at times, but overall was a non-stop thrill ride with an obvious deep understanding of the technological concepts behind the storyline. I guess this should come as no surprise given the author's background, but it feels good to read a novel where the author actually knows what he is talking about when it comes to computer science and HCI. I say, accept the Daemon.

1433502410|4.0|The ESV Study Bible is not bad at all, but it could have been better. There's a lot to like. As other reviewers have pointed out, there are many nifty features--color maps, solid translation, helpful notes that give multiple points of view, etc. So, I'll get straight to the point about its drawbacks.    The concordance is small...VERY small for a study Bible. I'm one of those people who can remember a word or two from a verse, but need a concordance to find it. The ESV study bible is weak in that area. I now have a 2nd bible next to me when I read, just to use its concordance! For a study Bible, that's a no-no. I also bought the refence Bible...same story (but, oddly, slightly different selections under each keyword).    Also, there is no subject index. Yes, they have articles about several things in the back (salvation, ethical situations, etc.), but I'm talking about being able to look up any of a hundred or more subjects that direct the reader to some applicable verses. My old NIV study Bible did a great job there, but I want the ESV translation...so, I'm stuck.    If they were getting too \\"fat\\" on # of pages, I think they would have done better to have included a few less man-made articles, and put in a better index of the Word of God, so that we might find His truths for ourselves...or just be able to find a needed verse. A study Bible should be able to do that.    All this being said, it's still a good translation of the Word of God, with many helpful elements. Too bad about the shortcomings. They almost knocked one out of the park...when I got it, it was like watching a well-hit fly ball, expecting a home run, only to groan as it bounces off the wall. Still--I'll take a triple.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was my first purchase through Amazon and I'm really pleased with the speed of delivery.I'm from Bucaramanga, Colombia and received the order 5 days after it is placed, although it was a holiday weekend  With respect to the product (Band of Brothers Blu ray), this is truly beautiful in its presentation. I had no objection to plays back each of the 6 disks. I am happy with the purchase. Thank you very much
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a great workout without a doubt, and although annoying, Jillian is very very motivating.<br /><br />My complaint with the workout is that there is so much jumping, it provides plenty of opportunity for  aggravating a forgotten part of your anatomy, in particular in Levels 1 and 3.<br /><br />I'm  certain the jump training, as she calls it, is effective to burn calories and for cardio, but I'd suggest an extra 5 or 10  minutes on a workout less stressful to the joints to provide the same calorie burn and strength training  without the aggravation, disappointment, and derailment that an injury can cause to a workout plan.<br /><br />That being said... I very much enjoy her DVD and appreciate feeling the improvement in my body and the growing ability to complete the workouts without feeling like I'm going to die!
030746363X|5.0|So it's not about whether his scientific method is pristine, or whether the info is brand new, it's about a guy and book that provides the reader with a one stop shop of interesting ideas and trials that show they work.    From the minimum effective dose to the kettlebell swing. From biochemistry to sleeping 2 hours a day. This book is full of amazing facts, and everything from anecdotes to photos to raw data that backs up the findings.    There's also a lot to be said for the books get up and go mentality. It's not about getting everything 100% perfect, it's about making a start and building from there.    I've really enjoyed reading about the different people Tim as tried things with.  I've loved the T-bar tip (I've already created mine and started my kettlebell training).  Fascinated by the pre-hab section with exercises on core stability.  Loving the way he pulls from lots of different sources.    Overall a great body on what Tim terms Body recomposition.

It's a literary masterpiece worthy of standing next to anything by Tolkien or Lewis. I think everyone, young or old, regardless of your race, religion and creed should pick up this book and give it a read. It may change your life as much as it has mine.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|I was a huge fan of Julio Medem's small but exquisite oeuvre already, but Room in Rome easily made it into the top five of my all-time favourite films (where it competes with Medem's [[ASIN:B0004Z32NI Sex and Lucia (Unrated Edition)]]). What, you may ask, makes it so special?<br /><br />First the set-up - a one-night encounter in a hotel room, which the camera never leaves except to peep out onto the balcony or through the entrance of the room into the corridor. This would work brilliantly in a very small theatre as well. The basic idea is borrowed from a Chilean movie (En la cama) with a couple of very important tweaks. Medem turned the man of the first movie into a woman, and he moved the room to Rome, and embedded it in Italian art history. There are paintings on every wall and even on the ceilings, which play an important part in the movie.<br /><br />Alternatively, to relate it to a better known movie, one could call it an all-female \\"[[ASIN:B00002E224 Before Sunrise]]\\" set indoors and in a different city. In one rollercoaster night the protagonists get to know each other and learn to trust and love each other.<br /><br />So in that room, we have two women, not too many clothes, lots of art, and modern IT equipment enabling them to show each other their outside lives via Google Earth. Oh, and a splendid view from the balcony over the roofs of Rome. (One could have called it Room with a view, had the title not been taken by some other movie.)<br /><br />Let's get the clothes issue out of the way first, as it seems to have scared UK distributors to an extent that they didn't give the film a chance in the cinemas. Yes, both women are undressed for most of the length of the movie, but after about two minutes that appears completely normal and one stops noticing it. In a sense, considering their respective vulnerabilities and difficult path towards mutual trust and truthfulness, one could argue that most of their nakedness is psychological rather than physical. Seen this way, the cosy white bath robes they put on for breakfast in the end seem to represent the comfort and protection of a trusting (if time-limited) relationship.<br /><br />More interestingly, the art, chosen by Medem's wife and art director Montse Sanz, tells us something not only about the story and its possible interpretations, it also offers insights into Medem's philosophy when Natasha cites the Renaissance artist Leon Battista Alberti, seen in one of the paintings, as saying: \\"The artist must know at all times what he is representing.\\"<br /><br />I would argue that the film contains more classical art than we see on the walls. Many of the poses of the women remind me of paintings - most of them reclining nudes, obviously. Towards the end, Medem acknowledges artworks as a source of inspiration explicitly when he makes Natasha copy the pose of the Venus of Milo, which is present in the room as a small scale model. Come to think of it, with all the gorgeous lighting and colours, many of the frames would make nice paintings.<br /><br />Ironically, the state of the art IT equipment including a smartphone and a laptop running Google Earth (or the Microsoft equivalent) almost seamlessly becomes as important as the Renaissance paintings, as it's the only connection to the previous and outside life of the protagonists. Talking of technology, I also love the fact that Alba turns out to be an engineer who came to Rome to plug an invention she made. While she failed to score a contract on this occasion, her business seems to be going ok, judging by the quality of the hotel room she booked. And as Natasha is an art historian, the story could be read as a \\"two cultures\\" dialogue as well.<br /><br />The five languages - some of the most touching moments involve each character speaking their native language (Spanish / Russian), assuming the other won't understand. But the English dialogue, with just enough of an accent to identify the origin of each character worked surprisingly well for me (I do like my Spanish films and am not necessarily happy if people switch to English). It's sad and ironic, however, that Medem's first film to feature dialogue mostly in English wasn't actually shown in UK or US cinemas. We also get some Italian (via the singing room service waiter) and some Basque via a video, reminding us of Medem's cultural background (I understand that, genetically, he is as much German as Basque, namely 1/4 each).<br /><br />The music of Spanish (but English singing) singer-songwriter Lourdes Hernandez, aka Russian Red (a pseudonym she borrowed from her favourite lipstick, apparently) is perfect for the movie, not only because her accent matches Alba's.essarily happy if people switch to English).

038572179X|4.0|I had heard so much about this book that I approached it with great anticipation. At first I was disappointed. Actually, I was disappointed for much of the book. Then, I reached the end of the book, and I was blown away. The ending of this book changed the entire experience of reading it. The ending was startling and moving, and well-worth the time to get there.<br /><br />The book spans more than sixty years, from the mid-thirties to 1999. It begins on a fateful summer day in 1935, when thirteen-year old Briony Tallis witnesses the interactions between her sister and the son of a family servant. Unable to understand the budding romance between Cecilia Tallis and Robbie Turner, Briony's response causes a devastating set of consequences. These consequences alter multiple lives.<br /><br />A significant portion of the book takes place during the Second World War, and the grizzly realities of the battlefield are presented in full detail. Be ready for plenty of stomach-turning injuries. The language in the book is very atmospheric. The prose describing the summer evening is sultry and languid, nearly as stultifying as the heat itself. The language does seem showy and a bit overdone. Why McEwan makes this choice becomes evident later in the book. This is a somewhat difficult book to get into, but it is well worth pushing through to the ending.

B000QUUD60|5.0|\\"ELVIS -THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\\" (DELUXE PKG.) I recently bought this movie/DVD of Elvis. I really enjoyed it, loved the Music, his voice, interaction with Fans, joking, cutting up and laughing with the guys who were all his friends, band members, acting silly, just enjoying himself and others. Doing some jam sessions and rehearsals. I would recommend this to anyone who is an Elvis fan, or maybe not an Elvis fan. Sure better than the musical movies he made. This was when he was in his prime...voice, health, looks and age. He was about 35 years old and makes you wonder 'where' he got all his energy he put into his shows. He LOVED to sing and does plenty of it, that was his passion. And he loved being friendly and giving his fans what he could to make them happy, whether it was a touch, kiss or smile. And HE was in control of his shows (not Colonel Parker). I also bought Elvis '68 Comeback, I enjoyed that too. I was never one of those girls in the 50's, screaming & etc over Elvis. But at age 69 I find myself wanting more of his movies: Elvis - On Tour, for one. I wonder if maybe I should have bought the Deluxe of his: Elvis '68 Come Back.[[ASIN:B00025L42Q Elvis: The '68 Comeback Special (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)]] My favorite movie of his was \\"Flaming Star\\". And I'm going to buy that and \\"Charro\\", which I have never seen or knew about.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|I bought this 4 CD album and I really love it. Elvis has such an expressive voice and way of singing. It really comes out as he sings these Gospel songs. From his heart and soul. With great backup from the Jordenaires. The last CD has some songs recorded at his Hollywood home in CA. If you love Gospel music, or just Love Elvis, you will get great Joy out of listening to this Album.
B003Z9Q4WG|4.0|I am very glad I bought this and highly recommend it. All of the recordings are from 1950's and early 60's. The quality and the breadth of this box set make it a wonderful way to start or quickly expand and a top-tier classical music collection. For me, the biggest revelation in the set was the recordings of Hayden symphonies, 19 in all. They are lively, fresh, balanced, and not overly romanticized. I had no idea that Bernstein recorded Hayden so often and so well. It also includes great recordings of all 9 Beethoven Symphonies and 4 of the 6 Symphonies by Nielsen. There is nothing in the set that is particularly modern, which I would have liked more of. The most modern pieces in the collection might be 3 Symphonies by William Schuman, again, wonderful recordings. One correction of a previous review: only Symphony 9 by Bruckner is included, not all of his symphonies.<br /><br />Some of his best recordings of Mahler Symphonies, which I was hoping would be in this box set, were made later with the NYP and the Vienna Philharmonic and are in other box sets from Deutsche Gramophone. My biggest problem with these earlier recordings is with the sound of lead trumpet player in many of the Mahler symphonies, particularly 2 and 5. He has a somewhat warbly, overblown sound that might have been in vogue then, but it is annoying to me now.<br /><br />I don't care for the packaging. I assume they wanted to do something big and different, but it can be difficult to find a specific recording, and sometimes it is hard to remove the CD that is at the very bottom of one of the four compartments. I would have preferred the common block-style container, with all CDs back to back.

B0034G4P7Q|1.0|On the technicals:  Good photography, good editing.    On the subject matter:   The kid has very serious issues. Case closed. The opening scene says it all and my assessment is confirmed in the last scene of the movie. He's a social outcast who wants to get even with the Frat house boys, when all he has to impress women with is his 1600 SAT score, which doesn't quite get it done. He's frustrated, nobody understands him, a loner, no friends and he wants to get even. Sound familiar? Every idea the kid ever had, he stole from someone else: i.e. serious ethics issues. Hollywood jumped on this because the old PT Barnum adage that was good then is still good to go now: \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\". That would include the professional reviewers and I suppose me as well because I was stupid enough to rent the DVD. If this movie is an American Landmark and an affirmation of acceptable behavior, please take note, we are in serious trouble as a society and a nation, which has been confirmed by current events. Think about it.

B00338QENI|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fascinating story on many levels. Scientific experimentation on cells has come a very long way since when HeLa cells were first taken from Henrietta Lacks in 1951 and the author documents in great detail from then until now. This story has implications for anyone who has ever had blood taken, given birth or tissues tested - who owns these and where do they go? What I found most interesting though was the story of how one family was impacted by choices made far beyond their control. Ms. Skloot's writing was very clear both on the scientific and emotional level. Definitely recommend for those with an interest in family history, science and bioethics.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I've been an entertainer myself working as hard as Michael and find it insulting when more lies about him are spread and untrue. I have this concert and it's obvious that it is him singing. Or do you not notice the wireless microphone. If anyone can spot lipsyncing it's me. This is not one of those. This was live and you can also tell by the pitch of his voice which is a bit lower than the norm that it is genuinely his voice.     I don't know if you're getting mixed up with some other artist but this is one of the greatest performances I've ever witnessed,The light show is great, the sounds of chimes makes the music sounds even better, he doesn't cut anyone off unless that's how you took it as your mistake. Michael was out of breath not only because dancing and singing together will do that to you, I should know, I've been there, when he sings the slow songs it's to help him catch his breath to get ready for the next fast dancing routine. Watch again and you'll know what I mean but Michael does not lip sync in this concert.    This is one of the best DVD in concert because it was live and we all know what a perfectionist he was, this dvd had to be perfect and he of coarse wouldn't have wanted his fans to have lipsyncing dvd. So please watch again and in stereo if you can and you can clearly hear every note if you know what you're looking for. This is a beautiful concert he worked so hard for, please don't be little it. I rate this concert a 5 star if not better if they were to allow that. I also plan to purchase another one soon since I've been wearing mine out and only had it a little over a year.

B001QKSWOE|4.0|You're sitting in your favorite chair, reading that paperback detective novel you just picked up, and you come across this passage in which the heroine, Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter, and her sidekick, Lulu, a \\"former `ho,\\" are discussing why their latest attempt to apprehend a fugitive has ended in disaster (as usual). Lulu has an explanation:<br /><br />\\"I got bad juju. How else could you explain it?\\"<br /><br />\\"It's not our juju,\\" I told Lulu. \\"It's our skill level. We're incompetent.\\"<br /><br />\\"I got a high skill level,\\" Lulu said. \\"I just shot a rat off a rafter.\\"<br /><br />\\"You weren't aiming for it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah. My skill level is so high I do things I don't even try to.\\"<br /><br />So, how can you respond to writing like this? Well, I don't know about you, but I find exchanges like this irresistibly funny. Likely as not I'll laugh out loud, as I do so often with Janet Evanovich's inimitable Stephanie Plum series. Perhaps it's just my sophomoric nature. After all, I laugh out loud at movies, too. Or, maybe, just maybe, it's that Evanovich has a rare talent for humor akin to that of Donald Westlake (also a writer of humorous crime stories) or great film comics like Buster Keaton or the Marx Brothers.<br /><br />Now, if you're one of the three book readers in the United States who is unfamiliar with the name Janet Evanovich, here are a few choice facts:<br /><br />  * Janet Evanovich is the author of 37 novels, give or take a couple. She turns them out at a pace that almost rivals James Patterson, with whom she tends to alternate the top spot in the New York Times Bestseller List for fiction.<br />  * Evanovich joined the ranks of published authors relatively late in life, and very slowly. It was only at age 51 with the debut of her heroine, Stephanie Plum, in One for the Money (1994) that she began to hit her stride. At last report Plum had managed to maintain her age (early 30s) and her figure (clearly enviable) through 17 numbered novels, the latest of which was Smokin' Seventeen (2011), plus five other books published \\"Between the Numbers.\\"<br /><br />If you read Evanovich loyally, as I do, you won't learn a lot about anything of consequence, not law enforcement, crime, or even the working-class setting in New Jersey where the Stephanie Plum novels are set. Chances are, though, you'll have a lot of fun.<br /><br />[...]published \\"Between the Numbers.\\"    If you read Evanovich loyally, as I do, you won't learn a lot about anything of consequence, not law enforcement, crime, or even the working-class setting in New Jersey where the Stephanie Plum novels are set.

0810997827|3.0|The book set is good to read (easy to follow) but, according to a certain 9-year old, the book is not one that makes you want to turn pages and keep on reading and searching for what will happen next.  A favorite though, is Dog Days.  Dog Days is interesting because it is something that really happens and can happen to some children so that makes it more fun to read.    Overall, even though the entire set didn't get the highest mark, this Diary of a Wimpy Kid set is still able to capture imagination and interests of readers young and those who are young at heart.

Also, the illustrations are  great as Grover's face tells exactly how he feels. It diminishes the fear of a \\"Monster\\" while keeping the listeners giggling. It is a short story, so it easily keeps the interest of preschoolers and early primary students.  This is definitely a favorite at our house.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I got this CD set in 2009 for about $20. That's a steep price but this collection is worth it. Some great familiar and not so familiar tunes make up this double CD collection. My favorites are:    The Christmas Song  The First Snowfall/Let it Snow  Merry Christmas Darling - the signature holiday Carpenters song  I'll Be Home For Christmas  Ave Maria  Home For the Holidays  Little Altar Boy  Do You Hear What I Hear?  He Came Here For Me  I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day    There's also wonderful short and instrumental versions of songs. The instrumental of My Favorite Things is bouncy and toe tapping. Interestingly, Merry Christmas Darling was written some 20 years before the Carpenters recorded it in 1970. Of course it's now a holiday standard. The notes in the booklet say that Richard and Karen loved Christmas music. The selections on these two CDs prove it. Richard says that had Karen lived, they would probably be on their fourth or fifth holiday CD. It's that's true, Karen's passing is even more tragic.    Karen left us at age 33 in 1983, much too soon. But she's joined Bing, Nat, Frank, Dino, Andy, Johnny and Elvis as singers you always hear on the radio during the holidays. Thank goodness she left us her music to remember her by.

B0042816YK|2.0|I knew the moment I heard Julie Roberts was cast as the lead in Eat, Pray, Love! the movie was doomed. Now don't get me wrong, I've been a long time fan of Julie Roberts since the early days, and thoroughly enjoyed Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill, and Charlie Wilson's War.  What's happened to her acting talents since then is a mystery.  Roberts acting range these days seems to be limited to either a fast talking loud mouth adolescent or an emotionally collapsed, poor me, lost soul wandering through life.  I think directors, producers, and writers get blindsided by all of the hype around a star. From my point of view, Julia Roberts amazing lack of depth in this role is responsible for the failure of the film. Even Javier Bardem couldn't save it.   Julia's song I fear, has been sung.    Eat, Pray, Love's heroine should have been a younger, more earthy woman who could bring to life the emotional trauma in her marriage, her lusty full bodied eating adventures in Italy, and finally some reasonable realistic interpretation of having found some serenity and peace through self-exploration and the mysteries of meditation.  They should have held auditions before committing.(Perhaps Rachel McAdams in The Notebook - an Oscar performance if I ever saw one).     Ryan Murphy is a talented writer and director who produced the racy Nip/Tuck, and the now highly popular Glee.  We know he's talented so what happened with Eat, Pray, Love? Did he allow Roberts to interpret the role for him?  Sure looks that way, as his  characters on Nip/Tuck were complex. At least Viola Davis was in it, and she brings a depth to any role you see her in. The film for all its beauty in parts was as shallow as Roberts acting.  What a shame!  So many of us who read the book were looking forward to a great fun movie and in the end it was disposable.    Viola Davis - A+ - Javier Bardem - A - Richard Jenkins - A -   Julia Roberts - D.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|\\"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.\\"<br /><br />Those words are the only thing appearing on the solid-black case that holds \\"The Social Network\\" blu-ray discs.  The packaging looks and even feels much different from the standard blue cases that blu-ray owners are used to.  It's nothing fancy, very minimalist actually, but the simple-yet-sophisticated design makes it feel special.<br /><br />When you get around to popping disc one into your player, you'll notice a top-notch digital transfer.  Image and sound quality are great.  Two audio commentaries are available.  The first is a director's commentary with David Fincher, who shares a lot of interesting information as well as various anecdotes about the making of the film.  The second is with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and many of the key actors in the film  - although it sounds as though Sorkin's thoughts were recorded separately because there seems to be no interaction between him and the cast.<br /><br />Disc two brings a lot of great bonus material.  The documentary \\"How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?\\" is approx. 90 minutes long, and chronicles the film's production in both L.A. and on location is Boston.  I found it to be a very fascinating look into the filmmaking process, although it may seem excessive to those who have no interest in such things.<br /><br />I should note that this 2-disc Blu-Ray set does not come with a DVD or a Digital Copy.  This is surprising given the recent \\"combo pack\\" trend, but it shouldn't matter much to those who own blu-ray players and want to see the film in its highest-quality transfer.

B003HC8ITI|4.0|This review will not discuss the pros and cons of the movie itself, or even the home video release.  Plenty of other reviewers have covered that.  My contribution relates to the Amazon.com exclusive Film Cell Photo Frame that is available for purchase with the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" Blu-Ray.<br /><br />In case this review appears on the standard blu-ray release, here is a link to the specific item I am discussing:<br />[[ASIN:B003HC8ITI Alice in Wonderland (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/Digital Copy + Film Cell Photo Frame) (Amazon.com Exclusive)]]<br /><br />Film Cells are actual 35mm film frames that show an image from the movie.  For this display, the cells were hand-selected and mounted.  As seen in the photos, this display includes 3 individual film cells.  Each display will have unique cells, so you will own a one-of-a-kind item: no two pieces are the same.<br /><br />Also included on the display are three photos from the film, as well as a title card.  The photos and the film cells are mounted on a black matte board and placed behind a sheet of glass for protection.  I own many film cell displays and this is one of the highest quality and most well designed pieces I have ever seen.<br /><br />The display itself measures 8x10 inches, and framed it is 11x13 inches.  The frame is solid black, and comes ready to be mounted on the wall.  On the back of the display is a certificate of authenticity from Trend Setters, the manufacturer of the item.  Each display is numbered and the entire run is limited to 3500 pieces (get your hands on one while you can!).<br /><br />The only downside here is that it will cost you considerably more to purchase this Amazon exclusive set than it would to just buy the Blu-Ray (approx. $70 more at the time of writing this review).  But this is a great item and I recommend it for movie memorabilia collectors and Alice in Wonderland enthusiasts.
030746363X|5.0|I am not a Tim Ferris groupie. I haven't read his 4 hour work week yet(although I will now), but I feel compelled to write this review because this book is really well written and he's taken the time to do all the things I wanted to do! As other reviewers have noted, nothing that Tim wrote is new. That's very true. I have read many of the things that he has written in other sources, but it took me years to stumble upon all that information. Also, Tim has enough experimentation on himself and his \\"subjects\\" to show real results. However, the results he displays were achieved in weeks or months and not years.  What I like most is his idea of the Minimum Effective Dose. Why do 50% more when you'll only get 5% better? Do the minimum to elicit the response you want and enjoy the rest of your time. Everyone says what they would do with more time, well here it is! Even if I only worked 4 hours a week, I wouldn't want to spend it working out. I'd rather be doing something else once I was sure my physical exercise needs were met. To put it plainly, what Tim endorses is efficient effectiveness and I believe that this 80/20 living is the way we are all going to move towards as we try to gain a hold on our lives again. Get bigger, leaner, more flexible, and sleep better so that in the end, you'll feel better. There's nothing wrong with that.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|The film was cut to the music. That should give a hint right there of just how well the music and the film flowed together, and how easily the images accompanying the music in the film pop into your head while listening to this soundtrack. Combining authentic symphonic work with layers of electronic music, the soundtrack to \\"Tron: Legacy\\" is an incredible piece of soundtrack artwork that deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.    From the get-go of Jeff Bridges's voice narrating in the track \\"The Grid\\" right up through the \\"End Titles\\" track, this soundtrack never ceases to amaze. For me, there is not a single track on here I don't care much for, though there are some big standouts, such as \\"The Game Has Changed\\", a track that was done so well that listening to it brings back the images of the much-too-short Lightcycle battle of the film. There is \\"Armory\\", in which you can practically hear the steps of the Sirens as they rig Sam up for the arena games. And then there is \\"The Son of Flynn\\", a track that can only really be described as \\"felt\\" rather than \\"heard\\". Leitmotifs run rampant here, from the primal rumble of Clu's motif to the notes that show up in the \\"The Grid\\", sprinkled throughout such tracks as \\"Armory\\", \\"Flynn Lives\\", and \\"Recognizer\\". They serve to tie the entire work together without overshadowing the tracks themselves.    It is a deep disappointment that the bonus tracks of overseas releases, such as \\"Encom, Parts I & II\\" and \\"Castor\\" are no included on the physical release, or the Amazon exclusive track \\"Sea of Simulation\\". Still, the soundtrack as it is presented here is wonderfully done and well worth the price. Daft Punk has done an amazing job - here's to hoping they will do more soundtrack work in the near future.
0446195529|1.0|This book does not live up to previous Camel Club books.  The Camel Club members have such a minor role that it's almost deceitful to even call it a Camel Club book.  The plot is too bizarre.  There's too much misdirection, and we're expected to believe that the bad guy/gal always thinks 10 steps ahead of EVERYONE and knows exactly every move that every single one of the good guys will make and has everything perfectly planned out and it always works exactly like he/she wants.  I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Get these!<br />Love them. I glued mine on so they won't come off in the heat of the battle.
1600595871|5.0|I have quite a large library of book-making books, and although I really enjoy looking at any of them, there are only one or two that I use for projects. I wasn't sure what to expect of this book, but I liked a previous Alisa Golden book quite a lot, so I pre-ordered this one last summer. It was a nice surprise to have it arrive in my mailbox last week, and an even better surprise when I started to look through it.<br /><br />The projects are diverse, numerous, elegant, and well-described. The illustrations include technical drawings for technique tutorials and photos of completed projects. I also appreciate the vast array of artists' books that are featured in this book; I am always looking for new artists to follow. I am so excited to get started on making some of these books. This will be one of my top books on the subject for sure.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|A really nice surprise and a golden gift that long was awaited. I want to sincerely thank George Lucas Corporation and all who have worked to bring us this wonderful production. Also, I deeply hope that Indiana Jones Saga - Blue ray will be out real soon. So, enjoy it everyone :)
0689853637|5.0|Winters' Tale is a magical masterpiece by paper artist Robert Sabuda.  This is my favorite book to give as a gift, mostly at xmas, to my  adult friends who need to be reminded that we all have the heart of  a child hiding in us, no matter how old we are!!!!    Every page is pure MAGIC...how DOES he do it??? This book is a pure  feast for the eyes and imagination!!!    Guaranteed to put a smile on the face of anyone lucky enough to  own this wonderful book!!! (Have I made myself CLEAR...I LOVE Sabuda!!!!)
0553805371|2.0|The authors struggle and, I believe, fail to make M-Theory meaningful to the non-physicist.  As their argument re: creation/creator/grand-design is built upon M-Theory, it leaves this non-physicist reader unenlightened.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The bag is ok for the price and built nice. If you have heavy lenses, it best to spend the extra money for better bag so it won't bent or fall out. If you have light lenses than it is a nice bag for the price.

0439023521|5.0|I am a hesitante reader and it will normally take me about 1 and 1/2 weeks to read a smaller book because i get bored quickly, I tried this book and I read it in 3 days that is like a record for me! Anyways I thought i was in Panem the whole time and I just was amazed on how this book was thought of! I did not put this book down, this book is romantic, fast moving, action packed, and I have to admit I came close to tears in a few parts puting mmyself in her shoes! I'm shocked that stupid twilight got a movie and the Hunger games didn't so far! I really want it to come out soon, I know the plot sounds weird but it is fantastic! It made em appreceiate the things I have! BEST BOOK EVER!     I felt like I actually knew the characters as if gale was my best friend and prim my little sister and peeta well I don't know what to call him but I guess fake boyfriend. I loved the writing and I could not put that down! I could comprare them to people I know that were similar so it seemed more real to me! I can picture everything in my head as she explained them and it's almost as if there was a movie playing inside of me!
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|First, let me clarify that this review is for all 3 books of the Millenium series.<br /><br />I would say that this has been nothing short of publishing coup to stir up a frenzy for the 3 books, but what a pack of drivel....<br /><br />Herr Larsson seems to living up his adolescent dream, of a supremely resourcesful, terribly talented, and an ulterior do gooder in every sense.<br /><br />Picture this, the female protagonist is actually a pint sized female avatar of James Bond, Einstein, Newton, etc etc all rolled into one,  who could simply memorize a password by looking at it being typed over somebody's shoulders, can deduce the most complex mathematical solutions in minutes without any prior education (even Isaac Newton needed a while to figure out Differential & integral calculus), can knock the daylights off a double sized adversary (naturally).<br /><br />And oh yes! There's also the improvised version of the Jaws from James Bond movies, a super henchman with incredulous strength.<br /><br />It is a bit of letdown really, because the first book in the series starts off very promisingly, and carries on through pretty much on track, a kind of Who Dunnit, before relapsing into a makebelieve finale.<br /><br />A piece of advice, pick up the first book if you like, but steer cleer of the other two.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|The movie came in time for Christmas.  Thanks so much for getting it here so quicking.  I   teach special education and the movie was a treat for the students.
0143034901|5.0|Everything that makes literature exciting is in this book. It literally made me experience every emotion: joy, excitement, sadness and even anger and hate (FUMERO!). It is by far the best book I've ever read, and I have read too many.
0151003084|5.0|A tiny book filled with macabre hand drawn art. Perfect for your loved one who sits just a bit off the beaten path. Perfect for that nook where the sun doesn't quite shine. Chilling.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I love this DVD!  It is a great collector's item, for Michael Jackson fans...if you can get your hand on it.  It is hard to find, but if you do find it, DO get it!  It is well worth it!  Love the \\"movie\\" and the videos are done wonderfully!  I have a few favorites from this, but Dirty Diana and Speed Demon are two of the best.  We miss you Mike!!
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|It's not a bad movie but it is not a great movie.The biggest problem is Justine Timberlake,the man can't act.Every scene he is in is a joke.The other problem is who do you root for in this movie,there either geeks,arrogant you know what or both.
B004G6009K|4.0|This will become a classic Disney movie! Beautiful movie, the art work was nice. I enjoyed seeing it! I loved the story...hope and dreams no matter how silly, can come true. The characters were unique and had great personalities! The music was catchy!    The only thing that I didn't like was a comment made by Rapunzel's \\"mother\\" about her getting chubby. I know that she was to be portrayed as being \\"bad\\" but all other comments that I remember her making were all true. She was anything but chubby and with all the self image problems girls have these days, that will just be added to it. As an adult, I can see that this was to show that her mother was bad, but I don't think little girls are going to get that.     Now it's been a month or so since I saw the show. When my copy arrives from Amazon, I'll revise my review if I'm wrong.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Never sure if your going to like all the songs on an artists CD. This one is the exception. Every song a winner - David Cook is one of the few to really succeed from American Idol.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|Well I loved the movie! The actors really had great voices! I am disappointed though because the actors who did such a great job in the movie are not showcased nearly as often on the cd! Why is faith hill singing a song that was sung as a beautiful duet in the movie! I think what the consumers are looking for in the cd is what they heard in the movie and it is sadly not heard on the soundtrack.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT.  If you are like me, you'll have to watch it twice & REALLY pay attention to get it entirely.  On the fact i purchased it from Amazon...GREAT DEAL.  I love the DVD, Bluray & digital copy for the same price you'd buy just the DVD in stores!!  I used the super saver shipping which sucks because it took so long to get it but i'd ordered it well ahead of when I needed it so no problems!
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I finally gave up after plowing about halfway through the final book in Stieg Larsson's inexplicably popular \\"Girl\\" trilogy.  My initial interest in the quirky heroine Lisbeth Salander was finally overwhelmed by Larsson's painfully inept writing style, the story's pointlessly labyrinthine plot, and the criminally negligent editing that permitted this book to even see the light of day.<br /><br />Salander, who was interesting enough in the first book to overcome Larsson's inherent weaknesses as a writer, and who turned improbably Superwoman-ish in the second, is relegated to a hospital bed for much of the third book.  But hey, at least she's still alive and contributing in a minor way to the increasingly incoherent story line.  All the other interesting characters have either been killed off or are offstage for almost all of this book.  In their place, Larsson gives us, oh, about 300 minor characters, all of whom share confusing surnames and a tendency to be b-o-r-i-n-g.  It's really kind of amazing how many actors Larsson introduces, and how utterly uninteresting every one of them is.<br /><br />Other readers - possessing much higher pain thresholds than I - claim that this book finally gets rocking in the final third.  I'll never know, because I'm done trying to slog through this disastrously cheesy series.
0670034711|5.0|Nothing like showing the obvious through the simple things of life we use to complicate! In this book she was just perfect on retracting issues that all women have one day in life... and it's so simple to solve, just looking to the inside!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|While not a perfect movie (the acting is a bit thin and contrived in places, and the character behavior is not fully believable), it's faults are easily forgiven, especially seeing as it was filmed in 28 days on a tight budget. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, with stunning visual effects and cinemetography!  The story is well thought out and intertwined/interwoven in a way that will make you think for days, even after the third time you have seen it.  Of course, the story is not fully \\"Explained\\", which is a big part of it's alure and enjoyment, however, if you prefer nice \\"cut and dried\\" stories with \\"answers in the back of the book\\" endings, this is not for you.    Might not be appropriate for younger children(under 15ish?) as the plot and story are mentally challenging and likely disturbing. I even read some pundit accuse this movie of possibly \\"inspiring\\" Jared Lee Loughner to kill 6 people in Arizona!  It's not THAT disturbing!  But is will help adults re-aquaint themselves with how it feels to be a teenager agian, feeling like you do not fit in, you do not belong, and the world is somehow \\"not right\\"
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I read reviews saying the story was awful and the special effects terrific.  The special effects are beyond amazing, really gorgeous scenes, and great action.  Maybe because my expectations were low I thought the story was fine.  It was no worse than 90% of todays movies.  Not great, but certainly ok.  While long, the movie didn't drag, and was very good.    All in all one of the most entertaining movies I have watched in several years.
1439181780|4.0|I have read the first book The secret which turned my life completely on a positive way. Now I live by those rules every day and the law of attraction really function. That book made me buy more books about similar themes. I just could not wait to buy The power as soon as find out there is a new book from Rhonda. The secret really made me out of my mind while reading. Time to time I used to close the book and think about the written deep words and said to myself: god, it's really true. I got so much excitement while reading, but The power did not make such effect. Although book is very fine and light. Talks about love which is the power. Something like I new before. But the Law of attraction from fisrt book was a bliss and discovery for me. For the one who already bought The secret, you really do not need to rush to buy The power. Anyway, I just had to have it my library next to first one on my shelfs. Because this is the Bible of living. Thank you Rhonda.
0307592839|5.0|I can't deny it: Another Visit from the Goon Squad is a technical tour de force. There are perspective shifts, changing voice, a patchwork of events that add up to a story, even a chapter in the form of a power-point slide show (which, in my opinion, is worth the price of admission). But that's not all. This novel is also about a group of lost souls, some of whom manage, over the span of several decades, to find themselves, straighten their lives out, and even eke out something like a happy ending. There are dead friends and depraved decisions along the way, but somehow people manage to prosper. Meaning: it gets better. In the face of current circumstances, proposing that progress is possible, whether in human lives or narrative form, takes a big dose of something. That something could be groundless optimism, but I'm voting courage.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have done this dvd for almost every day for 30 days and have completed all the levels. I started with level one and when I could get through it all the way with no modifications or couple second breaks (she says only up to five seconds if you MUST) then I would move on to the next level (averaged about a week per level). I did not follow a diet regimen so that's probably why I didn't lose 20lbs but I could tell a MAJOR difference in how my jeans fit by the end of the first week.         There are so many things I LOVE about this dvd, most of all being that fact that it's over before you know it yet you're sweating your butt off. The 3-2-1  circuits are so fast that you're on to the next circuit before you know it. Unlike other videos, you know when it's going to end and that helps you push through it. She has one gal doing modifications the whole time and another one really pushing it so it's easy to follow whomever you need to. Did I mention it's only 20 min?! This is SO helpful when you have a toddler and an infant!! I HAVE time to do this every day.       Something else I love about this is that you don't need that much floor space. I think her skater move uses the most space but even then it's about the same as when you lay down on the floor. I use to move my coffee table every day until the leg started to break from not picking it up, now I just turn my tv and do it to the side of the table and still have enough space in my small living room. It's nice not to have to trip over the kids too when they are there with me.       There are very simple moves in this, no crazy aerobic moves that you have to remember or try to keep up with. My daughter will even try and do them, she loves the jumping rope part. Most of these aren't knee friendly but I'm a former Marine and my knees are shot. I just put a brace on and take my supplements. I also like how she says things like \\"think about bikini shopping\\" and \\"see you tomorrow\\". She doesn't talk nonstop like Denise Austin, whom I happen to get annoyed with, but instead just tells you what you need to know and will every once in awhile throw in something motivational.       My ONLY complaint is that you can't fast forward through the beginning 2min while she talks before you can chose your work out but I think this covers her ass in case someone hurts themselves. I just use that time to set up and get my weights out.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|We received the DVD, it was damaged with a indent in the actual disc.  At first it  looked like we were going to return it since it would not play in our players.    I attempted to take out the in-dent in the disc as it was located near the center hole and not on the DVD content area.   So far it has worked, but I am still considering returning for a replacement since it was damaged when we opened it Christmas morning.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I am a 20 year old girl and usually hate teen movies.<br /><br />This looked amusing from the commercials and I'm a big fan of Thomas Haden Church, so I decided to check it out. I've read the one-star reviews and I'm not sure why people thought this movie was boring or confusing. I admit, sometimes people don't understand what certain age groups find funny, and I think this movie is probably a good example of that.<br /><br />There is a LOT of sexual humor, innuendo, swearing and somewhat inappropriate situations in this movie. If you have any clue what it's about (a girl who accidentally gets a reputation as the school slut), you'll know that before buying it. It doesn't make it bad. In fact, quite the contrary, I thought this movie was hysterical. I thought the acting was great and this movie has actually made me like Emma Stone a lot.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, and it's not for youngsters, but for teens, it's a pretty decent movie. After one viewing, I intend to buy it.
0061989142|4.0|This new book arrived as expected.  Has been meeting expectations and is read   offen by my daughter.  She really likes the book so, for not knowing its contents  I would refer to my daughters comments.    She is happy with the book, cheaper to buy on Amazon rather than local book store.
B003A4IFDW|2.0|The interpretations are a bit disappointing.  I had heard the track of Love Reign O'er Me (Live From The Kennedy Center Honors)and had hoped to hear more of the same on the rest of the tracks. I would have thought that Bettye would have put a bit more energy into the rest of the interpretations, instead it sounds like she was just trying to get another CD out to market.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This is possibly my favorite of Satoshi Kon's work.  He is a true genius when it comes to making films and Tokyo Godfathers is the perfect combination of real life and humor.  The story is touching and the characters are easy to like.  There is one hilarious moment after another, one second you're laughing and the next you are on the edge of your seat in tears, but no worries you'll be laughing hysterically in a moment.  The perfect Christmas movie for someone who believes in miracles.    Definitely a must see for any Satoshi Kon fan or anime fan for that matter.
B003MX5P20|5.0|While I enjoy both the regular and deluxe editions, my favorite is the imported special edition which includes \\"Tonight\\".  When purchasing the \\"Euphoria\\" album, you need to be careful as to which version of it you are truly getting.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I didnt think this would be any good because frankly i thought the others were.....forgive me....entertaining....but not good. But this was great. much stronger characters, more complicated plot, and an ending that will make you go crazy waiting on the next one. i cant believe i didnt see it coming! highly reccomend it. if you liked percy youll love it. if you didnt, you still might.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I have to say, this is one heck of a good book. But I'm also slightly freaked by the idea this could really happen. Having your memory stripped, being thrown into a fresh torture every time you wake up, then being betrayed just because some evil scientist wackjobs need to find a cure. I would just tell them like it is. Hello, world. We're screwed, deal with it. Don't make kids your little lab rats.     Scary, tense, and I read it all in under 2 hours. I think that makes a record for me.

B0029QRA1U|2.0|I am not an audiophile, but I do want to make clean recordings of the LPs I have, and label them with proper track info for use as MP3s.  I was not able to do either of those easily, and the software is to blame.<br /><br />The turntable was adequate for my purposes, with a plastic platter, a sapphire needle, and no anti-skating or auto-start.  When hooked up to my audio system through the phono input, it played my LPs cleanly.<br /><br />I had no trouble attaching it to my computer, but some difficulty in configuring the settings on my computer to properly capture audio; the documentation is minimal.  Once I got it working, I had two options: let the software automatically decide where tracks start and stop, or define them manually.<br /><br />The automatic feature relies on finding periods of quiet, and labelling those as track separations. This works okay for studio albums of pop, folk, and rock music, but has difficulty with live performances, classical, and spoken word.  It did not split the live albums into enough tracks; it split classical and spoken word into too many tracks.  It split one choral LP into 31 tracks instead of 21, combining some tracks together and splitting others in as many as 6 pieces. The software then asks you to label the tracks without either an opportunity to listen to them or to revise the splits it made.  I am forced to guess how to label them, and end up with some terrible mismatches.<br /><br />The alternative is to define tracks manually, but this requires you to sit by the computer while the recording is in process, and click the \\"New Track\\" button in realtime; there is no option to go back after the fact and edit things.  So this is an incredible expense of time.<br /><br />In addition, the software does not remove clicks, pops, or hisses, and it cannot trim unnecessary dead space (like when you're flipping the record over to record the second side).  This makes your recording sound \\"authentic and historic\\" but hardly beautiful.<br /><br />I found an alternate product which allows me to record the album first, and split it into tracks afterward.  I can do all the cleanup mentioned above with that product.  Therefore, I am returning this product tomorrow.llows me to record the album first, and split it into tracks afterward.

030746363X|5.0|Growing up with a mother who has a PhD in nutrition and a father who was a marathoner and liked to run 10Ks on weekends for \\"family fun\\" I have always enjoyed the subject of health and nutrition. Then add in a saying I have had since I was a young person, \\"do the least amount possible yet still accomplish my goal\\" and you have a great description of The 4-Hour Body.    When I read my first review of this book I was like... This is too good to be true!!!  Well the book is out, I have my copy, and it is highlighted with many colors. And I am now a 4 Hour Body junkie.  I carry the book around like an evangelist carries the bible.  I never leave home without it and am always referencing the book and rereading it.    What I like most about the book are the levels of complexity Timothy lays out.  You can adapt a very simple workout/nutrition program.  Or if you want to go to the \\"freak\\" level, Tim shows you exactly how to do that also and tells you exactly what kind of results to expect.  Usually because of first hand experimentation he has accomplished on himself. Not because of something someone told him or what some \\"journal\\" says.    I do not know Timothy Ferriss personally and had never heard his name until a little over a month ago. But he seems to be the health and nutrition \\"freak\\" that you to can accomplish through many very detailed programs, which are very well laid out and in plain language in The 4-Hour Body.  Get the book, read it, learn it and live it.    Lin
0307346617|5.0|I love post-apoc fiction, and I love zombie stories, so from the beginning I had high hopes for this book.  What I did not expect was the interview-style writing, but it really works in this format. I found the vignettes for the most part to be very moving and believable, and the story on the whole was really stunning.  I was in tears a lot - so glad it's a work of fiction!<br /><br />Compared to some of the other recent post-apoc/zombie/ghoulish stuff I've read recently (The Road, The Passage, Dust), World War Z is hands down the absolute best.  I've re-read it several times now, and each time something new strikes me.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little wonder is perfect for probably 90+ percent of the knives you have laying around. If you have certain Asian knives or whatever with different-angled edges, you're probably a knife expert and don't need to read this review anyway. For the rest of us who got a cheap knife block as a wedding present or what have you, this'll put an edge on all your duller-than-life steak knives and that cheap knife that came with your Omaha steaks that you don't want to throw away because, hey, free knife. Get! Now! Please.    I have not needed to use the pointy accessory for sharpening serrations. That's just a bonus as far as I'm concerned.
B003XT603Q|5.0|I initially didn't know what to make of this book, but by the end of the first chapter I was hooked. The depth of Naoko's sickness pulls you into a place where you start to see the darkness present in everyone's existance. Murakami's journey into the idea of normality takes the reader to a place of deep contemplation. This book doesn't just entertain its readers, it transforms them.
0385342047|2.0|One word: wow. I have been an avid fan of Sophie Kinsella but was MAJORLLY disappointed with 'Mini Shopaholic'. Having read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels, I wonder if Madeline Wickham is an escape route from this progressively worse series. I received 'Mini Shopaholic' as a gift and purchased it on Kindle and have never felt such a chore to finish a book. While the title leads you to believe that Becky Bloomwood's daughter may follow in her footsteps the novel soon forgets that and focuses on her husband's surprise birthday party that will not end. Honestly, if I wanted to read about someone throwing a 400-page birthday party I would have picked up a The Baby-Sitters Club book! I guess I should have not been surprised when the movie for 'Confessions of a Shopaholic' was such a letdown to avid fans but this book brought the 'limbo bar' that much lower. My request, if you like this series this is a definite library check out. I hate to be so negative but it's the same lies over and over Becky tells everyone. It needs to be a 'Confessions of a Compulsive Liar' series instead of 'Shopaholic'. The way these serious issues gets downplayed is also a concern. Much respect to Sophie Kinsella because the first few books were amazing and I really enjoyed 'Remember Me?' but 'Mini Shopaholic' should have been a children's book or at least written under yet ANOTHER pin name.
1607963183|5.0|It may seem silly but I read this book for the first time at 24, all at once, when a not quite complete stranger handed it to me. It shifted my perspective on everything all at once, and so it was a children's novel changed my life. I was simply in the right place at the right time, and now so are you. If somehow you've managed to avoid this until right this moment all the better, it will be all the more profound.

It was so engaging and it grabs your heart. i cant wait for the movie to come out!
B00004T0US|5.0|i bought it for my mother, it was a little late shipped but it was christmas. it came in good condition. i paid barely anything for it. she LOves it. i looked for it forever. but all in all she loves it.
B004GNYGTI|3.0|I was very disappointed. I've no problem suspending belief..it's a movie..belivable isn't an issue. Acting wasn't that great honestly and by the time the movie got started - it was over and I was left with, \\"what? that's it?\\" Actually I like the premise of the movie but it left me wanting...and wtf happened to Jolie? Doesn't she eat anymore? She looked awful.
0802798225|5.0|In Fairfield, the school is divided between the rich north-siders and the gangs of the south-siders.  Brittany comes from the North side and seems perfect on the outside.  She has the brains, the beauty, and to others she has the perfect life.  In reality she has a Father who is hardly home, a Mother who is constantly trying to perfect everyone in the house, and a sister with disabilities.  She is always trying to make sure her life seems perfect even if she is crumbling on the inside.<br /><br />Alex comes from the South Side where he is a member of the Latino Blood gang.  He secured himself in the gang to make sure his family is safe after the death of his Father.  Everyone at Fairfield High School steers clear of Alex.  They know he is apart of a gang, and they have heard the rumors about him.  When Mrs.P, the chemistry teacher, pairs the two together for lab, it becomes the clash of the rich snob versus the poor gangster.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  I have been dying to start this series after reading so much about it on other blogs, but I never seemed to have the time.  I finally decided to take a break from other books and start the series.  I loved the way Brittany acted around her sister.  I am glad the author decided to make her out to be the caring person that I was hoping for instead of the snobby rich girl who looks down on a disabled person.  You could really tell that the two loved each other and Brittany did everything in her power to keep her parents from shipping her away to a group home for disabled children.<br /><br />Alex was tough on the outside, but when you first meet him interacting with his family, you knew that this bad boy was going to capture your heart throughout the book.  He truly believes being apart of the gang is protecting his family until he starts to question the death of his Father.  His friend Paco, also captured my interest in this book and I was really hoping he would talk some sense into Alex.<br /><br />When the two start to fall for each other, you can actually feel the struggle the two are going through on the inside.  The author did an amazing job with her writing and I loved how each chapter was in either Alex or Brittany's point of view.  The progression of the story was done at a wonderful pace and believable as well.  The only issue I had with the book is the Spanish.  I don't speak that much Spanish, and I didn't understand some of the phrases that were being said by the characters, but it didn't bother me too much.  I could still understand what was going on between it all.<br /><br />A great book with the perfect amount of chemistry between two main characters that has me craving the next book in the series.other, you can actually feel the struggle the two are going through on the inside.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|I saw the boss on Jimmy Fallon and they were talking about this item. My wife is a huge huge fan of the Boss. What a wonderful Christmas idea! I came to Amazon the next day and found this item at an outstanding price to what I found elsewhere. It contains 3 CD's much of the material previously unreleased, and 3 DVD's of concerts, plus a replica of the Boss's spiral workbook containing songlists for concerts and appearances, rough sketches of song material and other personal notes, notations and reminders. A MUST HAVE for any true Springsteen fan!

B000YAA68C|1.0|My movie was delievered in a timely fashion, and that was great, but the DVD was listed as \\"Very Good\\" and when I got the movie, the second hour of the movie wouldn't play because it skips so bad. I will not be buying from this seller again. I was very dissatisfied
0385528752|5.0|Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard is a great book that I'd really recommend.  It clocks in at 11 chapters, 259 pages.  Each chapter is broken into smaller sections that either introduce a concept or reinforce an idea through real-life examples.  Also scattered throughout the book are \\"clinics\\" where a problem is laid out, and then you are challenged to apply what you've learned to the problem, followed by the answer - what really happened.<br /><br />I would really recommend this book to anyone who has anything in their work or personal lives they'd like to change, either within themselves or their environment or the people they interact with.  The authors themselves make it clear that this isn't their brand new invention, highlighting a number of books in the \\"Recommendations for Additional Reading\\" at the end, explaining how each provides further example or insight into one of the principles they've covered.<br /><br />But what makes this book unique and compelling is that they've packaged up the ideas into a simple, easy to use, easy to understand set of concepts that you can apply and see results with, even if you didn't read all the other books they recommend.  So how is this new enough that I would praise it instead of accusing them of just stealing other people's ideas?  It's the way it's packaged, made easy to relate to and brought together.  The aggregation and synthesis is what makes it so compelling.<br /><br />The book starts by asking you to think of the problem or situation as an elephant with a rider on a path.  The rider is logical and thinking.  But he's much smaller than the elephant and it takes a lot of work for him to control the elephant.  And the path is the way to get from point a (current reality) to point b (the change you want to see).  And the elephant is, well, the elephant - a large, emotional, less-intelligent creature -- and then points out that every situation will have these three elements.  The book talks you through how to convince both the rider and the elephant that the journey must be taken and how to increase the likelihood that the journey will be taken by clearly identifying the right path and making sure it's clear of obstacles.<br /><br />Nurses wearing construction vests have fewer prescription errors?  Check.  The size of the free popcorn you're given at a theater determines how much of a glutton you'll be?  Check.  Giving government employees credit cards will lead to tax savings on purchases?  Check and check.<br /><br />You will find this book difficult to put down and will finish it quickly.  I think this is a book that I will want to re-read from time to time to re-inspire me and to help these concepts sink in even better.the rider and the elephant that the journey must be taken and how to increase the likelihood that the journey will be taken by clearly identifying the right path and making sure it's clear of obstacles.

B002Z8IWMS|5.0|One of the greatest second acts in business is the return of Steve Jobs. Taking Apple to new heights, it has become one of the greatest business success stories ever written.  This book gets to the core of Apple and provides insights to innovative thinking. Easy to read, full of great information that is applicable to anyone making presentations, designing products, dealing with employees and customers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is absolutely amazing. i love the storyline. i could have never guessed the ending. A very unique plot invluding all our old favorites. Katniss, Peeta, a little more from Gale tham the last book amd several new characters.<br /><br />After the games have ended we find out how the Capitol feels of things that transpired during the previous games. The love triangle seems to get even more complicated. Twists and turms im this novel kept me reading it straight through.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you love a little action, a little romance, a little but not too much science fiction, and a whole lot of awesome. Oh but of course read The Hungher Games first or it won't make much sense
B000B7QCKE|5.0|My husband saw a PBS special on Yanni & loved this particular part of it so I purchased the dvd/cd just before Christmas. He spent a good amount of time glued to watching the dvd. Great purchase - made him very happy!
0316044407|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. The story is heartbreaking and interesting, and draws you in within seconds of beginning the book. I literally couldn't put the book down. The book is so well written and I would recommend it to anyone. I have given this book as a gift several times, and everyone always loves it.

B0015XASFS|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for my mother, who is a big Josh Groban fan. My mom and I have been wanting to see him in concert, and always seem to just miss ticket availability. This DVD was a fun taste of his concert. He is so relaxed and high energy, and of course his voice is beautiful as always.
1589946634|4.0|I enjoy this game.  It can be played solitaire, so I can play whenever I get a hankering for some good 40K action (my wife, while typically a game-lover like me, is uninterested in learning this game), or I can bust it out during game nights with up to five other players.  It's fun, tense, and challenging, three elements not often found combined in a cooperative game.    I appreciate the fact that this game gives me a good taste of the grim dark future of Warhammer 40,000 without forcing me to assemble and paint miniature figurines to play the game.  I enjoy the universe, but I am just not THAT dedicated.
B00192IV9U|4.0|When I first got this album, just after its release, I simply didn't give it the chance it deserves; and thought I didn't like it. Now, in 2012, after listening to it many times and watching three of the videos, I must say that I absolutely love the album and am so glad to have it. My favorite track is \\"Behind The Mask\\"...classic, awesome MJ, a song as excellent as any song he ever published. I love \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" but I like the video version of the song better than the album version. The \\"Behind The Mask\\" video is a blast, I adore it and congratulate the fans who made it. I like \\"Hold My Hand\\", both album and video. I haven't been able to see the other existing videos, and it rags my butt that Sony won't release them on DVD. I'd buy it even without having seen the other videos! As for the controversy about some of the songs not containing MJ's voice, that's ridiculous. Of course it's Michael's voice. Any MJ fan should be able to tell that! Of course there are other voices on the album, used to complete some of the unfinished tracks, but MJ's voice IS in there as well. Read the album cover or CD insert; it'll tell you that. Duh. All in all, I think Michael would approve this album and be honored by it. Buy it, listen, give it a chance. It's gooood Michael Jackson stuff.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|There are a lot of characters and details that can be difficult to keep track of and often become mind numbing...however all three books were written that way. With that said, this was by far the best of the three. a definite page turner with a satisfying conclusion.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Historic Origins:<br /><br />This film is broadly based on an Old English heroic epic poem of the title name. It is set in Scandinavia in the late 5th century, and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature. In the poem, Beowulf has defeats three main enemies:<br /><br />[1] Grendel - a very large troll<br />[2] Grendel's mother<br />[3] A Great Dragon<br /><br />The third battle takes place 50 years after the first two. At this time, he has become king of the Geats, unfortunately in this battle he is fatally wounded.<br /><br />An Animated Marvel:<br /><br />This film is an animated using motion capture techniques. The animators did an excellent job in making all the actors, monsters and sets look very realistic. This film is one of the most life-like animations that are available; this alone makes the movie a collector's piece.<br /><br />The Action:<br /><br />The action unfolds quickly, as the immoral behavior of a king come back to haunt him. Grendel is a vicious man-eating troll that hates the sound of merrymaking and puts an abrupt stop to it.<br /><br />Enter Beowulf, who's mission in life seems to be to seek out and destroy monsters that threaten humankind. Strangely enough, he baits Grendel, and awaits him complete naked. The action is fast paced and the fighting is brutal and gory at times.<br /><br />There are some surprises and the level of action is taken to even higher heights as he battles the dragon in the climax of this film.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Excellent graphical content, acceptable storyline, and lots of action.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|The triggers are a welcome addon to the PS3 controllers. It fits nice, looks and feels like the original buttons.  The only draw back is $5 dollars for two pieces of plastic probably worth 5 cents.
B000784WMW|5.0|I was interested to see how they'd turned this 11-part series into a DVD.  It is only one DVD, and you can select to play all or play by episode.  It's awesome!  I was ecstatic about it.  I love this version of Jane Eyre - Timothy Dalton is such a strong Rochester, and Zelah Clarke is a lovely Jane!  Really worth having for your collection.  I will cherish this purchase forever.
B000N3ST7A|3.0|I do like this cd but not fussed with the live tracks and the song selection.     I think the previous greatest hits that was put out in 1990 with sometimes life is a bitch released as a single was much better. The only down fall with that compilation it was not remastered.     Stevie has had some amazing songs through out the years even with Fleetwood mac but i am a little dissapointed with this cd.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Amazon has sent me this product review request approx. 9 times in the past two weeks.  This item was a gift and I never opened or viewed the product.  It was shipped directly to the recipient.  I cannot vouch for the product, only that the seller completed the transaction to both my and the recipient's satisfaction.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|We purchased these for Christmas gifts after viewing the DVD on PBS. Music truly bridges the barriers of race, religion and language. We all are traveling the same road. Anything that can bring us together in this knowlege is an exceptional gift. The price for the DVD and the CD was very reasonable.
B003XU75QG|5.0|I purchased this CD in mid-December of 2010; I would have bought it as an MP3 album if it had been available, but I had to buy the import CD instead, if I wanted all of the songs. And that's what I wanted.<br /><br />I track my music listening habits on Last.fm (which is also where I discovered The Pretty Reckless), and at the end of 2010, I captured my stats for the year. With just a few weeks of play in 2010, this album turned out to be my 4th most played album for the year--that's how much I liked it. Taylor Momsen has the vocal pipes to rival those of any other lead rock singer in the business today. The guitarists, bassist, drummer and backing vocalists deliver solid rock 'n' roll that strongly complements Taylor's voice and doesn't miss a beat.<br /><br />Some people may dismiss this group because Taylor Momsen is a teenage actress. Don't let that hinder you from listening to this music. If you're in the US and want this CD, you have to buy it as an import, but don't let that stop you from buying it. As a US resident, you could, if you wanted, buy [[ASIN:B003RNSA0O The Pretty Reckless EP]] as an MP3 album. But I would suggest spending the extra money to buy the import CD and passing on the EP. If you like female fronted rock 'n' roll, you will love The Pretty Reckless.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|For anyone who has been exposed to Settlers of Catan, actually owning the game is amazing. The pieces for 3-4 players are all included in the box.    Some great parts    - the pieces are painted well and the objects that are placed on the board are quite sturdy (houses, roads, cities, etc.)    - The rules are quite complete and offer several different layouts for the board    - the colors of different parts that go together often match.    Some Problems with it.    - The same comments that other people have had about its durability I can definitely verify. The pieces are not that well built and they do not stand up to the constant wear and tear of playing the game often.    - The border around the tiles of the basic board is supposed to hold the pieces in place, but like many others, mine never seems to fit quite right and so we never use it anyway, just add our own ports to the map and then go from there.    - playing with newer players is difficult because the clay hexes that produce bricks have a lot of green in them (like the pastures) and are very similar to another kind, the wheat hex. You have to look harder to distinguish the differences.    - the new box that all of the pieces come in is supposed to help keep everything organized, but I have found that sorting things and putting them in their own plastic bag works as well as using the box and saves a lot of space.    - the cost of the game is quite high and only rises as you add the expansions to it.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I got this for my dad after seeing it it on PBS.  He was very thrilled with it.  I may need to copy everything before I give it to him from now on because I want to see the full session myself.    This is worth every penny even if you already have the CD release.  Great production values for time when it was recorded.
1594202842|2.0|I've just written 800 words of analysis on my Mojo Mom blog but I'll try to keep this review short.  I read the actual book and not just the Wall Street Journal excerpt and assigned myself the task of coming down on one side or the other:  is it okay to treat your children this way?  My answer is no. If this is not abusive perfectionism, then what is?  Chua openly coerces, berates and shames her daughters in order to control them and get them to do what she wants.    The \\"star\\" rating is hard to apply here. I found the actual writing compelling, like a peek into another mother's cathartic diary written during a crisis, but I cannot endorse her actions.  She has said it's not meant to be a how-to book, and she grew from her experiences, and I can only hope that is true.    I don't know the immigrant experience but I do believe that generations have to adapt.  Chua brings to mind my grandmother, who grew up during the Depression, and never got over it.  She could never really spend money on herself or enjoy it, and she always had a mindset of scarcity that served her well in some ways but made her a sad person in others.    It would be one thing to work your children this hard if you had to get them across a desert before they starved or died of thirst, but to act this way to produce \\"perfectly\\" disciplined, talented, uncoddled kids, it's really not okay.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|By chance I happened to stumble across this show on our local TV station.  After only one episode I was hooked and had to order the DVD box sets.  The plot changes and turns, which kept me riveted and wondering what would happen next.  The screen plays adaptation of the books reflected a crisp storyline with some added deviations.   The lead characters which are so very different from each other, form a very formidable joint force, who's quest it is to save the world from evil.  The acting is world class and perfectly delivered.  If you enjoy been drawn into a world of fantasy and make believe, where there are wizards and witches, scrolls and tears of stone, then this is definitely a must for you. Although the second season does have a very abrupt semi-ending. I CANNOT BELIEVE that ABC and DISNEY DO NOT want to make/release the 3rd Season.   Not continuing the the final episodes would be a sad end to a really fantastic show.  I dont think that this series has gotten the credit it deserves from the Network.
0525951652|4.0|I found this first part of the Century Trilogy to be very enjoyable.  I love long books and intricate stories. The research for this book is impressive....history in Germany, Russia, England, Wales and the US in the run up to WWI.  I enjoy that era of history and I have to say that I learned a lot from this book.  There were times when so much was going on in the book I felt exhausted.<br />My only criticism is that I did find the graphic details of sexual encounters and the vulgar language in some conversations to be gratuitous.  Follett is a gifted writer and while I understand the need to make the interactions real and dramatic, they do not necessarily have to be so so explicit.<br />I can't wait for the next book!
0316069884|5.0|I have sometimes suspected there were problems with the meat producing industry, but had relied on our governments to ensure that both farm animals were not suffering unduly and humans' health was not put at risk by the way they're raised and processed.    Jonathan Safran Foer has masterfully researched and described the extent to which the systematic abuses of farmed animals and fish is hidden from consumers. It was an eye-opener just how few corporations control the entire chain of meat production in North America and how our governments simply rubber stamp their highly questionable practices. Before reading EATING ANIMALS, I had very little idea how detrimental the effect was of factory farms on the huge population of farmed animals, human health and the planet's environment.     EATING ANIMALS is one of the most important books of our time, not just for its ideas, but for the clear logic and excellent writing of Foer. My husband and I are now vegetarians.

014241543X|5.0|\\"If I Stay\\" is well written, well crafted, and has one of the most sensual lovemaking scenes I have ever read. It reminded me of the way I felt when I read \\"Forever\\" in junior high school. I have read \\"Twilight,\\" and I couldn't put it down. However, I felt angry and somewhat betrayed by it. I didn't know why until I read \\"If I Stay.\\" \\"Twilight\\" was like a sickeningly sweet dessert, while \\"If I Stay\\" is a gourmet meal. I felt good about liking it. [Note that I read the Kindle edition.]
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Too much of a good thing is a bad thing, when it comes to the Expendables this quote is right on the money.<br /><br />Most of the actors in this movie have had some what of a successful acting career in their own right, mostly in the eighties and nineties. Honestly though, even with all the success these actors have had, we all know the movies that made them household names were cheesy and not really known for winning Academy Awards. They were more of a guilty pleasure, appealing mostly to young men who at one time really believed it was possible to take on a whole army all by yourself and come out victorious.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying they weren't fun for their time, however that time has come and gone. Too much cheese can constipate you leaving you feeling very uncomfortable and trust me this movie has extra cheese. Of course with a movie like this you really wouldn't expect an incredible heart warming story, so with that said I wasn't really let down by the very clich&eacute; plot and generic story telling. The acting and dialog was pretty much as expected too, corny one liners and of course more muscles than a seafood restaurant.<br /><br />This movie is all about the over the top action, which it does have a lot of. If you're a fan of the genre, you have a really loud surround sound system and catch this movie on TV or receive it as a gift then check it out. Otherwise don't be in a rush to waste about two hours of your life when there are a lot of better alternatives. In a nutshell it's not a horrible movie, however not as fun or enjoyable as the Rambo movies.  Basically this is just a supergroup of the whose who in from the eighties/nineties action movie club, think Damn Yankees!<br /><br />Michael
0143118420|1.0|I couldn't force myself to finish it. I stopped reading at page 48. Yep, that early. I skimmed ahead to see if it would get better and it didn't so thats when I called it quits. I became very annoyed by her because she portrayed herself as this sad pathetic divorcee but then she would scatter little passages around about her good looks or her skinny figure or about how wealthy she is or some know it all attitude to make herself feel above her readers. It was just really pathetic to me. Yes, it is a memoir, but I really couldn't stand her.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|If I had a top 50 all time western list, the Lee Marvin version of Monte Walsh would be high in the top 10.  This is to my estimation an accurate portrayal of what it must have been like as the old west and the cowboy began to fade from the scene.  In many ways it was a sad tale with a lot of good action.  Lee Marvin was excellent as an old cowhand who was watching his friends die off or watching the ranches for which he worked begin to fail. Lee usually turns in a splendid performance in his films and this was no exception.  I have seen the recently remade Tom Selleck version and with all do respect to Selleck, the older version is far superior.  I have been waiting for a long time for this film to be released on dvd and when it was I snapped it up.  The film also included a fine supporting performance by Jack Palance as Walsh's long time side kick.  The sound track included a song called \\"The good times are coming,\\" which was ironic in as much as there were no signs of any good times on the horizon.  The song was sung by Mama Cass Elliot. If you are a fan of the western genre you owe it to yourself to own or at least see this movie.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Well written life lessons for teens & parents. I highly recommend this series. My teenage daughter (15) and I LOVE to chill and watch this together. The episode topics evoke many important discussions on relationships between family, friends and dating partners. There are opportunities to discuss the multifaceted moral dilemmas between the dialog or episode pauses.<br />I plan on watching this with my preteen sons when they are in high school and old enough to comprehend the impact of the choices considered and acted upon.<br />This series is a FAR departure from the trashy reality shows today's kids are fascinated with and are written from a moral family outlook.<br />If you agree with this review - click \\"helpful\\" to guide other families to this impressively written series.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|I wasn't too big of a Katy Perry fan until she released California Girls w/ Snoop Dog. I felt like that was a hot track, and it was different for her to be pared with a legendary rap artist such as snoop dog. It's weird with this album, most the commercial singles are really good but the rest of the album falls extremely flat compared to her first release. I felt like she really sold out, which can be good in some ways, bad in others. When I listened to the whole release through, I felt like a lot of lyrics and dance beats were really immature. In fact, I feel that Kesha has at least better beats in her music. I will say that I really like the vocals on Teenage Dream and Firework. It took a while for me to catch onto Firework, but it actually works well. It's nice to her good singing and dance beats like Blake Lewis's Binary Love. It reminds me of a lot of the old school R n B that I like. Peacock just sounded awful and that one song about partying on Friday Night was garbadge compared to some her other radio hits. I would only suggest buying on the singles on this album. It really didn't desearve to have 3 No. 1 hits, but Katy Perry's not that bad of a singer.

B003UBTX7C|2.0|I'm a big fan of David Baldacci and was really disappointed in \\"Hell's Corner.\\"  It was choppy, confusing and trite.  I wondered several times if he actually wrote the book or had some protege write it like a lot of big-time authors seem to be doing now.  I usually love his books because they are exciting and fun with lots of \\"insider\\" info, but this one was boring.  I didn't feel attached to any of the characters and I predicted most of the dramatic points in the book.  There is no character development. I didn't care when so and so turned out to be a bad person working for the other team - I saw it coming.  Oliver's usual humility was spoiled by everyone else's wide-eyed respect for his past. As someone who has read  most of his other books, I still had trouble placing all the players, too.  The whole thing was sketchy. People were angry and I couldn't care less or even understand why. We are beaten over the head with what a supposedly great spy/assassin Oliver Stone - the main character - was in the past, but he doesn't show it in this book.  Baldacci takes us back to murder mountain for the grand finale - really? Are there no more interesting locales? We already had a finale on Murder Mountain! I felt like Baldacci just phoned this book in.  Aside from the interesting aspects of Hell's Corner itself (jurisdiction and stuff like that) there was very little of his trademark \\"insiders\\" perspective that I usually enjoy in his books.  My suggestion?  Borrow it from the library.

The chapters are short (most are less than two pages in length) which allows the reader to fly through the book, even if it's read in short bits.<br /><br />The fictional story revolves around folklore and personal accounts of those who knew the late creator of the atomic bomb. A sobering topic, but Vonnegut manages to create situations with refreshing humor, satire and imagination.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Yes this is the best Lego set ever. Numerous minifigures and different play scenes combining both Star Wars Death Stars gives it the most playable Lego title as well. This set is absolutely amazing. I see some listed complaints, but other than the laser being too easily torn off, I have none.    $400.00 is well worth it when you consider the quality you get with Lego. I used to complain of the expense until I worked with other cheaper construction blocks. Now I'll never go back. Don't forget these are also durable. My 10 year old still plays with Lego's I had 30 years ago. I can't say that about most of my other toys. Then consider the value that most Lego sets retain over the years and you actually have quite a nice investment going w/ respectable returns.    9 1/2 hours total time to build. I will admit, I have built over 100 Lego sets(small and large) over the last few years, so I am not an amatuer. The boy just couldn't wait to play with it so Sunday after Christmas we spent 9 1/2 hrs. in my basement workshop together. And the next 9 1/2 playing with it in his room.    After that many sets, I have found Lego's quality control to be nearly impeccable. One piece missing in all those sets total(it was an arc-170 set). I found numerous times my missing piece was just placed on the wrong part of the Lego set. Or hidden under something else on the table. Or dropped on the floor. That's a lot of Lego's to only be missing one piece. I have yet to come up with a better solution for their instruction manuals to prevent me from making those mistakes.    So thank you Lego for all the quality time my son and I spend together. And thank you Amazon for making it possible at only $400.00. Yes you have to shop around, but I would have to admit in hindsight I would have been willing to spend twice that if I had too.
1573225517|4.0|I absolutely loved the beginning of this book! It sucked me in right away and didn't let up for the whole first part. However, though I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole, the second part of the book didn't have quite the same appeal for me that the first part did.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Rob's (the main character's) perspective on relationships and life in general. He's quite insecure in many ways, but it's easy to relate to his thoughts and feelings, especially when he puts such a humorous twist on things. I really loved reading about the dynamic of the record shop and his employees. The guys he works with are just classic characters, the type of guys you feel like you know.<br /><br />The ending was a little cheesy for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed the book and I'm planning to read Hornby's other novels. There are so many others to choose from, I don't know where to start!
1594202842|1.0|As a person of mixed ethnic background (Chinese and Caucasian), my opinion is this:    You know what happens when you raise children to judge their efforts by test scores?  They do anything to get test scores.  So is there any question why there is rampant cheating in China's higher ed?  According to the NYTimes, Even Chinese scholarly research is tainted.  (According to them no Chinese citizen has even won a scientific Nobel prize.)  Source: NYTimes, \\"Rampant Fraud Threat to China's Brisk Ascent\\" (Oct 6, 2010)    You know what happens when you raise children to play music like sweatshop workers?  They play music like machines.  They may not inspire emotion from audiences, but maybe they will inspire jealousy of their technical proficiency from nearby mothers.  Of course, there are many many people of Chinese nationality and ethnicity who are wonderful musicians (Lang Lang is certainly not missing expressivity in his playing) but this is IN SPITE of the rigidity of these practices, not DUE to them.    This approach to education and life breeds and rewards performance, measured in metrics.  Just like Wall-street rewards performance, measured in (quarterly) metrics.  Look where they've lead us to.  Is that really the best we can do?
0671027344|5.0|It took me awhile to get used to the simplistic language in this novel. The whole book is written in the form of letters to an unknown recipient, and I don't know whether the flow of the language improved as the book progressed, or if it just felt that way as you got more comfortable with the style of the writing. Either way, the more I read, the more I fell in love with the protagonist, Charlie. He's a sweet kid, just starting high school. This is a coming-of-age story that's at the young-adult reading level, but it's chuck full of recommendations of Charlie's favorite books and authors (most at an advanced reading level for most people Charlie's age). I found that I have read or am planning to read every book mentioned in this novel. It just so happens that Charlie and I have very similar taste in books, and possibly that is what I like best about his character.<br /><br />I feel like I know Charlie, and I feel like he's going to be a part of me for the rest of my life, like so many characters whom I really identify with. That's the mark of a great character, and a great book.
B001NFTZPM|5.0|its batman what else needs to be said if you haven't seen the movie dont buy this rent it then make your decision some people like it (very very few) some hate it, but still some do the dvd holder it comes in is very unique the price is an average price not all that great you pay the same thing going to a store and getting it bc of the shipping and handling otherwise we had it within about a week
030746363X|5.0|ive been following tim for a long time and i have to say that i was super excited when i first heard about this project. but to be perfectly honest, is surpassed even my wildest expectations. its easy to read, fun and spot on. my only complaint is that it wasnt longer! after reading the entire thing, i could easily have enjoyed sat down and read it agin. so i did. and i continue to go back and reference it again and again. thanks tim. keep up the god work. and let me know if you need someone to experiment on!
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|This isn't really a movie, it's a collection of different videos put together. I bought it for my little brother who is a HUGE MJ fan for Christmas, and he said he didn't need anything else.

1594202842|4.0|I am a Chinese mom, who has lived in the USA for 10 years. My husband and I have two beautiful young kids.     I have to say that Amy reinforced the stereotyping of Chinese parents at its worst in her book. I believe she made it sensational and extreme to promote her book.  During the past two weeks, a few popular sites for Chinese overseas, especially those in the USA, had been talking about her article in Wall Street Journal. I am certain that 99% of them said Amy's method is way too extreme; They were shocked and taken aback like many westerners. To couple with that, they felt a pity that Amy damaged Chinese parents' image so badly although she said she used the term loosely.    However, Amy does have a compelling point. As a Chinese mom in the USA, 85% of time I am a \\"western mom,\\" who always praises my kids anytime anywhere for anything they try and set my ground rules at the same time. 15% of time when I wanted to be stricter, many times it is just constructive feedback and recommendation, my kids are so \\"vulnerable\\" that they tell me \\"You are hurting my feelings...you are mean...you are not my friend... My teacher never says a bad word to me...\\"     Sometimes, I feel that the American's overly cheesy ways of  nurturing kids' self-esteem doesn't help building their self-esteem for the long run. To couple with Amy, I think self-esteem should come from inner confidence, and \\"harsh education,\\" hand in hand with positive encouragement, is part of the process to help kids get up after failure, reflect, discover, and move forward. That said, isn't this the same philosophy in the spirit of sports in the USA? If so, why is it missing in raising our kids for academic excellence and future work?     To sum up, my kids play violin and piano, and they also play basketball and video games with strict stipulations. I belong to those 99% of Chinese who think Amy went to extreme and won't raise my kids her way. However, it is good to have a book for parents to reflect and find a balance.

1400079144|5.0|I am not sure why all of the mediocre reviews.  I enjoyed this book as much if not more than The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  A great page turner.
0142501123|5.0|I LOVE the rhymes of Donaldson.  They are simple and provide a cadence that my little one (only age 7 months) enjoys from start to finish.  The illustrations are cartoonish, fun, and colorful.  I highly recommend this author.
B000026OW3|5.0|This is such a great collection of recordings. I had most of these recording back in the day on LP, and again soon after their first release individually on CD. I love to hear Rubinstein play Chopin. Fine recordings, and now an unbeatable value.<br /><br />My quibble is that this set is a cardboard sleeve containing three bulky multi-CD jewel boxes, just as you would find in 1991, not the more compact format of the recent RCA 'Complete Collections.'<br /><br />Great music, great performances, very good recording and notes (I can imagine something more lavish and wonderful, but anyway...)

0765356147|5.0|This is the third and final book in the Mistborn Trilogy.  It was a wonderful conclusion to this epic fantasy and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Elend and Vin have left the city of Luthadel to find the remaining hidden caches of the Lord Ruler in hopes that these caches will give some hints as to how to save the land.  The mists that have been consuming the land are getting worse and claiming more lives every day.  But it is the falling Ash that will be the end of the people, as it covers the land and blocks out the sun things are getting more and more desperate.  Elend, Vin, and their crew are up for their greatest challenge yet...how do you stop a God of Ruin from destroying your world?<br /><br />If you liked the first two books you will enjoy this one.  Many of the small events that didn't quite make sense in the first books are all drawn together in this book.  There is a lot of war, strategy, and explanation behind the origins of the metal based magics.  We also get a lot of explanation into how the different races were created.  The theme that seems to underlay this book is one of faith; faith in each other and in our beliefs.<br /><br />There is significantly less characterization in this book and the reader is switched between four or five different points of view throughout the story.  This doesn't detract from the story though, although the book does get a bit slow mid-way through it quickly picks up pace again.  In the end this book features Spook and Sazed more than Vin and Elend, although Vin and Elend still play prominent roles throughout.<br /><br />All in all it tied up the series nicely.  The plot kept me guessing and took twists and turns that were unexpected, which was refreshing.  The way everything tied together was masterful and intricate.  Sanderson is an excellent writer and this book shows that.  The ending was definitely bittersweet and may bring on a few tears and sniffles.<br /><br />Overall another exceptional book by Sanderson.  I look forward to reading more books from him in the future!  I have [[ASIN:0765326353 The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive)]] on my shelf waiting for me to pick it up.in the future!

B002SJIO5E|4.0|I see a lot of reviews that comment on the movie District 9 itself. However I believe that the reviews should be talking about the Blu-ray disc itself and not the content of the movie. I have a 32\\" TV and the blu-ray quality looks great on it. There is no grain and the movie looks like what it's suppose to look like: High-Definition.<br /><br />The humans look sharp and the color is well defined on the edges. The prawns (the aliens in the movies) stand out because of the higher detail that the Bluray Disc ensues.<br />I can't comment on the audio because I had to listen through my crappy TV speakers but it's suppose to default to lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.
B002RN5I3M|5.0|At first I dreaded reading this book due to the thickness of it and the time period that it was set in. They say never judge a book by it's cover, which proved very true. I started reading this book and really never wanted to put it down from start to finish. The story was beautifully woven as were the characters. Ken Follet made you feel as if the characters were right in front of you and you were getting to know them as if they were your close friends. The book touched upond a lot of different behaviours and ideas which we can relate to what's actually going on in today's world. I highly recommend that any advid reader pick up this book and try just the first 10 pages and see if you don't get hooked on it.
0790729369|5.0|My husband loves this movie and that is why I purchased it.  I can not speak for myself because I have not watched it completely yet.  Considering the fact that he loves Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, etal action packed movies,for him to love this movie....IT HAS TO BE REALLY GOOD!!!

B000002TWN|4.0|If it wasn't for me reading a VIBE magazine and noticing that this is one of the must-haves of my album collection, I wouldn't have this D'Angelo album.<br /><br />This album is explicit. The booklet features its lyrics. The songs on \\"Brown Sugar\\" are mellow, featuring Jazz elements and luring falsetto vocals at times. My initial experience with the album was impatient because I didn't like the first 5 tracks, but they grew on me. The worst track is \\"[...], Damn, [...].\\" Other than that, you get a groovier cover of Smokie Robinson's hit \\"Cruisin'\\" and a couple of optimistic tracks (\\"Alright\\" & \\"When We Get By\\"). \\"Higher\\" is elements of Gospel in it. All the other songs are lovely and decent. Another problem is that there's unnecessary repition towards the ending of selected songs, making this album longer than it had to be.<br /><br />I'd say the best track on this album is \\"Smooth.\\" That VIBE suggestion to have this album did not go in vain.
B004529NKM|5.0|I just love this movie!! The story line is great and I love how they connect each of the movies into each other ^__^
B00006F1IJ|5.0|One of my favorite Acoustic Alchemy CD's. I never get tired of it. Unfortunately, I wasn't familiar with their music while Nick Webb was alive and this album was produced but have seen the band numerous times and Miles Gilderdale certainly does justice to the old songs on his steel stringed guitar and am thankful that Greg found him and kept the band going. Grab this CD and then go see them live. You won't be disappointed!

B001MSMULG|4.0|If you're a fan of Daniel Silva and his Israeli Massad agent-assassin Gabriel Allon, then you've probably read \\"The Kill Artist,\\" the first in this venerable series.  But if you're not, is there a better place to start?<br /><br />The story starts with a flashback to Vienna where Allon's son is murdered, and his wife irreparably damaged, in a Palestinian car bombing in revenge for Allon's role in tracking down and killing the perpetrators of the Black September massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Allon, now 40ish, has been retired for over a decade, having returned to his sedentary life as a much sought-after restorer of fine art.  Meanwhile, Gabriel's former boss, the bluntly efficient Ari Shamron, has been called back into service by Israel's prime minister as a shadow leader in an attempt to rescue a failing and embarrassed intelligence service.  But when Israel's ambassador to France is brutally assassinated in France, followed by the murder of an Israeli sympathizer and his wife in Amsterdam, Shamron locates Allon in his studio on a remote English studio.  Though reluctant to return to the life that cost him his family, Gabriel reluctantly concedes, driven by Shamron's belief that Allon's Palestinian nemeses, the illusive Tariq, masterminded the killings in Paris and Amsterdam.  Allon teams up with former partner and lover Jacqueline Delacroix, a fashion model whose grandparents were victims of the Holocaust.  This leads to a predictably suspenseful and action-packed thriller rich in spy-craft, while shedding scattered rays of light on the hate and atrocities that serve as policy in the Middle East.<br /><br />One would argue that John LeCarre is the master of modern espionage fiction, but about the time Silva was concocting Gabriel Allon, LeCarre was forgetting which side of the Cold War he was on, replacing classics featuring George Smiley and \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" with cheap leftish political rants.  Fortunately, Silva was there to fill the void, crafting authentic tales of the dangers, politics, valor and treachery of 21st Century espionage.<br /><br />Having said all that, \\"The Kill Artist\\" is far from the best book in the series.  While is does its work in setting up characters and settings for subsequent novels, it lacks the intriguing \\"Mission Impossible-like\\" mechanizations of the tales that follow, and in spots bogs down in Allon's moodiness and guilt.  Notwithstanding, this is a fast and entertaining read, spiced with enough insight and subject authority to add credibility and sobriety as balance to the fun, along with a neat little twist that I never saw coming.  Give this one a try.the void, crafting authentic tales of the dangers, politics, valor and treachery of 21st Century espionage.

0316098337|5.0|This book was amazing. It was difficult getting used to the narration coming from a five-year-old, but you get used to it. What an imaginative way to tell this heart breaking story. Don't be convinced by poor reviews. This book was one you will pick up and not be able to put down!

B003YK42LQ|4.0|It's hard to live up to the last two albums. Don't think it is better than either of those but is a good cd with some great songs. Worth the purchase if you like the Kings.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book was a little disappointing for me.  After multiple recommendations from friends I decided to read it.  The first 100 pages or so was VERY slow.  It did get more interesting after that but I found there to be A LOT of extra information that I didn't really need.  I finished this book but will not be reading the other two.
0553212419|5.0|All of the first part of the novels and short stories. Great compact size and all of the great stories. The second volume has the remaining stories.
0525951652|4.0|You know a book is good when, after almost a 1000 pages, you are ready to read book 2!  I really liked this book.  I wouldn't put it in my top 10 books to take to a deserted island, but if I could take 20 books, it would be in my sea bag!  Pillars of the Earth and World Without End WOULD be in my top ten.  These 3 books are the only ones that I've read by Ken Follett.    After finishing Fall of Giants, I've actually looked into reading some of his others'.  And isn't that what an Author is supposed to do?  Hook you so that you want to read his other books?  In my opinion, this book is a success and I look forward to reading the next 2.
1563894696|5.0|A fantastic year 2 tale, The Long Halloween is one of the greatest batman novels ever published. It delves deep into the character of Batman and tells one of his greatest stories, and one of his greatest tragedies. It seems to be overlooked nowadays, but Batman was published as being the world's greatest detective, and this book proves it. It takes the Dark Knight back to his noir roots and I loved every second of it. The twist at the end will have your head spinning. The mystery is one thing, but the real gem in here is Harvey Dent's transition into two face. I haven't seen it done better. It is handled wonderfully and you can really believe it.     The art is great. It may not be my taste, but it suits the style of the story fantastically well. There are lots of dark panels and shadows, it is a great thing to look at. The one thing I will complain about is that the pages aren't your typical comic-book fasion. It isn't the glossy pages we're used to, but this it doesn't even come close to spoiling this fantastic read. It would be nice to get a reprint of the book with the glossy pages though, but anyways...    Batman: The Long Halloween is a must read for any Batfan. I recommend this as a follow up to the greatest batman novel ever written, Batman Year One, but taken in it's own right it is a fantastic story that is timeless as the batman character.    10/10

0439023491|3.0|Only took 3 nights (and that's not full nights) to read this.  Again, Collins creates a fast and interesting read.  I didn't find any revelations in it - a middle book leading to an end.  However it was good.  I know one thing - I cannot seem to place Katniss and this group of kids in the teenager realm.  I see them more as 20something adults. I realize they were raised in a situation that dictated their mental age to be further along than physical age but still, this is hard to grasp for me.  The words, actions, constant evaluation & analytical mind of Katniss is compelling but way over 16 yrs of age.<br /><br />Does anyone else feel sorry for Peeta??  God I'd like to have a man like him, so deeply and fully devoted.  Peeta is a loving, sweet soul, and true to love no matter the end.  And I think Peeta deserves a break dammit.
0312944926|1.0|I listen to books on my daily commute and thought I'd give this a try.  After the first day (2 hours) I told my wife (who also listens on her commute) not to bother with it.  But I stuck it out.  I should have taken my own advise.  The further along it went the more predictable and annoying it got.  Was he trying to add to the drama by breaking up the last \\"scene\\" into what seemed like a 20 chapters.  Maybe while reading it isn't that bad as you can just read through the breaks. But having \\"Chapter XXX\\" read yo you every few minutes really destroys the flow - what little there was.      Just like Da Vinchi Code the \\"puzzles\\" were pathetically easy as he basically throws the answer at you and you spend half the book wondering why none of the \\"genius\\" characters can figure it out.      I should have known better.  Dan Brown isn't very creative and likes to just make up stuff rather than researching to at least get it close.  The story had potential but wasn't executed with any skill.
B000FA5QEK|1.0|This book was really annoying to read. He lectures the reader by thinking back to how he saw the world as a 7th grader and by retelling stories his \\"other dad\\" (his 7 yr old friend's dad) told him about money. The lessons are oversimplified and the stories are awful combination of overly exaggerated while still excruciatingly boring. I would hate to have to sit through a lecture or a meal with this guy. From reading the book, I get the impression that it would be like watching a stupid old man lecture an little kid about how his education is useless and how smart people learn financial awareness and get rich, while all the while the kid knows the old man just got rich on a stroke of luck and then rode it out the rest of his life. Awful. Awful.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|Check your region on your DVD player before ordering - the US version is lackluster at best, and was not printed in large quantity. If you have a regionless DVD player, go with that option)<br /><br />Big Brother is one of those things that seems to live large overseas. And it was indeed living large on this set - quite a bit larger than most shows the U.S. has. People were outside the big Brother home waiting to catch a glimpse of their stars, wanting to see firsthand what ejection looked like. Inside there is a bubble of sorts, cameras and people living much like termites in the crawlspaces, filming and watching and servinv up whatever people want. A sickness has been travelling outside too, and this sickness seems to be getting worse. People are not exactly dying and, if you believe the hype, they are coming back from the dead. No worries, however, because Big Brother will continue - or maybe not.<br /><br />This originally aired a six pieces to a puzzle. They were lovely too, and they made me happy. In fact, when it comes to zombas (calling 'em zombies, but more like infected, really) and the way things happen, a lovely little fallout appeared on the reality TV horizon. It was the undead massing outside of the studios, ready to take people with them. I liked this alot, both on a personal level and on a zombie loving level, enjoying what might happen. You have FAST zombies and they have people trapped, ready to feed them to the - well, themselves. The wonder of that is that the people didn't want to fall over and dying. No, some wanted to fight.<br /><br />When it comes to these fighters, there are differences in them. you have the housemates a girlfriend and boyfriend tandum, a boss, as well as others being focused on. They are all different and they all bring something that the others do not have. Sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad but it always seems entertaining. I personally laughed as the housemates learned what was going on the hard way, feeling like they deserved a bit of what transpired. and the ending - it was interesting and it was bleak.<br /><br />Lastly, there are some sexy zombies involved. Some die and some don't, but all of them do try running and eating. With no mama zombie to tell them not to run with their mouths full, they go to town sometimes, tearing through everything. I personally liked them and i liked the effects because they made something nice, shocking and surprising this watcher.<br />It was a happy place.<br /><br />Anyone watching anything horror needs to watch this.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|the hunger games is a good book but in my opinion there was too much killing and dying. i especially didnt like the fact that rue dies. also the muttated dog thing went a little too far. i mean thats just weird and gross. overall i think the book was OK but kinda violent. i wouldnt recommend it for any one under at least 9.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|A lot has been said about the movies plot.  The 3d is very good at some places in the movie and good during others.  Worth a view...
0061906220|5.0|The illustrations are an understated form of hilarity, which I really enjoyed (you can just see this hippy-like attitude dripping off that cat) and the moral of the story itself is a great one.  Make lemonade out of lemons, and that is exactly what Pete the cat does, getting his shoes dirtier and dirtier yet loving them all the more for it.  Who doesn't love red shoes!  I don't know about wet ones, but like Pete says; it's all good.  Pete is the supreme optimist, putting a positive spin on any mishap he may encounter.  Will Pete's day be spoiled?  GOODNESS NO!  Now that is a message I want my kids to take home with them!  This book has it all; it's spunky from the printed words to the unique pictures.  It's one of my favorite `recent purchases'.

015204907X|3.0|I don't really get this book.  The whimsical illustrations aside, I found myself not really caring about that elusive green sheep; like at all.  Sure, this is not a book for me, but for my daughter, but still...I failed to see the point.  The types of sheep presented range from colorful sheep to `bed sheep' (why not `sleepy sheep') and `scared sheep', and everything in between `sheep', but when we finally find that green sheep it isn't anything wonderful or exciting.  I kind of expected the sheep to be hidden throughout the book, or to have his reveal be something fun but in the end he's just...sleeping behind a bush.  Oh well, like I mentioned, the illustrations are pretty darn cute and the comparisons between opposites made (but never enforced) could help children to learn and put things together for themselves, but the overall impression I get of this book is rather apathetic.  There are plenty of better written children's books to choose from.
0312430000|5.0|Hundreds of thousands of people die every year from surgeries gone wrong. While surgeries are never truly \\"routine\\" and unexpected things do happen, some errors are very preventable.<br /><br />A surgeon by profession, Atul Gawande was part of the team assembled by the World Health Organization (WHO) to look at the prevalence of surgery errors. They heard accounts from other surgeons - those that operated in high-tech hospitals of the developed countries and others from the developing countries that lacked adequate resources, training, personnel, and so on.<br /><br />What they found was that errors happened everywhere, and no amount of technology or pharmaceuticals could prevent them. In fact, errors happened most often due to human error, due to routine tasks that were forgotten while focusing on the more complicated problems at hand. This conclusion led to the development of a simple checklist that was then tested at participating hospitals around the world. The results were quite surprising, even to Gawande.<br /><br />Checklist Manifesto is Gawande's account of the development of the surgical checklist, but it's also so much more. He discusses and compares checklists used by a variety of professionals, from pilots who heavily rely on checklists, to financiers who use checklists to make calculated investment decisions. More importantly, Gawande makes a convincing argument in favor of checklists. Our world is complicated and our skills are getting more and more specialized, causing seemingly unimportant and routine tasks to fall through the cracks. That is where checklists come in.<br /><br />Checklist Manifesto has been a true inspiration, and I have since made checklists for the routine tasks in my life: packing for travel, making professional Power Point presentations, preparing for holidays, etc. Having well thought lists to guide me through these common situations definitely definitely makes my life less stressful!
B002QW7ALM|1.0|This movie had such horrible acting from most of the cast which really sealed the deal for being one of the worst movies ever.  The storyline was not that great either it was like they couldn't decide what the storylien eas, the captain or the creatures because there is still no explanation for the creatures to be there in the first place.  Thank goodness i didn't waste my money at the movie theatre, it is bad enough i wasted two hours of my time watching it at home. Most of the movie you wonder if the director and writers were on LCD or something. It was just full of two much of everythign to make it any good which is why I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  There is nothing good about this film so avoid at all costs
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Awesome headset! Sound quality is superb when gaming late at night. Microphone is pretty good. Setting up is easy with PS3 and mac/pc. I was able to kill two birds with one stone with this headset, gaming and voice chat on my mac and pc. Sound sometimes cracks but not very often.(could be my cables). And all the cables can be a pain sometimes. But I am a casual gamer so these definitely exceed my standards. If you are contemplating on getting these or the tritton ax 180s, get these. It is so worth the extra 10 bucks. Much more comfortable, sound quality is better, more full and vibrant, in my opinion, structure/sturdiness and functionality, and design... Not too mention you will be sound whoring like a boss!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|This is a thriller in the old fashion sense of the word.  Many people know about the Zodiac and the terrible crimes he committed. This film does an excellent job about keeping the reader guessing about who is and who isn't the killer.  It also does a great job of showing us how the police evolved into catching him and for those who've read the book this was based on we learn that the Zodiac case is what lead to many of the criminal procedures that resulted in the arrest of Ted Bundy and other serial killers.     The film is well cast and well acted.  I think one point that was made in one of the reviews I have read about this film is that it catches the vibe of 1970's San Francisco without becoming a silly kitsch piece. The acting is exceptional and it is great to see Anthony Edwards back after a long time off since he left ER. The film works because it has actors large and small playing great roles. There are some tense and disturbing segments as Fichner does not wish to portray Zodiac as anything less than an evil person.     One caveat I should offer is that the closing credits make it sound like the DNA did not match Arthur Leigh Allan.  That is not quite true.  The sample had degraded so much that a conclusive match, great than 95% could not be made. Were Allan still alive another sample could have been easily obtained and many believe that he was in fact the Zodiac.  But chalk that one up to poetic license.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Incredible album and I must say their best since the reunion.  Has more quality tracks than brave new world and doesn't have an excessive amount of long epics that plague the latest 2 albums.  Montsegur, rainmaker and paschendale are absolute classics.  But as other reviews have said it doesn't equal the 80's maiden albums but this one sure comes the closest....so far???
1594202842|5.0|\\"Battle Hymn...\\" is  funny, wise and wonderful.  This is about a mother who believes her daughters are capable of excellence  - if they work hard enough and if she works hard enough to make them do it.  The combination of her faith in her daughters, her obvious deep love for  them and her willingness to give them that most precious gift of herself - her time and energy, enable the girls to achieve mastery at the piano and violin and to be the best they can be at everything they engage in. I think a point that most of the reviewers miss is that there is a big difference in just being strict and demanding and \\"forcing\\" your children to work, while you yourself are watching and criticizing from the sidelines, and being the kind of mother Ms Chua is, who is right in there. When the girls practice, she practices with them. She learns about the nuances of the music they play and the phrasing of scores that enable her to coach her daughters measure by measure. She drives them long distances to the best teachers. She cheers them at competitions. She is above all, there for them always.  In the book she describes a serious illness that hits a family member. With her characteristic optimism and devotion, she plunges in, never gives in to despair and is effective and loving in giving true help. One of the interesting concepts I found in the book is the whole issue of happiness. Most people think happiness is something to strive for. The \\"pursuit of happiness\\" is built into our national identity. Parents tell their children to do what they love. Amy Chua believes that happiness is a fringe benefit of doing things well, of working hard, and that pursuing happiness per se is fruitless. Another of the many pleasures of this book for me is the glimpses of what is involved in musical performance, not only the technical skills which require so much practice, but the feelings a musician must communicate through the music. There is an absolutely marvelous section on how Sophia, the elder daughter who is a pianist, learns a piece from Prokofiev's  Romeo and Juliet,  \\"Juliet as a Young Girl\\"  in preparation for Carnegie Hall, how she must blend technique and imagination. Amy Chua writes with humor and unflinching honesty and self-awareness and the book is really a page-turner.

B0035G9ABQ|3.0|You can't really blame Damon Albarn for making a record like Plastic Beach. Already deep into a career with a legendary band (Blur) and head of a perfectly successful pop side project (Gorillaz), I imagine him lounging in some hip downtown condo, surrounded by musical toys and recording equipment. He can work with nearly any producer he wants and can call up almost any artist for a collaboration. He lives in arguably the best candy store ever - full of sweet, available talent and everything needed to make a record. And, as his Gorillaz project has grown, so has his comfort with experimenting, here making a record that feels like one man's very eccentric version of modern pop culture.     Listing to Plastic Beach reminds me most of listening to college radio stations. A very diverse (yet also somehow cohesive in production scope) collection of forever cartoon-y songs, the album touches on so many different sounds and currently hip styles that you could almost match each track to a different artist from Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2009 list. Notably, the record features quite a bit of hip-hop influence - nothing too new for this crew. Here things seem to go even further than they did when Automator and Danger Mouse were offering production. Not only do we get somewhat obvious cameos from Mos Def, De La Soul and Bashy and Kano, but Snoop Dogg also shows up.     But, save for the Snoop offering, these aren't your usual hip-hop cameos. No, these are a true mod's version of backpacker hip-hop, meaning that the songs are loopy, dance-ready and over-produced. It's a wonder that Dizzee Rascal and The Streets don't show up, let alone Andre 3000 and Kool Keith. (Might I suggest Dose One?) Do these hip-hop tracks work for hip-hop fans, and is there enough hip-hop here for crossover influence? Hard to say. My guess is that, at best, the songs will have enough of that crossover/novelty appeal for some, yet not enough to set the mixtape circuit on fire.     Some of the other collaborations on this cameo-stuffed record don't work quite as well as the Mos Def and Bashy and Kano appearances. Bobby Womack, who guests on two songs, is something awful. My guess is that Albarn thought he'd revive the man's career in Tarantino fashion, but damn if the results aren't awful. So bad. I also found the Gruff Rhys appearance to be unnecessary, as they hardly use him and certainly don`t focus on what he does best. And Mark E. Smith?! Seriously, Mark E. Smith on a Gorillaz record?! Weird. Doesn't quite work, but it is an interesting listen. One guest who does oddly fit, however, is Lou reed. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that \\"Some Kind of Nature\\" is the best Reed track in 10 or more years.     The best cuts on the disc, for my money, are the Reed track (natch), the Mos Def cuts and, more than anything else, the five proper tracks that don't feature guests. Whenever Albarn takes center stage (and, strangely, it`s not often at all), I kind of love Plastic Beach and am tempted to take it very seriously. The no-guest tracks feel like real songs - almost weird prog-pop, even. It's great stuff, and, if the album wasn't so messy with guests and genre tourism, this would be the modern big label record.     As a whole, Plastic Beach is only decent, feeling more like a collection of iTunes one-offs than a real record. And, in that way, I suppose this album is about as modern as they come. In this age of iStore pick-your-tracklist customers, Plastic Beach is a winner. It features something for almost everyone, from obscurists to pop radio fans. For an album lover like myself, though, this is a long, bloated, anything-goes wreck of a project that I only care to hear maybe 33 percent of ever again. Had this been a similar sounding record with all Albarn vocals and maybe two or three (non-rap) guests, I think it'd stand a chance to be brilliant. But, hey, you know what they say about the kid in the candy shop.

B0037W68F4|4.0|Weeks after its release and I'm loving MGMT's strange new sophomore album, Congratulations, more with each listen. I hear the Zombies influence, a few songs even making me daydream about a Zombies/Of Montreal collaboration. The vocals sometimes remind of disco-era Mick Jagger, but only if he had a little less Mick in his Jagger. They remind my girlfriend of Prince, which I also agree with. And their songs also remind me of this and that, as does their look and general approach and appeal. They're artsy pop music historians disguised as hipsters - the price young artists pay in 2010.    All those familiarities we came to know on the band's debut, Oracular, are less obvious on Congrats. The sound here is also less instant, more clouded, expansive and odd, which led many reviewers to dismiss the record as inaccessible pop music upon its release. But wait, these songs are, for the most part, accessible as hell. Maybe not in an \\"Electric Feel\\" over-the-top sort of way, but this is definitely a poppy record full of hooks, riffs and fun, memorable moments. That the general vibe is so out there only makes the repeat button more interesting (and essential).     So are these seemingly hip kids, as so many have said, simply getting weird to be cool in the face of stardom? That's not the feeling I get. I like to think that they - a then unknown band - made an uber poppy album (Oracular) so that they could later make an album like Congrats and have people actually hear it and think about it and talk about it and argue about it. From t-ball to the majors, and it worked. And they did a fine job of making credible pop a couple of years ago, their debut standing as one of the best pop records of recent memory. But now they're artists, making exceptionally weird music that is also somehow often accessible. I actually wish the new album was less poppy and more weird. I wish there were more 10-plus minute songs and freak-out moments. Less regard for pop structure and general of-the-time appeal.    This shiny collection of left turns works because its makers are not just pop historians and perfectly capable musicians, but because, I'd suggest, the boys behind MGMT are genuinely strange people. Think 70s era Bowie. MGMT aren't the big box stars or Pitchfork heroes we once thought they would be. They're something else. They're adventurous, and this is an adventurous carnival ride of a record. I miss the extra punch producer David Fridmann offered on Oracular, but the production sound here is perfectly fine. Everything is perfectly fine - because none of it, not a single second, is predictable, boring or inauthentic. As it turns out, MGMT are the real deal; art freaks who deeply understand their craft and are pretty good at playing their instruments. With Congrats MGMT have become the rare bizarro pseudo-art band in this oversaturated Pitchfork era that deserves to release records.
B000009CEM|5.0|I personally cannot understand why this album gets so much crap from fans of the band, although many consider it to be one of the best albums in the Fear Factory catalog, and I'm in that group, sure we can hear some nu-metal influences here, but I think they work quite well, and the nu-metal influence doesn't show up THAT much, it shows the most in 'Edgecrusher' but that song is a good song, but songs like 'Shock' and 'Smasher/Devour' I hear none of that, in fact, those two tracks are two of my favorites on this album, 'Securitron (Police State 2000' 'Hi-Tech Hate' 'Obsolete' and 'Freedom or Fire' are more standout tracks on this album, and if you get the one with the bonus tracks, the cover '0-0 (Where Evil Dwells' is purely awesome, with some awesome doublebass and creepy sounding, one of my favorite cover songs, I forget who originally did it, but the cover is awesome, 'Messiah' is another complete thrasher with the bonus tracks, quite aggressive, 'Concreto' isn't bad either.    So, no, this is not Demanufacture, it is to a point, but it's far more progressive, so it's Demanufacture taken a step further, with SOME nu-metal influences, but the influences do NOT dominate the album, you can still tell it's Fear Factory for sure, they did not go Korn on this release, though some people seem to think they did, NOT BY THESE EARS!
B003162R7E|4.0|Jimi Hendrix' three proper studio albums were three of my favorite records in high school. They remain so today, strong as ever, because I have a brain. So when Legacy decided to reissue said albums with a bright new mastering job and accompanying DVDs, I was sold. Just like the recent Beatles reissues, these discs were a no-brainer must have. When I got to the record store I saw the three familiar beauties lined up, shining bright, next noticing a fourth reissue, titled First Rays of the New Rising Sun. I'd seen this disc before, many times, but always figured it was a hits or live collection or something. Hendrix, when alive, was known to be a man of taste with notably great album art ... but damn, Rays, released posthumously, is a very unsightly looking album. But, considering that Legacy decided to reissue it over Hendrix Blues or Band of Gypsys, I figured I needed to do some research on the ugly.     Sure enough, Rays wasn't the budget-priced, truck-stop-ready release I'd written it off as. Not even close. Instead, I learned that it's actually an almost proper fourth studio record - the album he was finishing when he passed in September of 1970, held aside until 1997, at which time it was compiled by Hendrix historians to the best of their ability. Now knowing this, I sped off to the store, bought it immediately and devoted what had to be at least a solid week to the very long, sometimes frustrating album.     And, sure, maybe most Hendrix fans already know about this hideous gem, but I didn't, and I suspect many don't. So I ordered the original release from Half.com, anxious to compare the mixes before writing a review (I'd originally planned to review the reissued of Are You Experienced, a record that changed my life). I found that, yes, if you own the original, you still need the reissue. It sounds twice as full and come with a stellar DVD, an essay and extensive notes on every track. It's absolutely worthwhile, especially for the hardcore Hendrix set. And if you're like me and have not yet heard Rays, get out to the store ASAP. If nothing else, you'll get a handful of classic Hendrix studio cuts and what are maybe his best recorded vocal performances ever.     I've read where some critics have called Rays a \\"logical successor to Electric Ladyland,\\" Hendrix's final proper studio release. I disagree. If anything, Rays feels like it could've been his second record, feeling more like a logical progression from the blues-rock pop of Experienced than the psychedelic and experimental sounds of Ladyland. A few songs here - notably \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dolly Dagger\\" - will be instantly familiar to many. Opener \\"Freedom,\\" despite maybe going on a bit longer than need be, sounds instantly classic. Some songs, like \\"Izabella,\\" are almost unreal. Shockingly complex enough at times that I wonder if it could even be played live. Is it possible to play guitar like that while singing? I've not seen such a thing in my 30 years.     I feel it essential to note that this isn't a perfect record. We have no idea how Hendrix would've sequenced it or what songs he may have left off or continued to tweak and perfect. Maybe he would've added songs, we'll never know. What we do know is that four of the 17 songs were finalized, including \\"Dolly,\\" \\"Night Flying Bird,\\" \\"Ezy Ryder\\" and \\"My Friend.\\" All these are fantastic - classics, even. The other 14 cuts sound, compared to the average song, pretty damn final. But who's to say with Hendrix, a noted studio perfectionist? A few tracks aren't quite at the A+ level we've come to know Jimi for, but there's a very solid 10-11 song set here that fits nicely with his other proper studio records. And damn if the new mastering job isn't wonderful, as are the essays and DVD. Essential stuff, made perfect for falling in love all over again with one of the all-time greatest.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|\\"The breakthrough in medical science came in 1952  Doctors could now cure the previous incurable  By 1967, life expectancy passed 100 years\\"    And so begins Never Let Me Go, a downbeat adaptation of a book I've never had the pleasure of reading by Kazuo Ishiguro. This film is an exercise in understatement; rarely have I seen a film that's so emotional and yet avoids bravado and manages to depict these emotions in such a gentle way. This is no straight-forward drama and there's an unconventional element to the story that I feel would be best to keep secret from the potential viewer. Unfortunately, it's difficult to discuss/critique the film without disclosing that element. With that said, the secret comes out very early into the movie so don't feel that I'm spoiling anything for you.    Besides a brief opening scene, the film opens in 1978 at a boarding school called Hailsham. While headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) gives her daily announcement to the students, it becomes clear that Hailsham is not the typical boarding school. The health of the students is greatly important and the students' existence is a sheltered one, completely cut off from the world outside the boundaries of the school. Students are at the age where romantic ideals begin to blossom and young Kathy H. takes a liking to a boy named Tommy. Those wondering what the purpose of Hailsham is don't have to wait very long as a disenchanted guardian named Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) soon enlightens them that their purpose is to grow up and donate their vital organs before their \\"short-life\\" will be completed. As this chapter of the film comes to a close, Kathy watches her friend Ruth and Tommy grow close. These childhood scenes are handled with great sentiment, but also with great austerity.    The next two segments take place in 1985 and then 1994, where Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield take on the roles of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. This second part takes place at The Cottages,where the three Hailsham students have their first contact with the outside world and their sexual awareness comes to full fruition. It's here that we learn a bit more about the students' purpose, as well as watch some characters struggle with their already pre-determined fate. \\"Completion,\\" the third part of the film is arguably the most tragic where hope and optimism leads to sad acceptance.     Despite being only 103 minutes, Never Let Me Go manages to tell a pretty full story and show characters completely evolve from naïve children to naïve, but optimistic adults. Watching these characters evolve is heartbreaking and the way the film burrows into your emotional center with such quiet nuance is astounding. Rarely do elements fall together so perfectly in a film that they completely immerse you in what you're watching and in it's own a soft, sad way this film absolutely casts a spell. This is not a film that will appeal to a wide audience, but I personally found it to be quite masterful.    The film's score by Rachel Portman is one of the most effective musical scores I've heard in 2010. The music evokes such sadness it becomes a key element to the success of the film as a whole. The picturesque photography by cinematographer Adam Kimmel is poetic and beautiful, static yet graceful and adds an additional level of poignancy that the screenwriter could not have foreseen.     As for acting, we get to watch three very promising young actors do some wonderful work. The most surprising is Keira Knightley who gives such an honest portrayal I forgot I was watching Knightley. Ditching any glamor or sharp-tongued wit, she plays the insecure, jealous, and frightened Ruth marvelously. Garfield continues to establish himself as one of the strongest up-and-coming actors at work today. He gets such pathos out of his mix of sadness and optimism; Watch Garfield's face as he learns the truth about deferrals and the way his expression quietly goes from hopefulness to helplessness. Contrast this with his acclaimed performance in The Social Network and you have an actor building an impressive body of work. Meanwhile, Carey Mulligan continues to prove that she is something special and refreshing in the film industry. What an elegant, immensely talented actress she is and her work here is brilliant. Mulligan is a true actress, something Hollywood is lacking these days and her performance here is so powerful, yet completely low-key.     There is something so brave and unexpected about taking a premise rooted in science-fiction and, in doing so, making a deeply moving human drama and a profound, meditative statement on life, death, and humanity. Again, I've never read the book but I wonder if the book is as much of an emotional journey as the film. I would never call this film \\"uplifting,\\" but the tragic, beautiful ending is one of the most life-affirming endings of 2010.     Never Let Me Go had much more of an impact the second time I watched it. It seemed more heartbreaking, more poignant, more powerful, and more beautiful than it did the first time. It's a deeply emotional viewing experience that gripped my emotions in a way few films have. While highly praised by some critics, it's been largely overshadowed by other films of 2010.  Never Let Me Go is as elegant, thought-provoking, and moving as films can get. It's undoubtedly one of the best films of 2010.    GRADE: A
B002ZIAC4O|3.0|Kieran \\"Four Tet\\" Hebden has released a giant stack of records over the last 10 years. EPs, singles, remix records, proper Four Tet albums, limited edition 12\\" projects, jazz fusion collaborations with Steve Reid, DJ records and more. His best work, 2003's Rounds, is rightfully considered to be one of the essential electronic albums ever recorded. All that said, Hebden has only released two full-blown Four Tet records since the star-turning Rounds: 2005's Everything Ecstatic (similar to Rounds, though not nearly as deep or affecting); and the just released There Is Love in You, the fifth proper release under the Four Tet name.     Hebden's 2008 EP, the much anticipated Ringer, signaled a change in direction for the Four Tet moniker. Where he had once utilized very organic, cut-and-paste sounding production style similar to the work of DJ Shadow and other hip-hop and trip-hop inspired producers, Hebden here began incorporation quite a bit of live instrumentation, focused mostly on keyboards that brought to mind 80s-era film scores. Cheesy, that's the word. So, no, the excitement for There Is Love in You was not exactly notable; Ringer wasn't a bad record, per se, but it offered little of the repeat value of Rounds, Everything Ecstatic or even the Steve Reid records.     There Is Love in You isn't the letdown Ringer was but it's also not the major triumph Rounds was. Does Hebden put on a clinic as far as electronic production goes? Absolutely. But that doesn't necessarily mean that he's released a triumphant record. In fact, Love feels a bit too mulled over at all times. Unnatural, even. Once described by critics as the perfect mix of organic and programmed, Hebden's work has lost its organic touch, in doing so, losing much of its repeat value. Save for a couple of tracks, most of the material here is a mix of epically produced IDM and ... well ... background music.     Does the new sound make Love a bad record? No, of course not. But it seems that the days of Four Tet making records that you can party to, sleep to, read to, get busy to and, most importantly, lose yourself in, are gone. Instead, we get one of the most deeply produced background records ever. A Tangerine Dream for a new generation of ears. Nothing wrong with that.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Winter's Bone is one of those independent features released every year that gets massive notice from the general public and ends up on nearly every year-end list of best films. It takes place in the rural Ozark Mountains, showing a side of America we don't often see in films and uses gritty, unflinching realism in this stark setting while telling a genuinely exciting, plausible story.       Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is 17-years-old and responsible for the well-being of herself and her two younger siblings. Her mother sits in a catatonic state and her father Jessup, a meth cook, isn't around much. One day Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) arrives to explain that Jessup has skipped bail and has put the family's house up for his bond. Ree vows to find him, but she lives in a town where almost everyone is involved in drugs and hardly anyone wants to talk. The effects of meth are apparent all through the area in both the rundown look of the houses and the weary, worn faces of its population. When even Jessup's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) refuses to help her find him, Ree must navigate her way through the male-dominated realm of the backwoods to find her father.    Although it takes place in the \\"backwoods,\\" Winter's Bone avoids the stereotypes that generally characterize people in these areas although it seems that nearly every character is related in some way. The film demonstrates very strong characterization in that it doesn't stereotype these people but it doesn't beautify them either. All of the actors look and sound realistic for this setting. Even Ree, the determined protagonist, has only an average vocabulary and though pretty, looks like a girl that has more important things to do than worry about her appearance. Ree is one of the strongest female protagonists to grace the screen in some time. She's strong-willed and determined, but appropriately vulnerable. Roles like this one don't often come along for women, but Lawrence really makes Ree come convincing. Sheseems to really understand this character and she plays her with the perfect amount of bravado and realism.    The film is really well-made, drawing you into the setting with the beautiful photography of absolute poverty-stricken areas and the use of a monotonous color palette. The film uses atmosphere very well to create a mood, but it doesn't emphasize atmosphere over plot. It's a family-drama that also operates as a mystery/suspense film. While I found the atmosphere created by director Debra Granik spellbinding, the plot is very suspenseful and very thrilling.    There is one thing that I feel really elevates the greatness of this film that I've deliberately avoided mentioning and that is the revelatory performance by John Hawkes. I'm familiar Hawkes from several movies and television shows, but not until Winter's Bone did I realize the extent of this man's ability. I've read reviews where people will remark that they didn't even recognize an actor until the credits rolled, but I've never personally experienced that until seeing this film. Hawkes proves he's a chameleon and an actor capable of giving a dynamite performance. While this performance hasn't gone completely unnoticed by critics and audiences, it's been widely overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence.  Hawkes not only brings a great amount of energy to the screen every time he's on it but he takes this character from despicable to ultimately likable. The scene between Teardrop and Sheriff Baskin is one of the most intense scenes of any film from 2010. It is this scene that summarizes why I think Hawkes should win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It's such an intense, captivating performance. When Teardrops asks the Sheriff \\"Is this gonna be our time?\\" It's a mesmerizing moment. Teardrop is a great role as written, but Hawkes brings something so powerful to it. It is Hawkes that made the biggest impression on me. While Lawrence is deserving of the overwhelming recognition she's received, I wouldn't call her performance a revelation. John Hawkes is simply that good.     Winter's Bone is an exciting, suspenseful, and enlightening piece of filmmaking that has the capability to please even the most casual film-goer. Some of the most riveting cinematic moments of 2010 occur in this film. Despite the hype, Winter's Bone is not over-hyped...It's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking, one of the best films of 2010, and it has my vote for the best supporting male performance of that year as well. This film is definitely worth your time.    GRADE: A-
B0015DROBO|4.0|For the first couple of chapters your thought is \\"This is awful\\"  but stick with it.  It is a very good book, ties into the next book and leaves you wanting to read the next one.  The characters develop well and you can easily follow them.  The only complaint would be there is too many details.  Keep in mind that this has Swedish names, etc and causes some effort with proununciation and understanding.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|After returning one that wouldn't even play the discs, Amazon sent this one out. The discs actually play but they are in the infamous baggies and shoddy packaging that is described by hundreds of reviews I've read. The case underneath the shrink wrap looks like some kid was sliding around on the floor with it. The quality is bad, low quality I can accept because I know that for the most part TNG was filmed in video - but this is VHS copies 5 times bad. I inspected the DVD in the computer and noticed that it only holds around 4GB of space at capacity, much less than a quality DVD which should be around 8GB. Also, the data was created on July 24 2010 although the set was released in 2007? I'm really disappointed in Amazon for standing behind this product. I'd rather pay twice the price to get something from a physical seller than the junk and knock-offs you get online nowadays.    Get the individual seasons instead.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|This book was quite readable and I enjoyed it. As many reviewers have mentioned, it is not a masterpiece by any stretch and wouldn't exactly receive the massive hype they play up about it from the show, but can't really expect it to be on a work of meta-fiction such as this. But kudos is definitely due to whoever was willing to ghostwrite this, it's easy to follow and catches the traits of the television characters very well, it plays out just like an episode would, I had fun with it.

1594202842|5.0|This book really spoke to me, and I know that it will touch countless others. Although I understand why some may be shocked by Chua's parenting techniques, if that is the only thing they get from reading the book, they are missing Chua's point entirely. Chua's book is not a \\"how to\\" book meant for providing parenting instruction. It is a memoir; it is a story of what she has learned and discovered in raising her children the only way she knew how: what she calls, the Chinese way. It is a story that provides insight into culture and family, and it is told with humor through the voice of a parent who loves her daughters unconditionally and knows how to make fun of herself. It is an absolutely enjoyable and illuminating read.     Like Chua's daughters, I fall under the category of \\"model minority.\\" I grew up playing hours of piano, finessing my Korean, and striving for no less than A's in school. While reading the book, I completely empathized with Sophia and Lulu. Why did I have to miss school field trips so that I could play the piano? Why were my friends rewarded for a B when my mother was asking me why I missed the one question preventing me from getting a perfect score? Even while empathizing with Chua's daughters, however, I completely understood and agreed with Amy Chua's parenting methods. Her book made me look back onto my childhood and despite the fact that I resented so much of what my mother made me do at the time, I am completely indebted to her now and appreciate her persistence and stamina.     Chua's parental practices, which might sound terribly harsh to a Westerner, represent something totally different in the Asian cultural context. The truth is, the world is a harsh place, and Chua, like my parents and countless others, is preparing her kids with \\"tough love.\\" My mother often asked me, \\"Do you think it's easy to be hard on you? I would love to be the parent who just plays with you all day. If you succeed and do well in the world, who does it benefit? Me? No, it's you.\\" My mother's tenacity in learning my coursework with me, memorizing my piano pieces, and guiding me through every step of the way has made me endlessly grateful to her. I know that I worked hard, but like Chua, my mother worked even harder and this can only be understood as a sign of their love for their children.     I am so glad that Chua has written a book that truthfully portrays the experience of growing up with Asian or what Chua dubs as \\"Chinese\\" parents. All of my Asian friends appreciate the sacrifices their parents have made for them, whether it is working round the clock in a 7-Eleven to fund their kids' college educations, shadowing their children's educational careers, or sacrificing their own professional careers to chauffeur their kids between school and extracurricular activities. Although many may have resented this parental attention at times, in the end, they have all appreciated the dedication of their parents and rather than cutting ties as soon as they turn 18, they plan on supporting their parents in their future. Chua perfectly captures this cultural style of parenting, and she does so with humor. She knows that her parenting techniques sound harsh, and she makes fun of how extreme she can be at times. Yet in every page of the book, we can catch glimpses of her love for Sophia and Lulu. For example, her music practice instructions to her daughters are filled with inside jokes and pet names. Chua's witty way of describing her trials with her daughters and her honest descriptions of her daughters' searing criticisms of her share with the public a style of parenting, that she does not argue as being the best, but as a different one, nonetheless filled with unconditional love and desire for her children to succeed and be prepared for the world outside the safety of their home. I highly recommend this fascinatingly captivating book to all parents and their grown children; it's a reminder that parental love comes in all forms.

B002HPKYH0|1.0|Unless you are blindly unaware of how you are perceived, your motivations, and your attitude towards work, Strengths 2.0 is a waste of time. The online self assessment test this book requires you to complete reveals what you already know about yourself, a free online Jung & Myers test would be equally if not more insightful.     Secondly, as a woman I believe this book dooms other women into acting the role of \\"mother figure\\" in the office environment.  My friend (who purchased the book for both of us during Christmas) received Empathy, Harmony, Includer, amongst others.  Call me stereotypical, but I believe women are more inclined to naturally demonstrate these qualities. Show me one woman with a corner office because she's generous, gets along with everyone, and makes sure no one is left out - sounds like the stereotypical matriarch, and Rath encourages it.      For women especially, if you're looking for a book that will help you at work - I would strong advise looking into other books with insight on how to \\"toughen\\" up a bit in the workplace; it is this strength which will lead to success, not being perceived (with Rath glorifying you..)as a Betty Crocker.     My personal recs: Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make by Frankel, and The Secrets of Six Figure Women by Stanny.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Saw a pre-screening at UNC-Chapel Hill, and just got my DVD copy. Assuming much didn't change between the two, as it would be hard to make anything better than it already was. Here the review:<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that this is just a movie about Facebook knows very little about film. Lack of knowledge apparently causes a lack of appreciation, but generally the reviews for this seem good so some people get it.<br /><br />Yes, the film is about the birth of Facebook, but it's what lies beneath the superficial that makes \\"The Social Network\\" a fantastic movie. The story is from pretty much the beginning of civilization: It is a tale of friendship and betrayal, above all else. The theme has been done a hundred thousand times, but using the current phenomenon of Facebook as a vehicle to deliver us to that theme is what makes the film.<br /><br />The writing is blisteringly witty, so mad props to Sorkin (whose other works I didn't appreciate much...sorry).<br /><br />Jessie Eisenberg continues to develop, which only make the comparisons to Michael Cera even more asinine. Yeah, they look kind of similar and play young and awkward male characters, but that's going to be it for Michael Cera. Once he gets a bit older, he may as well hang it up, because he lacks something that I think will keep Eisenberg around for a pretty long time: talent.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is no Leonardo Dicaprio, but this movie is a dark comedy, and JT provides the latter part of that very well. The guy has SOME talent at least, and he's not meant to be a completely serious character in this movie (obviously...).<br /><br />Andrew Garfield impressed me, and I'm looking forward to the Spider-Man reboot all of a sudden. He should be able to equal or--more likely--top Toby Maguire without too much trouble, at least I hope so.<br /><br />Armie Hammer nails his character(s), and I'm pretty impressed that he played both of them so well.<br /><br />Overall, this has to be my movie of 2010. Sorry Inception & Toy Story 3, but \\"The Social Network\\" was just too good.o good.
B001JV5BIA|4.0|If you're a horror fan and have been for many years, you probably at some point heard of writing/directing legend Wes Craven's debut film \\"Last House on the Left\\". This low-budget, extremely disturbing (for its time at the very least) 1972 horror film gave rise in various ways to many of the famous horror films that have come since, and it even recently had its own official remake, which I felt handled the overall mood/tone better but was nowhere near as harsh and real. Of course, it's hard and rare to top or even reach the same level of an original film with its remake, but it's especially hard with 70's horror, which always seems so much more real than today's horror films, in which the actors are too recognizable and attractive and the general product too polished. Anyway, this review is about the MGM Collector's Edition DVD release of the original film, though it should be mentioned that the term \\"original\\" should maybe be taken with a grain of salt, as Craven himself admits to having been greatly inspired by Bergman's \\"The Virgin Spring\\", which I have yet to see, but it did sound strikingly similar when described.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Last House on the Left\\" is fairly simple. The day before her 17th birthday party, a sweet, middle-class, girl-next-door type named Mari says goodbye to her parents in their lakeside home and heads out to a rock concert in the city with a female best-friend from the wrong side of the tracks. They decide to try and score some weed before the concert, and they unfortunately run into Junior, the son of just escaped convict Krug, while doing so. Junior lures them into the clutches of Krug and his cohorts, fellow escaped convict \\"Weasel\\", a sex fiend, and Krug's crazy girlfriend, Sadie. Now, if you don't want spoilers, you may want to skip the rest of this synopsis. However, with this film, it's probably best to know what you're getting into. Basically, the gang takes the pair of young girls out into the woods, where they humiliate, torture, rape and murder them. It's pretty graphic and brutal, probably more in how realistic it is rather than really how much is shown. We are talking top-notch, uninhibited acting here on the part of the villains and their two victims, making for a series of scenes so disturbing in their totally realistic cruelty that this film has become legendary. But, the movie doesn't end with the death of the victims, nor is it about the police catching up with them. In fact, the police are the bumbling comic relief here; to an extreme level. The twist of this film is when the killers take refuge in the home of Mari's parents. Once the parents discover whom their distressed houseguests are, \\"Last House on the Left\\" goes into revenge film mode, and it is pretty brutal. In my opinion, it tops its recent remake in this regard, and though the film is excellent in its realism and ability to \\"get to\\" the viewer, the only pleasure I could imagine anyone might gain from viewing this film is in seeing Krug and Company get their comeuppance in the final act.<br /><br />And, that's what makes \\"Last House on the Left\\" a difficult film to review. It is hard to honestly call it a bad film, though it has flaws, naturally, since we are talking about a low-budget, guerilla style, directorial-debut type film here. It has its excellent aspects. It is overall compelling, disturbing and unforgettable. At the same time, however, it is cruel and miserable. There is no joy to be had here, and really, no fun. There is comic relief spliced in throughout, not to mention an intentionally contradictory and sometimes wacky soundtrack from the film's lead baddie, David Hess (Krug), and both cause some discord among viewers (and even some of the film's actors) on the issue of whether or not they \\"work\\" within the context of the film (it almost depends on what sort of film you want this to be, but I often lean towards feeling the comic relief doesn't fit at all and the music, well, I go back and forth on the music, though it no doubt demonstrates that Mr. Hess is truly multitalented. Still, as a study of or comment on human nature, violence and society, it is a fascinating work. It invokes many emotions in the viewer, and it probably wouldn't hurt for young women to see this one when taking those steps towards a more independent lifestyle. The horror of \\"Last House on the Left\\" is that things like this truly do happen, even if they seem too horrible to imagine. There's nothing impossible about what happens to the girls in this film, and in fact, if we're to trust the news media at all, I guess this sort of thing happens every day. It's horrific, and that is why this film is so horrific. Maybe it has little value beyond presenting some of the evils in our society for our own increased awareness, but I suppose that alone makes it worthwhile, and while I find much of this film difficult to watch for just being too tragic, it`s certainly got some great performances worth revisiting too. So, no, I don't hate this one, though it's hard to say I like it. Not sure what to say. I'll just say that \\"Last House on the Left\\", initially or in certain scenes at least, is a hard watch, but you should probably try to watch it at least once.<br /><br />The collector's edition release from MGM, by the way, has some really nice extras. I would have liked a selection of trailers for the film, but we do get a fantastic audio commentary by the 3 male villain actors, some great retrospective featurettes, deleted scenes and never before seen footage. The featurettes and commentary really do a lot to improve one's appreciation of the film, so be sure to watch those. Also, if you are looking for something... sorta similar, and with the same lead baddie in a similar role, I point my finger to \\"House at the Edge of the Park\\".no doubt demonstrates that Mr. Hess is truly multitalented.

1594202842|4.0|Because this book has stirred up so much debate and that debate being so emotional I decided that I needed to read this book for myself.  It's an easy read and I read it in a day (while I let my own children watch a movie!).    I don't think this is a \\"parenting guide\\".  It's a woman who, for reasons only known to her, wrote a book about herself and her thoughts, actions and family.  Some parts of this book is comical, some parts very sad.  All of it will evoke some form of emotion.  Should you use this book as a guide about how to raise your own children, no. Do I think this book reflects the parenting style of the Chinese people, no.  Even the author herself states in the beginning that her words of \\"Western\\" and \\"Chinese\\" are used loosely.  This is just an autobiography that is creating quite a stir and she will make a load of $$ from everyone wanting to know what the book is really all about and to express their opinions.    Although when I think about it, anything that gets people talking, even heated debates, will bring about something good, something to think about.

Plus, most of all, he loved his country and let everyone know it! All who enjoyed what he gave us will miss him. This movie was a fun time. The story was great. It shows how enemies can put aside their differences for a common cause. Lots of action, horses, cowboys, and a pretty leading lady. What more can a western fan ask for??!!

0439023483|5.0|I was looking for something else to read after I got done with Twilight and the Wicked Lovely series and this fit the bill.  I absolutely loved this series.  They have suspense, romance, and a bit of the supernatural.  The author does an amazing job with character developement, visual expression and keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, she throws in a twist.  I also liked that the main character Katniss wasn't a damsel in distress.  Although she had self doubts (like anyone would) she didn't give up or wait on someone else to rescue her.  This is a great story of courage, growing up, and survival of the fittest.
030746363X|4.0|I started the 4 Hour Body plan 3 weeks ago, after I read through the ebook on my iPad. There is a lot of information to digest, but fortunately you can jump around in the book and get what you need to start. I'm happy and surprised that I lost 11 pounds and 1 and 1/2 inches around the waist since then!<br /><br />I invested in 2 kettlebells and use them according to the Monday, Wednesday, Friday, workout plan. The kettlebell swing is much tougher than I imagined. My record reps so far is 40, which is much better than the first time I attempted it!<br /><br />The reason I gave the book 4 Stars is because it's not really clear about what foods are allowed. The 5 Rules are simple, but I'm puzzled about a few foods. Supposedly dairy is not allowed, but later in the book Tim mentions that his mother eats cottage cheese. So if that's OK, wouldn't yogurt be OK? And how often can I eat cottage cheese? Are canned beets OK even though some brands have sugar?<br /><br />Also, I wish there was more information about workouts, perhaps a chapter on workouts of various levels, beginner, intermediate, advanced. I read that the minimum is doing 2 exercises, the swing and myostatic crunch. But later there's the three day workout I mentioned. And later still there's an advanced workout.<br /><br />When a 2nd edition comes out, I hope there are detailed charts of acceptable/non-acceptable foods and charts of various workouts that include the kettlebells. Perhaps the workout charts could be incorporated in a single Workout chapter, instead of workout information spread throughout the book.

B000F8O35U|1.0|I ordered this item as a Christmas present for an autistic niece who adores the Little Mermaid. Upon receipt of the DVD, I saw that the cover was in dull colors, obviously a very bad reproduction from a foreign country. I know that Disney would never allow such poor quality printing of even just the DVD cover out of their quality control. As this movie is obviously not in release now from Disney, it is too bad that their controls force the market to be contaminated with bad product such as this copy. I sent the movie onto my niece as she will be happy even with the poor quality - but the situation is discouraging to me as a consumer.
0061537969|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. At first the premise sounded a little ridiculous to me, even though I've been an animal lover all my life.  A story narrated from a dog's point of view - sounded a little crazy, but I was willing to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did because this story sucked me in. For anyone who has ever had a very strong bond with an animal, this tale will speak to you.  Enzo is such a sweet soul, and reading his story made me really miss the one and only dog I've ever owned, who passed away about 8 years ago. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels like our connection to animals is far more than just as superficial companions.
B004FECNIO|4.0|I got the Artificial Intelligence blu ray as part of some Warner Bros Blu Ray Deal in the Netherlands (region 2).     I've watched this blu ray and I compared several scenes with the dvd version. I can say that the differences are barely visible. The transfer of this blu ray has some noticeable noise that makes the movie look older than it is. Compared to the dvd there is a little bit more detail and everything including colours looks a little bit brighter. The sound of the blu ray (DTS HD Master audio) was definitely a bigger improvement, especially the orchestral parts of the soundtrack seemed to come more alive (e.g. the road to rouge city where the Rosenkavalier waltz fuses with the original soundtrack).     There are several extras but all are old and with SD quality. I believe most of them were also on the original dvd, it included: ''Creating A.I., Designing A.I., trailers, storyboards, Music of A.I.'', etc. These documentaries are snippets of 8-15 min. There was no commentary track sadly.    In short, if you want the best version of A.I. then you should buy it, but this is not the blu ray the movie deserved, so don't expect this to be an example of a glorious HD presentation.    All in all: 4 stars for the movie, 3 stars for the blu ray.
B0013527I4|3.0|When on TV the Muppet Show held a special place in family life.  In ours, kids and parents watched together.  Now, three generations watch and enjoy the DVD's.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is a great animated vid. This is the version you want. There was a crummy chopped up disney version that was released when it was shown in theaters. This is the original japanese version, but dubbed very well into english with big name actors. The animation is sophisticated and sweet by american standards. Overall, its a masterpiece. It tells the story of the last few remaining human \\"kingdoms\\" gradually being overwhelmed by the toxic jungle, unstopable giant insects - and each other. A thousand years previous, the human race destroyed itself in a single night. Nausicaa is  the main character, a very practical princess in her tiny kingdom. She seems to have a \\"way\\" with the giant insects.  The story chiefly concerns revealing how the toxic jungle and the insects evolved and why. There is a prophecy that humans and nature will be at piece again one day. That is their only hope. The toxic jungle has consumed all the land and its spores are lethal. The backdrop is the last few remaining kingdoms fighting over ancient weapons. Lots of plot turns - like any japanese tale. And as usual, there is always a small furry pet. I wonder why? Maybe this has meaning in Japan - like a spirit or soul? Anyways, You will love it. The second disc is moslty the same movie except in story boards. Interesting.
0345528581|4.0|The biggest pro of this book is that the exercises work. I am now on week 8 of the basic program, although I must admit its probably taken me about 10 or 11 weeks to get there. I'm not the most consistant exerciser. The moves are fantastic and I feel challenged enough to know it is working when I have to \\"push\\" for that final rep and the soreness the next day that accompanies it (even after 8 weeks on the program). A lot of these moves admittedly I already knew but some I didn't and he does have a few exercises I was excited to find. The best part is this book makes exercising relatively inexpensive (usually free) and easy to do in my small one bedroom apartment (although its huge compared to what I hear you get up in New York). Make no mistake - this book is for someone SERIOUS about getting into shape. The muscle soreness on a regular basis even after 7+wks on the program gets annoying and is part of the reason it is difficult to motivate myself to push for another day of excercise. He shows you ways to make stuff easier and harder, although I do wish he would show how to make the let me ups easier if your too much of a weakling, as I was, to do what is supposed to be the easiest one. I used a chair to support part of my body weight at first until I could do one actual rep on my own. All in all the excercises themselves and the beginner program that accompanies it is awesome. Challenging and effective. My best friend tells me she can see a difference in the way I look and I can feel a difference in the looseness of my jeans.    Now for the cons. There is no talk on warm ups or stretching dynamic, static or otherwise. He has a chapter that totally shoots down aerobic exercise and while I agree with the premises aerobic exercise ALONE is not going to make you fit and healthy and lose weight I strongly disagree that it is a total waste of time as he asserts. Although his routines usually get my heart pumping, especially tabattas and stappers. And the amount of protein that he and really every other body building website I visited recommends you eat is  bit excessive. I'm not a huge veggie fan but if I actually ate as much protein as he recommended 40% of my diet would be protien leaving fats and carbs to make up the rest. Now I love a good steak as much as the next person but come on... to assert Americans don't get enough protien? Seriously? I have upped my intake of protein but I'm not obessive about it. I like a good veggie now and then for variety. I am very glad he has included exercises for the lower back unlike many other websites and books I've seen. As a sufferer of back pain I'm finding these exercises are super important to keep mobile and relatively pain free.    So the bottom line is this - like many other reviewers buy this book for the exercises, they totally work and best of all are easy to do at home and even better are free! Just make sure you take the time to warm up properly and stretch afterwards and don't totally give up your cardio - or your veggies.
B00436GNVC|3.0|I really enjoyed this album, however it just was not as good as Duffy's first album rockferry. Some of the songs have a \\"retro\\" feel to them because they sounds added to make it sound like a record rather than a CD, its interesting but I would rather to hear the purity of the music. In general though it was a very enjoyable album, and I will continue to support Duffy's work.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|The amount of audio improvement varies from music to music.  In high quality recordings i.e live concerts, the space improvement is a little more noticeable.  The quality of the headphone or earphones also is a factor in how much improvement one could hear with the E7 in between the player and listener.  I would say the improvements are often harder to pinpoint when the recording is hi bit-rate and good phones are already being used with say an iPod.  In short,  all just sounded a little better and wider, with some instruments a little more audible and others sounding more like real instruments.    Testing on my Macbook Pro using USB, my lossless music sounded completely new and  much much better in balance, space, and clarity.      Personally, I got the E7 to use with a pair of monitor headphones that my iPhone and iPod are having trouble driving and the extra power from the E7 enables them to be driven more effectively.  I believe the price is about right for the improvement returned and the little better here and there eventually adds to become a more satisfying listening experience that is worth $99.
6304711905|4.0|the product, a DVD, works fine, my only complaint is that the case it was in, which was supposed to be brand new, was cracked so that the little circle knob that holds a DVD in place inside of the case, was broken, causing the DVD to slide all around the case, and potentially be scratched. other than that, the DVD works, so i suppose it's not the worst thing that could have happened.
B000031WBQ|4.0|Rubenstein is of course good.  However, I liked the Richter recording under Gramaphone.  Richter is slower in his playing it, but to me, it has more depth.  His Tchaikovsky recording is also good, but at time for me, it seems to plod along.  My favorite piano concerto is the Rachmaninoff 2nd.  And of all the different recording pianists, (Van Cliburn, Glenn Gould, Rubenstein, etc), I like the Richter one the best--listen to it all the time.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This is the best Toy Story yet....just a wonderful, wonderful movie.....we've seen it 5 or 6 times....and we  are two adults in our house.   The animators are genius!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I read about 100 reviews of various gps/heart rate monitor watches and this was by far the best. Without a doubt, its a great device, but you definitely need to spend some time going through the manual and setting it up to meet your needs. This is not difficult, but takes plenty of time. I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who is looking to improve his/her performance or anyone who loves gadgets. Fortunately, I was looking for both.    The training software is OK and I haven't spent too much time with it although I've hears that there are far better free programs that you can easily transfer the data to.     In terms of feel, it very comfortable to wear and fairly easy to see the information while you run (again you must set it up right)    The battery lasts about 2 weeks in power save mode and 8 hours in GPS mode. Really easy to charge and even easier to transfer the data to your computer via the USB ANT stick which wirelessly transfers the date.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|The last series. Jack is Jack and I am glad to have all eight volumes. They may be a collector's item some day.
B0042U94UQ|2.0|Loud. Violent. Bathroom jokes. Couldn't understand most of what Steve Carel said. No characters drew me in, very little humor. Big disappointment. We left in the middle at my kids' request!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|The music on the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.  A must for anyone who enjoys classical pieces, especially fans of the movie Pride and Prejudice.
1400079144|4.0|OK, it's a Dan Brown book, so going in you already know 3 things:    1. It will give you info on some interesting stuff you might have been curious about (in this case, the Masons, Noetics, decoding symbols)  2. It will have a somewhat cheesy plot  3. It will be quite entertaining    \\"The Lost Symbol\\" does not disappoint on any of these 3 things. I have read all of his other books, and I would put this one up there with \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"Digital Fortress.\\" Some of the revelations at the end were a bit of a letdown (really? *That's* why the CIA lady was so concerned about \\"national security\\"? seems unlikely). Some of the stuff about \\"god within\\"...well, I don't entirely agree with Brown's godless religion, but I do think he puts together an interesting and compelling story. I liked especially all the stuff with how they figure out the secret codes.
B00004X10B|5.0|This is my second Tamrac bag. My first bag is 25+ years old and still in fairly good condition (no rips or tears). Wanted a new bag for increased capacity and this bag has everything my old bags has,except loops for film cannisters (how times have change:). The construction of this bags seems better than my old one, so it will probably be the last bag I will ever need. An excellent product at a very good price.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I borrowed this from my local library and I LOVE how challenging just level one is, but my knees are saying NO WAY to the jumping jacks and the jump rope part of it. Yes I even tried wrapping my knees.  This is a great challenge and will leave you sore for days after.  I am going to have to take a break from it for a bit and do something else until my knees are feeling  better.  Not sure if it is my shoes or the floor I'm jumping on.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki is amazing. This is by far the best album I have ever bought. I expected to be disappointed with her album since I had only heard her being featured in other peoples songs but I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't stopped listening to this album since I bought it. LOVE THIS ALBUM AND LOVE NICKI!!!
B002ZG994U|2.0|The movie was 'new' and packaged, and the movie itself was good and quite funny.  However, there are SEVERAL spots where the movie hangs up and blurs and then continues to play after a minute or so.  If I purchased this at a store I would have quickly taken it back to exchange it...
0316098337|4.0|My emotions ran the gamut with this story,and I think that's what the best books do; they make you think in a new way and really feel something.  This story made me sad and then infuriated, but in the end Jack and his Ma come to terms with what happened to them.  And, as so often happens, children teach us the most about ourselves and the world and forgiveness.
0316286850|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas present for a friend who is interested in Cosmetology.  It made a great gift along with a set of makeup brushes.  I couldn't help flipping through it before giving it away though, and I was surprisingly enthralled by it, even though I normally am not very into such things.  This book not only has beautiful celebrity photos, but also in-depth, step-by-step instructions on achieving a wide variety of looks from different time periods. It also has a wonderful makeover section with truly unbelievable before and after photos.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that the white cover was smudged and dirty upon delivery.
B004D7GU3M|1.0|I purchased the CD first. And I gave away five stars - see my review of the music:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6RCNYELIKSA/ref=cm_pdp_rev_more?ie=UTF8&sort_by=MostRecentReview#R1ZFCGM5DUL3PI      Now I got the US-pressing. It is packed in thin cardboard, with no lyrics, no additional information. Pressed onto 6 sides - that means I have to change sides every 12 minutes! I could live with that easily if the sound would be nice. But the sound is disgusting! Lot of ticks (I listen with a usually perfect tracing Ortofon MC $1500-Jubilee Cartridge) and the sound itself thin, extremely digital - much more than the CD!!! All instruments and voices fall apart. Lots of unbearable hiss in female voices!! No recommandation at all! Buy the CD! The CD is cheaper, sounds a lot better, and even has all the lyrics.    A missed opportunity to create a lasting piece of vinyl art!  Shame on the industry!!!
B003TML0VO|2.0|I have discovered that Santana is one GREAT!!! guitar player (tons of notes)!!!! However I have also found that the simpler the chords the better I like the guitar music. The voice art is very nice!!! I like it better than the original, but I will not buy another album on name value alone again. I will base it on true musical enjoyment!     Note to Santana: Please hire a GOOD composer and make some incredable \\"NEW\\" sounds that tickle my fancy, not adding notes to used old songs that everyone already loves. However it was so good I will buy it now just because I know it has to be fantastic, because of your musical ablility, not just because its a cool \\"Beatles\\" song.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|A very cute cartoon movie, with unexpected twists and turns.  Well written.  A bit long in the last part, but still worth watching!  Beautifully drawn and animated!
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I would recommend this if you want to get more out of your headphones without paying a fortune for a large amp. The music definitely has more bass and richer tones. It is good for the price.
1594202842|5.0|A very enjoyable and quick read.  The outrageous behavior of the mother (at least in comparison to western norms) had me laughing and horrified at the same time.  The storylines were compelling and made me finish the book in one sitting.     The book was also fascinating insight into a very different parenting model.  It led both my wife and I into a lot of interesting discussions around our own child rearing practices.  At the end of the book, Lulu (the 'rebellious' daughter) makes the interesting observation that although she hated being pushed into the violin by her mother she appreciated the experience.  She remarks something along the lines \\"American parents think they are allowing their kids to pursue their dreams, but most kids are just watching TV or on facebook all day.\\"  There is definitely something in the author's \\"virtuous circle\\" logic that young children can't make good decisions and that they need to be pushed over the hump to start enjoying something.    An interesting contrast is Earl Woods (father of Tiger) book, where he emphasizes not pushing the child, but making the child interested, then getting the child to ask the parent for the privilege of being allowed to practice.       A lot of the negative reviews here seem to be reactions to the WSJ piece and the author's child rearing practices.  The book is more nuanced and you see a more balanced portrayal of the pros and the cons of \\"chinese parenting\\".  And irrespective of what you feel about the correctness of her parenting, the author does an excellent job of transporting you into her world and letting you see through her eyes.  An entertaining, thought-provoking book and well worth a read.    The kindle edition as always is excellent.  But, I still find it hard to stomach the Kindle editions being pretty much the same price as the physical book which needs to be printed, stored, then shipped to my house.
B000AARKOO|2.0|This version was butchered in the editing room. How do you cut approx 50 minutes from a movie?  After viewing this version I saw that it was a good movie so I ordered the director's cut.  Much better.  Buy the director's cut if you purchase this movie.
1439153663|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  I like books that aren't overly descriptive and this book was very easy to read. It is a very intense story. She has great character development and the characters are sure to stay with you long after the book is over.  Hope she makes a sequel!
B00000G6H1|4.0|Here Olivia succeeds on so many different levels! It's one of her best.      Yes, she had a stratospheric commercial success with the title cut; but more importantly, she backed it up with an entire album of well-sculpted, singable songs:    She reveals so many facets of her personality in this objet d'art. She can sound like a hormonal elf (\\"Landslide\\"), reveal the naughtier sides of her nature (\\"Stranger's Touch,\\" \\"Make a Move on Me\\"), talk of the loneliness amid her solitary sailing (\\"Recovery\\"), deliver some sensitive love ballads (\\"Falling,\\" \\"Carried Away\\"), venture into rockier territory (\\"Physical,\\" \\"Love Make Me Strong\\") and yet also leave room for ecology and spirit (\\"Silvery Rain,\\" \\"The Promise [The Dolphin Song]\\").     Highly entertaining but also provocative and introspective. This Newton-John set is natural, believable, unstrained.     John Farrar does very well here as both producer and writer. He knows how to emphasize her strengths to suit various styles. You can dance to these songs, sing to them, they make you move around and sometimes really think about something: They remain in your head for quite awhile after hearing.     It was a coup de grâce in that it effectively accomplished an image change (here is sexy, sultry Olivia) without sacrificing the virtues that made her so adorable to begin with (\\"The Promise\\" melts your heart, the way she does that \\"ah, ah, ah, ah...mised you,\\" she seems to be floating through time and space).     Three cheers for this one as it also stands the test of time and is not kitschy to listen to today.
B001EOOC3W|3.0|I suppose you'd have to be a tremendous BB fan to buy this set. Personally I would stick to individual pieces. The \\"War Requiem\\" is a tremendous masterpiece and deserves to be bought in the original recording with Britten recording ( as do most performances). \\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\" ( \\"Variations on a theme of Purcell\\") is also tremendously enjoyable, likewise the \\"Simple Symphony\\", a compilation of his childhood compositions. If you are into opera \\"Peter Grimes\\" is easily the best and, if not, the \\"Sea Interludes\\" are fine post-Debussy pieces. I'm sorry to say I find a lot of the rest of Britten's music rather minor, but you are welcome to disagree.
B0049D1TCM|4.0|I didnt expect her to be singing as much as she is on the album, which threw me off. But I actually like it.  Songs I love...  -Super Bass  -Muny  -Fly    Songs I can do without...  -Save Me  -Last Chance  -You Love
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's January 12th.  Are they seriously taking pre-orders on a product due to be released on SEPTEMBER 2011?!?!?!?    And for the record, there is ONLY Original Theatrical Release.  Anything else I won't spend a dime on.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Yeah, I'm just the mom who paid for two. These are expensive compared to other non-Nintendo brands and I had considered them. I look for bargains and sales just like anyone else. But you also get what you pay for and I needed these to last a very long time. So I paid for the official product and so far they are holding up to an 11 yr old constant use.
B002RBU4GA|5.0|There is a reason this book was on the top ten list.  Don't skip this book, trust me you will enjoy it.
0525951652|5.0|Another wonderful Ken Follett read. If you liked Pillars of the Earth, World Without End or The Man from St. Petersburg(as I do) you won't be disappointed. Ther characters are approached a little differently that in POTE and WWOE and it takes a little longer to really feel wrapped up in them. You do though and then find yourself unable to put the book down.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome.  Fun, and easy to pick up.  Provides a good evening of fun for the whole family.  We take this game camping with us to pass the time when it is raining.  Settlers of Catan is a must have for any board game fan.  I also recomend the expansions of Seafarers,or Citys and Knights!
B0017TWUZG|3.0|Acting is bland; piture quality is mediocre; But movie is very entertaining especailly if you appreciate dancing & urban music
1591842972|5.0|This book is amazing if you know who Steve Jobs is and if you admire apple products.    For me it's excellent
0451208706|5.0|Another wonderful Ken Follett read. Definitely in my top 10 books of all time. If you liked Pillars of the Earth, World Without End or Fall of Giants (as I did) you won't be disappointed.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This series of the three, for me by far is the best.  At least 3xs a week I find myself watching it just before I go to bed.  It's a love story, its about working together regardless of the difference to achieve a common goal. It takes you on a journey.
B00368PSN2|5.0|This is great movie, a lot of actions, got a good storyline and awesome in Blu-Ray.  The acting is very good.  I have to warn you: there are a lot of graphic violences and grotesque scenes.  Not for kids.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had a baby in March (10 months old now) and I was definitely motivated to get back into working out and back into shape quickly, but for me, the biggest obstacle wasn't motivation - it was TIME.  I work 40+ hours a week and with the baby, time was of the essence.  Enter Jillan.  I heard that this was a great workout and only 20 minutes.  I used to feel like I needed at least 40-45 to feel I was getting an effective workout (good and tired afterwards).. but I was wrong!  This is a GREAT full body workout, very challenging (but in a good way, and you can make it as easy or hard as you want), and just the right length of time that I don't have an excuse not to stick with it.    And my body has definitely gotten back into the shape I was hoping it would be in!!  And then some! (My arms are strong - perfect for holding my 18 lb kiddo!)    Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to get into shape with limited time on their hands.
1401207529|2.0|Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is an unnecessary and over-the-top retelling of Bruce Wayne's first years as Batman.  It has not aged well.  Frank Miller's apparent obsession with seediness and prostitutes carries over here, with Selena Kyle portrayed as such.  Obvious caricatures of pimps, corrupt policemen and the mob ooze cliched dialogue while the story overall reads like generic noir.  The book is saved by David Mazzuchelli's beautifully dim and realistic artwork.
B002ZCY7TG|1.0|The content of the program is FANTASTIC, but the \\"loading\\" of each DVD and each episode is painfully slow - never experienced this before with a Blue Ray.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Devil is a taut, tightly-written thriller about being trapped in an elevator with Satan.  Even though security and<br />the police are right outside, they can't help you.  They can't get to you.  Nobody can save you.  It's a very<br />scary, claustrophobic feeling of helplessness that carried with me the very first time I got on an elevator in<br />real life after seeing this movie.  I have to admit that I felt a nervous twinge that didn't end until the doors<br />opened safely on my floor.<br />M. Night Shyamalan has definitely redeemed himself after that ridiculous Girl in the Water and that childish<br />Last Airbender.  He is back doing what he does best:  good, creepy thrillers.<br />And the ending, while not completely happy, was in my opinion, hopeful.  Very higly recommended!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I much prefer \\"Absolution\\" and \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" over this album.  That said, it is still a very good release.  it's just that I absolutely love the other two.  This is a must have for any fans of Muse.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I like Jose Groban so it is expected I would like this album.  There are a few repeats from previous albums but iTunes can fix that.
B003D83DPA|4.0|The sound is great in DTS 5.1 surround. Yes, the video is poor for BluRay. That is the problem with modern technology, it blows away 1983 technology. If you were watching this on your 1983 TV it would be GREAT. I am sure for a $1,000,000 you could fix the video, but then the price point would be much higher. And for an old catalog item like this, not likely to go triple platinum on BluRay, I am sure the producers weren't going for that. I bought it without regard to the 1 star reviews and am quite pleased with my purchase.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Both Life and Planet Earth are amazing documentaries, worth having them in your stack of movies. The details that are shown are absolutely incredible and the story is very well narrated. It keeps you interested every second of it, i have personally watched several episodes, one after another and i just couldn't stop, i wanted to see more. The quality is great, and there is so much new information that you just don't hear or see in other documentaries, at least not so detailed. I highly recommend them to everyone, from children to adults, there is no possibility for someone not to like it so you won't take any risks. It is worth every penny.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, the story sounds good but it's told from the point of view of a 5 year old.  Bits and pieces of a 5 year old speaking are cute, a whole book written in 5 year old speak is mind numbing..<br /><br />I tried several times to read this book and just couldn't handle more then 20 or 30 pages before I had to put it down :(
B00001SIES|4.0|This is a good album by one of the best bands around.  I love Muse and this album is enjoyable.  If you are new to Muse, I would suggest you start with \\"Absolution\\" or \\"Origin of Symmetry\\", as they have a more immediate effect.  Showbiz is a good album, but it took me a number of listens before I really got into it.  It is still my least favorite album, but that is only because I absolutely love their more recent releases.
0439023521|4.0|I read this book on vacation to preview it before I placed it on my classroom bookshelf.  I could not put the book down, as the story was captivating.  I would recommend it to both adults and teens.    The binding fell apart within the first hour of reading.  Complete pages fell out of the book.  I bought the paperback edition.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This collection not only allows me to enjoy some wonderful old songs, it's introducing my children to music they might not have known otherwise.  Love it!
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Read the reviews on Head fi as well as here on amazon, and boy am i glad i got it! creates a fuller sound. definitely recommended. if you have an ipod, get a line out, bypasses the ipods built in amp, and gives a richer sound. deducted one star because the bass boost button seems a little flimsy.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|The movie itself is smartly written, sharp, and funny.  But to me the film seems poorly lit in many scenes.  When I saw it in the theaters I thought maybe the projector bulb might be old and dimming.  When I saw it on Blu-ray I realized the film itself was just dimly lit.<br /><br />I'm also not a big fan of the Blu-ray disc packaging.  The case itself is fine, but the info/insert card that comes with it is not attached in any way and basically just drapes over the case.  It makes it a very impermanent part of the packaging and likely to be misplaced, lost, or simply tossed away.<br /><br />I prefer the packaging to be as collectible as the film itself.  The packaging for this movie is certainly \\"nontraditional\\".<br /><br />The film itself, however, is very enjoyable though not totally unbiased or based on absolute fact.  Still, this was meant to be entertainment and not a documentary.<br /><br />There are quite a few bonus features but they do not include the rather interesting movie trailer that we saw before the film's release.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I love Muse and this album is my second favorite of all their releases.  Good songs from start to finish!  This should be a must have for any fans of Muse.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|CANNOT SPEAK TOO HIGHLY OF THIS CD. CLAPTON AT HIS RELAXED, MAKING MUSIC WITH FRIENDS, BEST. EVERY TRACK A WINNER. A VERY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE.
0575083093|3.0|It's good to see a genre which prides itself on imagination actually produce something imaginative once in a while. While Reynolds clearly knows his science, he also knows that tech with no people is pretty boring and has constructed a complex world with believable cultures and social issues -- to say nothing on his take on the Fermi Paradox.    But that's only halfway. I'm not sure if it's a scientist or an Anglo thing but his prose style is as dry as Utah. This is especially jarring when one of the characters is a Russian woman -- if you've ever known Russian women, you know \\"dry\\" is the last word to describe their language and thought processes. It totally upends the suspension of disbelief and had me wincing for the last third of the book.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This was a very enjoyable album.  I have every Micheal Jackson Album and all the Jacksons albums.  It sure sounded like Micheal on every track to me.  All I can say is that even dead, Micheal can sure make a good album.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|Really started getting into the Nerf guns with my 6 and 4 year old.  Yes, I know they're below the age limits but hey, gotta get them started early on Zombie training.  I was hoping for a gun that was able to shoot more precisely and a bigger range than the other Nerf guns (e.g. Stampede ECS).  I was painfully disappointed. Of the various models that we have, this was by far the worst when it comes to range.  Agree with many reviewers, 10-15 ft tops and it's not a strong shot either.    The only reason why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1, is that other than the poor range, the rifle sure feels good and you really can't beat the cool bolt reload action.  Was planning on returning it to exchange for another one since I thought it was defective.  Looks like it's just a poorly constructed pump mechanism.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film - FACEBOOK - has caused.  The story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays - a compliment) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive, multifaceted performance in the film) and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told.  The fact that the idea was 'lifted' from the Winklevoss twins (recreated a la 'The Parent Trap' concept by one actor - Armie Hammer) and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra (Max Mingella) provides the story driver here: the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy. It is story of obsession, of the fragmentation of trust between friends, of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme, and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination, the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic.<br /><br />Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires' as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher (Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), and Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films.  Here that atmosphere includes degrading women, drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), maladaptive behavior, and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success - not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake.  This is a long, loud, noisy, crude, roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and is terrifyingly thought provoking.

B0011Z32PS|5.0|I'm so glad that Metallica is showing up in MP3 format.  I lost most of my heavy metal bands albums in the great wreck of 95.  I forgot how good heavy meatal sounded.  When I kept hearing different tunes running through Supernatural, that did it I had to get my metal back.  Unfortunately my hubby does not agree with me he never liked the genre apparently.  Heck of a time to find this out 30 years later!  Any way, Black is an excellent introduction to Metallica if you are a newcomer to the heavy metal genre.  Heck even my Dad likes Enter Sandman!  That is my nighty night song.  I have to play that every night before bedtime (which for me is like 3 or 4 am I have a wacked out work schedule what can I say?).
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Buy this book.  Make tea. Grab hanky. Curl up under a blanket in front of a bright window or warm fire, as the weather provides. Read and love book. It's like the joy of Miss Marple mixed with a lovely British black and white movie starring Deborah Kerr with a little Herriott thrown in for color. It's a delightful little bit of sunshine.

It is very well done and gave me a new appreciation for violinists.  The CD has a classical feel but easily recognized rock songs to grab your attention.  David Garrett is amazing.

B0047X4926|5.0|This review refers specifically to the exclusive contents of the Couture Edition of \\"Loud\\", as I feel there are plenty of reviews available regarding the actual musical content of this release. I will note however, that this release is also unfortunately censored.<br /><br />If I was asked to describe this package using as few words as possible, I would say \\"It's a mega-sized deluxe edition digipack!\\" The entire set is housed in a plastic cover. Nothing too special about this; it simply reads \\"Rihanna\\" across the top and \\"Loud\\" across the bottom in some kind of raised, glittered letters. You remove the \\"digipack\\" from the plastic cover and unfold the compartments. You should recognize the main product image.<br /><br />In the center compartment you'll find the booklet and lithograph. I wasn't sure what a lithograph was when I ordered this from Rihanna's website. I looked up a definition and still wasn't sure what it was. I received my order and understood somewhat. To say the least, it's a pixelated poster. For a more detailed description, I'd suggest trying to imagine the sandstone landscape around the edge of your pool. Looking closely you can see the tens of thousands of \\"pieces\\" making up the cover image. I really don't know how to explain it, except that it looks great on my wall.<br /><br />The extra large booklet is a nice alternative to the standard 4 incher. (Ha.) It includes almost all of the photographs from the Standard Edition booklet, plus a few extra, and mega-sized. Your view of Rihanna is not obstructed by those pesky song and musician credits (you'll still find them on the last page).<br /><br />Overall this is a great collectors piece. The booklet is printed on sturdy paper and the entire package has a smooth, glossy finish. This release still includes track 11: \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" although at the time of this review Amazon does not list it. I hope this information was useful in helping you understand exactly what you are buying. Most of it might have been obvious information. If that is the case, then I've just confirmed.ht have been obvious information. If that is the case, then I've just confirmed.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I purchased this cable to connect my Tivo to my digital TV. Initially it seemed to work fine, but then every few days Tivo would display the message \\"HDMI Connection not Permitted\\".  Tivo support suggested reversing the HDMI cable, which I did.  That got rid of the error message, but then every 5 minutes or so the signal would disappear completely.  I bought a new HDMI cable (also from Amazon, similar price, but by Mediabridge) and that solved my problems.    I happen to have access to an Agilent 54754A TDR with an HDMI fixture, which is used by cable manufactures to test their cables, so I hooked up my cable. Sure enough, one of the clock lines in the cable was not attached to the connector.    Given that MOST people don't have any problems with this cable, this is probably  just a quality control issue with the manufacturer.  If you're going to purchase this cable, be ready to return it if you get a defective one.  Fortunately, Amazon makes returns very easy.
0307474712|2.0|I've never written a review for any of the books I've read, but for One Day, considering all the hype, I was seriously dissapointed. The book goes on forever, so many needless details, so bland, so dull, no humour, Emma is so annoying with her constant negativity and insecurities that I caught myself rolling my eyes during reading it. The book goes from Okay to dull to boring to depressing and leaves you depressed once your done. Nothing is more annoying than the ending and what happens to Emma, really? After all that? I understand that sometimes life goes down that route, god forbid, however it seemed like the auther was trying to make a gasping turn in the story when really it was just more disappointment.
B000068QY7|3.0|Stop Crying your heart out, Born on a Different Cloud, Force of Nature, Songbird are all solid Oasis tunes (in that order).  Better Man and the rest are alright with the notable exception of Little by Little which is just an awful song.  Stop Crying Your Heart Out, which should have been a giant hit was a little over produced, but still shines through. The acoustic version of the song which can be found on Youtube shows it's full potential.  Born on a Different Cloud, were it written by Noel, would have been a critically acclaimed hit, but because Liam wrote it no one was willing at the time to admit it's an epic tune, but that's exactly what it is.  Force of Nature is a less epic Supersonic.  Songbird is Liam trying to be Lennon, and the truth is, he's no Lennon, but he does a fair imitation.  The rest is the rest.    This album wasn't as bad as everyone wanted it to be. In fact it's actually pretty good.  Ranks with SOTSOG as the worst of the Oasis albums, which tells you how good Oasis is in that it's an honest 3 out of 5.  The Oasis Albums Ranked are:    (What's the Story)Morning Glory?(5 out of 5), Definitely Maybe (5 out of 5), Dig Out Your Soul (4 out of 5), Don't Believe the Truth (4 out of 5), Be Here Now (3 out of 5), Heathen Chemistry (3 out of 5), SOTSOG (2.5 out of 5)    The Masterplan (5 of 5), a compilation of B-Sides belongs after Definitely Maybe.

0439023521|5.0|As an avid fan of young adult literature, I feel this book is a great example of the potential of this genre and how it can captivate adults just as much as children.<br /><br />There's a reason \\"The Hunger Games\\" is so popular: it's morbidly fascinating, it's taboo, it's gory, it's horrifying, it's uncomfortable. I loved it and I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated by the descriptions of the reapings, the sacrifice (and sometimes the lack of it), the games, the arena, the strategy, the deaths, the humiliation of the interviews, all of it!<br /><br />The story is pretty original, although it reminded me a little bit of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" on some levels, though the circumstances as to how they all got there certainly weren't the same (but still had much the same outcomes, like children killing each other, creating alliances, searching for food, etc.). The pacing was very well done. Character development was good. When I was done, I was satisfied and I wanted more. And the \\"more\\" had lots of potential, so I couldn't wait to see where it went.<br /><br />I would love to see spin-off books that talk about the Hunger Games from the perspective of other players (like the careers or other characters, like Tresh--what was he doing in the fields the whole time?), family members who are watching, Capitol people who are watching, etc.<br /><br />I am concerned about how the movie will be done and can see them changing many of the circumstances and key points (like making them all older, making deaths less gory) that define \\"The Hunger Games\\" to make it more acceptable to moviegoers, which would really be a shame.
1853288438|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo102DDZUEFZCOR]]FOR PRIVACY PRACTITIONERS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Keith Mathieson and his team of 8 specialist contributors at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP have produced an excellent road map for privacy law which is the Law Society's `take' on the subject.<br /><br />All the titles in the Law Society Publishing's `Legal Handbooks' series successfully give us a collection of expert, specialist books specifically for lawyers... and very welcome they are, too. The remit naturally focuses on both the practical aspects of our professional work and the requirements of the specialist legal bodies and privacy law is the latest subject to be covered.<br /><br />Also, the books in this series should, nearly always, be the first port of call for practitioners and this one will be of use to those involved in data control and freedom of information as well. In around 250 pages with 11 chapters and 5 Appendices, Mathieson and his team have covered substantial areas of privacy law in just one slim (ish) volume to give us what we need without reference to the heavy tomes. It is a dramatic and ambitious aim which succeeds.<br /><br />Mathieson's mission is to produce a statement in 100,000 words on the laws that govern the personal protection of privacy in the United Kingdom. He is spot on with his evaluation that the last 10 years have seen dramatic change concerning privacy with the view that it is unrealistic to expect the pace of change to ease.<br /><br />So, to make life a great deal easier for us, we get significant developments online from the Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC) website which is one of the most attractive additional features of this title and a facility which has become popular with a variety of modern publishers.<br /><br />Another welcome device with this legal handbook is the decision to limit the number of citations and references and they are proud to have `eschewed the use of footnotes'. It's therefore advisable to read through the entire text which will give readers a thorough grasp of the current state of privacy law and its adjacent issues like data protection and freedom of information.<br /><br />We have reviewed many titles in this area of law, and this particular work offers a refreshing insight into the modern law via the use of internet updates. For example, of particular interest to many is chapter 2 on the concept of breach of confidence which needs now to be read in conjunction with the Human Rights Act.<br /><br />English law has, famously, never recognised a general right of privacy although ways have been found to protect a person's individual privacy in certain circumstances. It may well be that change is on the way with the discrediting of the `super injunction' in some quarters but this work will remain an excellent first port of call for all who want a quick overview of modern privacy law.able to read through the entire text which will give readers a thorough grasp of the current state of privacy law and its adjacent issues like data protection and freedom of information.

She had seen it in theaters, really liked it, and figured I would, too, especially due to my love of owls (I liked owls before they were cool! ;).<br /><br />I had no idea this movie was based on a series of books until today, so my review comes from someone who has never read the books (although now I'll be going back to read them).<br /><br />I had no expectations going into this movie and I was absolutely blown away. I watched it over and over. The characters are engrossing; the soundtrack is lovely; the animation is dazzling; the voice acting was great; the story isn't overly original, but certainly seemed to stay true to the world that has been created.<br /><br />I think this movie is wonderful, magical, and brilliant. The time, love, and research that went into this movie are so apparent that it makes it all the more endearing. Plus, it's educational without even realizing you are learning.

If one could expand the illusion in the names to our Parliamentarians without unjust lack of flattery, the confusion which is `The Coroners and Justice Act 2009' - yet another annual form of CJA (will the government never learn!) - really covers both the rag, the tag and the bobtail of this complex piece of drafting which has given us significant and long-awaited changes... but at a cost of trying to understand the multi-tasking approach of this legislation. Thankfully, Jonathan Glasson and Julian B Knowles are at hand to help out.<br /><br />Most practitioners find these Blackstone guides invaluable for their advice because they deliver concise and accessible commentaries on the latest legislative reforms, changes and amendments to statute law for occasions such as this one with this Act.<br /><br />The publishers, OUP, have identified what we, as the practitioners and advisers, need- namely publications soon after the legislative enactments with serious and experienced expert analysis by leading lawyers on the scope, extent and effects of the statutes.<br /><br />In addition, the Blackstone Guides Series is always cost-effective giving us a copy of the Act plus key information needs quickly to act as the perfect companion for our main practitioner works to give us a unique additional updating service to compliment formal updates which often lack the depth we require without time-consuming legal research.<br /><br />Glasson and Knowles explain here how the Act introduces diverse elements of law in one statute.  The success of their mission lies in the expert narrative explaining the scope and impact of the statute together with its civil liberties implications.<br /><br />We liked the way in which the provisions are presented in a straightforward layout which is helpful for the busy advocate as an excellent and quick reference tool which is so well organized.<br /><br />Irwin J gives, as an example from his Ulster youth, the Grocer's Van arriving with its multitude of contents, hence the description of the Act as \\"ramshackled\\" and \\"huge\\" although it is pointed out, quite fairly, that there is plenty of competition elsewhere! Therefore, as Irwin J says, \\"the Guide is admirably clear, but the legislation is not always so\\" being possibly enacted for immediate political ends which seems to be the history of previous CJAs.<br /><br />The Guide addresses the 3 concerns about the legislation: additional professional burdens; the impulse to be populist bypassing scrutiny; and excessive rigidity and complexity of the statute. We agree that the book is first rate as the authors guide us around the \\"cave\\" with well-organised elegance and clarity in just over 400 pages.<br /><br />A touching and generous decision by the authors to donate the royalties to INQUEST is to be strongly admired for the problems we all face currently fiscally.

B0000714B5|4.0|The late fifties,sixties and seventies were deeply influenced by Hermann Hesse writings. His Eastern influence was a notorious fact and the huge spiritual wave that turned around that generation (who hailed Lobsang Rampa, Ravi Shankar' s music, Jim Morrison' s presence, whose main spiritual support was William Blake and the cult Beatles album The magic and mystery tour in the middle sixties)  searching for illumination into a chaotic world made the mankind revisited the work of that old oak (Nobel Prize in 1945). Siddhartha, Demian, Steppenwolf and Peter Camezind were his most widely known readings.<br /><br />In this orden of ideas, Siddhartha was a long expected project but also a feared one due its challenging demands. Conrad Rooks at last decided to walk ahead his colleagues and with the aid of Sven Nyvkist (the legendary cinematographer of Ingmar Bergman). Both were bewitched and engaged by the glittering magic on this ancient location in India North West.<br /><br />Siddhartha is the story of a man looking for bliss and enlightenment, who leaves his wealthy parents and decides to become a wandering ascetic, following his own path. This journey will lead him to a kaleidoscopic experience (including sexual passion, sense of power and material wealth). Nevertheless he feels the huge  emptiness and runs away from this new stage, finishing his life in company of a humble ferryman learning existential tranquility and philosophical reflections from the river itself.<br /><br />Although this movie was practically overlooked by the great commercial circuits, it became for many people one of the most dazzling and revealing films of the raising seventies.<br /><br />Watch it, hoping that its reading was the natural consequence.
0439023513|2.0|Spoilers. Read at your own risk.<br /><br />I came to this series late. By the time I heard about it, the entire series had already been written and published. I voraciously read the first two books in this series, and I had high expectations for the final book. Let me say, I am glad I did not have to wait a year for book 3, which was disappointing and left me feeling thoroughly unsatisfied. Here's why.<br /><br />- Rushed.<br /><br />As the title of my review suggests, this book reads like Collins had to meet a too-quickly-approaching deadline. It is not the labor of love the other two books were (especially the first). I couldn't believe how much story still had to be closed when I had only 50 pages left to read, and the hurried nature of it all was very disorienting.<br /><br />- Didn't \\"sound\\" like Collins.<br /><br />This book read as if Collins collaborated with someone else, or even that entire passages were written by another person altogether. It felt choppy, disconnected, and just plain unnerving.<br /><br />- Lack of focus and odd pace.<br /><br />So much time was spent on unimportant details (such as Katniss's deciding which boy she loved and trusted), while major plot points (such as the ending with President Coin and Katniss's decision surrounding it) and major character deaths (in particular, Finnick and Prim) were insensitive and glossed over.<br /><br />- Finnick's death.<br /><br />Finnick was a main character who was loyal to Katniss and the cause, yet he was killed off in the most infuriatingly unceremonious manner, like it had to be completed in ten words or less. And, no. Annie's pregnancy didn't console me and was pretty meaningless. I would rather Finnick had lived. This was foreshadowing that I missed. Usually if a woman gets pregnant, you know that'll be their consolation because their lover (who's alive now) will probably die later in the book; or, if their lover has already died, you know the woman will magically be pregnant. Some of my friends didn't even know Finnick had died until after all the fighting when Katniss was counting who was left!<br /><br />- Prim's death.<br /><br />By this point, I was feeling like series became \\"Legends of the Fall\\" where pretty much everyone dies for apparently no reason, other than to be gratuitously tragic. It took me a while to even realize that it was Prim and she was dead because it was cheapened with odd hallucinations and no substance--again, the death of a main character which was nearly glossed over. Additionally, I felt this death defeated the purpose of the whole series, although I do know some people who felt it made perfect sense. I admit to being someone who cannot see how it made perfect sense at all, especially when it happened so late in the series. This was another death that I realized had been foreshadowed when the timed weapon was being described.<br /><br />- The endless waffling.<br /><br />I get that Katniss is troubled, trying to figure out what she wants, doesn't know who to trust... but, seriously--enough is enough! I got bored near the middle because every sentence and every thought was teenage angst. It started to feel like the \\"Twilight\\" saga, and that is NOT a compliment (you can see my review of that for why). In the first book, this uncertainty was understandably at the forefront; in the second book, it was still prominent and less understandable, but did not bother me too much; in the third book, I was bored with it.<br /><br />This book did not feel like it rang true with the series. It was wholly disappointing and there's nothing worse than a book, especially a series, that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and cheated.en Katniss was counting who was left!    - Prim's death.

However, it has worked (so far), and the complex mass of statutory provisions is now in one Act, containing significant changes to the law to expand the work of the `equalities industry'. So, it will be interesting to see how much the implementation of this legislation will cost business!<br /><br />All practitioners find these Blackstone Guides invaluable for their advice because they deliver concise and accessible commentaries on the latest legislative reforms, changes and amendments to statute law and the Equality Act 2010 fits the bill nicely.<br /><br />The publishers, Blackstone and OUP, have seen what we need which are publications arriving soon after the legislative enactments with a serious and experienced expert analysis by leading lawyers on the scope, extent and effects of the statutes- and that is exactly what we get.<br /><br />In addition, the Blackstone Guides Series is always cost-effective giving us a copy of the Act plus key information needs quickly to act as the perfect companion for our main practitioner works to give us a unique additional updating service to compliment formal updates which often lack the depth we require without time-consuming legal research.<br /><br />The authors explain in 500 pages and 12 chapters how the Act introduces new duties on employers, service providers, and public authorities to eliminate discrimination and promote equality. Helena Kennedy sums things up nicely in the Foreword saying the Act will be a key resource for all who actively pursue a fairer society. Rightly, she admits that many of the institutional barriers which prevent people from achieving their potential in society, or taking their right place in social life, will remain intractable.<br /><br />The Act is an important new step towards building a society based on equality and human rights by rationalizing and modernising the law. so, the 4 expert authors, John Wadham, Anthony Robinson, David Ruebain and Susie Uppal, give us the additional tools to help us through the new maze and they do the job brilliantly. Their hope is that the Act will be recognised as a vital partner of the Human Rights Act by providing the twin columns of a modern and civilised constitutional settlement.<br /><br />Whether that comes to pass will have to be seen since the elections May 2010 although the change of government may have little effect in reality as the statute is already on the books: in any event, at least we have the Blackstone Guide which gives us the explanations and the directions in which society is now going.how the Act introduces new duties on employers, service providers, and public authorities to eliminate discrimination and promote equality.

The Act is an important new step towards building a society based on equality and human rights by rationalizing and modernising the law. so, the 4 expert authors, John Wadham, Anthony Robinson, David Ruebain and Susie Uppal, give us the additional tools to help us through the new maze and they do the job brilliantly. Their hope is that the Act will be recognised as a vital partner of the Human Rights Act by providing the twin columns of a modern and civilised constitutional settlement.      Whether that comes to pass will have to be seen since the elections May 2010 although the change of government may have little effect in reality as the statute is already on the books: in any event, at least we have the Blackstone Guide which gives us the explanations and the directions in which society is now going.
B000244FDW|5.0|I wish more people would enjoy this adaptation for what it is, because it is a wonderful version of Jane Austen's classic novel. It follows the novel the most faithfully (I believe) and Elizabeth Garvie is sublime as Elizabeth. I even like David Rintoul, who is cold, stiff and icy and easy to for Eliza to hate at first! LOL. I wish he would loosen up sooner in the miniseries, but still, physically he makes a perfect Darcy, and again, this adaptation follows the book quite well.    It does have the \\"budget TV\\" look to it (not unusual for a show made in that time frame) but the costumes don't look dated--they look fairly historically accurate. The actress who plays Lady Catherine DeBurgh (I hope I spelled that right) is fantastic. Old enough to be Darcy's aunt and young enough to be *really* scary.     I like to savor and enjoy all my favorite adaptations of Pride and Prejudice for different reasons. I don't find that it's an \\"either or\\" sort of thing. I love the 1980 Garvie version for its faithfulness to the novel, the witty dialog, and for both Garvie *and* Rintoul. I enjoy the 1995 Colin Firth version for its more emotional and open quality (and Colin Firth is fabulous). I enjoy the 2005 version for its brevity, beauty, and for the wonderful performances by most everyone.

But the consequence to this type of child rearing was a child with horrible emotional issues, who tried to commit suicide quite a few times.  If you rear your children this way, you will be emotionally damaging them.  Bring them up with balance, show them love (even in public), if they have done their best, then compliment them.  Show them they have value no matter what.

It's a bit like policing the internet really- until there is proper international agreement (which is doubtful) the serious problems will remain concerning the current neutered approach by the key law enforcement agencies towards attempts by defendants to retain ill-gotten gains.<br /><br />What the authors have achieved in the third edition is a weighty consideration of the current legislation against a backdrop of the practical problems which both defence and prosecuting counsel face when interpreting and implementing successive Parliaments' wishes.  Addressing the confiscation and restraint of proceeds of crime is a tall order the Millington & Sutherland Williams rise to the task very well indeed.<br /><br />We were interested to see the reaction of Toulson LJ to this subject matter when he describes it as a `bete noir' for Crown Court judges.  His suggestion that depriving criminals of the proceeds of their crimes could have been approached in a simpler way by setting out the basic structure of the confiscation regime and establishing general principles with the courts left to work out the practicalities is eminently sensible... in fact, far too sensible for Parliamentarians who have messed the whole thing up.  Of course, it may well be that Parliament has another go at this subject within the next five years!<br /><br />Meanwhile, an invaluable service has been performed here with the explanations of the formidable case law and statutory provisions.  As an analytical and comprehensive leading statement of the law, it contains much helpful advice and practical observations on the operation of the principles and helpfully provides the rationale for many statutory provisions with an excellent pr&eacute;cis of the case law.<br /><br />Kay LJ stated, in the first edition, that `crime can be extremely profitable', so striking a balance between the need to ensure that criminals do not prosper whilst giving the guarantee of fair treatment for defendants and third parties is what is needed.<br /><br />Millington and Sutherland Williams have performed what David Perry QC describes in the second edition as `an invaluable service' in the explanation of how we deal with the proceeds of crime successfully... but there is much work still to be done before crime is no longer extremely profitable: this book is a start.rts left to work out the practicalities is eminently sensible... in fact, far too sensible for Parliamentarians who have messed the whole thing up.

The book is primarily for solicitors so the remainder of the work is devoted to those lawyers working in local authorities, those instructed by children or children's guardians, and those instructed by parents and other adult parties. The last part of the main book covers other important aspects of public law Children Act cases.<br /><br />All these titles in the `Protocols' series from Law Society Publishing continue to produce a library collection of expert, specialist books just for us as legal practitioners and/or those acting for local authorities, parents or children and they greatly assist our understanding of how our processes should work at what ever level of practitioner expertise. And that is what we have here.<br /><br />The Law Society remit naturally focuses on both the practical aspects of our professional work and the requirements of the specialist legal areas. With \\"Good Practice in Child Care Cases\\" we have, in just under 200 pages with 6 chapters and 15 Appendices (plus index), a work for every level which has been thoroughly updated and revised as an official guide to best practice.<br /><br />We found the Appendices of great assistance with the detail provided covering Practice Directions, Notes and Guidance.  Appendix 15 gives some highly useful website although readers should always be aware of the way in which the web can change at short notice!<br /><br />President of the Family Division, Sir Nicholas Wall, in his admirable Foreword, identifies the vital role solicitors play in ensuring that matters are dealt with justly and fairly, with the minimum of distress to the children and individuals involved- this supplement to 3rd edition of the Law Society's Family Law Protocol gives the practical and welcome guidance in this sensitive, difficult and important field.<br /><br />This collection of concise good practice guidelines was drafted by the 13 members of the Law Society's Children Law Sub-Committee together with the active and close involvement of the Association of Lawyers for Children and Resolution.

0307408833|1.0|I was charmed by this book's gorgeous photography and lofty foreword by Tom Colichio.  I wonder if he was reviewing Ms. mckenna's bakery or if he has actually experimented with any of the recipes in the book.  The truth is though, a cookbook isn't primarily about being a visual feast, though it can at least be said that this book is gorgeously laid out.  The recipes are the main attraction and if they fall short than the cookbook is a flop.  And boy do they fall short.  First of all, I spent 76dollars on ingredients to make the famous vanilla cupcakes.  Followed the recipe to the best of my abilities and they came out, well, disappointingly.  The frosting was a complete failure.  I was more than a little chagrined to later read on the baby cakes website that I was supposed to melt down the coconut oil.  Really!?  That would have been helpful information to have in your cookbook dear.  You know, like, in the instructions?  Not only that, but she comes right out and says, in her website, that the frosting she makes in her bakery contains an ingredient that isn't available on the market, after passing the frosting in her cookbook off as the same one that she sells in her bakery.  Above all, the frequently asked questions in her website, about the cookbook, comes off as being unbelievably smug and talks down to the reader big time.  Why did my cookies fall flat?  Is one of the questions.  Not sure is the answer.  Ok, thanks, that was super helpful.  The recipes in the book are paired with pictures of her baked goods from her bakery which it appears are not the same recipes used in the book.  Where I come from, that's called fraud.  Love the pictures, love the concept.  Hate the smug, Oozing with self congratulatory narcissism evident in the overall product.  Will have to keep looking for someone who knows how to get down here with us common folk.  You know, the ones who all paid through the nose for your cookbook and helped make you rich with royalties.
1594202842|2.0|Don't buy into this style of parenting.  I am American, and my wife was raised in Taiwan according to the \\"traditional Chinese way.\\"  On the prima facie view, the children are \\"perfect\\" and grow up to be accomplished adults.  However, this harsh style is far more detrimental than good.  First, it seems that a child's natural way is to explore and have fun, but when they are forced to live a regimented life, although it may produce good results in school and competitions, the children are bundling up emotions and desires that will come out at a later time period when they finally feel comfortable (such as when they get married to an American who is nice to them).  My wife, although very accomplished in school (BS in mathematics from a prestigious university, graduate degree as well) has released a lot of anger from her childhood on me, because I was the first person she truly felt comfortable around.  The release of emotion has been violent and abusive.  Also, as mentioned above, children learn to solve problems and analyze situations, but not in Chinese culture.  Chinese kids learn to memorize, not think critically (this is actually a problem the People's Republic of China has recognized recently and addressed as a government).  Sure, Asian children excel at math as a whole, but in talking about this with my wife, she said that although the majority of the math department were Asian, the top students in the math department were ALWAYS Caucasian--reason being when you are dealing with the highest level of mathematics, such as working in 4th-dimensional realms, requires extreme outside-the-box thinking, something the Asian kids never learn.  Also, this restrictive parenting seems to make people have little interest in any kind of healthy/relaxing sports or hobbies.  Everybody I know who was raised the traditional Chinese way has one extracurricular interest: blogging/surfing the web.  Any kind of outdoor sports (except taiqi in the park) are so foreign and uninteresting.  I find these activities relaxing and rejuvenating.  Another downfall of this method of parenting is instilling the child to worry about everything to become the best--ultimately resulting in extreme anxiety.  Many Asians I have known who were raised this way worry constantly about other peoples' expectations--not surprising since they were raised where every second of the day they had to live up to their parents never-ending expectations.      I could go on and on about how much I hate the traditional style of parenting, but in conclusion, it creates robots.  Children and people who seem to act perfect, but are actually suffering from severe emotional problems.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I love these headphones.  The sound quality is terrific, it's simple to set up, and I haven't had any significant problems.  I read about other people hearing \\"pops\\" regularly and that almost drove me away from buying these.  However, now that I've owned them for a month or two and have experienced the occasional \\"pops\\", I can assure you they are nothing to worry about.  They happen very rarely, they are not particularly loud, and it will not distract from your overall gaming experience.    The only downside I've found is that it's sometimes tough to perfectly set the in-game and chat volumes.  Sometimes, I find that the chat volume suddenly gets too loud.  Also, when my mic is not muted, I've had friends complaining that they can hear a bleed through in my mic.  Still working on that to see if I can resolve that issue.    Overall, I really love this headset.  I'm pointing out my minor quibbles so you don't think these are absolutely flawless headphones.

The problem for lawyers is that this view could well cover a large number of legal areas.<br /><br />Therefore, it's not surprising that Lord Woolf, in his Foreword, expresses immense relief for those who are concerned with Britain's reputation for probity that in the last days of Gordon Brown's government, the Act became law. Woolf accurately identifies the substantial improvements with this new piece of legislation which will have beneficial effects around the world- something which he and his fellow judges are well aware of because we are not dealing here with a local problem but one which infects every country. That's why we salute Monty Raphael for producing this excellent OUP/Blackstone guide.<br /><br />Most practitioners find these Blackstone guides invaluable for their advice because they deliver concise and accessible commentaries on the latest legislative reforms, changes and amendments to statute law. The publishers have seen what we need which are publications soon after the legislative enactments with serious and experienced expert analysis by leading lawyers on the scope, extent and effects of the statutes.<br /><br />In addition, the Blackstone Guides Series is always cost-effective giving us a copy of the Act plus key information needs quickly to act as the perfect companion for our main practitioner works to give us a unique additional updating service to compliment formal updates which often lack the depth we require without time-consuming legal research.<br /><br />Raphael explains in 150 pages and 12 chapters how the Act reforms the law of corruption and introduces a controversial new corporate offence to enable the prosecution of companies associated with the individual or business accused of corruption. Of future interest to us will be the development of the defence of `adequate provisions' for companies accused of committing the corporate.<br /><br />This Guide is extremely timely although, as Lord Woolf suggests, it's clear that there will be demands for further editions as we see how the new law settles down, and whether it has worked or not. The bulk of the book covers an introduction and background to the general bribery offences and then looks specifically at the following important areas: bribery of foreign public officials; the failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery; defences; facilitation payments, corporate hospitality, promotional expenditure, and commission payments; consent to prosecute; outcomes, penalties and remedies; investigation and prosecution; and international and domestic instruments.<br /><br />Monty Raphael has set out a quick reference tool here which is logically organized and follows the structure of the Act which is set out in the first Appendix.

What should they cost in 2011?  How are costs determined?  Where do you go for authoritative, well informed, reliable advice?<br /><br />Well, whether you're a solicitor, barrister, judge, or cost draftsman, your first port of call will almost certainly be \\"Cook on Costs 2011\\", and it is easily the least formidable for most professionals associated with legal matters today.<br /><br />Michael Cook has long been known for his expertise in this complicated area which inevitably lends itself all too often to dissension and dispute.  But here you have Cook's up to date, authoritative and easily accessible work which focuses on the practical aspects of costs, with clear, straightforward explanation and examination of every aspect of the remuneration of solicitors and barristers for work done.<br /><br />Thoroughly and comprehensively, Cook covers the entitlement and quantification of contentious and non-contentious legal business brilliantly, and it includes costs between the parties and family costs.  Private and public funding of litigation is also covered and the text is helpfully illustrated with decided cases, many of which you won't find in the law reports.  There are verbatim extracts from all landmark costs judgments and all the relevant statutes, rules and regulations governing civil costs are also included.<br /><br />Law Society President Michael Napier has put it succinctly saying that the funding of litigation - whether the case can be funded and who pays what to whom at the end - has become a new and essential skill for litigators everywhere!<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Cook on Costs\\" which has been with us since 1991, is now annual helping the profession `steer its way through the costs maze' very effectively.  Napier has added that due to the `dizzying pace of change'- recalling that the law lords have gone, and solicitors are no longer `of the Supreme Court' but `of the Senior Courts' to site only two examples- a reference work like this needs to be published yearly. So, that is what \\"Cook on Costs\\" actually is today: the 2011 annual edition of this familiar title, which first came on the scene 20 years ago.<br /><br />\\"Cook on Costs 2011\\" remains an invaluable work of reference across the legal profession, including in addition to the straightforward pithy text, the tables of statutes...statutory instruments...Civil  Procedure Rules...Practice Directions about costs supplementing CPR Parts 43 to 48...non-statutory provisions...and cases, and also Michael Cook's great sense of descriptive humour.<br /><br />With the modern landscape of costs, Cook has kept pace with the dizzying change and we are all grateful to him for his wisdom and keen understanding of this perplexing aftermath of litigation- a full statement of costs suitable for the second decade of the 21st century!dizzying pace of change'- recalling that the law lords have gone, and solicitors are no longer `of the Supreme Court' but `of the Senior Courts' to site only two examples- a reference work like this needs to be published yearly.

0312600844|5.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />We are introduced to a variety of characters in this book, as we follow their lives over a period of time. The story is not necessarily told in chronological order, in particular a part of the book where we are given a person's backstory told from their point of view from an autobiography they were instructed to write by their therapist.<br /><br />The main characters in this story include Patty and Walter, a couple that met in college where Patty was a star basketball player and Walter an ideological intellectual planning to help resolve the planet's ecological crises. They have two children, a daughter named Jessical and a problematic son named Joey. Add into this mix Walter's best friend, a womanizer musician named Richard and a host of other supporting characters.<br /><br />We read this book for book club, and it was interesting to hear that people either seemed to really like the book or they really, really didn't. The criticism I heard most was that they didn't find the characters believable - neither their actions or speech. I wondered whether some of the disappointment was due to the huge hype for this book (hard to hit high expectations) but I'm not sure that was it.<br /><br />For me this book absolutely clicked, and I loved it from page one. I just think Jonathan Franzen is a brilliant writer, and I often found myself highlighting various passages just because I thought they were so clever and smart. Such as:<br /><br /> \\"She was afire with a plan for them to study together every evening, afire with affection for Patty and fear of losing her; and Patty having opened her eyes painfully to Carter's nature went ahead and closed them to Eliza's.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, but I would also say that if you not enjoying it from the start then this may not be the book for you. I loved it from the start, although I will admit that I thought it should have ended just a bit earlier. I was also a big fan of this author's earlier novel, [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections: A Novel]] although being a fan of that book does not guarantee your liking this one, as I've learned from others.1273 The Corrections: A Novel]] although being a fan of that book does not guarantee your liking this one, as I've learned from others.
0307460444|3.0|I bought this book for my brother for Christmas since he loves baking. We chose the red velvet as our first recipe and we ended up having two trays of sunken cupcakes instead of those that matched the pretty picture on the front of the book. We followed all of the ingredients to spec so it was not a mistake that they turned out this way. After much reading I discovered it could be fixed with a substitution of the baking soda instead of the baking powder (as the recipe calls for). I have not tried it yet but I expected not to have to tamper with recipes when I bought this book. Overall though, lots of great ideas within and has some fun decoration tips as well.

030746363X|5.0|This is a great book. You have to pay attention to the introduction and the instructions. He warns readers NOT to read the book straight through like a novel. Use it more as a how to guide reading specific parts together and skipping the parts that are not directly relevant. He breaks the book down into different goals and what part(s) to read to help with those goals.   If you read straight through, there will be inconsistencies and conflicting information. I dont see that as a drawback because the point of the book is to accomplish certain goals as efficiently as possible. Not do everything at once. So something that might help with one goal may hurt or at least not be part of the most efficient path to a similar goal.     Its only $13 for a hardcover right now. Buy it and form your own opinion!

Kvothe (pronounced Quothe, like Quote I believe) is a phenomenal narrator, not simply because he has lived a life worth telling, but for his storytelling; as he speaks, he understands himself and we learn more of him than he has ever known of himself. Kvothe is flawed, arrogant, scared, passionate, and most importantly, he exists beyond the pages and is real.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Undoubtedly the original STAR WARS Trilogy is one of the few outstanding modern myths of the 20th Century which had a major impact on culture and contained a variety of philosophical and spiritual lessons or meanings we were to believe would also reflect what its creator had in mind, then.    Unfortunately, this has considerably changed if not escalated to some form of perversion, where we have to assume that the creator no longer shares these beliefs but - on the contrary - is rejecting these.    One of the core lessons of STAR WARS, both original and prequel trilogy, is that frustration, fear and anger lead to the \\"dark side\\".  If the creator feels this lesson to be still valid, one may think that within his sphere of influence he would make sure, that he would not be the source of frustration, fear and anger.  Unfortunately, it turns out that it is exactly his rigid reluctance to showcase the original theatrical edition in the contemporary HD format, which is the source of frustration, fear and anger among many fans whose investments helped George Lucas to realize his dreams.    Another core leson of the original trilogy had been the ability for a character to change, to undergo personal transformation and achieve spiritual growth and redemption.  George Lucas' rigid reluctance to showcase the original theatrical edition in the contemporary HD format seems to me to be vastly incompatible with this lesson. If he would change his mind on the subject this would add considerable gravitas and authenticity to this particular lesson!    And as for the prequel trilogy I understood that a strong democracy is absolutely necessary to withstand the evils of a dictatorship or an oligarchy. However, given how George Lucas is constantly denying the requests of the loyal fans from the beginning and handles the issue with the attitude of a dictator or emperor, I cannot help but doubt if he is actually serious about the messages he conveys as he is obviously above the \\"law\\" and will not take to heart the lessons he is preaching. This is not putting your money where your mouth is.    In terms of visualization this scenario reminds me of the climax in RETURN OF THE JEDI with George Lucas playing the Emperor and the audiences Luke Skywalker: \\"Your lust for HD has made you powerful. Now purchase STAR WARS on Blu-Ray!\\" \\"I'll never appreciate the special editions. I like the theatrical editions, like my father before me...\\"    The original Boston Tea Party was about \\"No taxation without representation\\". I feel somehow unable to invest any extra dime in the upcoming Blu-Ray edition, as long as my humble request for the theatrical editions is not represented.  In A NEW HOPE George Lucas was providing a sympathethic portrayal of rebellion but now it seems he no longer shares this view as he is presiding over the opposite side.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My 15 month old son enjoys this toy very much when he takes a bath. I can't believe i was not about to buy it because of the reviews. But when i carefully read them I realized how ridiculous they were! For those who don't like it because there is no \\"hoop hole\\" must lack some common sense. Hello! get some scissors and cut a freakin hole! Anyway my son likes it withOUT the hole because it teaches him to put all his bath toys away in the basket. He loves putting them in and taking them out. And if he's happy, I'm happy! I rate this toy FIVE stars because it's simple, fun, and your child can enjoy their intire bath playing with that. So don't listen to the bad reviews because most of them talk about that silly hole! LMAO!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the first book I purchased with my Kindle. I can honestly say that this is the first book in a long time I have read cover to cover without wanting to put it down. For anyone who is interested in a good story I would highly recommend this book.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Some of these reviews are harsh and unfair.  Not every literaty piece has to be deep and moving, earth shattering or devotional.  What I got from this memoir was one person's expiernece in breaking whatever mold was laid out for her.  It was a story about her choosing to walk her own path and find her place amungst the chaos of her life.  There is no dubt that this plan was one that she was able to creat do to privlage, but this none the less was her journey to find out who she was and where she belonged.  If you are looking for someone's interospective journey through life as a person conflicted with the stresses of society's norms and her own battle with depression.      The reviews listed here seem to ridicule the fact that Gilberts plight is less and there for she should get over herself.  After reading this book there is no doubt in my mind that Gilbert was able to get through her personal circumstance to see the world for what it truely is.  She expeirance showed her the very things that these people are critsizing her for.      In short, if you are looking for someone's introspect on trying to find themselves through a long and elaborate journey, read this book.  If you are looking for a deeper look into the plights of impoverish nations and one person's quest to define god, read Mother Tearesa's biography.

1594202842|1.0|Chua's view about Chinese mother is shockingly biased or she just wants to use CHINESE to catch readers' eyes. If so, don't be cheated by her marketing strategy.     AS A CHINESE MOTHER, I DON'T WANT TO BE REPRESENTED BY AMY CHUA!     I was born and raised in China. I was not raised in Amy Chua's way. I don't believe in her way. My kids are still very little. But after they are old enough to go to school, I will never raise them in Amy Chua's way either.     All the Chinese parents I know here in the US are not parenting their kids in Amy Chua's way either. Education is important, but we also value many other things, such as healthy personality, happiness, kindness, and responsibility.... Success and fame to us are not as important as what are to Amy Chua.     I guess many other Chinese mothers who are not like Amy Chua don't want to be represented by her either.     Even though Amy Chua once clarified that she uses the \\"Chinese mother\\" and \\"Western mother\\" terms loosely; unfortunately, she overwhelmingly gives everybody impression that the demanding \\"cold-blooded\\" parenting style she talks about is what CHINESE mothers usually do.    If Chua wants to talk about \\"permissive mother\\" or \\"demanding mother\\", say so. Or she can just use \\"mother Amy Chua\\" to represent herself. Why does she use an ethnicity-orientated term, which is inaccurate and offensive to many of us who don't want to be represented!     I felt hurt when reading Amy Chua's writing. Chinese mothers are not those cold-blooded controlling monsters and Chinese kids are not the emotionless learning machines--the impression Amy Chua creates.      DON'T BUY!

B0029QRA1U|5.0|First I love this turntable but wanted to store my music on my hard drive converted to MP3. I installed the software for the turntable then installed Itunes.Couldn't make things work as I wanted so I uninstalled Itunes. I have an old edition of roxio cd creator,[it's 10 years old. 5th edition.]. I click on the desktop icon for the turntable, then click next. Then I open my Roxio, and a few clicks later I am recoding my music to the file I created, in MP3. If you don't want to spend the bucks for the latest Roxio you could probably get an older version like mine somewhere. Truthfully I'm happy as a lark with this turntable and my own setup. Hope this may help some people out there.

B001JNNDBA|4.0|Donnie Darko doesn't strike me as suspenseful horror in any shape or form.  More like light elements of psychological weirdness that never really hits you on a deep personal note.    It basically consists of a teenager constantly questioning his reality, questioning the possibilities of time travel, and wonders what would happen if you were to change the past so it never happened.  Mental problems perhaps a tad worse than usual for a confused teenager contributes to some wild, hallucinating effects.    Now when I was a teenager, I went through problems similar to the kid playing the role of Donnie Darko.  I'd confuse and worry myself silly *almost* to the point I'd wonder if my existence was even real or not.  This resulted in questioning whether the universe was actually real among other crazy problems.  Nothing really out of the ordinary there- most teenagers go through the same phase.  We grow out of them eventually (at least, most of us do) as we accept that death is inevitable, so I can totally see why Donnie Darko is a huge hit among the younger crowd.    Perhaps I'm too old to really appreciate it, but many of the scenes felt rather cheesy with Donnie constantly seeing odd, orb-like transparent snake images floating directly in front of his family members and friends while they were walking around the house.  Supposedly the theme is that Donnie was seeing images of a terrible situation that couldn't be avoided.  However...    I don't want to spoil the ending because that would ruin everything, but you may be shocked by the conclusion.      If anything, Donnie Darko delivers with an interesting storyline that makes you wonder where it's going, and that's it.  I honestly didn't sense any truly earth-shattering deep meaning here.  Obviously the rabbit creature *itself* isn't supposed to be scary- it makes you think because it's an unexplainable hallucination.  So people who are putting down the rabbit creature because it's not scary... well, imagine looking in the mirror and seeing something like that.  Yeah, it would definitely be alarming *then*.    Anyway, I really do like Donnie Darko.  There's a variety of characters each with their own assortment of problems and the storyline does a great job focusing and giving enough time to each one of them.  However, the ending... haha.  That ending is just not too good if you ask me.  Perhaps I wasn't looking for a simple explanation after all.
1594202842|5.0|To what?<br /><br />To the mamby pamby relativism promoted by the 1970's bestselling I'm OK, You're OK, and other expressions of feel-good pop psychology like it.<br /><br />And so, everybody is praised, whether their conduct and performance merit it or not, and lukewarm applause greets endless processions of prize winners at school events designed to bolster self esteem by ensuring nobody is a loser.<br /><br />Into this environment storms Amy Chua, self proclaimed Tiger Mother, screaming, cajoling, belittling and otherwise bullying her children in a single minded and manifestly obsessive drive for excellence.<br /><br />OK everybody, settle down, take a deep breath, don't get so bent out of shape.<br /><br />The author admits that much in her approach to parenting is over the top. As she herself writes, \\"This was supposed (italicized for emphasis) to be a story about how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old\\".<br /><br />Also, you can dial back the politically correct indignation at the cultural stereotyping in referring to \\"Chinese\\" as opposed to \\"Western\\" practices. Chua tackles this on page 4 of the book, describing in detail how she is using the terms \\"Chinese mother\\" and Western parents\\" loosely. She goes on, \\"I recently met a supersuccessful white guy from South Dakota...and after comparing notes we decided that his working-class father had definitely been a Chinese mother. I know some Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Irish, and Ghanaian parents who qualify too. Conversely, I know some mothers of Chinese heritage...who are not Chinese mothers, by choice or otherwise\\".<br /><br />This really is a very good book. Rather than the prescriptive handbook that many are characterizing (and reacting to) it as, it's an insightful and often profound memoir of an exceptional and very interesting family. Engagingly written and with much self deprecating wit, it explores deep questions about culture, values, achievement, love, responsibility, and ultimately what it means to be human.<br /><br />Highly recommended.much self deprecating wit, it explores deep questions about culture, values, achievement, love, responsibility, and ultimately what it means to be human.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Let's be honest, zombie movies are rarely ever scary.  They're only able to provide short term laughs but never any actual substantial fear.    Zombieland is pretty short on the zombie appearances for the most part, having lengthy segments near the middle of the film devoted more to the four main characters getting to know each other inside Bill Murray's mansion.  The zombie attack-fest doesn't really occur until the final 20 minutes and of course, the first 5 minutes.  The zombies are apparently speed runners too.    For most of the storyline, we experience teenagers acting fairly normal, and in the case of the teenage boy, his goal apparently is to find a way to have a relationship with the one brunette girl he finds attractive.      Woody Harrelson provides most of the laughs, acting like one of the teenagers himself most of the time and coming across like he's sort of drunk and unaware of his surroundings.  I've seen him act the same way in other films so it's not exactly a surprise.    I did like the clever ways the two teenage girls get to the boys as a means to stay alive from the zombie outbreak involving sneaky tricks (one of them taking place in a grocery store, the other outside in the middle of the main highway).    Woody Harrelson's long running twinkie gag was hysterical, and the entire carnival scene was well done.  A great comedy for zombie... lovers or haters?  Maybe both?  Who knows!

1742149332|5.0|Distant Hours is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of Kate Morton's about past mysteries coming to light, which in turn prompt soul-searching in the present day. When a long-lost letter arrives in the mail, Edie Burchill takes a journey to Milderhurst Castle, a structure whose better days are long since passed. Edie's mother was billeted there fifty years ago; the twin Blythe spinsters live there now, and devote most of their time to taking care of their youngest sister, who hasn't been quite right since her fiance abandoned her in 1941. Edie's journey teaches her more about her mother's life, and the truth of what her mother lived through in \\"the distant past\\", then she ever could have anticipated, in this thoughtful and evocative character drama. Highly recommended, especially for public library audiobook collections. 18 CDs, 22 hours 44 min.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is a deeply moving piece of Science Fiction with action that is more like a video game and virtual reality.  I rented this video recenty and even though I had seen the trailers I was pleasantly surprised at the story line and the overall action and even the intrigue involved.<br /><br />Although the concept is a dream within a dream and so on, there are a couple of stories within the overall story of what we find Leonardo Dicaprio's team is able to do.  Fascinating concept of dreaming with others, not sure if there is some overall message they are attempting to get across, but it is a rather cool concept of group dreams to manipulate the thoughts or to share the ideas of others.<br /><br />When thinking of the concept, I thought of the Matrix in reverse, you place yourself in an unreal world of your making, but you need others to help you build and interact with it.  I would imagine there are virtual reality sites already taking advantage of this in the world of Web 3.0.<br /><br />Besides the overall exciting story and time line and the action in getting the mission accomplished, the special effects are enjoyable and the methodology thought up for the dream state and getting in and out of it seemed well thought out and seemingly also without holes.  Some times there are obvious holes in a story that you find something was left unaddressed creating an inconsistency.  At first pass, there seemed to be no inconsistency in the film, making it even better.<br /><br />The flick takes you to Mombassa Kenya of all places, along with Europe and Asia.  The virtual worlds are really cool, and it is really and imagination fest.<br /><br />Inception is a fun movie and a nice distraction for a rainy or snowy day.  It is longer than many movies, so if you are viewing on a week night, leave enough time to watch it.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can understand a lot of the arguments on these reviews about Lucas releasing edited versions, etc. And thats fine, I imagine if you are a completist/enthusiast of the movies as much as most people, you already have the DVDs with the original versions, not to say you shouldnt desire them on Blu Ray. For someone like me, I remember watching them when I was younger, had the toys, got back into it during the re-releases, played the card game, had the newer toys, but never picked them up on vhs/dvd. And ever since some of the bigger movies have been released on Blu Ray, I eagerly awaited this release, even though I would still consider myself a casual fan. Who shot first is immaterial to me, I'll enjoy them just the same.  Ive also never seen any of the prequels and hadn't intended to, but seeing as how buying the full 6 movie set is the only way to get the special features, I suppose its time to give them a whirl.

1400079144|2.0|My favorite book that I read by Dan Brown is Angels and Demons, followed by Davinci Code.    This book was good (albeit not great) at first, until there's a death at The Temple (I don't want to ruin the book by telling you who dies and how there), but the last fifth of the book, which follows this death becomes more like a classroom, with no though for emotions or characters.  That part was such a dull read that it easily knocked the book down from a 3.5 star for me (not sure that I would have rounded up to a 4-more like a 3 star) to a 2 star.    In the first part, the characters seemed to all react in similar fashion, as the other reviewer, Justin Lee said.  ie, character one is relaxing, character two tells character one something, character one reacts to it in some dramatic fashion.  Now, this would be ok, except it happens in the book very often.  Kind of like a child would write a story, which gets annoying.  The last part of the book (the last 20% or so) seems to be ideas that Dan Brown wanted to communicate to the reader, but either couldn't be bothered or didn't know how to squeeze them into the first part of the book, and basically takes a lecture approach, and slaps a few dialogue lines and a few semi-human reactions into it.    The saving grace of the book (well, at least the first 4/5 of it) is the usual Dan Brown sense of mysticism/history in the story.    Bottom line is I would still read the book, perhaps (well, DEFINITELY) recommending to stop reading after the climax, with the death in The Temple.

0374158460|2.0|The unhappy want two things - they want an excuse and they want to believe people who seem happy are really as miserable as themselves. Franzen, who is not a great writer, succeeds instead by providing the product the unhappy want. (and manipulating reviewers and Oprah with a carefully contrived 'author persona') His stories, which all involve the rot infesting outwardly successful families, and the link between bad, bad society and that rot, satisfy both desires. They make the case unhappy people are just victims, they could never have had successful marriages because after all there are corrupt vendors supplying the war in the middle east, or whatever... They also demonstrate that all families are cruel disasters, and the ones which seem happy are the cruelest and most disastrous. What a relief to those who might otherwise envy happy familes! Phew - if your family is a mess have no fear, just read Franzen and you'll soon realize it isn't your fault and no one's doing any better than you.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  try this sample comment, left about a 5 star review:  &#34;Whew, do you ever make a great case for this book.

B0016PM722|4.0|I bought this lightsaber to display in my home theater along with a Master Replicas Episode V Darth Vader Force FX saber and a Vader print I owned. Anyone claiming that the Hasbro sabers are of lesser quality when compared to the older Master Replicas versions are just trying to be loyal to the MR brand. The build quality is just as impressive, the light effect exactly the same, and the sound is actually louder. The only negative I can see about the Anakin light saber is that the on/off switch is in a location that's easy to accidently switch it off if you're swinging it around. Don't be scared off by the Hasbro name...it's the closest you'll ever get to having the real thing.
0743437497|4.0|I will say, I never read this book until now because I was so in love with the original Stanley Kubrick film. The film is one of my favorites and reading the book was tough to do because my vision of the Stephen King novel wouldn't fit my already well established memory of the film. However, the novel was excellent, in that the background of the characters and the settings had plenty of details that provided great background to the film version as to the motivations of the characters.   I know now: what really haunts the overlook, I now know why Jack was predisposed to go insane like he did and I found that very refreshing. King paints a very creepy atmosphere, especially the part were the elevators would move on their own with no one around, and open up into empty darkness, that really creeped me out. Also Dick Halloran's character is much more explained, and fleshed out as to his background. I especially enjoyed his actions in trying to get to the overlook after Danny beckons for him, again this was refreshing. If you've seen the movie and really thought it was great, the book will be to fill in small details. I highly recommend it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Yes!!!! finally...after reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders I hit the nail!!!! Ok..I play in a really LOUD metal band...none of us are record savvy or anything like that...we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out. But we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember \\"that riff\\" for the next rehearsal. We tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice, well the ZOOM H4N changed everything. Simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just....well INCREDIBLE...for such a little thing...no distortion of any kind (just be careful where you place it). I still need to read a lot of the users manual...but take my word...I hate those manuals...I figure how to use it (extremely basic) and just hit the REC button and rock out. Finally when I came back home I plug it into my pc and I was amazed by the quality of the sound...we recorded in 4CH mode with two extra mics...and man....I havent even tried the multi channel mode yet!!!    thanks ZOOM...now rocking and basic recording it´s how it´s supposse to be....SIMPLE AND FUN.    cheers!!!
1449575617|5.0|If you like Dickens, chances are you will like \\"Woman in White\\" by Wilkie Collins. The story is well-structured and suspenseful, told in the voice of various characters central to the story, but this is mainly the gallant Walter Hartright's narrative (heart right?). On assignment to the country home of the Fairlies in Cumberland to teach drawing to Laura and her half-sister Marion, he falls in love with the delicately beautiful, sweet and virtuous Laura. Of all the characters, Laura's appears the least well drawn, which may lead the reader to wonder about Walter's attraction for her when he (and the author) seems to have more admiration for the feisty Marion, who is not strictly a woman of her times and makes no secret of resenting the shackles that Victorian society places on women. The hypochondriac uncle and the Italians, Pesca and Fosco, are particularly well-delineated characters. Collins' background in law serves the story well.  (I read a library Penguin edition, with a lot of misplaced commas. A page was missing a third of the way through, and so I downloaded a Kindle version to read the errant page; better punctuation. Another comment regarding the editions: I have yet to see a cover that actually resembles Laura as described in the book!)

B000P0J09W|5.0|Watching \\"The Goonies\\" again brought back many good memories of watching it when it first came out in 1985 with my oldest son.  We both loved this movie and I am quite sure my son imagined himself being a Goonie, having this wonderful gang of friends, treasure hunting.<br /><br />I think the movie has held up well even though 26 years have gone by since it first came out.  Yes, there are some dated parts of the movie: hair styles, clothes, glasses, bicycles - but overall this is a movie that even in another 26 years, young and old will still enjoy.<br /><br />There is big business vs. small property owner; escaped convicts; young love; bullies; friendship; treasure hunting; pirates; a giant; puzzles to figure out; brotherly competition; and good winning out over evil.  These are all pretty timeless themes.<br /><br />These young actors got a good start in this movie.  Most have gone on to much bigger things.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater the first two times, and to do it justice, it really should be seen on the big screen.  That said, I'm glad that it's out on DVD (although I wish I had gotten blu-ray) because now I can go back and rewatch all the disasters over and over so I don't miss any of the special effects.<br /><br />Not only are the CG beyond jaw dropping but there is quite a list of great actors too:  John Cusack, Danny Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Woody Harrelson, John Billingsley, George Segal.<br /><br />The plot is pretty weak but what the heck - that's not why I went to see this movie and I bet a lot of others agree with me.  The plot is alright; not terrible.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING:<br />One of my few problems that I had with \\"2012\\" is one I've seen mentioned in other reviews - only the powerful and/or rich were being allowed onto the Arks for saving.  A very sad commentary on our future world in case of disaster, I must say.<br /><br />Otherwise, this was a spectacular thrill a second journey to the Himalayas and beyond.
0545123275|5.0|What first drew me to this book was the cover.  It was different, clean, and relaxing.  Much different than others YA Paranormal book covers, which are dark.  I downloaded it to my iPod and I read the book in an afternoon.  I could not put this book down.  The plot was refreshing and different.  It is better than the Twilight Saga.  The love is just as strong, but in a more mature way.  I thought the take on werewolves was a nice change to how werewolves are usually portrayed.  The story starts out with you getting a sense of who Sam and Grace are.  Grace is a human girl who befriends a wolf.  She has always felt very connected to this wolf.  Sam is this wolf.  In this book, werewolves do not change with the normal moon patterns that we expect from werewolf books.  The shift with the changing of the seasons.  When it is cold they are a wolf, 24/7.  When it is warm they are human.  Basically Winter = wolf, Summer = human.  After Sam is wounded by a hunter in his wolf form, he turns into a human despite it being the dead of winter.  Grace finds him on her back porch and immediately knows that he is her wolf.  She takes care of him and he sleeps in her room with her.  They begin to fall in love with each other.  Their love is refreshing.  It is a strong love, one they cannot live without, but it is done in a mature way.  I always found Bella in the Twilight Saga to be very naive and somewhat selfish in her love for Edward, always saying they were not equals and she was not good enough for him because she was a puny human while he was God-like.  In Shiver, Grace and Sam are equals and trust in each other despite being vastly different.  There are other characters that are important in this book and begin to evolve in the second book, Linger.  Sam and Grace each have different family lives and obstacles to overcome, but they do it together.  I don't want to reveal too much of the book.  It is a very good read, as is the second, and I cannot wait for the third and last book.ok.

I am also frustrated by the number of books featuring animals that then refer to ALL of those animals as he...but that's another conversation.  This is a great book for boys and girls, my three year old chooses it for bedtime most nights and the 3 month old seems vaguely interested :)

0439023491|5.0|After the shattering events of The Hunger Games Katniss finds herself in even more danger.  When she and her fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta took a stand at the end of the last Games, forcing the Capitol to choose between two victors or none, they inadvertently became the symbols, and heart, of the brewing rebellion.  Naturally this paints a bulls-eye on them for the Capitol.  They must navigate a continuously more difficult field to ensure the safety of not only themselves, but their families.<br /><br />As you may remember, when I finished The Hunger Games I was practically salivating for the rest of the story.  I was beyond thankful that I had both of the next two books available to me, and didn't have to wait a year (or more) to get to the end.<br /><br />Katniss hardly has a moment to rest, and begin to deal with the trauma that her bout in the Hunger Games had left her with before she found herself within the Capitol's sight again.  The victory tour of the twelve Districts is a yearly, and necessary, event she has no choice in.  She's hardly looking forward to it, but when she comes home to discover President Snow in her home with barely veiled threats, her future looms before her as a terrifying thing.<br /><br />Now Katniss finds herself with the task of convincing the people of the Districts that she has never had an intention of standing against the powerful Capitol, but that she and Peeta are desperately in love - and it was that which caused her to make that heart-stopping choice.  Not only that, but she must convince the President himself, a person that has Katniss's death in his eyes, a thing even she can see.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a rocketing-fast, nail-biting, action-filled, heart-wrenching sequel to The Hunger Games.  I was immediately drawn into the story, and it did not let me go until I finished, at four in the morning.  There's a wonderful blend of action, world building, and increased character growth and depth.  I simply couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />The pacing here is another thing that's absolutely fantastic.  The tension continues to build, with hardly any let up, and at the same time doesn't sacrifice anything of the character development.  The plot is tightly woven and continues to build on the events and machinations only hinted at in The Hunger Games.  And I'll freely admit to being shocked, truly shocked, a few times in the story.  There are few things that I love more than a novel that can keep me in suspense.<br /><br />The love triangle, that appears to be somewhat necessary in young-adult novels these days, is more deeply explored in Catching Fire and while I'm not generally a fan of this particular trope, I have to admit that it's handled really well here.  It's not only believable, it's understandable.  One of the things I loved was seeing Katniss explore her own feelings and struggling to come to terms with them.  While she cares, deeply, she's not the most emotional person.  She is eminently practical and tries to apply that to what she feels, not always with the greatest results.  It's when she's not thinking about things that I think we get the clearest glimpse into her heart.  So while there were times that I wanted to smack her and tell her to stop trying to rationalize everything, I still completely stood by her while she worked through all these very difficult feelings and thoughts.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games the cast of players was relatively few.  Not so here, there are a multitude of secondary characters that we're introduced to in this novel.  Many of them felt like they deserved their own stories told, some were only around shortly, but each one felt fully developed with a complete history and personality.  We also revisit those that we first met in The Hunger Games, learning more and yet still left with questions.  One of my favorite new characters is Finnick, whom I couldn't help but love and hope to see much more of.<br /><br />All in all, Catching Fire more than lived up to my expectations.  In fact, it blew them away.  I was immediately, once again, enthralled in the world Suzanne Collins created and, upon finishing, couldn't wait to delve into the final book in the trilogy.ore than lived up to my expectations.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered this series on Netflix. I really enjoy the characters and creativity this series has. Over the series, characters become more complex. I like the humor and commentary on today's society via the future.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I suspect this is one of those books that you like very much, or do not like much at all. I kept looking for a plot, or even a point the author was trying to make. Couldn't find either. I wouldn't care to read it again.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|First, I must say that having seen Serenity before the series a few years ago & then after the watching the series recently, one really ought to see the Firefly TV series before seeing Serenity. The characters & their plights are continued from the too-soon canceled series. Granted, the story line runs thin at times and some of the characters seem a little overdone. So what if one can tell what's CG in certain screens. Serenity is action-packed.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|I love the Resident Evil francise: The movies, the games, the story, everything. This movie was not very good.  First of all, it went by so quickly that when the credits come up, you're left confused. The main climax to the story didn't seem so big so it makes you think there should've been more to the story.  Definately not worth the purchase. If you feel like you need to see it, rent it. Sorry. I was really excited about seeing this, and it was nothing.
1594488843|5.0|Sometimes in the direct sales industry, we joke about \\"More carrots! Less sticks!\\" when working to develop promotions and programs to drive our sales forces. Another common phrase is \\"What gets rewarded, gets repeated.\\" In the book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink, the author says \\"carrots and sticks\\" as drivers of productivity are ineffective remnants of a business environment of the past.<br /><br />He spends a lot of time setting up the premise that what worked in factories, with training and management, just doesn't translate to our current service economy, an economy where we rely on the creativity of the workforce to fuel innovation and boost results. It was interesting to make connections between the things he was saying about modern work environments and the studying I was doing with my college-age son on training theory and application.<br /><br />What was inspiring about Pink's premise is the idea that what truly drives people - at work and at home - is the desire to grow and develop. This search to reach our fullest potential and be a part of something bigger than ourselves and to have real pride in our \\"product\\" is so much more life affirming than the conventional wisdom that we are all looking for more money, perks, or status. People are looking for purpose and they can find it in the most mundane tasks when they're permitted to be creative and inject pride into their work.<br /><br />In fact, his studies reveal that rewarding behavior with \\"carrots\\" seems to take the natural fun out of it. Almost as if rewarding our journey for potential with something as crass as a bonus changes things so much that we lose our inner drive. And, the studies also show that fear of loss, those terrible \\"sticks,\\" is just as ineffectual. It was fascinating to read the examples. Even as someone with a lot of experience inspiring people individually and as groups, I found myself surprised by the outcomes of well-meaning incentive programs.<br /><br />This book is an interesting and deceptively short read. Though the book is full size, much of the second half is broken up into sections for specific application. Sections like a glossary, a summary of the book, and further exploration of \\"Type I\\" approach to motivation, with the \\"I\\" standing for \\"intrinsic.\\" There is also a reading list and a \\"Type I Toolkit\\" along with other tools. Those who love the first half of the book might be interested in picking and choosing which parts of the second half they'd like to dig into.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for anyone in business who wonders how work could be structured to encourage the most productivity from a team. This would also be a great book for someone who's feeling a little ho-hum about work and wants to explore the studies about what contributes to a happy work life and the achievement of more \\"flow\\" and satisfaction.an interesting and deceptively short read.

0385493622|2.0|Writing a layman's account of a topic in pure mathematics is much more difficult than, say, physics since one is denied the easy recourse to tantalising images of time travel, worm holes and visiting alien civilisations where all the inhabitants look like Sophie Marceau.<br /><br />Dr. Singh compensates for this shortcoming by filling the pages with a rather banally written history of some of the mathematics and mathematicians involved in the three-century effort to prove the cited theorem.  Most of this is so elementary as to be offensive to all but the most immature and uneducated reader.  To be sure, some of the important maths relating to elliptic curves can be easily understood by an alert child.  But when Dr. Singh begins to describe the remarkable relation to modular forms (the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture), his rhetoric fails and the narrative degenerates from infantile simplicity to worthless twaddle.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book does offer the slower witted amongst us a taste of the excitement of research in pure maths and for that, alone, it is valuable.<br /><br />While the gross aspects of Wiles' proof can be understood by a competent undergraduate, the details are probably accessible to only a scarce hundred people in the world.  An excellent exposition for the budding mathematician or non-specialist is provided by van der Poorten's \\"Notes on Fermat's Last Theorem,\\" which I highly recommend.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|Like most people who bought this DVD as soon as it came out (ordered in advance, actually), I am a HUGE Zeppelin fan, and an admirer of Edge.  I knew very little about Jack White, so I was curious to say the least.  After watching the film twice back to back, I came away impressed.  First, the audio quality is outstanding.  If you have a high-end audio system like me, crank this baby up and enjoy.  I won't make this review a novel, but I will say that all three performers were outstanding.  I got goosebumps when Jimmy walked in the door at Headley Grange, and reflected on recording Led Zeppelin IV there, even pointing out where they placed Bonzo's drums under the staircase because of the unique sound the echo produced.  Being only a 'casual' fan of Edge, I can say I was really impressed with his talent; his reflection of his old school, and explaining how he started his first band there, is similiar to Page's scene at Headley Grange.  Jack White, who I knew nothing about, truly admires the other two, and he stands alone with his talent as well.  The opening scene with White making a guitar out of a Coke bottle is one of the best scenes in the entire film.  This is well worth checking out, so buy it and see for yourself.
B000002A3T|5.0|I was wary of this CD as Roger Waters was not part of it.    However, I think this is a great CD.  The music is interesting and its haunting nature is a throwback to the Echoes era.

B0012GTZFC|5.0|PROS:        * Provides a researched system of classifying organizations and businesses as \\"tribes\\" that is easy to apply.      * Has useful ideas for helping people \\"tribe up\\" and improve their relations and improve organizational relations.      * Very readable and understandable.      * Doesn't pull punches on some of the conclusions.      CONS:        * Some historical interpretations are arguable.      SUMMARY: Buy this book and read it unless you have no interest in community, leadership, and business.  In that case you're probably not even reading this blog.    Leadership books.  I've been getting tired of them ever since people started deciding \\"The Art of War\\" could by applied to businesses if you ignored all the war, killing, use of fire, and soforth in the book.  Everyone talks about Leadership in business and in the world, but as I don't see any improvement out there as the amount of lame Leadership books increase, so I assume most of these texts aren't that useful.    At the same time, I'm very interested of issues in Leadership since I don't see nearly enough of it.  I see bean-counting management, rock-star style poseurs, and exploitative jerks with a narrative.  I don't see enough leadership in business, politics, media, or more - real, rallying, directing, powerful leadership.    Tribal Leadership is the kind of book I've been waiting for.  It not only explores issue of leadership, mostly (but not entirely) dealing with business, but issues of culture, organization, and community.  In many ways its a book of applied sociology that happens to focus mostly on business.    Based on research covering a decade, the book lays out a very clear thesis:       1. Humans naturally form tribes.     2. These tribes can be classified into 5 types each with a unique attitude towards life, and become more functional as you move from Type 1 to Type 5.     3. It is possible to coach people and groups to \\"tribe up\\" the scale to become more cohesive, functional, andproductive (and in some cases at least less pathological)      The book is split between describing the theories, and describing how people and groups can advance from lower to higher Tribal levels.  Each chapter leads naturally to the next, and handy checklists and bulletpoints help you keep track of important ideas.  This clear focus and organization makes the book easy to read, refer to, and use.    As for the theory itself?  It's simple and intuitive  Essentially there are five tribal types, each defined by an attitude of members:  Level 1 - \\"Life Sucks\\" - pathological, gang-like, angry.  Level 2 - \\"My Life Sucks\\" - a mix of learned helplessness, bitterness.  Level 3 - \\"I'm Great\\" - Productive and dynamic but egocentric.  Level 4 - \\"We're Great\\" - tribe-oriented, creative, productive, tight.  Level 5 - \\"Life Is Great\\" - Big-picture, tribe-connecting.    You can probably guess right now which level you and your friends and co-workers function at (hint: you're probably also wrong).    The theory itself is extremely applicable in my experience, and the authors give extensive information to help you understand where you and your various organizations fit on the tribal scale.  The clear boundaries of levels, straightforward explanations, and explanations of the classifications helps you use this theory and see the sheer lack of B.S.  Just be prepared for a few ego-bruises because most people think they function higher than they do (and this book will puncture your illusions).    The theory comes with tips, advice, and directions for raising tribal level of people and organization.  These sections are straightforward with excellent detail, from things to try, to signs to look for to identify personal progress.  Again there's a refreshing lack of B.S. here.    So is the book flawless?  No.  There's a few moments of historical reference and metaphor that seem stretched or that I disagree with.  There could be some better explanation of techniques at a few points.    These are minor concerns.    Here's what you need to know about this book- you should read it unless you have a reason not to, like a lack of money or being currently dead.    How much did I like this book?  I've given two copies as gifts and my Kindle edition is filled with notes, I've joined a group to discuss it, founded another, and am discussing applying it's philosophy with other people.  Yeah, I was impressed.    This is a must-read
B002ZG98LO|3.0|You gotta admire Adrien Brody...the Oscar winning gent has gone from KING KONG to SPLICE to this sci-fi actioner and he has acquitted himself well.  This film is more like the original than a mere sequel and it has some great action sequences and the cast is overall very good.  Laurence Fishburne's cameo seems a little superfluous and overdone but helps in an expository fashion.  It took a little too long IMO to get to the predators but once there, the film maintains good pacing.<br />Overall, Brody made a good action hero and Topher Grace's surprise \\"twist\\" nicely done.

0374290024|3.0|I agree with almost everything in the review posted by PK, above, so I will not repeat his/her arguments here.  Unlike PK, however, I was also disappointed by the last chapter.  Here, Morris breathlessly describes the future as a race between the \\"Singularity\\" of man-machine consciousness and the \\"Nightfall\\" of worldwide nuclear annihilation.  All this is to unfold in just the next hundred or so years as social development in both East and West rises from 1000 to an unbelievable 5000.  It seems to me much more likely that the slope of social development will start to sharply decline as both East and West reach identical levels and then bump up against a new \\"hard ceiling\\" of technology, sociology, and politics.  At that point, there will be a shared material culture common to both East and West, and the world will likely settle into a decidedly familiar competition between two competing superpowers and their allied client states.  Not exactly a Utopian singularity or an end-of-times Armageddon, but just the business-as-usual balance of power politics we know so well.

B000007O9L|3.0|Another studio record, another tour and another live LP, the Stones have made this a familiar pattern in the latter years of their career. `Stripped' was at least an original concept for a live record: record at some concerts set in small theaters and also record some \\"lost classics\\" live in a studio. Was the execution as good as the plan? Well I guess that would be a matter of opinion. `Stripped' is pretty good but I wouldn't say it's much better or worse than any of their eight other live albums. It ain't no `Get Yer Ya-Yas' that's for sure. The title might indicate that `Stripped' is an acoustic affair but that is not the case nor does it only feature the four (four?) Stones without their formidable backing musicians, so I guess one could chagrin and charge them for false advertising? Only kidding, but anyway highlights include \\"Spider and the Fly\\", \\"Love in Vain\\" and \\"Sweet Virginia\\".  \\"Street Fighting Man\\" is also very good and \\"Dead Flowers\\" is given a spirited take. No need for the Dylan tribute, how contrived does that sound? `Stripped' will entertain some and bore others and fifteen years later does anyone really care?
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I grew up on the \\"real\\" annie, meaning the original broadway version, and never liked this 1982 aileen quinn \\"annie\\" film, directed by john huston. I never saw the 1999 Disney one until last night, when i watched it with my four year old daughter.  she wanted to see annie and i made the mistake of showing her this john huston film-- VERY dark, unappealing, and the arrangements of the songs are not good. carol burnett, whom i LOVE, played a very dark version of miss hannigan, drinking, floozing, and actually quite scary and creepy-- totally inappropriate for young children.  i think aileen quinn is extremely unappealing as annie, with none of the charm of andrea mcardle or any of the broadway annies.  the next morning when my daughter asked to watch this again, i had to tell her the dvd was broken, because i just felt it was too dark, and charmless-- even the costumes and sets were without magic (and the jeffrey holder sub-plot is just silly).  My daughter was furious and begging to see annie again, so i did some reading of reviews here on amazon, and found the other one-- the alicia morton/kathy bates version.  it's like night and day!  that one is much more true to the original broadway version-- alicia morton as annie is charming, adorable, a great singer-- tough and sweet, but not saccharin like aileen quinn.  the costumes and sets are charming, the musical arrangements are great, all the performances are strong, and it is great for young audiences.  i am usually not a fan of Disney-fied musicals-- but they did a GREAT job with this one.  and the andrea mcardle cameo was a huge treat for a fan like me.  i had to give this one star for respect for carol burnett, albert finney, and john huston, but i give it a big YUCK for the execution, and the performances. an even bigger yuck for quinn and her hair!!  Skip straight to the TV version with kathy bates, audra mcdonald, alan cumming, and kristen chenowith-- especially if you have children.

Well, it is good music!<br /><br />Even today, decades later, Hotel California has not lost its staying power, and tracks from this album still make the rounds on playlists on my MP3 player.<br /><br />Of course, it may not be likely that the younger generation will buy into more than some of the more popular tracks, but the entire album is enjoyable, listenable, and well-worth my time and money.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!
B001UV4XFG|1.0|What do I have to do to get a widescreen copy of this movie?  I bought a single disc copy at Target the day it came out only to watch it and see everyone's heads chopped off. No returns at Target so I gave that copy away.  I ordered from Amazon carefully checking to see that the two disc special edition was widescreen.  It came in the mail today and it's not. It's standard definition. I am returning it. Didn't even open it once I checked and saw it was not widescreen.  That sucks. Why would anyone even print a movie these days in anything other than widescreen?  I like the Twilight series. I have a copy of the first movie(in widescreen)and saw Eclipse three times at the theatre. Maybe this was a decision by Summit?Again, it sucks.

First of all it's a lot bigger than it looks in the picture but it curves around so it's not annoying big.

I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cheap solution to steadying up their cameras!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I bought this CD as a Christmas gift for my mother. However, she was kind enough to allow me to upload it to my iTunes library. I particularly enjoy the songs which are in Gaelic. It is very soothing music when trying to sleep, or to just relax and get some work done. I think this album is just as good as \\"A New Journey\\" and \\"A Christmas Celebration.\\"
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I enjoy strategy games and when I am forced to read text I usually consider it to be an annoying chore.  So I had to clear my mind when I bought 999 because I heard that there is a lot of text.  After I started to play I realized right away that the text in 999 is so well written that reading is what makes this game so awesome.  There are puzzles that blend seamlessly into the story, however, I just wanted to keep reading because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.   BTW, if you get stuck on a puzzle, there are FAQs in the internet that you can consult.   After you finish one ending you'll want to play it again because it leaves you hanging and hungry for more.  Each unique ending adds new information about the characters and/or the story.  I have finished 4 out of the 6 endings and they have blown me away.   I have never played a game that had me freaked out like this.   999 is easily one of the best games I have ever played.  However, it is not for everyone because it is more of an interactive novel than a game.  Do yourself a favor if you play this game - do it in a quiet place where there are no distractions like TV, people talking, etc. because they will detract from the chilling and suspenseful gaming experience.
B0021L8V0W|2.0|*Spoiler*<br /><br />So Angelina Jolie is exposed as a Russian agent...spends most of the movie running from her coworkers at the CIA because she swears she's not. Then she kills some guy as her duty to a Russian agent. She then watches her husband get killed by the Russians. Then she kills all the Russian agents. Because the Russians killed her husband she wants to kill them all. So the very gentle nuance is that she let go of 20 years+ of loyalty because her husband was killed. Oh, and one of her CIA coworkers is also a Russian Spy. That is the ENTIRE plot.<br /><br />This movie would probably only be about 1/2 length if you took out the action sequences. Not impressed.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Breaking Dawn is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I've ever read. I enjoyed the first three books of the Twilight series. This one, however, failed in many ways.    The first third of the book, the wedding and honeymoon, were okay. They satisfied everyone's desire for Bella and Edward to consummate their relationship. Bella once again shows her \\"martyr\\" tendencies by letting Alice create the wedding she wants. The sex is written horribly, not that it goes in that much detail. Her injuries are just plain ridiculous. Sex isn't awful and stop treating it that way. The pregnancy was obvious from the beginning. Of course Bella would become pregnant. She gets everything she wants in life and more. She thought she didn't want children, but surprise, she does.     The second third of the book was a whine-fest. Jacob Black spends pages griping about his lost \\"love.\\" He clearly doesn't love her. If he did, he's let her go. The change in POV is also jarring. We gone from strictly Bella to Jacob? It makes no sense and ruins the flow of the series. It wasn't done correctly. If you want to see how to do it correctly, read Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The first chapter doesn't deviate readers from the story.     Jacob simply isn't likable. Bella wants him around all the time, which makes her even less likable than before. He is like one of those people who beg for pity.    The birth scene was predictable. Of course, she was going to turn into a vampire. This is a series where everything is perfect.     The last third of the book was abysmal. Bella becomes a vampire, has no crazy urges and has the perfect baby. The rest of the book leads to the most anti-climatic ending in literature. Rather than be punished or a main character die, the book ends with everyone's life perfect. Except, of course, forgotten Renee.     Oh and Reneesme? Really?    The worst moment in this travesty they call a book is when Jacob imprints on Reneesme, an infant. It's pedophilla. No wayaround it. It's disgusting. Jacob may have said that the girls have a choice later in life, but he also asks why they would want to choose. The entire imprinting concept should be obliterated from literature.

B0039208QM|5.0|I grew up watching this movie. It's one of a select few films from my childhood in the 90s that have achieved a place in my heart that can NEVER be removed(Aliens, Terminator 2 are some of the others). I've always loved this film.     Watching it again on Blu Ray after many years...I'm in love with it all over again. In fact, I've forgotten how good it was.     With all the hype over Nolan's films, this film has become forgotten and underrated it seems. Which is a damn shame considering it's the best film of the franchise.     The acting is top notch, but what surprised me was how good Danny Devito was as the Penguin. He's portrayal of the disgusting, yet tragic, interpretation of the character makes him the best villian out of all the films (Yes, even better than Ledger, who while doing a good job, DID NOT top Nicholson).     The standout though in all of the awesomeness within the film is Danny Elfman's score. Everything about it hits the right notes to bring out the emotion within every scene. Special mention must be given to \\"The Finale\\" as the piece with or without the scene involving Penguin's death, still brings me to tears. It's just that good.     The Blu Ray Transfer of this movie is spectacular with scenes that would be put many recent movies to shame.     So do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie.     You won't regret it.
1416550542|5.0|Starting out in 2005 with Cassandra and the passing of Nell, we weave back to 1913 when Nell first arrived off the ship, to 1930 when Nell turns 21, to 1976 when Nell takes Cassandra into her home.<br /><br />Looking at that above paragraph you can think that this 552 page book could be just a jumble of happenings and a big confusing mess... and..<br /><br />you would be wrong.<br /><br />Kate Morton weaves together strong women through the decades that in some cases never met, but still have their stories entwined, making not only the women, but the story , stronger.  This writing style would not be for the light of heart or for someone of little imagination as you could easily get lost in the worlds that are within the pages, but again I had no trouble sorting out the story line, more and more fascinated and deeper involved as each page was turned.  Kate Morton holds together each story on its own and a more in depth read I have not encountered in a long time.<br /><br />As Kate is quoted from her website:<br /><br />  I like to think of The Forgotten Garden that way: just as a Victorian mourning brooch contains a plait made from the hairs of family members, my book's narrative binds the lives of three women in three different eras into a single story.<br /><br />At first I admit that I did find myself trying to remember what was happening when as each chapter for the most part switches years and pieces of the story.  I was asked why I was not whipping through the book, and my response was that as I read I would have to back track to recall where I was and what was happening....  however, about 100 pages in, I picked up on the flow of the read and started to truly engage in each of the different parts of the story - looking forward to what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I was in awe of how author Kate Morton was able to detail each part of the book so well and there was no story line that lagged.  In books I have read in the past that have attempted this style of writing I have found that I prefer a storyline and skim through the others just to get back to what I like, this was not the case in this book.  Each woman was so detailed in their time period I felt as though I was there - from the detailed descriptions of the houses to the clothing and the background characters, they all held a secure spot in bringing this divine work of literature to a very satisfying close that will not soon leave my heart.line and skim through the others just to get back to what I like, this was not the case in this book.

1416955070|4.0|SYNOPSIS:<br />15-year-old Clary Fray is just a normal teenager living in New York. Her mother is an artist and her best friend, Simon, is in a band... rather, a band that sits around discussing band names instead of actually playing anything.<br /><br />One night while Clary and Simon are at the all-age club Pandemonium, Clary is witness to a murder. She can't call the cops because there is no body, and Simon is looking at her strangely because he can't see the culprits... but she can!<br /><br />The culprits turn out to be Shadowhunters, fighters and warriors dedicated to ridding the world of demonic beings. Almost immediately, Clary is pulled into the fast-paced and ever dangerous world of the Shadowhunters. Her mother disappears, she herself is attacked by a demon and the only \\"father-figure\\" she has ever known has abandoned her. Now what in the world could demons want with Clary and her mother? And why can Clary see demons and Shadowhunters, but Simon cannot? The Shadowhunters are interested in figuring this mystery out, as well.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />Can I just say, WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS BOOK SOONER? I feel like I've been hiding under a rock. I've read numerous reviews about this book and there is no middle ground, people either hate it or love it. Apparently, I'm one of the latter. This book was absolutely thrilling.<br /><br />I was immediately drawn into the world of the Shadowhunters. I wanted to be one! I was committed to the groups mission to find the Mortal Cup. Having been to NYC before, I could envision myself walking in Clary's shoes next to Jace, Alec and Isabelle. This story had it all: demons, vampires, werewolves, warlocks, etc. And the Shadowhunters were the law of the land, keeping the Downworlders in check.<br /><br />The characters were so vibrant, so alive. I was immediately drawn to Jace's wicked humor and sarcastic banter. He had me laughing and of course sighing, because I fell in love with him. I enjoyed that camaraderie and the close-knit relationship Jace had with Alec and Isabelle. Simon was the fun (and fawning) best friend from childhood who you just knew was absolutely in love with Clary, but she didn't see it. I'll admit it, some girls just don't realize it. The only downfall for me, character-wise, was Valentine. He didn't seem like much of a villain to me. He wasn't dark enough, evil enough. Hopefully he will step it up in the next book.<br /><br />This book was extremely fast-paced, action packed and fun! I did have quite a bit figured out before the book ended, but the ending did throw me for an absolute loop! Something I was not expecting, AT ALL!<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the next few books in Ms. Clare's series before the release of City of Fallen Angels in April.Isabelle.

B002SAUCBC|4.0|I liked this story a lot.  Although I have never walked for days without stopping, trying to be the last one alive, I have walked in some awful road marches in my military service, so I identified with much of the described fatigue and thoughts of the Long Walk participants.<br /><br />I do wish though, that there had been more written about what happened to Garraty after the event concluded, but an ending like the one written is a fair speculation ending.<br /><br />But all in all, this was a good read, with good character development, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an entertaining story.
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|The Longshot is an interesting Nerf Gun.  It looks and sounds like a sniper rifle, but it doesn't have that much more range than the Recon.  The firing mechanism is different and supposedly easier to modify, although I haven't tried it yet.<br /><br />The pistol/barrel extension attachment is almost completely useless.  Mine doesn't even sit right; so if you look down the barrel it looks crooked.<br /><br />The flip out bi-pod is a bit rough, but a cool feature none-the-less.  The scope is kind of disappointing.  Obviously just a plastic tube with a dot on it; you can't adjust it, so hope it is on the mark or it will be off permanently.<br /><br />The extendable stock seems like an interesting addition, but just makes the gun unnecessarily beefy.  The clip holder in it is a good addition and gives you a nice place to store a spare clip (although the Longstrike can store 2 clips).<br /><br />The clip release button is one sided unlike almost every other clip system gun, so you better hope you are right handed.<br /><br />If you are a collector, check it out, otherwise you might want to pass on this one.
0385341008|2.0|\\"This had such potential*. I can't help thinking that epistolary novels are lazy and avoid much of the literary crafting that make a work truly outstanding. It seems a disservice to what could have been a really respectable novel.<br /><br />This is sometimes an engrossing story dealing with the little- known (or thought about)Nazi occupation of Britain's Guernsey Island and how several of the salt-of-the-earth islanders form a literary society which at first is a cover story for breaking the evening curfew imposed by the German forces but eventually transforms into actual literary discussions of various sorts. The power of literature becomes a bit too apparent and well, sentimentalized. This work would have been much improved with 3rd person narration (even 1st person for that matter), better defined peripheral characters, and a cohesive story line. The verisimilitude with various plot points and characters is also, at times, exasperating.<br /><br />There are some standout sections --- one dealing with Nazi concentration camps and the difficulty for survivors in the aftermath of such atrocities, another concerning the day when many parents on the island ship their children off to England for safety during the occupation.<br /><br />If you have better things on your night table or Kindle, I'd recommend skipping this one.<br /><br />*I know, this is a totally obnoxious phrase
B003H9MSPG|3.0|The Longstrike is simply a rehash of the Recon!<br /><br />The firing mechanism is the same.  The clips are the same.  The extra parts are completely interchangeable.  But with a name like Longstrike, you would figure it would be able to shoot further right?  Wrong.  For almost double the price of the Recon, this weapon proves to be a waste of money.<br /><br />However, if you are going for all out fun factor, this is a great gun to get.  It looks way cooler than the Recon and like I said, the parts are pretty much interchangeable.  Nerf is doing a great job with these clip system guns which tend to shoot further than their standard dart counter parts.

9889979942|5.0|In Tom Carter's two year trek around China, he has captured an amazingly diverse cross-section of Chinese society with captivating imagery. Whether due western bias, regulated media, or simply my own ignorance, I always imagined China as having a much more homogenized population and overly-polluted environment. Portrait of a People smashes all of my preconceived notions as Carter captures a beautiful richness of culture (including 56 ethnic groups) across each province in China. His photojournalism is top notch, and could easily grace the pages of National Geographic. I highly recommend this book as it allows you to truly explore the richness of China, without dedicating the years traveling it would otherwise require.

B002ZG997C|4.0|I watched this movie on cable after watching the movie I bought on Amazon called \\"Agora\\". Talk about two movies that go together. Agora had Christians burning books and starting the Dark Ages. This movie went the other way, with one champion, whose body is burned and scarred after an apocalypse, seems like he may be protected on High, or is he? Watch Agora first, you'll appreciate this film more.    I had heard this movie was religious fodder for the evangelical set. I was glad and even shocked to see this wasn't the case. Actually, the villian played beautifully by Gary Oldman, was the Evangelical Power Player. I feel the movie makes clear, that his power is largely derived from literacy, which the townsfolk don't have, but he does. (Reminds me of a line from the once banned Gospel of Phillip) \\"Ignorance is the mother of all evil\\".    Eli, played by Denzil Washington provides action and beyond pragmatic sensiblility. This film leaves me guessing about Eli seeming supernatural nature. Whats more, Eli, is the proverbial, pray in a closet guy. His lack of religious bombast was refreshing.    At the end, we know what he is about. We also learn that no book, no matter our bias and prejudice, whether its the Bible, the Koran or the pages of Hustler should be burned or banned, and we must protect our literary heritage because it tells our posterity who we were, and what we were thinking and feeling at the time.    The Post-Apocalyptic genre isn't my thing, so I deduct a point for that. Its 3.5 to 4 at most. I probably would have given it 2 stars if I hadn't seen the other film first.

I ordered two copies, one as a gift and one for me. When they arrived, one was in pristine condition, and the other was a little banged up- the pages were all fine, just the cover looked like it had been thrown around a few times. A little disappointing but I kept it for myself- the book is wonderful, very funny!
B004856SQ8|1.0|i really think they were trying to tell a story of BEFORE the hit TV show, only they bombed.<br /><br />if you are thinking of bying this movie because you loved the TV show of the 80s then stay away. rent it, watch it on On Demand, download it (ooops, that isn't always legal).

From the opening episode with the release of the first Nikki Heat book (Which was really released, I suggest you but it because it's a fantastic tie in) to the epic 2 parter on disc 4 to the wonderful season finale, this season hit all the marks and the performances of Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion are both hilarious and incredible. This is a show destined for a long life, jump on board now while it's early
B003B96AOW|4.0|As the title says, I was able to buy this figure for lower than retail price (okay, it was only by a dollar or two, but still...) since three of my newer Deadpool figures were pretty expensive, this one was at the right price. I guess it pays to buy them when they first come out.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was how big this Deadpool figure was, standing at 7-8 inches, towering over Marvel Legends figures, but generally the Diamond Select figures are bigger than, so he fits in with my Diamond Select Spider-Man, Anti-Venom, Ultimate Venom, Black Cat, and so on.<br /><br />The articulation isn't that great and the joints are a bit stiff, but it isn't that bad.<br /><br />The sculpting on this figure is nice, but I don't like the placement of the eyes on the mask. They seem a little lower than they should be.<br /><br />Paint job is pretty good and matches the same shade of red as my other Deadpool figures. My only gripe is that the black on his shirt actually looks like a dark grey rather than a black. It's not that big of a deal, but it is kind of noticeable, especially since the black on his mask, boots, and gloves are all a shade or two darker.<br /><br />This figure comes with a machine gun, two pistols, two sais, and a broken wall backdrop. All of the accessories are just as nice looking as the figure.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this figure, especially if you're a Deadpool fan. Get it now before it's all bought up and you have to buy it for 3 or 4 times the cost on eBay!

B002RVZV9K|3.0|The idea behind this film is great: Assemble guitar heroes, play guitars and talk shop. A great idea. With that as a start, why, why why, why go anywhere near Jack White? There are SO many legitimate guitar gods we'd love to hear from (all of us can name at least 10 off the top of our heads), but they choose White. What a waste of great opportunity. Jack White has not yet earned his stripes as a musician or a songwriter, let alone reached guitar god status. Most of us guitar players know him for what he truly is: a very basic guitar player with very little creativity and no originality. His career is already waning, supporting the sentiment that he is completely undeserving to be in this film with Page and Edge. Worst of all, White carries himself in the movie as the most important person in the room - speaking constantly and almost not letting Jimmy Page and The Edge get a word in edgewise.   Despite the unbearable and painful presence of White the film is a must see for guitar players who love to get insight into the lives and thoughts of legitimate guitarists Page and Edge - who both have made lasting impact on the way guitarists play and listeners listen to modern music.

I'd give the book 3 1/2 stars for concept and originality if I could.  I especially thought the ending was good, and hope to see a sequel.   Would have given the book a half a star more, but it was a bit complex for my imagination. Some parts, particularly about the manufacturing aspect of kinks and springs I had a hard time grasping. But I did get the intention.   In my opinion, it edited a bit, this could make a great movie.
B000002J27|5.0|In 1976, Genesis fans were anxiously wondering what their band would sound like without legendary frontman Peter Gabriel.  Well, drummer Phil Collins was well up for the task of taking over the lead role, and puts on a fine vocal performance here, while preserving the progressive rock sound of the band.  Actually, the musicianship here may be the best on any Genesis album so far.  Also, the songs are all very melodic, much like Selling England was, while still retaining a surreal, mystical atmosphere.  Anyway, this is one of the great albums of 70's prog rock- don't be scared off by Phil Collins, he was still young with long hair here, and is still one of the worlds all time greatest drummers.  Recommended.
1600595871|5.0|This is the most comprehensive and clear guide to making book structures that I have ever seen!  There are no wasted pages - every inch is used to make the process clear, starting right from the first chapter on Materials and Methods.  There are many interesting tips and tricks that will interest even veteran bookmakers.  The variety of structures with technical and content information is phenomenal.  The numerous illustrations cover a wide range of bookmaking approaches and subject matter.  I especially appreciated the commentary written by a number of book artists that is interspersed throughout the book, giving background and insight into the creative process. These roughly paragraph-long sections are noted by a fleur de lis symbol.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the book had come out earlier!  I would have used it as the textbook this semester in the University Book Arts class that I teach!  I will definitely be sharing it with my students.

There was so much that I could relate to about the main character, Charlie. I'm really at a loss for words... this book is just absolutely amazing, and I highly suggest you read it. I genuinely enjoyed reading this book, and I would definitely put it in my top 10... probably somewhere close to the top too. Fantastic book.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|A lot of people say that Countdown to Extinction is slightly lighter and more mainstream than previous albums by Megadeth. I haven't heard the first three albums just yet, but compared to Rust in Peace, CTE does seem to be a bit more commercial. But still, it's hard-hitting music, complete with fabulous thrash melodies and catchy lyrics. The first song, \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" is an excellent introduction, while the famous \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" features the band's most undeniable talents. \\"Architecture of Aggression,\\" \\"Foreclosure of a Dream,\\" and \\"Sweating Bullets\\" are nothing short of brilliant. \\"This was My Life\\" and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" are great, though admittedly it starts to sound the same a bit here. \\"High Speed Dirt\\" kicks it all off again, and all the way through the end it's intense and haunting once again. The demo versions of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" and \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" are very interesting to hear.<br /><br />Overall, it's a incredibly exquisite album by Megadeth, and hopefully I'll be able to explore their other albums as well.<br /><br />Grade: 9.4/10<br /><br />Also available from Megadeth:<br />Rust in Peace (9.3/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH5O Rust in Peace]]<br />Youthanasia (9.9/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH40 Youthanasia]]<br />Cryptic Writings (9.4/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH4U Cryptic Writings]]<br />The World Needs a Hero (8.9/10) [[ASIN:B00005EBQE World Needs a Hero]]

B000G7599Y|5.0|Like most diamonds, this set has its flaws. Even so, it’s more irreplaceable than the Hope Diamond or Cullinan I. In the current milieu of famine and cholera, never again will we witness the convergence of the Berlin Philharmonic – as it once was – at the Jesus Christus Church with a master Mozartian at the helm. Be thankful that it’s extant. . In their zest for life and eternal youth, Uncle Karl is remarkably attuned to the young Mozart; most of the problems with this cycle come in the later symphonies (such as sclerotic K 550). Elsewhere, I am no advocate of snail racing; the last movement of K 183 is funereal - what on earth was Karl thinking? Ever so sadly  - and after a sizzling account of the first movement too - the same could be said of the last movement of the Paris: are we there yet?<br /><br />The chief asset of the set remains the Berlin Phil and their golden glow - and when Bohm is on song, say, the Linz or K 543, it is hard to imagine a better performance. Even with the remastering, however,  some but not all of recordings remain light-ish in the bass. Here are some vignettes:<br /><br />K 551 Jupiter - a top notch performance<br /><br />K 550 - Slow to the point of being unlistenable.<br /><br />K 543 - nearly the best on the market.<br /><br />K 504 - Prague - recorded in 1960 and the sound is thin. Not a contender in a crowded market.<br /><br />K 425 - Linz - like the E Flat above, a superb performance.<br /><br />K 385 - lacks fire<br /><br />K 338 - Karl and the Berliners clearly enjoy this magnificent C Major symphony. Terrific.<br /><br />K 319 - fine enough.<br /><br />K 318 - bedevilled by some poor intonation<br /><br />K 297 - first two movements are highly enjoyable, but the finale is disgracefully slow.<br /><br />K 201 - a moderately paced account which is so enjoyable on its own terms  - largely attributable to the glorious Klang of the Berliners!<br /><br />K 200 - the BEST on the market by a mile. What a finale!!!<br /><br />K 183 - Karl achieves some phenomenal sonorities in the first movement - but it is the Snails' Grand Prix in the last.<br /><br />K 181 - what fun.<br /><br />K 132 - still the best account of this symphony. Adrenalin in spades.<br /><br />K 130  - solid.<br /><br />K 129 - a masterpiece and played as such by the Berlin Philharmonic.<br /><br />K 124 - best on the market by a mile!<br /><br />K 112 - what magnificence! The slow movement in itself is reason enough to purchase this cycle!<br /><br />K 110 - ditto. A great little symphony.<br /><br />K 22 - As played like this, a prophetic work.<br /><br />For anyone who remembers their boyhood, the early symphonies of Mozart are a conduit back to the past - why else do K 22 or K 110 exist in this cosmos? Flaws notwithstanding, this is plenitude. Bury me with it./>K 110 - ditto. A great little symphony.<br /><br />K 22 - As played like this, a prophetic work.<br /><br />For anyone who remembers their boyhood, the early symphonies of Mozart are a conduit back to the past - why else do K 22 or K 110 exist in this cosmos?

B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is by far one of the biggest surprises I been so blessed to play this year on any console.  Now in saying this, this game is not for kids.  It's very graphic, and the best way to describe it is by saying that it's kind of like traveling through the movie Saw.  It's scary, thought out, difficult and has so many endings that replaying it doesn't get stale.  One great feature is that there is only 1, that is ONE, true ending.  So each time you die, and you WILL die, it saves your info that you've already collected.  The one minus this game has is its great deal of writing.  Although the writing is terrific, once you die, you must travel through all of the puzzles and conversation you've already seen.  Good news is there is a fast forward through the scenes and you can recheck dialogue if needed,the bad news is the puzzles must all be redone over and over again.  Still a minor flaw for such a wonderfully thought out game. KUDOS!
1594488843|5.0|Drive isn't just about the surprising truth about what motivates us, it's also about the alarming truth about how STAGGERINGLY WRONG we have been about what we thought motivates us.<br /><br />I've long maintained that there's no such thing as attempting to motivate anyone.  That, motivation is self-directed.  That the only thing an outsider can do is present a person with a choice and that the person then motivates themselves towards one or another decision.<br /><br />However, what Dan Pink does in Drive is provide a blueprint for how to create an environment for continual self-motivation where the means and the ends are somewhat circular: autonomy, mastery and purpose.<br /><br />All three are components of what really motivates us, but all three are also the means by which to help us be, do, and have a fulfilling work and life.  Dan Pink doesn't just expose what really motivates us, he explodes many long-held myths about what we believe to be motivating, but actually turn out to be dreadfully counter-productive, not just de-motivating.<br /><br />The good news is that these obsolete myths about motivation in the workplace are barely one hundred years old.  That means that we haven't lived with them for but an atomic fraction of the human experience.  The bad news is that these last hundred years have been the absolute most astonishingly productive era in human history and these myths have seemed to work well enough that they've become ubiquitous things of academia, literature, business and government policy.<br /><br />Current titans of business, government and industry have built their empires on these myths because they seem to work for most people most of the time.  The only problem is that they also lead to many of the business, educational and societal issues of our time which are too-easily side-stepped and ignored.  Furthermore, at least two generations of workers and soon-to-be workers are rejecting these myths.  Business, government, and industry will need to re-frame their notions of what motivates us.  Those forward-thinking among them will become the new titans, only now, these new titans will be a more positive place to work and a more positive influence on humanity.<br /><br />It's painful to look at places where I've done work and to see how deeply flawed they've been in the light of Dan Pink's Drive.  So much time lost.  So much unhappiness.  So many unfulfilled possibilities.  So much wasted.<br /><br />Dan provides practice tools and guides at the end of this book to help take his investigation and put it into the workplace.  I, for one, intend on being part of the new Drive.  Business, government and industry can wait no longer to put the truth behind 21st century human motivation into the workplace and into our lives.<br /><br />My rating is not because of the scholarly and balanced investigation, but because the urgency with which people should pay attention to the book in the business world.  A more critical look at the book would find that there's more going on than meets the eye with respect to motivation.<br /><br />A few times while reading, the thought crossed my mind that some conclusions are overstated, some connections are over-emphasized, and a few relationships are over-simplified.  That, in short, there's often a much more complicated and complex set of interrelated attributes contributing to a situation, and, that how research studies play out don't always translate into the workplace -- where there are nearly unstoppable forces already firmly in place.  In a few other places I noted that Dan paints a black and white picture of right and wrong proportions where there are often many more shades of many other colors and many possible shades situationally \\"right\\".<br /><br />I believe Dan's motivation may have as much to do with jolting business out of a lull of complacency as it does with communicating new ideas.  Were his book to represent all sides on each of his points, it would be too long, unreadable, not enjoyable, an academic book, not a business book, and it would have a much weaker position to stake.<br /><br />Therefore, the short-comings of the book do not negate the conclusions nor the urgency with which our businesses, governments, and industries need to take a cold, hard look at how we're treating our people and begin to match our needs as humans with how we're handled in the workforce.would have a much weaker position to stake.

B004IK30QE|5.0|Fairy tales don't really happen in our world -- especially not the kind that actually involve princesses.<br /><br />But you wouldn't know that from \\"Roman Holiday,\\" one of Audrey Hepburn's earliest ever movie roles -- as well as her breakout one. This adorable romantic comedy balances itself nicely between a sweet little romance, a lighthearted romance and the bittersweet, overhanging specter of royal duty.<br /><br />Bored young Princess Ann (Hepburn) goes on a \\"Roman Holiday,\\" when she gets upset, is sedated by a doctor, and has an odd reaction to it. Soon she has wandered out of the palace and into the streets of Rome, where she is found by struggling American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Since she appears to be drunk, he takes her home.<br /><br />When Joe realizes that he has the missing princess in his apartment, he takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome, with his pal taking photographs for a full article about her. But he doesn't count on falling in love with Ann, or having her truly fall for him. And Ann has a tough choice to make -- should she give up her royal life and stay with Joe, or fulfil her responsibilities as a princess?<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" is one of those rare movies that sounds incredibly trite and Hollywoodish when you just hear what it's about, because it's been done so many times before. Surprise -- instead we get a movie that is mostly a cute, innocent little romance, but with an inevitable choice that looms over Anne throughout her fun.<br /><br />But it's a fun ride while it lasts, with Anne and Joe careening through Rome on a scooter, dancing by the river, and getting her hair cut. This doesn't sound very funny, but William Wyler plays it with plenty of little jokes, including Joe's scandalized landlady raving at poor Anne in Italian, assuming that she's a one-night stand. And near the end he twists the storyline into a bittersweet examination of duty vs. love, with Anne forced to consider which way her life will go.<br /><br />And there's one joke that Peck played on Hepburn in reality -- the infamous \\"Mouth of Truth\\" scene. There's a reason Hepburn shrieked so convincingly: she had really been tricked.<br /><br />Hepburn and Gregory Peck are thoroughly solid as love interests -- Peck is breezy and likable as the jaded American journalist who is seizing an opportunity. And Hepburn showed off her range here -- she can be funny and quirky (including a hilarious \\"drunk\\" scene), then switch over into a doe-eyed sadness that breaks the heart.<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" is a modern-day fairy tale that never sacrifices integrity for cheap gooey romance.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|What I love about this book is what so many people here, who've reviewed it HATE about the book. This story is about the life and feelings and emotions of one single woman in this world who felt like sharing those emotions with others, through written word. It truly is a book about how one woman \\"found herself\\"...I know that a lot of people think that such a notion is selfish and that a lot of the reviews here talk about how self-absorbed she is...but what is wrong WITH that every once in a while? Not every woman is meant to be a wife and/or a mother and do exactly what society thinks they should do.    I LOVE how - when she's in Italy - she's talking about how, when she's in the city ran by the Mafia, all she cares about is finding her next great meal!    Too many women, I believe, are unhappy in their lives - and Elizabeth Gilbert set out to find what would make her happy. It's beautifully written and - while I'm happily married - many of the parts of her journey - when she's talking about how she felt as she was getting divorced - I could relate to because I wasn't ALWAYS happily married and it took me YEARS to find MY happiness...    If you're a person who doesn't care about \\"fru-fru-ness\\" of other's and their emotions, then no this book isn't for you. But if you enjoy listening to others talk about their pleasures and figuring out in life what made THEM happy then read this book!
031603438X|5.0|If you are a Rolling Stones fan, or even a fan of rock and roll, you'll want to read this book.  While Keith Richards' Life comes up short in many respects, it is long on a whole bunch of other stuff.  The early development years of the Rolling Stones is covered quite well, and much of the song writing and development is also present.  It does lack in the song development aspect somewhat, but over all Life, from a rock and roll history aspect, is a treat.      I give Life 5 stars, not because it is extremely well written, but because of what it represents and who wrote it.  Keith Richards has written some of the most memorable songs and hooks and guitar lines in rock and roll history.  It would be impossible for him to write an autobiography and a song dissection in one book; thankfully he didn't try to do that.  What he did do was give us a bit of both. I've always been intrigued by many of the Stones songs, particularly their 60s era hits.  Songs like \\"Paint It Black\\" \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\" \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" \\"Get Off Of my Cloud\\" \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" are all 60s classics.  They are the songs that I wanted very much to learn about.  Unfortunately, I didn't get my wish answered.  But I did get a measure of it, and for that I am grateful.      I've anticipated this book almost all of my life, and I am actually quite surprised that it has arrived.  Who would have thought the world's most popular drug addict would actually write a book?  I've been reading with some dismay many of the negative comments about the book.  My advice is to get over it and realize that Keith Richards is not a book writer; he's a guitarist and a songwriter. Appreciate the fact that as you read it, you can actually visualize and hear Keith saying what has been written.  While it's true he used a ghost writer, the tone of the book, the feel of it, is all Keith Richards.  That's a treat.    Since about the late '70s, I realized that the Stones are not somuch about Mick Jagger as they are about Keith Richards.  The book, Life, affirms my belief.  Jagger, who according to Richards, seized control of the band during Richards' drug years and has steered it ever since, with Keith Richards being sidelined as a guitarist/songwriter and resident drug addict.  This book explains why much of the Stones music recorded after 1981 sucks.  I've often wondered how it is that the Stones could write and record such classics, one right after another, and then fall into an abysmal series of bad stuff and pretty much stay there.  It's clear that it's Jagger leadership that lacked vision and musical knowledge that encased one of the greatest bands in the world into a mire of technically sound musical slop.  It also explains why Keith Richards' solo efforts are better than the Stones releases from 1991 forward.  What I got out of reading Life is that Mick Jagger has no musical vision; he's all about image and money, whereas Keith is all about music, period; well, and some ego massaging.    The book does have problems, most of which have been covered by other reviewers.  For me, the disappointment comes in two areas.  The first is that Keith ignores so much discussion on the development of their albums and hit singles.  The only album he talks about in length is Exile On Main Street.  The rest of the albums get a passing mention, if that.  I've so often wondered about the development of Beggars Banquet, Some Girls, and Tattoo You.  Little to no answers in Life.  He also pretty much ignores Bill Wyman.  It's no wonder the guy quit, he was probably never treated like an equal, and he certainly gets zero praise in this book.  I had to wonder why that is.  The second area that was disappointing is the amount of space he allotted to drug usage.  Far too many pages and pages about drug abuse.  I think I understood it the first 50 pages, I didn't need another 50.        If I learned anything at all from this book it is that Keith Richards is probably a jerk.  He probably deserved what happened to him in losing his control over the band, and the way he treats other people is reprehensible.  He brags about some of his misdeeds, like an immature middle school boy who gets caught doing something stupid and hasn't learned his mistakes.  I'd venture to say that if Keith Richards hadn't learned how to play guitar he would have added up to zero.
B001TLKN1K|5.0|My 19 year old son asked for this book for Christmas, as this was the first time in his life he asked for a book as a gift, I went directly to Amazon and bought it along a couple of books for myself for free shipping.  On Christmas evening he was reading this book, chuckling frequently and occasionally reading parts out loud.  He posted this book on line as one of his favorite presents.  I confess that before I wrapped it, I read about 30 pages. The humor is adult in content and women who lack a sense of humor could be offended; this is NOT a politically correct book, but it IS REALLY very funny. A quick and entertaining read.
0307460444|5.0|I find all of Martha Stewart's recipes to be exceptionally clear and organized in their delivery.  For me, this is the biggest stress reducer when trying a new recipe.  I don't like to wonder about what a certain term means halfway through the recipe (as they frequently vary from chef to chef) and I like to have visual and textural cues for how to tell when something is where it needs to be in the process.  Her recipes are also amazing in that they are flexible enough for independent variation without the basic integrity of the food being ruined.  Love this book!
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you're already into Rush, you'll feel like listening to this band for the next week the time you finish watching this documentary. If you're not into them, there's big chances you'll try to find something out about the band.  The movie is great and makes you want to watch it over and over again. The career of the band is very interesting itself, and full of ups and downs, and this DVD/Blu Ray will show it all to you.  The extras are pretty nice too, and they include hobbies of the Rush guys outside music and some live performances. This is a must have if you're into any kind of Rock music!

The book awakened me and has changed my outlook on life. Living in the present, identifying the ego, has made me live a life full of love and gratitude. I recommend this book to anyone that may feel lost without purpose. Great book!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was a kid. The films were magical and inspiring to me. Lucas said that special effects were just a means to tell a story, not a means to an end, and that people had a tendency to forget that. Many years later he totally forgot this wisdom. He defaced his own art, and brought forward three prequel films with so many plot holes and contradictions to their own reality that it leaves one in disbelief (just check out Star Wars reviews on YouTube to see what I mean.) But then, in the old days he had a team of experts helping him every step of the way. No one dares to question him now, just watch the behind-the-scenes footage to see for yourself. A beautiful space opera, with imaginative inspiration from old Sci-Fi serials, has been turned into pure commercial garbage.  And George wonders why more fans aren't interested in the new live action Star Wars series he's working on...even if the critics cheer it on, I won't waste my time. They already fooled me with \\"Revenge of the Sith.\\" I don't care to be suckered again.

B0034G4OVS|4.0|Three friends become stranded on a ski lift in icy cold weather. Fifty feet up, with wolves waiting below, they must find a way to survive, or die trying. A riveting, all-too plausible story that has both rich character development and grisly horror. Frozen is a taut horror-thriller that will have you cringing, screaming at the screen, and hoping for an impossible rescue.<br /><br />Frozen is a gripping tale, expertly carried off by three actors in extremely tight surroundings. In just 90 minutes, we come to know them as people, care about their survival, and mourn their fate. Though their actions prove ill-fated, they seem logical in such a desperate situation; we can imagine doing the same, having the same ideas racing through our minds as we are freezing to death, blown about by the wind in a tiny cocoon of cold steel.

B00005NP04|5.0|I only came across Martina McBride a few years ago through the 'stone angel' song, which I found powerful and reflecting an utterly true (yet still taboo) reality today of children who are harmed by caregivers. I was interested to hear what other things she sang about and found that I liked her voice and her music. This album adds to my modest collection of her works (I also have 'shine', and a smattering of mp3s of other songs of hers I like), and I am very glad I ordered it.   Consistently good quality music is not easy to come by, but Martina McBride delivers every single time.   I recommend it for anyone who likes good country music, good voice, good sing-along-with-some-meaning words, and just fun music to accompany anything from a car-ride, a workout, or scrubbing the kitchen floor.  Good stuff.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed a bag with room for more gadgets for my new camera.  I researched and read the reviews and thought I'd try this one.  It is a Great Bag.  It has multiple pockets you can adjust with dividers.  I was able to fit my GorillaPod tripod in the bag as well as all the cleaning supplies, filters, and other items.  It also has two zippered pouches on the inside of the lid.  I can store extra batteries, SD cards and other small items you don't want to lose in those.  There are also two straps on one side which I used to strap on my larger slik tripod. I took the bag out this week after a snowfall and was caught off-guard by freezing rain.  The backpack iced up but no moister got into the bag. I don't think I'd go out in a rainstorm to take photos - if you're looking for an inexpensive camera backpack - this a very good bag (I'm a casual photographer - not a professional) it's everything I looked for or wanted.  Also I'm 5' 10\\" and the straps adjusted fine for me to comfortably carry around for hours.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I read this book because my piano teacher recommended it. That was November 2009. In the months following, I slowly came to realize the value of her recommendation as I practiced for the Cincinnati World Piano Competition. My daily average in June was about 6 hours a day, sometimes more. By the time July 1st, 2010, the day of the final round, came, I had logged over 10,000 hours - the minimal requirement for success, as this book explains. With its many intriguing examples, this excellent novel clarifies that hard work and time are crucial components to good results in any subject, not just music. Although not everyone has the same goals (mine was to be a finalist), all will benefit from reading this book - as I definitely did. If anyone is curious, I earned co-gold; 10,000 hours did the trick.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I received this CD for Christmas and I've been listening to it ever since.  As a fan of Loreena McKennit, it's wonderful to have a new album from her after many years of silence.  On this album, she returns to her roots in Folk and Celtic music with a selection of traditional ballads and lyric songs.  These are rendered in her usual style: her voice, haunting as ever, is backed by harp, bagpipe, concertina, and other instruments.  The songs range from the upbeat \\"As I Roved Out\\" and \\"Star of County Down\\" to the more typical sad, romantic numbers such as the title track, in which a young man mourns a lost lover shot in his arms, and \\"The Death of Queen Jane,\\" which memorializes Henry VIII's third wife.  While some listeners disliked the faster songs, I found them a refreshing change, and true to the singer's Irish/Folk roots.  All in all, a pleasure to listen to and sing along with.
0307408833|4.0|So far I have only made the choc chip cookies (which are Gluten free) and they were amazing.  They were pretty expensive to make and it was the only recipe that did not require the elusive garbanzo/fava bean flour that appealed to me. . My family DEVOURED the cookies and I had to make them again the next day to send them on to my gluten free buddies.  I was very happy with the cookie recipe, but do see how frustrating it can be to find all of the ingredients the author suggests.  I made three trips to the store and had to special order one of the items.  In total I spent over $80 to get all of the basics. I'm hoping that will last me through SEVERAL recipes.  I have already come to realize that the coconut oil is a major ingredient and you'll go through it quickly, but it is SOOOOO expensive.  I'll save these recipes for special occasions for my gluten free friends and family members.  Sorry guys. . .love you but I can't afford you!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|When it comes to heat sinks, I think there's a lot of mediocre crap on the market. I like this one for the way it attaches to the motherboard more then the heat sink. The plastic twist locks on most heat sinks come loose very easy and this thing has a very solid mount. If your interested in an aftermarket heat sink, at least look for a mounting solution like this. As for this product, if it will fit in your case I think it's a bargain.

Yet, whenever there was a scene with Kevin, I would become angry. The end of the book, corney as it may be, was so shocking and literally made me gasp. This is a great story.
B0009S8EWE|5.0|What is it about the year 1967 that spawned the launch of so many brilliant albums?  We had \\"Sgt. Pepper ...\\" from the Beatles, The Doors' debut album, \\"Are You Experienced\\" from Jimi Hendrix and many, many other classic rock greats that coincided with the growth of the whole San Francisco psychedelic, hippy culture and of which this brilliant Jefferson Airplane album has become synonymous with and embodied by tracks like \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\".<br /><br />This is a classic album that ranks among the best ever recorded and this mini-lp replica sleeve version is a treat for fans as it is very well designed and assembled and includes a 16-page booklet that contains all the lyrics.  The sound quality has been remastered very well as well for a great sounding disc.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the tracks and in addition to the hits mentioned above other standout tracks are \\"Embryonic Journey\\" which ranks among the best guitar picking instrumentals that I've ever heard and \\"Comin' Back To Me\\" although truth be told there are no real filler tracks here.<br /><br />In addition we get 6 bonus tracks here that are also pretty good:<br /><br />12. In the Morning<br />13. J.P.P. McStep B. Blues<br />14. Go To Her<br />15. Come Back Baby<br />16. Somebody To Love (Mono single version)<br />17. White Rabbit (Mono single version)<br /><br />This is a great album that should be in every sonic library and I personally believe it to be Jefferson Airplane's best ever work.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great content and great sound quality makes this very highly recommended!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|For most of the book, I wondered how this could possibly be a love story. Chris' true love for Emily is revealed during his trial and I was relieved when he was set free. A masterpiece showing the meaning of love and the horror of suicide.
B001BJ65SU|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) 24 carat gold mobile fidelity remastered version of the ultimate self-pity and one of Sinatra's best ever albums is a real treat for fans!  As far as the design and assembly of the mlps goes this ranks among the best that I've ever seen which will please collectors.  Despite this being a mono recording, the sound quality has also been remastered well as is to be expected given the high standards that Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab sets for itself.<br /><br />Some of my favourite all-time Sinatra tracks are on this baby such as \\"One For My Baby\\", \\"Ebb Tide\\", \\"Spring is Here\\" and \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" but as a true concept album should be all the tracks here are good and stick to the theme of loneliness and lamenting about it.  This is not only one of Sinatra's best works but it certainly ranks among the best ever albums of all time.  No fillers here and as is with the case with any classic album this should be heard in its entirety at one sitting to appreciate its true greatness.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever experienced loneliness and the despair that accompanies it will totally relate to this album and listening to Frank croon about it here provides a great therapeutic effect knowing that even the great Sinatra has been there and made it through.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great sound quality and great content makes this a no-brainer recommendation.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B003L7DK74|4.0|A funny show that even if you have never seeany of it, will draw you in . A very rewatchable series with songs that get stuck in your head... it's Business Time......
B00005JLPK|5.0|`Frida' is an incredible film looking at the life of Frida Kahlo. It is set against the background of the Mexican revolution and her art. The first thing that struck me was the rich colours and beautiful locations throughout and this makes for a very visually stunning film. Frida comes across as passionate and joyfully and fiercely independent and Hayek's portrayal is exceptional, I have never seen her act as well as this. Alfred Molina is also amazing and the supporting cast (which includes Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, Ed Norton and Geoffrey Rush) also put out impressive performances. There is beautiful framing of certain scenes and the direction is a real highlight; there is wonderful use of cinematic techniques (like quirky animations and living paintings) that heighten and add to the overall feel. The music also stands out and is both atmospheric and evocative and stirs your emotions along with the scenes on screen. Not only is the story of Frida's life compelling and fascinating, this film also gives a deeper insight and understanding behind the emotion and meaning in her art. I look at her work now with a fresh eye and renewed appreciation. Her artwork is put into context with her life and has more meaning as a result. This is a beautiful film, about a uncompromising, passionate artist and makes for a couple of hours engrossing, stirring viewing and comes highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Kate Beckinsale, tight clothes, incredible eyes, and a vampire?  What more could you want in a lead charactor?  A totally new and innovative look into the lives and times of the creatures of the night.  Great plot, great acting, just enough violence to be suitable for young teens as well.  Two thumbs up!!!
B002WY65W4|4.0|`Zombieland' is a pretty decent Zom-com and manages to be both gross and funny at the same time. This follows four people who are trying to survive in Zombieland (a decimated America) and who decide to stick together after a tricky meeting. They are headed to LA to go to Pacific Playland and try to avoid Zombies on the way. This open with funny Zombie evasion/survival rules which are added to throughout the film. The graphics for these rules pop up on the screen and are often knocked over or moved by the action on screen which is a novel touch. There is excellent acing from all involved and Woody Harrelson is as great as we have come to expect. There is also a cameo from another well known actor which makes for a funny five minutes in the film. This has a good soundtrack with a good mix of metal and other music to give the right balance of action and sentiment to the film. This is way better than I thought it would be and although it gets compared to `Shaun of the Dead' they are different movies really and just as enjoyable as each other in their own ways. This doesn't take itself too seriously and as long as you aren't expecting a full on zombie horror movie (although this is certainly gory, but with a pinch of salt) then this should make for just under 90 minutes entertaining viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001B51B9M|5.0|It was so great to find the Blu-ray DVD on Amazon.com.  Some of the old musicals which were on tape just didn't cut it.  Very high quality DVD and a joy to watch.  Color was fabulous.....which we didn't expect.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|`Bat Out Of Hell 3' is very much a formulaic affair and offers us a `Meat Loaf by numbers' album. There's not too much wrong with that if you enjoyed past Meat Loaf albums, but if you are looking for growth, development or new style songs then this is going to be a disappointment. This is a huge cash in on the `Bat Out Of Hell' legacy and in all honesty it should've been released under another title and not linked to the two previous stellar albums. The best song has to be `All Coming Back To Me Now' and shows Meat Loafs voice off to great effect, it makes you remember how good he can be. The record company realise this as well as this was the main single from the album. This album has numerous high profile collaborations, with many big names writing and performing on various tracks, but sadly there seems to be something missing and the magic of previous albums seems to be gone. The artwork is as great as ever and Julie Bell provides some stunning pieces, although many of them aren't new or specifically for this album, check out her excellent book `Hard Curves' for the artwork featured here and more besides. As we have come to expect from Meat Loaf this album is grandiose and overblown and whilst he usually manages to pull it off, very occasionally it feels as if he is parodying himself. This is an ok album, but nothing great and I fell it slightly detracts from the Bat legacy. Never the less, he is still churning out crowd pleasing numbers and his die hard fans will be happy.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000021YQV|5.0|It's hard to decide whether Toxicity or Steal This album are the better of SOAD albums, but I have to ere on the side of Toxicity. It is short and punchy, has some great riffs and some very intelligent lyrics. It is safe to say that every song kicks ass, and I'm always feeling left slightly disappointed when the album finishes! A great album and should be part of any metal/rock collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Exactly what the description says, exactly  what it is supposed to be, perfect conditions, awesome delivering time. I'm very happy with the service and the product.  Price is quite good as well. What else could I ask for?  Just thank you.
B000INAXGU|5.0|If you are aware of Jamiroquai you will know them for their infectious grooves and funky acid jazz, and if you don't, then this is the best place for your first taste of what they have to offer. Spanning all their albums to date, this album has a greats selection of tracks. From the didgeridoo enhanced 'When You Gonna Learn' to the exuberance of 'Virtual Insanity', as soon as you put this CD on you will start to move, tap your feet and grin and you won't stop until the last track. This has such gems as 'Canned Heat' that never fails to get me up and dancing, to 'Little L' which has much the same effect! This also has more laid back tracks such as 'Seven Days in Sunny June' from the latest album, 'Dynamite' and extra tracks for this collection, my favourite being 'Runaway'. This special edition has an additional disc with remixes of various tracks and although it is good, it isn't great. But considering you can buy this for the same price as the single version of this album it is worth buying anyway. Overall this is an addictive sound, with great vocals and funk feel from a great British band. Highly, highly recommended, especially at the current price at time of writing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003FNWR6Y|4.0|The Game is well designed the pieces are great. The only issue I had with my game is a missing dice but that can be easily fixed. If your a fan of both Nintendo and Monopoly and don't want to spend too much money this is a great buy.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This album has some rocking tunes, as well as some funny interludes. This album isn't meant to be too serious (as rock is fun after all) and has a great combination of humour and well written songs. It's a perfect summer album and will make you laugh out loud at times, sure some of the jokes are school boyish but they're funny as hell. Enjoy!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00129H7VS|5.0|My wife bought this for me for Christmas.  I loved the series when it came out and am delighted to have it now in Blu-ray.  I had loaned my original set to several people and it was never returned at one point and no one remembered having it.  So this was a great present for me.
B002BFBAUG|3.0|`Adventureland' is a down beat comedy that follows a guy, called James, who works at an amusement park over the summer to earn enough money to go to University. He makes unlikely friendships amongst the geeks and misfits who he works with and strikes up a summer romance that comes with more than it's fair share of complications. The is set during the eighties and has an appropriate soundtrack to match and the outfits are one aspect that will raise more than one smile. The trailers I saw for this film portrayed it as an all out comedy film and whilst there are plenty of amusing moments, very few of them will have you laughing out loud. Maybe I was expecting more after seeing the trailer, but this is a pretty average film, it isn't horrendous, but it isn't really great either. The best bit of this film was the performance by Jesse Eisenberg, but to be honest I just saw him in `Zombieland' and he was even better in that than in this film; but if he wasn't in this film it would have been a whole lot worse. Overall this is an ok film and will while away just over an hour and a half, just don't have too high expectations and you should enjoy it just fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This Movie is A Long Time Favorite of Mine. I just  Upgaded it to DVD. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY,ENTERTAINING,GOOD MUSIC AND OVER ALL A PLEASURE TO WATCH. It's a Timeless Clasic.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|`The West Wing' was an exceptional political drama and this is an exceptional boxset of the complete series that does it full justice. This has every series (each series is spread across 6 discs and is in it's own dedicated DVD case), as well as an en extra two discs of bonus features and extras and an excellent booklet that has a brief synopsis of every episode. Whilst some series were better than others and it lost it way briefly in the middle, this always had a high standard of writing, directing and acting and you will rarely find yourself bored whilst watching this, even if you watch this back to back over a two week period as I did! The dialogue was always snappy and intelligent and the stories kept me gripped throughout. I love how this wasn't dumbed down for audiences and is more credible and enjoyable as a result. There is a wide range of issues explored across the series`, from political scandals, foreign policy issues, domestic issues, national catastrophes and more and all alongside the most wonderful human interest stories from the staff of the White House. If you have even a passing interest in American politic then I'd recommend this and if you enjoy any TV drama of a high standard then this is required viewing. This is a great value boxset, with a wide range of features, but at the end of the day each superb episode speaks for itself.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Fun Movie...almost rented it for a watch with parents movie over xmas, wouldn't have been a good movie for that.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|`Inglourious Basterds' is a typical Tarantino film and if you are a fan of his films then this will right up your street. This is set in WW2 and follows a group of American commandos who are behind enemy lines and who terrorize nazi soldiers to lower morale. It also features a Jewish cinema owner who plans to enact her own form of revenge; both stories weave their way separately through the film and join up at the end. This is shot in a series of vignettes (very much in the pulp fiction style) and each little episode provides an extra element to the overall story. Some of the dialogue and behaviour of the Basterds will make you laugh, that is until the retribution begins and then you get the usual Tarantino ultra violence that will make you wince as you watch. The Basterds behaviour is as deplorable as the nazis at times, but their delivery and flair raise a wry smile throughout. There is an excellent cast, with many decent actors playing small roles as well as main characters and whilst the direction is stylised it is easily as good as previous films by Tarantino. The ending is ludicrous but is shot with tongue firmly in cheek and although complete fantasy, it is the ending you would want to make this a satisfying film experience. It's not real, but it is good cinema. This was better than I expected and is worth a watch at some point, just note that it is an 18 certificate for a reason.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B002K0WBYG|5.0|`The Proposal' is a genuinely funny rom-com starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. This follows Margaret, a hard nosed publishing editor, who is about to be deported when her visa expires and Andrew, her assistant who she blackmails into marrying her so she can stay in the country and keep her job. They then go to meet his family in Alaska and the real fun begins. Bullock shows yet again what a hilarious physical comedian she is and Reynolds has superb dead pan line delivery and this film had me laughing out loud at various points throughout. The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds is obvious from the word go and they are a wonderful couple together on screen. This also has stellar performances from Mary Steenburgen and Betty White who play the mother and grandmother and who welcome Margaret into the family whole heartedly. This is a gentle film and doesn't sink to crass or overtly rude jokes to raise a laugh, instead it has real warmth and genuine humour and makes for just under two hours fun viewing. The extras include the obligatory commentaries and a funny outtakes reel which shows the fun had on set during filming. All in all this is a funny and heart warming film, one of the better rom-coms I have seen and is well worth checking out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0920668364|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was little and I knew I had to get it for a special child in my life.  The book arrived in great condition and in a speedy way.  The little boy I gave it to loves it very much and we've already read it at least 5 times.  Thanks for your business!
B003BWQEU4|4.0|`Dumbo' is one of those Disney films I grew up on and I still have fond memories of putting this on on VHS and enjoying every minute of the story. I was obviously looking forward to this Blu-Ray reissue and although it lives up to my expectations in some respects, it also misses the mark in others. The re-mastering is pretty decent and the sound quality is much improved, but I feel the animal rendering is too polished now. The nuance and style of the classic animation is lost and you can obviously tell this has been retouched. Re-mastering should be unobtrusive and add to the end product and sadly here it detracts from the original animation. Thankfully the scenery is still beautiful and many small touches that make this film remain. This film has great music that brought many memories flooding back and the now famous psychedelic pink elephant scene is just as impressive as ever. This has a nice mix of cute, funny and sad scenes and the sad ones made me choke up as a kid and still had the power to put a lump in my throat as an adult. This package features an array of extras, most of which are of more interest to a child audience, but there area also some bits of interest to adults too. Overall this is a fine example of classic Disney animation and although I feel the re-mastering may have taken a step too far this time, this is still a film that should be owned by all fans of animation. This is heart warming film making at it's best.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000007MVM|5.0|..we had dinner at this buffet restaurant and when we finished we were all full and a little toasted.  As we stepped out onto the street a man on the sidewalk was selling these little plastic transparent rubber balls that lit up when you bounced them on the ground.  They were cool.  They had fish and a bunch of little stars floating around inside them.  So I bought a couple just for fun and bought an extra for my friend's girlfriend, who also wanted one.  We took a taxi back to my place after that and when we got back, my living room was really cold and me and my friend started throwing these balls back and forth across the living room.  You bounce it off the ground to the opposite person, each throwing a ball at the same time.  And when they hit the ground they light up like a strobe light.  Then someone had the great idea to turn off all the lights and play this game in the dark.  Its kind of hard catching a light ball in the dark.  They light up suddenly, and you can't see your hands, but you can see the ball.  And this game developed between us where if you dropped the ball, you got a point.  And the first person to reach 10 points, loses.  So my friend and I played and the girls kept score and the winner took on the next challenger and we really had a great time.   I had put on this album MADCAP LAUGHS just by accident when we got home, and not long after this, the whole game started up.  I couldn't have picked a better soundtrack.  I was impressed by how good it was.  I had never really listened to this album before, although I've had it for a while.  Fortunately it was the closest thing to my CD player when we got home from the restaurant, so now I know.  Use this album when you are in need of a light but seriously zany cool mood.
B0029F21BA|4.0|This is a great film. Penn highly deserved the Oscar for his performance in this film and the direction and supporting/co cast were all fantastic. It has you gripped until the end and leaves you breathless at it's conclusion. It has some very powerful, highly charged scenes and the whole film is acted brilliantly. It is a film that is better the first time around as you are unaware of the outcome and twists, but can easily be watched and enjoyed again and again. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0042H6VYG|4.0|The dramatically titled \\"Ultimate\\" does live up to its name and succeeds very well in encapsulating the PSB's \\"hits (and misses)\\" over the past 25 years or so.    One of the hardest things to get right in a \\"Best of\\" to to create an exciting and engaging audio journey for the listener rather than simply have hit after hit which may not mesh too well.    Ultimate is a real pleasure to simply put on, say in the car (recently driving from Sydney to Melbourne, 900km it ran through 3 times with me happily singing along before I switched to Depeche Mode) or while Im preparing dinner with a glass of South Australian Shiraz or Rose. The point being that the selection of tracks works really well as an audio-collection and as a representation of commercial and artistic success.    The collection of 19 tracks is skewed towards PSB's first three albums with 2-3 tracks from each. The PSB's last 4 albums only score 1 track from each. Oh well, they are hardly going to include \\"Numb\\" over \\"Heart\\".    Of course everyone will grumble about why such and such a track wasn't included and why such and such was included - (Mine: \\"Before\\" over \\"Bilingual\\"?).    But hey, 3 generations of my family love \\"West End Girls\\", \\"Always on my Mind\\", \\"Go West\\", \\"Miracles\\" and they are all obviously included.    The new track \\"Together\\" is a pleasing slice of euro-disco.    For Fans..the DVD contains a seemingly endless number of appearances of PSB on Top of the Pops and the Pandemonium Concert at Glastonbury.     Ultimately, this a superb \\"Best of\\" and that is all it aims to be.
B00008AWOD|5.0|This is a great Placebo album. Close enough to their previous albums to appeal to existing fans and fresh enough to stay current, a perfect mix.

A great album for existing fans, and the best place to start for new ones.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001NFNFF8|2.0|`In The Electric Mist' is a weak murder mystery crime thriller starring Tommy Lee Jones. From the word go this had a `made for TV' quality about it, whether it be from the cheap and dated soundtrack or the wooden acting from the townsfolk supporting cast; pretty soon into this film you realise that this isn't going to be ground breaking stuff. Lee Jones is definitely acting by rote here and there is a lack of passion throughout. It doesn't live up to his usual high standards. This had a slow start and little hook or drama and the terrible dialogue made me cringe at numerous times whilst watching. By the time the film ends you are hoping for some kind of twist or shock ending, but instead you get very little coherence between scarce plot lines and not a great deal left of the story that bears any relation to anything else. There is no real motive or back story to the murderers actions and you are left doubting the credibility of the entire film. As you can see there isn't a great deal to commend this film for and to be honest you can miss this and not worry in the slightest. Watch this if nothing else is on (or buy it if you have money burning a hole in your pocket), but otherwise check out something else to pass your time.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00005B4GU|4.0|This record, heard 9 years after the expectation created by the monster that was Kid A, is very very good.  I'm glad I pulled it out from the shelf after all this time, I suggest that fans with less than fond memories of it do the same.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Much has already been said about our hairy heroes, Fleet Foxes and I concur with many reviewers here that a stand out feature of their music is the lush harmonies and sixties influenced sound. Luckily they manage to make this sound fresh and put their own twist on it to make it relevant to a modern audience. The opener `Sun It Rises' is a good indicator of what is in store, with swirling harmonies and a great riff during the chorus and towards the end. They are a typical Sub Pop band and if you like other bands on that label then it is a sure bet you will like Fleet Foxes as well and they are a good example of modern folk. For some reason I enjoy this album more when played on headphones and the harmonies have more effect this way and I recommend you do this on first listen at least. This hasn't shaken my world as some reviewers have suggested it can do, but it is a solid, well written and produced album and always makes for around 40 minutes relaxed music listening. Worth checking out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0345509617|2.0|Although this book has amazing content and imagery, the book itself is not of good quality. I received the first book and every page was curved (like it had water damage). Thinking that was the case, I sent it back and ordered another. But when the second one arrived it was exactly the same. I was then able to figure-out that they have chosen the wrong paper quality for the amount of ink that is on each page (it should have been a thicker paper stock that can hold the amount of ink they are using). So for the amount they are charging it's disappointing to have a book that isn't good quality. I kept it anyway because it was a gift that someone specifically asked for. But I don't feel like I received my money's worth.
B004EK91LQ|4.0|I thought there was alot of amazing dancing than the other movies   and I'm glad that the story changes in every movie because it would have   been boring with the same characters over and over....but some characters from the last movie return too.

0375714839|5.0|This book provides a wonderful window into the culture, people, and history from the perspective of an Iranian woman.

B001P829VY|5.0|\\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\", one of the best films of the 1940's, has been given the Blu-ray transfer it so richly deserves. Virtually speckle free and with an enhanced soundtrack, \\"Treasure\\" offers a bleak portrayal of human nature only occasionally leavened with humor and self sacrifice, thanks mainly to the exuberant but sly performance of Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Walter Huston as a wise and altruistic old prospector.  \\"Treasure\\", along with Von Stroheim's \\"Greed\\" (1924), stands as Hollywood's greatest testament to the corrosive power of greed on the human soul, especially that of Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. Unconscionably ignored by the Academy, yet giving the unvarnished performance of his career, Bogart dares to be unlikable even as an out of work laborer hitting up the same American for repeated hand-outs. His descent into paranoia and madness, signalled by his references to himself in the third person and his rants against the rest of humanity, is graphically positioned in the richly detailed black and white shot on location universe of both urban and rural Mexico.  While not free of racist stereotypes, most notably el bandito of Rodolpho Bedoya and his infamous \\"badges\\" comments, \\"Treasure\\" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer and would influence future films such as \\"The Wild Bunch\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", 20 years later.
B0012GMV76|5.0|First heard this album when it first came out. I was working in a record shop in Tunbridge Wells, Kent and the rep came in with this album. I was immediately struck by the lyricism and beauty of the ensemble and have continued to listen to it for years. I bought a case of 25 and sold them within 4 months. All it took was playing a track or two and people bought it.<br /><br />I was pleased to hear the additional tracks on this CD. I'm still enjoying the music.

She is going on 4 with a brain that is always soaking up whatever you throw her way.  I decided that these books were more valuable than any silly toy that would break, so I ordered the entire set for the holiday gift.  Wow, did I make a hit!  She wouldn't put them down the whole week I was visiting there. And, we read together getting quality time too.  These books are instructional as well as fun to read for your child. Go for it!
B000035Z3K|4.0|Just some thoughts...<br /><br />Dracula (1931) is a classic for the ages.  Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula has become the enduring and iconic image of the king of all vampires.  I find this black and white movie to be dark and creepy with decent special effects for 1931.  Castle Dracula is especially creepy.  The original movie has no musical score.  This movie was made before musical scores became the norm in movies.  This movie's slow pacing, lack of musical score, and slow deliverance of lines is a reflection of the time period that it was made in - that is, it was made at the end of the silent era and beginning of the sound era, so the movie was filmed in the style and pace of how a silent movie would be filmed.<br /><br />A musical score was added in 1998 by composer Philip Glass.  This DVD allows you to watch the movie without the score or with the score.  I find the Glass score, not surprisingly, very unique.  His music seems a little offbeat to begin with, and his score for this movie is no exception.  I give his score 3 1/2 stars out of 5, which I would say is fair to pretty good.  I find that some of the music doesn't fit certain scenes very well.  The music seems too powerful in scenes where it should be tamer and seems to have a drive and rhythm that's awkward much of the time.  Glass is not the right kind of composer for a movie like this.  His style is just too offbeat and awkward.<br /><br />Also included is the Spanish version of the movie, made at the same time as the American version.  I actually think the Spanish version is slightly better than the American version due to its better camera angles, slightly better atmosphere, higher energy level, and better pacing.  The Spanish version is 1 hour and 44 minutes, whereas the American version is 1 hour and 15 minutes.  This DVD also includes a documentary called \\"The Road To Dracula\\", commentary from film historian David J. Skal, the theatrical trailer, and more.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good.  Lugosi defined the classic Dracula character.  His image has held up for some 80 years.  When people dress up as Dracula for Halloween, it always seems to be the Lugosi version.<br /><br />This was the first ever Dracula movie and many more versions have followed in the last 80 years.  My personal favorites are the 1958, 1979, and 1992 movies, but this 1931 movie is the one that started it all.  Highly recommended.acula character.  His image has held up for some 80 years.

B0000CNY27|4.0|Over the years, John Carpenter's Escape From New York (1981) has become a cult favorite.  It's B-movie science fiction, with crude special effects that are now part of the film's charm.  The movie has an interesting premise and a solid and very talented cast who really bring to life, this dark vision of the future.  Kurt Russell, the onetime star of Disney fare like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), is perfect as the notorious Snake Plissken, a criminal with an eye patch, raspy voice, and a reputation for getting things done.<br /><br />Manhattan island in 1997 has become a penal colony, and the President's plane has crash landed somewhere near what was the financial district.  Police commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) recruits Plissken for a rescue mission, where in return for recovering the Commander in Chief, he would earn his freedom.  The catch is that Snake has less than 23 hours to bring the President (Donald Pleasance) out alive, or charges planted in his neck will explode and kill him.  Plissken enters the city's air space in a glider, and lands on one of the towers of the World Trade Center.  He begins his search using a tracking device that homes in on a bracelet that the President is wearing.<br /><br />Escape From New York could easily have been a more violent and brutal adventure, but instead it is more atmospheric, than action packed.  Plissken navigates the streets, inhabited by the creepy lowlife that come out at night, and learns that the President has been taken prisoner by The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), an underworld leader.  Snake catches a huge break when he encounters Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), a cab driver who takes him to see \\"Brain\\" Close (Harry Dean Stanton), and his girlfriend Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau).  Brain manufactures gasoline for The Duke, and also has information about an escape route from the city, via the 69th Street Bridge.  Plisskin convinces Brain to betray the Duke, and help him rescue the President.<br /><br />After being somewhat sedate, the level of action cranks up in the third act, as the rescue party attempts to save the President.  One of the more memorable scenes, is Snake's cage match to the death, where it is revealed how Plissken got his moniker.  The chase on the bridge is serviceable, but at a very small scale, and again far less thrilling than it could have been.  Despite the limitations, John Carpenter (Halloween) utilizes his resources well, delivering a film that entertains, as Snake enjoys the last laugh.<br /><br />Beloved by many, Escape From New York probably could have been a stronger film, but it is quite a fun ride for what it is.  If the film were ever remade, it is quite easy to envision it with slick high tech gadgets, CG special effects, and lots of carnage.  If it ever were to happen, one would hope that the film would capture some of the same campy style, and that the cast would even be half as good as the original, who make the most of what is basically a comic book adventure.<br /><br />Carpenter and Russell initially collaborated on the TV movie Elvis (1979), and this would be the first of three films they would make together during the 80's, the second being the classic sci-fi remake The Thing (1982), followed by Big Trouble in Little China (1986).  The two disc special edition of Escape From New York, has the most extra content, and probably provides the most bang for the buck, including two commentaries, which are not present on the Blu-ray version.  As usual, Carpenter's commentary with Russell are very informal and entertaining.sedate, the level of action cranks up in the third act, as the rescue party attempts to save the President.

B0042816YK|4.0|I've missed Julia Roberts.  Either I have been watching different movies or she hasn't been in many lately. I forgot how much I enjoyed her acting.  She comes across despite her obvious attractiveness as a genuine person with many levels on the screen. This role was no exception.<br /><br />Having not read the book, I have nothing but, the movie to comment on. I enjoyed it.  The characters were interesting and complex. Liz, Julia's character, essentially did what many women do, absorb their boyfriend's/husband's interests and make them their own. Often time, laying their own interests aside.<br /><br />This character combines her interests in travel with her search for herself.  Ironically one of her choices India combines a former boyfriend's interest in a particular guru. This I found a bit odd. Maybe his interest awakened one in her.<br /><br />The ending which I will not reveal here, was to me a bit ironic and counter-intuitive.  Especially with the character's gut punch reaction.  I said, when I saw it....here we go again...<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />This was an entertaining movie and reminded me of many of the people in my life that have offered advice; solicited and unsolicited. When you look back you think, hmm, they made sense or what a bunch of crap.  Sometimes the two are not immediately obvious.

B00461BQC0|5.0|Both critics and some of the old Kings of Leon fans say this album is crap, and that KoL has sold out and gotten ridiculous. I disagree big time! Yes, I can imagine how Come Around Sundown and even Only By the Night sounds bad for those who liked the old, darker Kings of Leon songs with Caleb mumbling the lyrics no one can really understand. But the thing is - change can be GOOD! It's a shame some people don't understand it. I must say, I'm a fan of their new sound and not so much the first two albums, so for me Come Around Sundown is a great record. I find songs like \\"Pyro\\", \\"The End\\", \\"Radioactive\\", \\"The Face\\" etc. amazing, no matter what the critics or some of the old KoL fans say. Come Around Sundown is a great album, and Kings of Leon still are kings of rock. Period.
