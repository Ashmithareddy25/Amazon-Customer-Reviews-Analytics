1592289444|5.0|I think I have read this book four times now, and will read it again in a year or two. After seventy years of reading books, this stands out among the \\"ten best.\\" Like the other nine well read books, it will grow dog-eared from frequent use. I had to buy a new copy, as I loaned out the last one and didn't get it back. I can't say anything better.
0618477942|5.0|Reading Fun Home feels like a scavenger hunt through someone else's diary.  In Alison Bechdel's memoir in graphic novel form, she skillfully illustrates setting through both text and image.  Myriad cultural and literary allusions assist movement and characterization \\"not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms.\\"  Detailed drawings abound with ephemera: newspaper front pages, handwritten margin notes in dog-eared books, phone messages, dictionary definitions, field guides, maps, product labels, photographs, and letters.<br />Fun Home rings with honesty as Bechdel vividly recounts childhood experiences with wry humor and perspective, but never nostalgia.  Witty, telling dialogue between Alison, her family and friends punctuates her often poetic narration.  Both expertly depict the complicated relationship between Alison and her father, a high school English teacher with a passion for heavy literature and gothic interior design and restoration.  Alison discovers he is a closeted [....] when she comes out to her parents during college, an event that both clarifies and confuses their distant connection.<br /> The combination of Bechdel's frank and likeable tone and expert illustration lead the reader irresistibly from one frame to the next as she pieces together the memories and people that influenced her identity.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|It's not too late to say \\"pass\\" on this newest, but mediocre album of Norah Jones.  I don't know why all artists, or nearly all, think they have to go away from what people liked about them in the first place and \\"experiment\\" or \\"grow\\" or some other existential bunk.<br /><br />This album contains a collection of mediocrity and experimental dumb stuff that is nothing like what drew me to Norah Jones in the past.<br /><br />Take a good listen to the on-line examples before you waste your money on this one.  I didn't do that and bought mine in an advance sale, based on my appreciation of her previous work.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />Sorry, Norah.  Try again, please.
B000021Y77|5.0|just incredible...The acting, directing, and pacing are all perfect!  Watching this with the volume up is a surreal experience.    <br /> <br />Buy it!  ;)
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I am the owner of an original HP 12C purchased in 1981. I gave it to my [...] daughter who is able to understand this device (it is more than 2 X older than she is!). The HP 12C Platinum was an emotional purchase which will serve me for the next 26 years! There is no other financial calculator with equal power in a shirt pocket form. Any function I need which is not preprogrammed I can program myself with the easy programming mode. The Platinum model has a faster processor, more programming memory and BOTH ALG and RPN entry modes.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Well acted dark mystery. Edward Norton is excellent as always. His accent is perfect...never over the top. Paul Giamatti gives another great performance. See this movie soon.
032147404X|4.0|This book is an excellent resource. I bought a second copy for my father-in-law. <br />
B0000046KM|5.0|This is one Shirley's best albums. The depth of emotion she puts in her singing is incredible. I really miss here now that she's gone.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Without going into much detail, the extras - especially those about crime and culture etc are very interesting and add another dimension to the detail Scorsese insists upon. (e.g. - how much of a bonus was Billy offered to go undercover.) <br /> <br />However, please amazon - stop advertising these DVDs as  \\"Region 1 only\\". I'm in Australia - my DVD player plays all regions and I think the Europeans have the same system available.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Beautifully performed. Impressive staging. Gorgeous costumes and fantastic backup orchestra and chorales. The setting could not be better. This DVD will make you want to travel to Ireland.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie is not real fast paced but is very intriguing and a lot of fun to follow.  The title The Illusionist is taken very seriously throughout the movie with a lot of cool \\"illusions\\" that are very obvious and some much more subtle.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have both this version and the 2005 version with Keira Knightley.  Keira's version is more \\"fun\\" and \\"romantic\\" to me, but this version develops the characters so that you really understand what Jane Austen was trying to portray.  Excellent movie!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I love it.  Brings back a lot of memories for me and when I walk the track, I don't have to change the CD.  It does the whole 3 miles.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|I think this movie gave me a peak into the ballroom enthusiast lifestyle. Fun entertainment.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Loved this concert dvd.  Best replacement for lead singer I have ever seen.  Great energy and performance from every member.  I highly recommend.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I have both this version and the 1996 version with Collin Firth.  If you want an in depth character portrayal, then the 1996 version is it.  But this version is so fun and romantic that it's absolutely a must see!
B000KRN07S|5.0|Most every track on this CD is fantastic. I highly recommend it!!! Keep up the good work Norah!!!
0894803123|5.0|I'm so glad I didn't waste money on other ice cream cookbooks.  I'm completely satisfied with this one.  Who doesn't like Ben & Jerry's ice cream?  Now you can have that same great tasting treat anytime.  You know what's in it, and it's all natural!
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's book Eat, Pray , Love was a great read for me.  I felt very connected to her feelings and experiences. Her quest for spirituality , enjoyment, appreciation and balance in life was inspiring to me.  Also, I learned all sorts of new information about various cultures and spiritual practices.  I felt more capable of taking on my personal challenges with gratitude and grace after reading the book.  Better than church.  And...funny God bless her for making me laugh at her and myself.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I enjoyed the '97 version with Beckinsale, but I LOVED this version!  Haven't read the book yet.
B000GW8VTO|4.0|Good movie have it on original dvd, the HD version is very good. The sound and gunfire effects are great on HD>  A great addition to your HD library.
B00007KWHG|5.0|My best friend saw \\"Jersey Boys\\" in New York and gifted me with the soundtrack CD....it whet my appetite for more of the Four Seasons....I'm going to see \\"Jersey Boys\\" when it comes to L.A.  Brought back many memories...you'll be singing along to all of the tracks....it's great!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Absolutely the BEST Blues Album in my collection.  After viewing the DVD and listening to the CD, I purchased tickets to see Kenny Wayne & Guests in New Orleans. Living in Florida, that is an 18 hour drive. Would not miss this for the world. Highly Recommend this for your collection...
032147404X|5.0|This is the easiest and most enjoyable photography book I've ever read. As someone contemplating the jump from advanced digital to Digital SLR, I learned a great deal about the best techniques to make the most of my existing and future equipment. Scott's sense of humor adds levity to a subject that can quickly become technical and boring. This was a lot more than just a \\"photography for Dummies,\\" but kept the conversation at a level that everyone can understand and enjoy.
B000JBXY1W|5.0|I love this movie anyway, I played in the minors and my dad was a big Joe Jackson fan. The HD enhancement is really great and makes the voice sound really good.  The extras on this disc are great. The Galena tour and the Costner interview at his home with the baseball greats is excellent. I am a big Kevin Costner fan and this in one of his best and the HD is really an upgrade.
B000002UAU|5.0|Back in the late 1960's, my life revolved around music. Although I wasn't a musician, many of my friends were. My involvement was on the technical side and I recorded many local bands using the primative recording equipment of the time. <br /> <br />That aside, I can remember the first time that I heard Sgt. Pepper as though it was yesterday. It was a Saturday afternoon and I was at home listening to music. <br /> <br />That's when a few musician friends showed up with the just released Sgt. Pepper album. They had already listened to it but wanted to hear it on my system which was pretty much state of the art back then. <br /> <br />After \\"setting the mood\\", so to speak, I put the album on the turntable and we all kicked back to listen. During the entire playing, nobody said a word. Nobody needed to. <br /> <br />We had just heard what we felt was the greatest album ever made. We must have listened to it 6 more times and always found something new. A sound that we hadn't heard before. A new interpretation of a lyric. I even recorded it and we listened to it backwards. <br /> <br />Over the years I wore out two vinyl copies of the disc. I hadn't replaced the second copy and many years went by without my listening to the album in its entirety. <br /> <br />About a year ago I bought the CD version. I've copied it to my MP3 player and it's even on my computer at work. Amazingly, the sound quality of the CD isn't all that much better (if at all) than the original vinyl.  <br /> <br />I no longer \\"set the mood\\" before listening to music, but that hasn't in any way lessened my enjoyment of what I still think may be the greatest album of its time.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|I was introduced to the Black Keys a year or so before they hit the mainstream. I was blown away by the amount of different sounds that can come from just one guy on a guitar and one guy on drums. If you don't believe what you're hearing, see them live. It is definitely worth it. This is an excellent album and I highly recommend having is in your cd library.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna is the greatest icon of our time! This CD/DVD is the best she's done so far. The Confessions Tour was spectacular. I love you Madonna.
B000GTJT16|4.0|I have this on original dvd. The HD is real good for some reason I thought the sound would be better but definitely worth the purchase. Buy it on Amazon you wont be sorry.
B000002KNI|5.0|If you like Simon, Garfunkel, or Simon and Garfunkel at all, this CD should be the very first in your collection. Sheer beauty. Not studio quality, (it IS, after all, a live concert) but with such atmosphere, you really don't miss that.
087349976X|2.0|I put this book on my Christmas wish list, and was very happy to find it under the tree.  My excitement soon faded when I saw how lacking in basic instruction it is.  The coverage of the basics is okay, and there are some nice looking projects, but, while some of the simpler elements are explained (though not well), the reader is left to figure out other major elements on their own.  Drawings are poor and don't relate well to the actual piece  -- as if graphic interest was more important than accurately detailing what the element should look like.  I found the \\"WOTWS (Working Off The Wire Supply)\\" abbreviation used on many of the projects to be silly and slightly annoying.  In every case, there was plenty of room to spell out those five words, and if I don't pick this book up for a month or two, I've got to go hunting again (page 12) for the meaning of the acronym.  I would recommend Sharilyn Miller's \\"Bead on a Wire\\" over this one.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|This movie was a really touching movie and it was well directed. Nicholas Cage did a wonderful job. Everyone should see this movie.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|I was at first kind of skeptical about seeing this movie when it was released in theaters, but I was pleasantly surprised by how excellent this movie is!!! If I could I would give it ten stars!! The acting was superb and best of all it kept you guessing the entire movie about what was going on!!! I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Thanks Amazon
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This a dream came true for die hard kiss fans. If you are one of them, you know what I'm talking about. Just can't wait for the followings DVD in 2007. <br />Maybe the concerts sound could be better improved with a little more digital technology, but it's OK. <br /> <br />
B000002UKS|5.0|This album it is the beginnig of the big success of this band, you will find songs like MY HERO and EVERLONG, Foo Fighters mix the fun with rock with sad love history, if you like an alternative rock music buy this album
B000GBEWHA|1.0|I bought this as a present for my wife.  She loves the movie but really fell in love with the leather jacket replica that it's supposed to come with (we saw it in a Best Buy store.)  I decided to buy it on Amazon (a bit cheaper and free shipping.)  But when I received it, there was only a standard DVD case and NO leather jacket.  I had to return it, and now I see that Best Buy doesn't sell it anymore so I guess we are out of luck.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Whew! What an experience.  I read a lot of reviews on the net before purchasing this unit and was satisfied that it would fill my needs.  Boy is that right. I have had no problems and the listening is great.  I can't say enough good for these phones. Roger
B000JJS8TM|3.0|Maybe if you had the opportunity to see the Cirque du Soleil spectacle, this Cd can be a good \\"souvenir\\". If you hadn't (like me),be sure you are a Beatles die hard fan (like me) before you buy it. If you are an average fan, let it go.
B00005JM0B|3.0|It is not Finding Private Ryan, it is robots take over the world and mankind fights back and wins, so don't expect any real drama.  It is great entertainment if you just want to forget everything else and watch some action.<br /><br />This is the second time I've watched the movie.  The first time was several years ago and I was so irritated by Hollywood Director's using the same hooks in their sequels just because it got a good reaction in the preceding movie, ie. the naked terminator goes into a bar . . . come guys . . . have him materialize inside a costume shop just before Halloween and come out as Zorro anything but the same thing again . . . geez!  Anyway, the next time I was ready for this and I was able to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />If you can let go of Hollywood's inability to take a risk about being creative a second time (like I was unable to do originally) you will enjoy the movie for what it is . . . machines take over the world, mankind begins to fight back and you are told mankind will win in the end . . . if<br /><br />enjoy
B00005K3OT|4.0|I purchased this DVD because Johnny Depp is in it.  I am a big fan of his.  I like this movie because he sings and plays the guitar in it..which is something we don't get to see him do in other movies.  Even in this movie you could see a shadow of things to come in him as \\"Captain Jack Sparrow\\"....he is the perfect man to play the pirate parts.  He has the look and actions.  The movie itself has a pretty good story but I would not have purchased it had Johnny Depp not been in it.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is a must have metal album. It's the first sabbath and probably the first real metal album. All the songs are great on this CD. I think the title track Black Sabbath and N.I.B. are my favorites. It's the original line up of Ozzy Osbourne, Toni Iomi, Bill ward, Geezer Butler. A totally Classic album!!!
B000077VPU|4.0|It's an original aproach to Queen Music from the point of view of many top artists. I enjoyed the full concert and the A&E Music special with backstages and some cool stuff. If you are a Queen or Freddye's fan, this DVD must be in your hands.
1582701709|5.0|Considering the idea that you are a magnet to other things in the universe through brain waves can be a frightening thought, especially when you are listening to this idea on an audio book in your car, driving down the highway and hoping that none of the large metal object whizzing past you are THAT attracted to your magnet. However, once you get past the shock of that potential, the Law of Attraction is an invigorating idea and one that surely most people have experienced at some point in their life. Have you ever thought about a friend you hadn't seen in a while and then, a couple days later, you see her? Have you prayed for and visualized a increase in wealth to have it come to you soon after? Have you thought about how a personal stressed relationship might be better only to have it ameliorate itself? These occurrences are hard to take as coincidence and happen to most people we know. So, assuming the Law of Attraction (the Secret) is real, what are we supposed to do?<br /><br />Ask for things you want, be grateful for what you have, and be positive and confident. That is the recipe for success in every aspect of life according to Byrne. It seems simple enough, and very healthy. There are problems in the methodology, however, and many people have trouble feeling positive- they're comfortable with stress, problems, and trouble. \\"The Secret\\" doesn't address how to get out of that rut besides just wishing it away.<br /><br />This book, based on the DVD, uses quite a few modern self-help experts, doctors, psychologists, and writers to get the point across: only you decide how your life will unfold. It's an inspirational work, but there are flaws. With so many qualified contributors and the depth of the subject matter, why is this book limited to short sound bites? Why, if this is a science and a law, is there no science behind the idea (at least described in this book). The answer to both questions is that no one really knows about these phenomenons (if you can call them that) and readers can relate to catchy one-liners in their own way without requiring the author/speaker to explain himself.<br /><br />There is certainly an immense (perhaps infinite) amount of knowledge to be discovered regarding the energy of the universe, from what particles are made of (Super String Theory), to what the Universe is made of (dark matter, dark energy), to human psychology. \\"The Secret\\" is a work that shows how much more there really is to know. However, the book shouldn't be seen as a scientific manual for how to explain it all. I know the author didn't intend it to be this way, but perhaps why she named it \\"The Secret\\" is because the law is still a secret to the author and contributors too.<br /><br />It's a good read despite its flaws and most people would benefit from the concepts Byrne tries to elucidate. I strongly believe in will power and the power of the mind and if this book helps people get to that point, then I commend them wholeheartedly!readers can relate to catchy one-liners in their own way without requiring the author/speaker to explain himself.

0142001104|5.0|This is a great book.  Anyone will find it helpful in freeing one's inner possibility, breaking negative limitations and creating new energy.  Especially helpful for people who manage or care for others such as supervisors, managers, teachers, pastors and parents.
6305841861|5.0|One of the funniest horror movies of all time. I love evil dead 2. I think it's the best of the 3 movies. Ash rules. He goes to the woods with his lady to her family's log cabin. Demons were released when someone read from the necronomicon (the book of the dead)and ash has to battle them through the whole movie. Theres a few locals who show up and of corse get killed off then turn in to deadites. great movie. I never get tired of it.
B000J103PC|3.0|First of all, Meryl Streep is great in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (and hence the three stars) as the tough edit-in-chief of Runway, a top fashion mag. Andrea is hired as her first assistant and is, initially, thought of as a fat and unfashionable new hire. Which is quite ridiculous because she looks sleek and quite well dressed to me. Anyway, the moral of this film (and anyone can see this coming) is that capitalists are unhappy if rich and, to be truly happy and save your relationships and your soul, you need to be an artist, sous chef or work for a newspaper. This is just another version of the usual Hollywood liberal propaganda against competition, hard work, big business and success spun as relationships are more important than money or cute clothes. Hey, Hollywood, how about a movie where the girl WANTS to be a success and financially well-off and doesn't want to work for peanuts for a liberal rag like the New York Times. And her boyfriend understands! Now THAT would be different, wouldn't it? Some critic called this a clever, funny adaption of Lauren Weisberger's novel, when really it is only funny to socialists. I am certain that those hard-working people in the fashion industry who love their jobs and have great family lives at the same time, thank you, didn't find this slick socialist screed funny at all.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I wasn't one who watched Gilmore Girls when it started airing on TV. I didn't even KNOW about the show. I was told about the show by a friend of mine, and she told me I had to check it out. Well, I was over at her house one night and watched one episode in the 5th season DVD set, and I was hooked!  I bought the first season DVD set to try it, and I wound up loving every single episode! I was so sad to know I had watched them all so far, so I ordered the second DVD set.  I've watched half of the episodes so far, and I must say it's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. It's a wholesome show about a mother and daughter that might live in a \\"utopia-type town\\", but they deal with real issues. My favorite thing about the show is all of the literary references they throw in. I believe they're called \\"Gilmorisms\\".  They're hilarious...AND it keeps you constantly interested in what they're going to say next! (Where did THAT come from?? What literary writer was that??) I suggest that any mother or teenage daughter needs to see this show.  Of course, I'm 29 and I love it too! :)
0812974611|5.0|This is a good book that really took me back to the last days of Pompeii - I love books that do that.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|First,those of you you have not been lucky enough to get a preview of SnA, you are in for a treat as of May 1st! Rush has never sounded so tight, nor taken this many chances on a recording since MP.
B000L43AN4|5.0|Like others who reviewed this collection, I am amazed that these songs were left OUT of other albums! It rates up there with my favorite TW albums, with the added bonus that it covers such a wide range of Waits' styles, including storytelling. It is wonderful and I haven't been able to get enough of it. Highly recommended to any Waits fan.
B000002UAI|5.0|Great classic album featuring the Greatest  Rock and Roll band in History.  Brings back the feel of the old album.
B000089RV6|5.0|A great, classic AC/DC album.  It brings me back to junior high, and the first boyfriend who introduced me to AC/DC (thanks, T.L.)!  Those were the days . . .
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This CD is great, it's edgier than her other two albums and several of the songs are probably her best ever.  She co-wrote all the songs which is an accomplishment.  A couple of the songs are a little dark, but after a few listens you \\"get\\" them.  If you don't like it at first, just keep listening because it will grow on you.  I would highly recommend this album.
0060899190|5.0|This book was incrediable easy to read and a lot of fun. It's easy to pick up but not easy to put down! It makes a great gift (which is why I purchased it). This book however, is about peoples deepest darkest secrets so it may not be appropriate as a gift for early teens.
B000067FP7|5.0|This movie is just as good as I remember it when I last saw it years ago.
B000093BDX|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my mom, who grew up in southern California, and has never quite gotten used to Utah winters in the 40+ years she has been here.  She listens to this over and over.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Excellent musicianship, sound and video production...... wwwwoooooow[...] was blown away. Highly entertaining, and with a great song selection. The additional features are a bit on the poor side, specially missing a documentary as special features (bad habit from the DT DVDs), just to get to know the band a bit better. But the main feature compensates, 'cause it would be a 5 star even if it didn't bring any additionals. After seeing this, it makes me think it's worth travelling to another country to see them live.
B000I0QK74|5.0|As always, Mr Smooth! Another classic CD to be played year after year on Christmas and any other time.  A mellow sound with soothing songs of love, family and good times.
B000067FP8|5.0|This movie is not as serious as the first, but it will have you laughing through the whole thing.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|I liked LAMB. It had some popp-ish, catchy, dance party kind of songs that made you want to get up and move. This CD didn't really do that for me.  <br /> <br />Wind it Up was the only dance song on this CD I enjoyed. The rest of the songs were like every other Hollywood starlet's-not written by the singer and bland. All in all, I say save your money and maybe download the songs that you like.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This movie is amazing. It's definitely a little out there and strange but the story is great.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|A very good movie with a moving story.  As always, Gregory Hines dancing and acting was wonderful and Mikail Baryshnikov was good also.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|There are a lot of Beatles albums out there already, but you can't miss this one.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I love her music, but this is her best so far.  It is a little darker - less pop than her others.  It fits her voice better.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|The Celtic Woman are HOT. I just love this CD. The dynamtic team is back on this CD. I hope they keep making music together and more CD's because I have become a BIG Fan of their style and music. I play the harp and I just love to hear harp music in some of their tracts on this CD. I also love the violin too. I hope they keep making Celtic music together. I wish I could see them in concert someday!! The Irish charm that came with it was cute too.
B000IMUYJM|3.0|This remake of Silent Night, Evil Night does not give the complete story line needed to follow the movie.  Still a good classical scary movie.
B000078DOH|4.0|The Chili Peppers' second album is best described by the amazing Flea himself.. `Too funky for white radio, too punk for black.'<br /><br />What we have here is a very entertaining variety of off-kilter, and bizarre pieces of funky rock; but to give you my view on the Peppers in general, so to compare your personal opinion to mine, I think that 'Freaky Styley' 'Mothers Milk' 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' and 'Uplift Mofo Party' are the Chili Peppers most creative, and entertaining albums. This is the Chili Peppers before the extreme funk and experimentation was watered down by alternative and commercial influences. To me, this is more along the lines of what the Chili peppers should have remained.. but of course I am more into Primus and Tom Waits than anything alt pop.<br /><br />The only downfall to this album is the sometimes immature lyrics. While I don't enjoy the later Peppers music all that much, I do think that they have really evolved lyrically. The production isn't so good either, wich may bother you, but I find it to add personality to this particular recording.<br /><br />If you are looking for classic Chili Peppers radio hits, then look elsewhere. There is not a radio-friendly song on this album. If you are looking for something weird, funky, and fun, then I would say that you have found it..
B00004XMV6|4.0|It was HOT! For couples who are feeling frisky, this might add a spark that'll lead to a flame.  Kim was a her best, so was Mickey.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought Band of Brothers after watching many different episodes on A&E, in various orders and missing parts of each chapter with my boyfriend.  He LOVES the series and will stop WHATEVER he is doing to pay full attention to it!  He was extremely excited to open this for Valentine's day...not my idea of romantic, but it worked for him!  I'm sure you will enjoy the Band of Brothers characters and storylines just as much as we do.  The interviews with the actual soldiers are so intriguing and moving, you just become so much more connected with the stories because you've seen the real people who lived through them.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|They are fabulous!!  When I play this cd, the mood in my home changes dramatically to a quiet, and tranquil one.  I cannot find a song on this cd that I don't care for.....they are all great!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This DVD is even better than their first one. The sound quality and audio quality is excellent.  <br />The music and the selection of the numbers are great. The entire group performs even better than they did in their first DVD, with a lot more emotion and stage movement and makes the viewer feel as if he/she is at the live performance. We would like more of their performances on DVD in the future. <br /> <br />Eksath Weerekoon
B000000LZV|4.0|I was inspired to look back to this amazing release by the book Our Band Could Be Your Life, and I wasn't disappointed. I only had a vague recollection of the Minutemen from the 80s so I wasn't quite sure what was in store, but even a typically tinny SST production job can't mask the raw creativity, energy and excitement over the course of an almost ridiculous 43(!) tunes.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This CD proves that The Beatles, without a doubt, are the BEST BAND EVER! I cried when I listened to the album for the first time and still, every song [in their own special way] fills my eyes with tears. If you are a true fan, you will enjoy every second of it! Everybody should own a copy of \\"Love\\"... My personal favorites are \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" \\" and \\"Octopus Garden\\"...
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is one of my favorite singers, and I think this cd is one of the best he's done.  He has a beautiful, calming voice, that makes you really feel his music.  AAA++++++++ !!!!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I have been a NoJo fan from the beginning.  I can listen to her first two CDs over and over and not get tired of hearing her soulful soft voice.  But I must say I was a bit disappointed with her latest album.  Aside from Rosie's Lullaby, it was, well, boring.  It's not that the songs are bad, but they seem to be missing the passion Norah has portrayed through her previous albums.  It is a good background album, maybe at work or during a dinner party, but not if you're looking to be inspired.  Not bad, but not great either.  Where is the Norah Jones we know and love?

032147404X|5.0|I love this book and its very practical and straightforward approach to photography and I carry it alongside my journal now when I travel because its become that indispensable.  Last year I took some classes at a community college for digital photography and found myself swamped with technical notes which confused me more than anything.  However, with Scott Kelby's book he has a great approach to how he teaches he categorizes scenarios and tells you exactly how to set your camera in that situation.  His reasoning is that if you do the correct adjustments enough then you'll learn by experience on what to do in future similar scenarios.  Quite honestly for someone who enjoys taking photographs that's how I want to go about it and not feel like I have to figure a Calculus formula to snap a shot of a gazelle or something.

1581806574|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is an aspiring artist and she fell in love with it!  She had never seen anything like it and finished it in a weekend.  She wants more just like it.  Thank you for helping me to encourage her.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Being a big fan of Jane Austen and any movie based on her works I expected North and South to be a cut below.  I was wrong.  The intensity of feelings and the depths of passion in this movie have sparked an interest in the novels of Elizabeth Gaskill.  There is much prejudice at play in the world they inhabit... the bucolic south verse the hardscrabble north, the old impoverished wealth verses the new industrial rich, the union workers verses the factory owners, but most especially bad first impressions verse growing respect.  What a beautiful way to watch two people set aside their pride, grow to truly love each other and more importantly learn to value each other.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Michael Buble has every thing it takes to be a star....a beautiful voice and good looks. He is also very personable with his fans/audience at his concerts. He is number one on my list!!!!

B000M5AJQS|4.0|While The Departed was easily the best movie of 2006, the DVD simply falls way short. While it does offer some interesting documentaries in the special features, there is no behind the scenes documentary at all, and no feature commentaries by anyone. In fact there is barely anything on the 2-disc edition that is related to The Departed, which is pretty ridiculous considering the extra money paid.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I really liked the scene where the tsounami goes towards NY. I found the special effects fascinating and I literally enjoyed the prospect that the ship passes between buildings.
0803729227|5.0|Another great rhyming book from Julia Donaldson.  She does a great range of books and they appeal to adults and kids.  They are so easy to read and it is a joy to follow the simple yet exciting stories.  She is a gifted story teller and the illustrations are just intriguing.

B00007K02F|1.0|I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. <br />THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW .
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a really nicelly shot movie. First of all I admire Scarlett Jhohanson and her work. She is amazing in every role she has played. I beleive she is very naturally talented no matter what school she graduated from. She just has the charisma. She is natural. I almost own every movie she is in. This is not the strongest role ever but she is very good as always in this particular movie.  <br /> <br />The movie's subject now is very interesting and it twists in many ways to the point that you cannot really comprehend exactly what happened uless you watched it twice. It 's a smart comlecated thriller.
0803723865|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it....oh yeah and so did the kids.  What a treasure to find a book that adults can enjoy as well as the kids.  And the rhyming text makes it easy to read and attractive to listen to.  Highly recommended.
B000KQGP2G|1.0|TPE:1 was a conceptual and musical masterpiece.  To call this TPE:2 is a total insult.  They totally copped-out with this album and it's nothing more than a collection of condescending rants and whines from Gildenlow.  The last two songs are the only really good ones on the album.   <br /> <br />A good album is timeless.  This one (hopefully) will be very out-of-date and forgotten soon.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|Is not as good as the first, but nothing can beat it!

B00006RCOB|5.0|The movie is one of my favorites.  However, the DVD case is cheap, not like store bought.  It's a cheesy plastic with a piece of cardboard with cover art.  Remove the cardboard out of the slot and there's nothing there.
B00009MGGI|5.0|What a production! Only the British can (it appears)make great television viewing. I remember watching this program when it was first broadcast,and it has lost none of it's impact. An interesting view of British politics.It is ashame that Ian Richardson died a week before he was to appear in an episode of Midsommer Murders. Keeps ones interest right to the end!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Love this movie! Love the cast-- they work together so well. This movie should not have a R rating. <br />Yes, they use the \\"f\\" word a number of times and there is some sexual discussion, Grandpa snorts heroin--but that doesn't turn out so well. The message of this movie is so much more empowering and family value affirming than many of the other films out there that are marketed to families and teens.  <br />But don't let that scare you either. It is very entertaining. AND-- I didn't even mention the soundtrack! <br />This movie turned me on to the wonderful Devotchka. Check them out as well.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This hard to find movie turned to out to be the most wonderful experience thanks to the great service and timely delivery my grandchildren has watched this DVD over and over and over again.

B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead always shows up on those lists of bands that everyone loves. <br />I could not get my head around them (I started with Kid A-- not so accessible) <br />I heard Gillian Welch do a fab cover of Black Star and had to hunt down the original. <br />Now I am a true believer-- this recording is great from one track to the next.

B000002UAX|5.0|It's hard to believe that the Beatles individualistic domineering album universally referred to as \\"The White Album\\" as almost 40 years old...and 20 million in sales later.  To really \\"know\\" the meaning of the White Album, is to know the stage The Beatles were in back in 1968.  The album was the first album of fresh material the Beatles did following the death of their beloved manager, Brian Epstein who died in August 1967 of an accidental prescription drug overdose. The Beatles, going through their India meditation experience while meeting in Bangor, Wales with the Maharashi, post-Sgt. Pepper and during the time of their Magical Mystery Tour TV movie fallout, started to think more of being an individual, rather than the band.   <br /> <br />Consequently, one would bet that this would have been a major flop by the band and to create this a two-record project, was almost screaming a disaster.  But the magic was there again.  John, Paul, George and Ringo recorded the White Album in 1968 as individuals...perhaps not entirely, but at least most of it was recorded at different times and junctures.  Paul would enter the studio one day and record material and George would show up and record back-up a few days later.  That's an example how The White Album was made. <br /> <br />Most people know the major songs on the album suck as \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Obla-di, Obla-da\\", \\"While My Guitar Gentle Weeps\\" and perhaps \\"Helter Skelter\\".  Are they the best tracks?  Well, they are among the best tracks.  To know The White Album is to know \\"Julia\\", \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", \\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Martha My Dear\\", \\"Piggies\\", \\" Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\", \\"Savory Truffle\\", \\"I Will\\", \\"Long , Long, Long\\", \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", \\"Revolution 1\\" and \\"Don't Pass Me By\\".  Then there's the great \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\", \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\" and who can forget.....\\"Revolution 9\\"?   <br /> <br />Ringo temporarily left the band during the recording of this project, but then was asked to come back by John, Paul and George.  How can Ringo refuse? Why, he's the great drummer who always wanted the band to play again after their 1970 break-up.   <br /> <br />So it's 2007, and The White Album stands at the 19th biggest selling album in the U.S., and at number ten in Rolling Stone magazine's top 500 albums of all time.  A masterpiece of work for a band who could do no wrong.
B0006J28KU|4.0|This is a long, involved, and generally superior caper movie, something on the order of \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" but with a cop thrown into the sauce. In addition, as a kind of subplot, we have a duel of wits between Pacino who represents LA's Robbery and Homicide, and DeNiro as the head of the honorable gang betrayed by a renegade member.<br /><br />The cast on the whole is splendid. Pacino gives a wide-eyed arm-waving, thoroughly enjoyable performance. As his third wife, Diane Venora with her feline eyes is the sensible spouse who feels she is not sharing her husband's life because he doesn't feel she should know about the rottener side of his work. If this sounds a bit familiar, it may be because you've run into this conflict in so many other movies, including \\"Bullit\\", \\"The Godfather,\\" and others. She is the only character who is given lines that make her sound as if she's gone to college -- \\"What you do is sift through the debris, then pick up the scent and follow it,\\" describing how she views her husband's job. DeNiro is more restrained, thoughtful, solemn, always seeming to be strangling his passion. His motto: \\"Never get involved in anything you're not ready to turn your back on and walk out of in thirty seconds flat.\\" Until he meets Amy Brennerman, a pretty young woman who turns in an understated performance filled with nuance. Val Kilmer's pinched face has now progressed beyond prettiness and has acquired real character, matched by his acting here. Two performances are absolute standouts. John Voight as the avuncular source of street information, a kind of Mentor to the gang, is flawless in the role. He has turned into a marvelous character actor. And Ashley Judd as Kilmer's love interest has to be one of our more underused and underrated actresses. She has plump lips, darting dark eyes, and a most mobile face and expressive body, able to convey more with a smile or a gesture than imaginable. She is a magnetic presence in this movie and in some others, so muchso that when she is on screen she seems to command it without trying.<br /><br />All the major characters have domestic problems, including an African-American driver recruited by the gang at the last minute. But these conflicts are secondary to the main thread of this complex plot, which involves two big heists, several shoot-outs in crowded streets, and a couple of murders in between, some of them off screen. The film is as admirable for what it leaves out as what it includes. There are -- this may be difficult to believe -- there are no slow-motion scenes of violence and not a single car chase. A man trying to escape in a pickup is shot while speeding away. The traditional, moribund thriller/action scenario DEMANDS that this vehicle either blow up like a Claymore or end its earthly existence in a spectacular slow-motion crash. But, no. The director has the truck with the dead man at the wheel slow down and roll to bump gently against a cyclone fence. Yes, folks, it's true. See it for this reason if for no other.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The version of Jane Eyre, ever the poignant tale, was beautifuly done. Nothing over the top or rushed. The lead actors are believable and fill their rolls masterfully.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  A lot of times you buy a CD because you like a few songs...possibily 1, 2 or 3 at the most.  I loved every song on this CD.  John Mayer has such a calming, unique quality to his voice.  Like no other.  I would recommend this CD to any and everyone who wants to enjoy an entire CD, whether on a road trip or just spending quite time at home.  I have several of John Mayer's CD and have found them all to be wonderful.  This is a winner!
B000001GQC|5.0|Nevsky with Abbado is a stirring and moveing piece.  This is the best version I've heard!  Kije and the the rampaging Scythians are also first rate.
B000AP04OM|5.0|If you like musicals you will love this one
B000KQGP2G|5.0|Scarsick, the title of the new Pain of salvation, IMO one of the best bands in the prog-metal scene, the album is offering lots of styles with 10 songs that can goes from the heavy POS stylish in the 1st track \\"Scarsick\\" with heavy riffs and agressive melodies and it's lyrics tell us about life and how people is really not paying attention to the world, then is \\"Spitfall\\" a very nice \\"rapping-metal\\" song also very progressive; now is \\"Cribcaged\\" one of my favorite songs from this album has alot of feeling, then is \\"America\\", \\"Disco Queen\\" basicaly a Disco/Abba Stylish song. \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" also one of the best tracks in this CD or at least one of my favorite... that has its POS trademark and finally are the tracks 7. \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\", 8. \\"Idiocracy\\", 9. \\"Flame To The Moth\\", and last but not least is 10. \\"Enter Rain\\" also having a ressemple of good old Remedy Lane album. Finally, I give 4.7 stars if you're a POS fanatic then you'll love definitely this album.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I loved this movie. My husband called it a total Chick Flick, maybe that is the reason I loved it!
B00070DK1E|5.0|This is a great album for Jethro Tull Fans. The fact that it won the Grammy for best \\"heavy metal\\" album only adds to its allure. After several albums with a techno bent, this is a return to form for Tull. Steel Monkey, Farm on the freeway, Budapest - are all very memorable tracks.  The newly mastered version also has the outstanding bonus track \\"part of the machine\\".   The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the use of drum machines and the fact that Ian Anderson's voice sounds quite different than earlier Tull releases. Still a great pick!
B0000AUHPB|3.0|It was interesting.  The remake is definitely more exciting.  It is different than the remake and the ending keeps you hanging.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah and the band are really fresh on this disc.  I really respect an artist who isn't afraid to try new styles of music, and she has accomplished this on this album without sacrificing style or quality.
0060763280|5.0|I think this book by Harv is one of the best books ever written on describing the limiting beliefs we have accumulated over our lifetime.<br /><br />How Harv breaks these down into his wealth files makes it easy to see which ones you have that are holding you back.  It's really easy to read through the book and become amazed at what you were taught that is keeping you poor.  Harv is the master!<br /><br />Also, once you purchase the book you can now attend his Millionaire Mind Intensive for $97.  I've been to his MMI so I can tell you that this is probably the best value, compared to price, of a seminar I've ever seen.  He is also a marketing genius!  Good for you Harv!!!
B000F5GO0A|3.0|That this album has received so much attention in the indie music scene, and that people consider this art music is yet more evidence of a growing trend. People who like talking about music, more than they actually love music. While combining synthpop with \\"Balkan\\" folk is conceptually original, the musicianship on this album is a bit bland. Any hobo with a arpeggiator-equipped synthesizer and a JEREMY BARNES could put together alot of four chord ditties that sound pretty. The constant comparison with Neutral Milk is natural, considering that they share a key member. I would say the brass, and rhythm section are the album's redeeming feature... Condon lacks the lyrical depth, and intensity that Jeff Mangum posesses, and every track is extremely repetitive. Credit should be given to the young lad for having an extremely handsome voice, however, and perhaps future releases will show him maturing and developing as a writer/musician. I have to say I'm kind of sick of hipsters who love balkan-flavored-this, and retro-flavored-that, and know nothing of the roots. Look forward to more eastern-euro-flavored whatsit from this little flavor of the year indie icon.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Great album. Would have won a grammy if they were decided on talent instead of popularity or politics.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I hadn't heard this CD before but sure glad I bought it - I think it's one of her best, a little of a departure from her \\"lite rock\\" stuff.  She is political on this one and she wears it well.  Highly recommend it (but not if you're a Bush fan maybe) The whole CD is great, I love it.
0312330529|5.0|I have been to Bombay many times and have friends there who are very close.  This book captures that incredible city better than anything I have ever read.  It also captures the human spirit better than anything else I have read of late.  It is so refreshing not to read something deep, interesting, culturally challenging and deep.  Being an American it is rare to find something not written by the same 5 novelists who tend to always be found at the top of the bookshelf in any airport or Borders.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Everything that I have ordered from Amazon has been just as expected. One of the best things along with their products is how fast your purchase gets to you even when you choose to go with free shipping that takes longer. Everytime so far I have gotten my package almost a week in advance. I will continue to use amazon for any internet purchases.

1932100660|5.0|This book is an eye opener to facts that have been somehow suppressed from the public for many years, even decades.  I'm reconsidering my diet as a result of reading this book.  This book could have major implications on the quality and quantity of health in your life.
1552091090|5.0|This book is a great gift for any mother-to-be or anyone who is already a mother.  A simple story that is just so touching... it will make anyone weep.
0694003611|5.0|Reading is a wonderful way to bond with baby and this is a really great book to do it with. I read this to my baby every night after bath. The repetative and rhyming verses allow baby to anticipate the next line. I love that it's a board book so it can stand up to being dropped, grabbed and chewed. Great book.
B000031XCR|5.0|I BOUGHT TWO COPIES OF CELINE DION'S DECADE OF SONGS.  ONE COPY FOR ME AND ONE FOR MY SON . WE ARE DOING OUR DANCE AT HIS WEDDING IN SEPTEMBER TO THE SONG: \\"BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME\\".
B000002ITW|5.0|I bought 4 Way Street as an album when it was originally released.  I bought it again when it was released as a CD.  Then when my daughter became a teenager she \\"borrowed\\" it from me and it is now living with her in her apartment.  I could not live without it so I have once again purchased 4 Way Street.  Why...?  Because of the haunting beauty of Find The Cost Of Freedom, the exhilaration of Love The One Your With, the melancholy of Cowgirl In The Sand and the hope of Carry On. Almost every song is a gem and to hear these four artists together is an opportunity not to be missed.
1400064287|5.0|I am recommending this book to everyone I meet.  Originally I bought this book because I am in marketing, but this book can be beneficial to everyone.  If you have ever had a good thought or idea that you couldn't get others to act on or even hear, this book is for you.  After reading the first chapter alone, I had dozens of ideas about how to apply the information.  You won't regret buying this book.  In fact, it will probably be one of your favorite reference books.  I know it is mine.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|If you are a Norah Jones fan, you should buy \\"Not Too Late\\", but don't expect it to be on par with her previous efforts. If you are not that familar with Norah Jones' music, don't buy \\"Not Too Late\\", go for an earlier release. \\"Not Too Late\\" has flashes of the Norah music I really enjoy, but for the most part it is uneven and disappointing.
B000006MS3|5.0|i think this album came on a direct pipeline from god. it's that good and interesting. Kate goes crazy with the fairlight.
074356619X|5.0|Yes this information has been around forever, but here all the pieces are put together in a very understandable, and VERY powerful format. I watched the movie and loved it and then ordered the audio CD's to listen to in the car. They have all the same speakers from the film, but add a lot of (invaluable) extra meat from Rhonda Byrne. I listen to them over and over so the messages will sink in deep. I already notice many wonderful changes in my life. I have given this CD set to many friends and family members and highly recommend to everybody!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has one of the most beautiful voices in the music world today. Her soft, sensual tones are just right for the music she writes. This CD has a string of songs that are so pretty I play it over and over again!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie until I found it on Amazon. I'm a big fan of Labyrinth and I love the genre, so when I found Mirrormask I bought it on a whim. What a great surprise! For me it surpasses Labyrinth (and I know many people who would consider that sacrilege), but it really does. This is probably the most visually revolutionary movie I've ever seen. Absolutely beautiful. That said, there is some truth to the accusation circling in other reviews that the movie is all visual with a weak plot. The plot is fine and makes perfect sense, but it's not a screenwriting masterpiece by any means. But that's really just characteristic of the genre. Labyrinth had an even weaker plot that made even less sense. In fact, Mirrormask's story can actually be very poignant at times with it's parallel narrative of a girl's struggle with her mother. <br /> <br />Mirrormask is one of those movies I could watch every other day and not get sick of. I know because that's pretty much what I do. Kinda sad. But I just LOVE this movie like no other. And that's another good point to be said about it. It really has a certain watchability that doesn't fade each time you see it. Not sure that made sense. Let me put it this way. You can watch it many times without getting sick of it. This is largely because the movie is so visually compelling rather than story-driven. Watching Mirrormask is like listening to your favorite music. You don't get sick of it. Mirrormask really is an experience. Watching it really is more like listening to great music than watching a movie. <br /> <br />All this said, Mirrormask has become my favorite movie to watch. Again and again and again. If you like this genre of movies at all, you will LOVE this movie. I would also recommend Gulliver's Travels (the one with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen), Labyrinth (Jenn. Connelly and David Bowie), and The Dark Crystal (but less so). Anyway, you should really give Mirrormask a chance. You will really be pleasantly surprised.
B00005JLO2|2.0|Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|Like everyone else, I love Norah Jones' voice - but the lyrics on this album are just dumb.  Lesson for those musicians out there - it's a bad idea to let your boyfriend produce your record.  Skip this one - buy her earlier stuff.

1582701709|2.0|I liked the book better than the movie.  The movie was like an informercial and one is waiting for the narrator to announce, \\"And for just $49.95, you can have your own....\\"  The book does give some good quotes, but the concept that one draws to oneself what one thinks about most is not a new concept, certainly not a secret, as is obvious from all the other wise people quoted in this one.  I do give respect to the author who was smart enough to take old news and package it smartly into a book called the secret that looks like something out of a centuries old vault and we all buy it.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|THE DEPARTED is Scorsese at his most professional and entertaining but it feels like he could have directed it in his sleep, by which I mean all the elements of the script and charactes are clever, and the involvement of the government on a high level a new twist, but he's done it all before, and better in GOODFELLAS and the underrated CASINO.

0380789035|5.0|American Gods is some kind of good book. Gaiman has Shadow as very much a spectator along for a cross-country ride with Mr. Wednesday, touring some of the scenic rural routes of America, almost clinically describing some of the marvalous things (and people) he sees along the way.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it; but Shadow has just lost his wife under some ugly circumstances, and it seems to me like he is numb to everything for much of the story and this shows in his almost total lack of response to a lot of crazy things.  Not getting into too many details, the story DOES have a solid plot (as I see some reviews don't agree), with many clues along the way that come back to haunt Shadow (and readers) as the story comes full circle by the end with a wide open ending that leaves you wanting more.  Gaiman is great, buy this book!

0770430074|4.0|\\"This book was born when I was hungry.\\" And so the yarn is spun, reflecting one of the most fundamental tenets of the human condition; that necessity is the mother of invention. Extreme tragedies and losses often provide the requisite platform for the human spirit to take off and soar. Mozart became a musical genius in the face of deafness, while Stephen Hawking a mathematical one in the face of cerebral palsy. \\"Life of Pi\\", a Booker Prize winner written by Yann Martel, proves that being stranded at sea for seven months can make a survival expert out of a meek vegetarian boy. Written in first person, the book recounts the actual events encountered by the main character's real life counterpart, Piscine Molitor Patel, whom now resides in Canada.      Pi Patel has had a deliciously eclectic childhood.  A sixteen year old son of a zoo-owner, Pi's education is not confined to the usual avenues of home and school, but to the perimeters of the zoo itself. His surroundings have taught him much regarding the behavior of animals. For one, there is the persistent misconception that zoos are \\"prisons\\" for the \\"enslaved\\" animals. On the contrary, he (and we) comes to the gradual realization that these enclosures actually serve as a fully furnished \\"unit of living\\" (replete with food and shelter), hence eliminating the creatures' physiological need for \\"wide open spaces\\", a notion they lack awareness for. Pi also comes to understand, from the zookeepers, the concept of the \\"Alpha Male\\" (a form of submission that group-oriented animals display towards a dominant male who can provide for their needs).     Despite having marginally aetheistic parents, being raised amidst such diversity of life in its various forms has opened him up to the beauty of God, a divine force he strives to comprehend by being Hindu, Christian and Muslim all at the same time. Earlier in the book, his brother, Ravi, teases him, \\"Why don't you become a Jew? At the rate you're going, if you go to temple on Thursday, mosque on Friday, synagogue on Saturday and church on Sunday, you only need to convert to three more religions to be on holiday for the rest of your life!\\" In an overall sense, we see a young boy with a soul as old as the universe. We see a boy we can love; a boy we'd like to welcome into our homes because we know our lives will be enriched by him.     Pi's faith is soon put to a gruesome test. Leaving for Canada, the Patels shut down the Pondicherry Zoo, auction off most of its animals, and abscond from an India under the new leadership of Indira Gandhi.  They depart on the Japanese cargo ship, the Tsim Tsim, (with some of their precious fauna aboard) bound for a new life in the West.  Inexplicably, the ship capsizes and Pi finds himself as the only survivor on a lifeboat; the only human survivor, that is. A Zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a tiger have also managed to make their escape from the doomed vessel onto the forlorn boat.  A few days into the tragedy, the \\"ecosystem\\" on the lifeboat has simply dilapidated, for only two creatures remain; the tiger, named Richard Parker from a past documentation mix-up, and Pi himself. As desperation sparks his creative drive, Pi conjures ways to capture sea creatures in order to sustain himself (despite his vegetarianism) and the ravenous Richard Parker in order to avoid being dinner himself. He uses every iota of animal knowledge (especially the \\"Alpha Male\\" theory of behavior) as a life-line with the insatiable Bengal Tiger. The urgency with which Pi must make his life-or-death choices propels him, albeit reluctantly, on a journey to manhood.     We also bear witness to his internal conflicts, as his religious convictions are brought to the forefront. The boy's unyielding mental struggles are colored by his grudging acceptance of savagery and ruthless domination as a means of survival. In a sense, we don't see a character losing his faith in god as much as a character trying to bridge the gap between his beliefs and his deeds. We see a broken paradigm, but not a broken spirit. In doing so, we also witness a faith in God that is absolute: a faith that does not hinge on specific rites, rituals and practices (such as his own vegetarianism). Pi's struggles are reminiscent of two biblical characters. Like Noah, who fearlessly braced cataclysmic floods armed only with the ambiguity of God's instructions, Pi must have courage in his convictions through the duration of his ordeals, no matter how severe. Similarly, Like Job, who sustained God's merciless whims, Pi's spiritual fortitude is put on the edge of a knife blade. These correlations may indeed be intentional, with the solitary lifeboat serving as an arena for the symbolic dialog between man and god.     A series of interlocked flashbacks, the book starts off well; The setting, India in the 1960s, is beautifully described, the events are profoundly symbolic and the insights simply intelligent. We can't help but laugh when Martel mocks our most common dogmas. Yet, we too, are deeply saddened when he exposes certain piercing truths, like prying open an old wound.  This withstanding, soon after the incident of the shipwreck, the prose descends, like the lifeboat, into an ocean of uncertainty, pandemonium and sometimes flat out boredom. Although we become aware of the intricate machinations in the psychological games the boy engages with the tiger, we also see a discrepancy in the writing style. From a writing disposition that is randomly rich in anachronistic anecdotes and delightful details, we are suddenly subjected to a rhetoric that is spartan and utilitarian. The story's focus on the boy's survival on the lifeboat with the tiger is razor sharp, leaving no room for much else. One can justify such radical change on the grounds of literary affect; that it serves to attune our attention to the different nuances in the game of survival that commences after the Tsim Tsim's demise. Such a radical transition, however, has also somewhat compromised the overall potential of the book. There is, none-the-less, a saving grace near the end: A spectacular turn of events that sheds a dramatic new light on everything we have read up to that point. In turn, Martel dares us to place our faith in the boy regardless of our doubt.     On the whole, this modern fable exudes an aura of understated grandeur. Underneath the quiet deliberations of a frail boy and the gentle undulations of the waters, an epic war is being waged; one whose outcome can result in finding God or finding a spiritual vacuum. However, Pi remains, and admirably so, resolute in his spiritual beliefs throughout the excruciating experience. When Pi loses hope time and time again, only to regain it back moments later in a fit of optimism, we feel a vicarious sense of joy at the triumph of the human spirit. Writing discrepancies aside, the book is an invaluable source of inspiration, a sentiment that is given even more credence by virtue of being a true story. Martel is not shy in reminding as at the end, that \\"very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr Patel, and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger.\\"
B000M4RG42|4.0|I thought this movie was well-acted, and I learned many facts about the flag placing on Iwo Jima.  I hadn't previously been aware of how Native American Indians were treated in the armed forces, nor was I aware of the feelings of the brave men who fought in the battle, and were then used to promote the purchase of war bonds. <br /> <br />My big complaint is that the flashbacks were confusing to me, and my family, and we will watch the movie again to try to get a better understanding of who was who.
B00009V7OL|5.0|The unique nature of the setting alone eludes normal reviews for film making, accompanied by great acting and the use of real cutting edge technology that exists (albeit not as functional as in the movie) make it a must see.

B000M5AJQ8|5.0|A great \\"cat and mouse\\" thriller between DiCaprio (Billy) and Damon (Colin).  DiCaprio and Damon are both grads of the Massachusetts State Police.  However, DiCaprio goes undercover to infiltrate the ranks of the crime organization, an \\"Irish Mafia\\" type group run by Jack Nicholson's character, Frank Costello. Nicholson's character had Colin under his wing since childhood doing odd jobs. Colin becomes Frank's mole in the State Police and Billy is the mole for the Police.  Each knows there is a mole in the organizations but does not know who the mole is. Colin's self-destructive nature causes him to lose, among many things,  confidence from Frank and his pregnant girlfriend.  If there was an Oscar for the Best Ensemble Cast, this film would deserve it.  Mark Wahlberg gets final revenge and Martin Sheen is falsely targeted. Leo DiCaprio does not get the girl but does capture her heart. Jack Nicholson gets to control the \\"puppet strings\\" of those working with him.

B00008RH3L|5.0|Tom Reagan either sees the whole board like nobody else can, or he is an idiot of the first order.  Either seems equally possible to me, as he engages in every double-cross known to man, for reasons which are never made entirely clear.  Along the way, he is beaten up seemingly by nearly every inhabitant of the unnamed city's criminal underworld, but seems to accept his lot with resignation.<br /><br />This movie had so many twists and turns that it required two consecutive viewings to insure that I had it right.  One could watch it a million times and still never know exactly what Tom Reagan's motives are.  The Coens certainly have no problem leaving the ultimate outcome somewhat unresolved, which always entertains me.  Neat, tidy endings are rarely a reflection of real life.<br /><br />One will find great performances throughout, particularly those of Albert Finney & Gabriel Byrne.  The typically twisted Coen humor is on abundant display in the snappy dialogue, sometimes so snappy that the viewer can hardly follow along (Steve Buscemi speaks at such a blistering pace that I had put on the subtitles to make sense of it all).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, you either love the Coens or hate them.  The surreal, ambivalent qualities which delight some will drives other crazy.  I have found both to be true...by the time \\"Barton Fink\\" was over, I had no idea what I was even watching anymore, and wondered what the ballyhoo was all about.  However, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a good example of all the best Coenesque qualities falling nicely into place, resulting in a movie which is hugely entertaining without being nearly as frustrating as some others.

0790734850|5.0|Devotees of noir & period pieces probably will not be as pleased with this as will the rest of this, but Curtis Hanson apparently decided that putting together a coherent & well-crafted film was more important than remaining faithful to one particular genre or another.  Aside from specific historical references (Bloody Christmas, for example), it is quite easy to forget that this is set in 1950's Los Angeles.  One could regard this as a shortcoming (it is, nominally at least, supposed to be a period thriller) or as an asset (a really well-told story will trump all other details), depending on one's perspective.<br /><br />In any case, Hanson and a top-notch cast works with a pretty complex plot and manages to keep all of the balls in the air.  I always enjoy a movie where the audience figures out most of the twists before the characters do, because then we get to enjoy watching the unfolding of consequences of decisions made or avoided.  Spacey, Crowe & Pearce manage to give us wonderfully ambivalent & complex characters, all of whom are far from being beyond reproach and continue to have some dubious motives right up to the film's conclusion.  Personally, I always like a film that deliberately avoids a tidy ending and leaves the viewer knowing that, after the credits finish rolling, the other shoe will eventually have to drop.<br /><br />I agree with others that Kim Basinger's breathy whispery performances is simply annoying & that she is woefully miscast in this role.  Why she got an Oscar for this is almost as big a mystery as any portayed in this film.  However, it is not a glaring flaw and is obscured by the stellar performances of the rest of the cast.  Top notch from start to finish!

And the icing on the cake... Elizabeth Gilbert is an excellent writer with a great sense of humor!

1582701709|2.0|There is nothing new in this book. Yes, the mind has an incredible power and our own spirutal vibration has the most influence on ourselves and a similar, but weaker one on our environment.

0618680004|4.0|.. but faith should be personal and private. As soon as you turn around and try to force other people to believe like you by means of guilt, peer pressure or worse then you are wrong. When my children asked me if there is a God and what happens after death, I gave them an HONEST answer: 'I don't know.'<br /><br />This is an excellent book on a scientific perspective on God. It does not intend to elaborate on Theology, as Theology mostly reiterates farfetched interpretations of ancient scripture. Dawkins however wasted his time trying to disproof God. No one can. People, who have not killed their emotions by trying to be too rational and reasonable, feel a spiritual power to be present. Science most probably never will be able to explain what it is. Dawkins is right that most of what is attributed to God by the great religions is nonsense, but that can not explain away all the mysteries we feel. There is a kind of universal soul to this universe and those with the gift can feel it.<br /><br />This world will only start to be a better place if we finally turn to each other with a smile and say: 'We don't know.' Reading Dawkins can maybe help us to do so, but so can the Bible. Claiming that he is wrong, is as wrong as claiming that he is right. Either way you prolong the conflict!

0066620996|4.0|This is a pretty good book if you're looking to determine directions that individuals can take in a company or organization to make it better.  As in many books of these types, there is a style that gets a little repetitive.  This style is a high-energy \\"you-can-do-it\\" style that sometimes gets old, but if you read the book for the messages imparted, then you will learn a lot.

As a package, if you don't already own the movie, it's highly recommendable, and if you do, it may not be a bad idea to sell your used movie and get your hands on this great collector's item.

0060589280|3.0|Coelho is always readable and always relevant.  The richness of his prose and the honesty of his convictions makes this work worthwhile.  But eleven minutes suffers from the patronizing stance of an author appearing in woman's garb and pretending to speak for her.In my own modest peregrinations with the physical woman, I have never encountered such moral justifications and/or sinless sexual and guiltless embraces that Coelho expounds through this woman character. Not one. I must say, the protagonist in this novel appears more like a drag queen than a Brazilian philosophic wench.    yes i will yes i will yes.  Mollie Bloom, Coelho is not.  Nor, quite honestly, should he pretend to know women, their anatomy, or even the failings of men as lovers.  While it is no doubt true that most men do not know woman's anatomy, it is equally true that most women have no idea how to satisfy a man.  both male and female deserve each other, in my opinion. Eleven minutes? I am over sixty years old. I think sex lasts a lot longer than that. But what do I know? And who can remember, anyway?   But at the very least, I have learned from the author the revelation(and the reverie) of the G-Spot and am so happy to have finally found where it islocated, exactly.(My girlfriend is now jumping up and down with joy!)

They look forced and do not consistently convey the emotion that the author attributes to them.<br /><br />I found myself \\"deflated\\" rather than inspired to use his techniques because of the example drawings (although this may not bother you as I tend to be a \\"hothouse plant\\" when it comes to quality and execution of ideas).<br /><br />Summing up:  On the Pro side: A fine reference to add to your library for the biological anatomy of the head, both in proportion and a broken down \\"geometrical\\" approach of it's basic construction - On the Con side: a terribly uninspiring look at those references put to use in the authors overworked, unrealistic and extremely disappointing drawings.
B000M341QO|1.0|Martin Scorsese has made some greta movies.<br /><br />This is not one of them. It is a joke, that the Academy awarded him the Oscar for this, one of his worst movies ever.<br /><br />Why don't I like this movie?<br /><br />It's easier to say what I like about it:<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />Okay. First of all, it fails the \\"1st 15 minutes\\" test. That is, if a movie does not grab you, draw you in and make you want to watch the rest of it within the first 15 min., it's a bad movie. I wanted to take it out of the dvd player after 15 min., but because of all the rave reviews I kept it in.<br /><br />30 minutes into it, I still wanted to take it out. I kept it in because this movie won Oscars.<br /><br />50 minutes in, with STILL nothing happening, just moving as slowly as a snail, nothing but talk, talk, talk, a few gratuitous violent scenes thrown in just to try to keep the audience interested, I took this p.o.s. out of my dvd player never to return to it again.<br /><br />This movie sucks. There is something wrong when people are raving about a movie like this. Are people so influenced by critics that critics can convince the Emperor he is wearing clothes when actually he is naked?<br /><br />But, yeah, this movie should have won an award alright:<br /><br />The Most Over-rated, Most Disappointing Movie of the Year.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Simple- this is the fastest way to make your flash photos look DRAMATICALLY better.  Off camera flash is the way to go- just try it and see.   <br /> <br />For photos of my child up close, I wouldn't do it any other way now. <br /> <br />
B00005JNX0|5.0|The animation is great. The characters are fantastic. Lots of humor for the whole family. My kids really got into the story. I can't get enough of the \\"Move it\\" song during the movie. Definitely a good movie and enjoy watching again.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|I haven't watched a love story like this in so long.  It was great.  I would recommend this to any true romantic at heart.
159562015X|2.0|Since Now Discover Your Strengths was very interesting and helpful, I've been very excited to read 2.0.      I was expecting 2.0 to be a new layer of the strength finder \\"onion\\" (aka more insight, more inforamtion, deeper understanding), but instead it is just the same onion is a slightly different format.      The ability to create a \\"customized version of your top five theme report\\" is really a print out of the same check lists found in the book.  You can \\"customize\\" the check list by only including the predetermined action items that you want in the report.      The action items are similar, to the ones found in Now Discover Your Strenghts, so if you photo copied your Now Discover action items and crossed off the ones you don't like - Presto!  Instant \\"customized version of your top five theme report.\\"    My advice, if you've read Now Discover, you are covered.  If you haven't, 2.0 is full of the same great information.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|After reading a number of reviews on her new CD, I was interested in hearing it and evaluating her new direction.  Happy to say, I was very pleased with the results!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I thought that this was an awesome movie in the theater-released form and the extended version is even better.  It adds a couple of story lines and several minor \\"detail\\" scenes that were left out of the shorter version.  This version is a bit more graphic and bloody - the first major fight scene in the snow is an example - but also seems to have more depth of character, especially for Balian, the king, and his sister.  In short, I think that this movie is enough of an *improvement* over the first release to rate the purchase price.  I am very happy that I added it to my collection.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This CD is very dark.  It has a very creepy feeling to it since it is unfinished and is very raw in how it was processed.  ..that makes this JC cd a very unique one.<br /><br />Just read what everyone else said about this album.  Probably some of JC's most emotional work to date.  It's very somber to listen to, but this is true music. From the heart and not massed produced/edited.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore has given our planet a wake-up call that cannot be ignored. Each and every citizen of the world must start taking action today, tomorrow will be too late.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|First off I want to say I loved the CGI graphics and the imagery.  Some of it was annoying..like the fake film grain, but the rest was beautifully done.<br /><br />Now, the story was so predictable.  I knew from the very beginning what was going to happen.  The story wrapped up terribley and the movie just seemed to drag on (reminds me a lot of the movie AI).<br /><br />Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors.  Jessica Beal is a cutie...but this movie was a sour grape in my opinion.<br /><br />2 stars for the dry story...4 for the video work.
630522577X|5.0|They have saved a musical masterpiece--it is fantastic.  I love it!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Not much I can add to previous reviews of this masterwork.  It could have been made last year, as crackling as the dialogue is, as inventive the camera work. <br /> <br />If you could create one work of art this powerful and compelling in your lifetime, consider yourself complete.  I also highly recommend the other DVD \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" for an overview of the Welles/Hearst situation. <br /> <br />A must own set for any serious collector, and even the casual movie fan.
B0007939NO|5.0|The restoration is excellent; they have saved a classic musical.  I loved it!
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|i enjoy richard geere and jennifer lopez alot and loved their dancing in this movie
B00003CX9E|1.0|I completely agree with the comments about what is all the hype about? with the film \\"Citizen Kane\\".  It is not even a good film much less the greatest film ever made.  There seems to be a cult following for this film or around Orson Welles.  It never ceases to amaze me when some film \\"critic\\" raves about Citizen Kane.
B0000640SA|4.0|This is one of the most twisted, yet edge of your seat movies I've ever seen. Chistopher Nolan is now one of my favorite directors of all time after watching this SPELLBINDING flick! It truely is a masterpiece for our generation of TWIST AND TURN movies.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|The quality of this restoration and digital remastering is excellent--it has saved an absolute classic film.  I am thrilled with it!
B0000TG9E2|4.0|I'm a big Alice in Wonderland fan and while I do love Disney's take on the book it doesn't match up to the book almost at all (that's why I only gave 4 stars). Disney's leaves out things from the actual AIW and puts in certain elements from Throught the Looking Glass as well as things that they made up.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is the first movie I remember seeing as a child.  I was probably about 7 years old at the time.  I've never forgotten it, and now, after 59 years, I'm viewing it again.  It's just as wonderful as it was when I saw it the first time, although there are a couple of \\"bits\\" that I don't remember from my first viewing.  It keeps me company during my treadmill walks.  It does a wonderful job of helping me to pass the time.  It's a beautiful combination of art and classical music.
B000068TPN|5.0|You want a review of this. I bought it for my brother in law. I don't need to review it. I spent two years there. Anyone that's all for war and wants to see the glory of battle, here it is, or as close as you can get from the comfort of your home. Don't review this. Honor those who were there. Feel in your soul all they felt. And if that doesn't do it then go in yourself before you send your children. <br /> <br />Don't look at Mel Gibson. See the real Lt. Col. Moore, don't see Sam Elliott but Sgt. Plummley and if you want to see that young photographer all you have to do is read his words in his weekly syndicated column. He shows a great deal of wisdom in all he says. His name is Joseph Galloway. <br /> <br />Don't review this movie...Honor the men who were there: those who came home and those who didn't.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|What a troupe of talented women!  This music touchs my heart.  The Slane Castle setting provokes a sense of the mystic, and the audience is obviously enthralled with the performances.  Mairead, the fiddler, is electrifying.  Orla's harp performance is wonderful, as is her voice.  Chloe's voice is so beautiful I have a strong emotional response that I don't usually have.  The other 3 women are also blessed with beautiful voices.  This makes my 45 minute trip on the treadmill worth the effort!  Thank you, Celtic Women!
B00005MP58|3.0|I liked this version very much. For purists it is the closest version to the book the acting is excellent. Colin Firth is amazing and Miss Ehle Is so beautiful, she looks like a Dresden Doll.... though she smiles a little too much which made her look a little too coy for my taste. What bothered me most however is that parts of the movie look very faded...  I have to say I like  the spirit and vibrancy of the Kiera Knightly version much better. Perhaps it is because that is the first adaptaion I viewed. I own both however both are very much worth seeing, go well together hand in hand. I give this movie a thumbs up
1569242739|5.0|THis book has completely dispelled the belief that eggs are necessary for baking.  I have made several recipes so far and they have all turned out excellent.  This book has endless possiblities for making amazing cupcakes and the pictures are very appealing.  The writing is fun, upbeat and easy to understand.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am happy with this transaction, both in the expeditious manner in which it was sent, and the quality of the DVDs.  What else can I say?  Good work.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Very entertaining.A must buy for ST. Patrick's Day. A great way to spend a relaxing evening.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|OK! It's Ferris Buellers Day Off. Even tho' I'm 64 years old, I, like millions of others.......LOVE this movie. What can I say? It's right up there with Caddyshack and Clerks! Color me a case of arrested developement, but these characters are fresh, funny and I watch them at least once a week!
1400032717|4.0|Wierd doesn't mean I didn't like it, though. I found it fascinating to get a glimpse into the head of a kid with autism. I think I identified with some of the things he felt and thought.
0896760278|4.0|...I just totally felt  in love with this book as a student a couple of years ago and what a good surprise to find it back, now,  on Amazon....Amazing references on the Victorian main silhouette, good selection of patterns and relevant information on the inside construction of the styles proposed. A lot of visual, sketch are clear and the ideas suggested are really interesting. I am a pattern maker myself so I never used the patterns as is from this book, but pick up a lot of information  and  integrate it in my projects... You probably need at least a bit of experiences as a seamstress or pattern making to fully appreciate and understand it. I personally recommend it. Have fun!
0307383415|5.0|In order to understand the whole man it's necessary to see what has influenced his life to make him the man that he is today.   Barack Obama is more attuned to all the needs of all peoples because of his extensive background. It is unlikely that anyone else has had the experiences that he has had so far in his lifetime. He truly is presidential material!
1401917186|4.0|I'd imagine anyone drawn to this title would be seeking information about the game of life and how it's played.  I've been doing that for years and I found this little book was packed with helpful tidbits that shed light on areas of darkness for me.  It offers personal accounts of people who have gotten in touch with other aspects of themselves and how this helped put their earthly existence into perspective.
0743454537|5.0|Wow, what an amazing novel.  I absolutely loved it and plan to read many more Jodi Picoult books in the future.  Warning:  you will need several boxes of Kleenex.  Especially at the end...
B000KRNCYY|5.0|No, I'm not talking about hallucinogenics, I'm talking about the ethereal place you enter when you listen to this CD.  The Celtic folk have long been known for their \\"fey\\" natures and that quality comes through these lovely young women and their beautiful voices.  Their rendition of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" is awesome.  \\"The Blessing\\" is the best love song I have ever heard.  Whenever I want a trip to an enchanted forest I listen to this CD.
B0002IU988|5.0|I loved this album right from the start.  I was sorry to see Creed dissolve, but I love the sound of this band.  Myles Kennedy, the lead singer, has such a fantastic vocal range, and Mark Tremonti, the lead guitarist, really let's it fly here.  His playing is very tight and aggressive; great stuff.  My only complaint about this band is what the hell is taking so long to get that second album out?  Come on, guys.  It's been three years; let's get a move-on here.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Only reason I didn't give this item 5 Stars is because I know there are cheaper options out there.  Granted, they may not have the aesthetics of the Ergotron products but if I wasn't spending gift certificate money I would have chosen a cheaper option.  But even $80 beats the heck out of the $149 that most office supply chains are asking - so maybe 4.5 stars. <br />And the movement, adjustment and build quality are all top notch and shipping was very timely as usual.
0425180638|5.0|One of Patricia Cornwell's best.  Loved the whole book.  Could not put it down.
0679722610|5.0|The same operator that apears in The Continental Op, but this novel is more elaborated. A must. Hammet at his best.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Awesome. I grew very tired of this album and then the cd after multiple listening sessions. This multi-channel mix is outstanding and brings this music back to life. The separation of the channels is incredible. Instruments pop from various speakers at different times on the different songs. Many times you feel like you are sitting on stage in the middle of the band. Knoppler never sounded better. If you have a 5.1 set up with dvd-a or sacd player capability this is a must have for your collection.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|We thought the tape was in excellent condition and the delivery service was very efficient.
B000803PKY|4.0|A classic album re-mixed in to multi-channel sound. I find the mix subtle but suitable for the music of this disc. The overall sound depth and clarity is a definite step up from the regular CD.
0618680004|4.0|I am very pleased to learn that this important subject is being dealt with in a forthright and well-reasoned manner. Because of my own lack of depth in the philosophical background (and related vocabulary) of some of the areas, I found the work somewhat more challenging to apprehend than necessary in places, but this in no way detracts from the validity of Prof. Dawkins' arguments and conclusions. The references included are also very valuable resources.
B000065V3H|5.0|This movie is an older movie but still has a lot of charm. It is great to see Seth Green and Patrick Dempsey when they were kids. It has a lot of laughs and sincere moments in it. a must see!
B00009XITQ|5.0|This is a good family movie.  Great story about a girl and her dad.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it :)
B00007GZQZ|5.0|arrived on time and was in excellant condition, the price was reasonable. The shipping was a little high for a DVD.
B0000696I0|5.0|If you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. More detail on how they became TMNT. Funny,action,all around fun to watch
B000002LND|5.0|This is a five star album and the only Madonna album or collection of hits you need. The album is all that and a bag of chips. In fact the 17 hits on this album show why Madonna is the queen of pop music and why she has been such a big star since the 80's. I do not think Madonna can top or produce better dance/pop music than she did in the 80's and early 90's, so she will always be remembered for these hits in my opinion. This album never gets old and stands its time. The music on this album is completely ageless and feel good music.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Highly recommend.  Huge difference in pictures.   I was quite amazed and cannot live without it anymore.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I adore this CD! I think that Jesse Cook sounds much better live than in the studio. You can feel the soul of his work live! I hope he produces more live works like this one.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|A lovely disk, as most of us have come to expect from Ms McKennitt, but one which pushes few musical boundaries. She may have been a pioneer in the genre, some fine years ago, but I would have enjoyed this disk a bit more had it not sounded so much like earlier offerings. It is still beautifully done and highly evocative, but more could have been made to happen here.
6305882592|5.0|Very eccentric and strange. I love this movie. Ruth Gordon is at her best in this movie. I love Bud Cort also. They did a wonderful job, and I watch this a few times a year for the comedy and Cat Steven's music. Ruth was such a great actress.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It feels like a scientific documentary, with a ton of solid facts and yet, most of it is delivered in a style reminiscent of good university professors. At times, it felt a bit too much like a political stab at the current Bush administration but hey, that's pretty forgiveable under the circumstances. How many of us who have seen this thing will in fact react to its message, however?..  Here is Switzerland, sales of big 4x4s are still on the rise, and everyone in the papers still debates over increasing the highway speed limit to 150 or 160...
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This compilation of familiar Beatles songs is brilliantly edited to create more than just a \\"trip down memory lane\\".  It's a fresh take on incredibly creative music that evokes new passions.<br /><br />Great stuff!  Recommend it for music lovers and Beatles lovers alike.
0060899190|2.0|I bought this book for a friend and I thought it was going to be a more 'organized book' with letters but its just random notes, chicken scratch postcards and drawings that are weird. I'm sure she's going to keep this one as a \\"bathroom reader\\".
B000002U9Y|4.0|My first delve into pre-Darkside Floyd.  Good set of tunes to get blown away to, i.e., let your mind relax.  I told my kids that you don't need drugs to get high; just listen to this.  Be careful playing CD while driving.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an excellent documentary.  And for you people that say Al Gore couldn't make this any good, you are dead wrong.  All the information that he gave was an eye opener.  I won't go much into any of the information he gave due you need to hear and see this for your own self.  This is a must see.
B000007MVM|5.0|The Madcap Laughs defies categorization. Once you hear it, you may never want to listen to anything else...except perhaps for as much Syd as your psyche can absorb. Syd Barrett's music is life altering...a prism of genius. Do yourself a favor. Listen while the madcap laughs.<br /><br />Syd...you are missed.
0439813786|5.0|At first, he was a little daunted with the size of the book, but once he got started, he was hooked.  Because many of the pages are drawings - and amazing ones at that - it was a very speedy read.  He loved the book so much that he wouldn't let me mail it to a friend.  \\"Buy them one 'cause they'll want to keep it too!\\"
B00005BKZJ|5.0|It's my favourite film, so I know what I was buying when I ordered it. It's about Love, welfare, sharing, desert, wonderful images, space, loneliness, problem of imigration, problems between men and women, passion, Art.<br /><br />All is Art in this film, every image could be a painting. The lights and colors are amazing.<br /><br />If you like the desert and if you love USA as I do, this film is a \\"must\\" for you.<br /><br />Yael
B000055Y0X|5.0|Naturally from an acting point of view Peter Sellers dominates this film. Playing three roles: The RAF Captain, US President Muffley and Dr Stranglove. Each is a comedic performance of brilliance. The RAF Captain is the voice of sanity to Sterling Haydens's mad US General. Its more than just a funny performance, Sellers acting portrays a desperation in his dealings with Gen Jack D Ripper. Having said that Sellers dominates, don't think this is one-man show. Both Sterling Hayden and George C Scott give stand-out performances.<br /><br />The film is full of great visual gags and some wonderful one-liners. \\"No fighting in the war room\\" being a favourite of mine.<br /><br />The film satarises the cold war paranoia of the 60's and was made soon after the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />Of course we mustn't forget the mastermind behind the film - Stanley Kubrick. He directed and co-wrote the film. In some of the brief attack scenes on the airbase you can see how he would later shoot Full Metal Jacket. It is an endlessly watchable film that any sane person will want to own!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I couldnt have enjoyed this series any more than I did, its right up my alley.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone made many great films, but this is the greatest of them all.<br />Firstly apart from the film itself:<br />The picture quality is marvellous, for a film that is 37 years old, it looks brand new. The extras are very good - especially the commentry by Christopher Frayling (who has written an excellent biography of Sergio Leone) which is most informative. I had seen the film many times over the years before I bought the DVD but never spotted a moment in the long pre-credit sequence when Jack Elam pulls the wires from the telegraph machine. In the commentary Frayling points out that its not just the noise from the machine that stops when the wires are pulled ALL noise stops - its quite surreal once you realise.<br /><br />Anyway the film itself is magnificent. This is a 2 hour 40 minute film and barely a second is wasted. Unlike a lot of modern films it is not filled with endless explosions and gun fights. This is a film that keeps you engrossed through character development and brilliant cinemaphotography. You have to symapthise with Claudia Cardinale, you really want to hate Henry Fonda (but its a struggle) and you want to be Charles Bronson (in what may have originally been a role written with Clint Eastwood in mind). I am not a fan of Bronson but this is a great performance.<br /><br />Each of the four main characters has a distinctive musical theme supplied by Ennio Morricone, and it is claimed that the actors based their movements on these themes. Leone originally planned to have the Good the Bad and the Ugly (Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach) waiting at the Station for Charles Bronson at the start of the film but sadly this was never possible. However Jack Elam, Woody Strode and the 3rd actor add something because they are not so well known. Although they had variously appeared in a number of major films (such as High Noon).<br /><br />The film references a multitude of previous westerns. One of the most obvious being The Searchers - Leone uses the framed doorway..<br /><br />You are unlikely to guess the ending to this film and will probably be as surprised as Frank is. Go and buy this film now!unlikely to guess the ending to this film and will probably be as surprised as Frank is. Go and buy this film now!
B00000C3G6|5.0|Nash and Crosby have created a masterpiece.  I purchased the album back in '72 when it was first released and fell in love with each and every song.  Harmonies are tight, and the musicians create a viable backdrop for the voices of Nash and Crosby.  I was thrilled to finally be able to get this on CD, as the album had seen better days, the result of MANY spinnings on the turntable.  These songs, this music and the performances rank with the best CSN or CSNY offerings.  One of my absolute favorite albums of ALL TIME!  If you like CSN(Y), you should truly enjoy this CD. <br />
B000B8QG0O|4.0|Disney didn't know my membership number from that Xbox 360 deal, so I went a different route and ordered it from Amazon. It is a really good movie that one can watch in loopedframeset, and brings Pixar to great movements of novelty with toys. On DVD this movie goes on many adventures and covers many different themes. The digital voices are taken from famous celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and a host of others. <br />I really enjoyed the movie and am thankful to have bought it.
B00003CXDD|4.0|We really like this movie.  It has a lot of action, but I feel that it still is good for children.  My kids liked it when they were young and my husband and I still like it.  It's very good.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Wow this is one crazy movie. LOL <br />Christian Bale is one nutty dude in this movie. <br />The world of Yuppies. One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be. <br />Who has better looking, more expensive business cards for one example. <br />It's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world. One is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill. <br />He kills one acquaintance of his who he really doesn't know, and takes him for another person. Of course Jared Leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are, and gets killed in this movie to, and he is actually the first murder victim. <br />His place is also where Christian's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them.  <br />This movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers. It's very well done, and Bale gives a very compelling performance. <br />I call it Yuppieville. <br />5* rating, it has all the elements of a great thriller.
0753453800|4.0|Jim is just a boy, that works at the Admiral Benbox Inn, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always alert and watching for stangers arriving at the inn.  And he has the right to be nervous, because he possesses a map drawn by Capitan Flint, the most feared pirate to ever roam the high seas.<br /><br />Well, Flint died, but there's plenty of men who served with Capitan Flint still alive who feel they deserve a fair share of the treasure.  The map, though, ends up with Jim Hawkins - (it's a near thing, read the book to find out how that happens).  Jim confides in the local doctor and squire, who work together to acquire a ship, a crew, and provisions to sail for Treasure Island.  There is a weak link though, because although Squire Trelawney is well-intentioned, he has a big mouth.  By the time the Hispaniola is ready for sea, she is boarded by the old murderous mob who sailed with Flint!<br /><br />There's a scene in the book where Jim, hiding in a barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned.  The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to take over the ship and make this journey their own, taking all the treasure for themselves.  There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim, aboard the ship.<br /><br />And now....You will have to read the book for yourself to see what happens next.  This is a fantastic story of double-crossing and deceit, bravery and cowardice.  I don't know how things would have turned out if Jim hadn't been involved.  For it is he who finds Ben Gunn, marooned on the island, half-mad with isolation.  And it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.<br /><br />And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No?  Well, don't expect me to tell you, you will have to read this amazing pirate tale for yourself.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I really can't stop see this movie, it is just perfect... I can't wait the sequal :D
1401917186|1.0|I was dissapointed in this book because when I got it, I saw that it was really just pretty much the same as the first Earth Angels book. (it is really the same book with just one chapter on what she already talked about in the first book so it is basically THE SAME BOOK) I would not buy it again because first of all, I felt really deceived and secondly as I already said it is the SAME BOOK! AS EARTH ANGELS ONLY WITH A DIFFERENT BOOK COVER!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore is now my hero... Everyone must listen him, the World Will be Destroyed by the Human Beings, 5 stars.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|If your a girl or if your gay, the hot models (who are trying to act) will pretty much be the only thing keeping focused on the movie. I'm sorry but the boys CANNOT act. I was really looking forward to a movie like this. Male witches, FINALLY. However, the storyline needed a lot of help, over use of one line (\\"The power is so seductive\\"), the absence of any real magic(special effects that would make you go \\"ohh ahhh\\"), and no real good fight scene(the wire works just sucked). They could of at least given the blond chick some dancing lessons. Did I mention, the un-need moaning of the dude during the very long kissing scene. Yeah, do not waste your money. If you really must see it, have a friend rent it and then borrow it. Like I said in the first sentence, this movie is only good for the male eye candy.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot is one of those bands you either love or hate. I'm one of those people that like all those other bands such as morbid andgel, dying fetus, lamb of god, etc. But just cuz slipknot are more popular and to say they suck is way off. Slipknot has great talent for being very publicly known Metal band. their first album came out when I was in middle school, and i look at them as my gateway band to metal. I never even really listened to metal before I heard them on the radio and for that I am greatful :)  Now to get to the actual CD, it is a great album even to this day. They definitely did something different from their other albums while keeping it as heavy as they always did. Songs like \\"the nameless\\" and \\"three nil\\" will make you remember why you liked slipknot in the first place. if you are going to buy this album I'd say not to depend on the reviews because chances are the bad ones come from big time haters, and the good ones are from die-hard fans. Personally as a fan of metal in general, I'd say get it.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|One of the best new sitcoms in recent years... Up until i got the DVD i had no idea Bob Saget was the narrator... Neil Patrick Harris is very funny as Barney (who names thier kid that these days?)and basically makes the show what it is....... LEGENDARY!!
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink is a wonderful singer, she puts her heart and soul into her songs especially in this cd. When you listen to her music it makes you feel good about yourself. Pink is addicting!!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I have always loved this movie and I bought it for my kids to add to their growing love and collection of Disney movies.  I think it's absolutely wonderful.
B000E9910W|5.0|The Doobie Brothers are one of my Favorite groups of all time and if your a fan like me. you have to get this 2 Disc set it is absolutely worth the price tag. I already own the Doobies greatist hits but decided to purchase this set as a collectors edition. you get remastered sound plus all thier hits!!go get it you wont regret it!!!
B000062XFG|5.0|Season 2 of ST:TNG is a definite improvement over Season 1, despite Gates McFaddin being on sabbatical and the writer's strike of the time.  Diana Muldaur spiced things up as the hard-edged Dr. Pulaski, and Whoopi Goldberg slipped in nicely as the charismatic Guinan. Some of the episodes leave a lot to be desired, but there is plenty here that makes up for it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Love the show! The DVDs are great quality and I received them when Amazon said I would.
0307237699|3.0|In reading this book , you can tell Barrack Obam is a very inteligent man. You get a good sense/feel for his ideas and convictions. Which is why I bought the book in the first place. But the problem I had with this book (which I did not finish), is that Mr. Obama is so intelligent that much of the book was just plain over my head/over my level of understanding. I will attempt to finish it in the near future, Maybe I just wasn't really in the right mood to read it at the time. But be prepared with a dictionary near by while reading it.
0743454537|5.0|Wow!  The family struggle in this book is amazing.  Jodi does an excellent job of telling the story from each person's perspective.  You want to reach out to each and every person in this story to comfort them.  I did not want to put this book down.
B00005ASIL|5.0|Very Best is what you can always expect from Jethro Tull.  These are the classics to be enjoyed as in days gone by.  For those of you seeking good classic rock, or just want to reminisce, this is a great album to buy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Anyone who likes a great love story will really enjoy this movie.Its worth watching just for the cinematography.Whoever did the cinematography deserved an oscar.
0440238609|5.0|After coming across online discussions about how this set of books was a kick in the pants to Christianity, and how secular humanists were carrying these books as their banner in the culture war against fundamentalists, I didn't really want to wade into that quagmire. So often, books touted in a culture war read like a manifesto. But I was trying my hand writing at an \\"alter-earth\\" fantasy myself, and Pullman's trilogy seemed to be succeeeding where I was failing. So I thought I would give it a chance.<br /><br />I have heard other people say that \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy was the finest piece of fantasy since \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" I have also heard it called a humanist alternative to \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\" Needless to say, I was dubious. No one since Le Guin has managed to craft a thick fantasy for young adults, and I was growing comfortable with the thought that the genre had been mined. But, after reading this trilogy, I am now convinced that Tolkien, Lewis, and Le Guin were just hacking at the stone.<br /><br />Thankfully, \\"His Dark Materials\\" was not a polemic against religion, nor was it an allegory or manifesto. It was a truly baroque piece of writing, damn near perfect. Naturally, I can now see why a few feverish fundamentalists would be horrified--God is a minor character, which I suppose would be as offensive to Xtians as a drawing of Mohammed is to Mooslims--not that I really care what religious nuts necessarily opine.<br /><br />That Phillip Pullman drew on \\"Paradise Lost\\" for inspiration and foundation is a thought-provoking thesis, happily neglected when the tale gets underway. Rather than pedantically preaching, Pullman works his craft: breathing life into his characters, making their dramas and conflicts real and imperative, and painting it all in language just barely within reach of the highly literate young adult. It is the reader's job to build and defend her own beliefs. In the end, I prefer to think that Pullman wishes to be as major an English writer as Milton was--or else that he wanted to remind us that High Fantasy was invented during the British Rennaissance. That's as far as the controversy goes for me.<br /><br />One ot the best things about the three novels, I believe, is a chiascuro worthy of Rembrandt. He blurs the edges of things, and puts shapes in the dark shadows at the hazy periphery. He suggest millions and millions of parallel worlds, populates maybe four, and yet you can almost feel the weight of all those universes pressing your hands as they hold open the pages. He only suggests a marvelous history for many of the secondary characters, and then your imagination unwinds their own novellas in your reveries. His talent for description makes reading a participatory process, rather than a receptive one. The result is a holographic oevre, alive and growing in the reader's imagination.<br /><br />There really is nothing like this trilogy. It is astonishing, marvelous, original, and thoroughly entertaining--much like the main character. The heroine, Lyra, is such a novel hero. She starts the story as an almost Dickensian urchin, then undergoes a tempering of character, forged in the fires of conflict and machination, and undergoes a tragic, orphean fall. Oh, how I wanted to change her fate! But what happens to her is as necessary as all the tribulation most very character meets.<br /><br />\\"His Dark Materials\\" outshines \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Earthsea.\\" There is nothing like it, and I suspect, nothing else will eclipse it for at least a century. It is a masterpiece of English literature, and I feel blessed to have finished it.
B000059XUO|5.0|If you ever wanted to see the greatest movie of all times this it.  Brandon Lee is by the far the best of all of the series.  It is a shame that he had to die so young.
0307237699|5.0|This book is an absolute read for all American Citizens - Republicans and Democrats alike.  (I am a Republican - however a people voter not a party voter)  This book is plain and simple good common sense - which seems to have been lost in politics in D.C.  - This upcoming election is going to be key to the future of the country - and we all owe to future generations to read and understand the problems and the common sense solutions and thoughts on the pages of the amazing book.
B00004RJ74|5.0|If you like blood and vampires and of course nked woman this is a must see.  Very good detail and awesome scenes.
B000BT97AO|3.0|I received the item very promptly, but I am confused about something.  When the item description says it is brand new and sealed, why is the booklet or insert that comes in new DVDs now inside?  I ordered two DVDs from amazon and niether of them came with the insert, but they were stated to be brand new.  Other than that I am very pleased with my purchases.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I'm one of those people who rents Groundhog Day every year, as a sort of tradition.  The reason I finally bought the movie?  The movie stores stopped carrying it because it is an older movie now. <br /> <br />The DVD itself is what you'd expect.  It has all the classic moments, good quality, and if you're looking to save on constantly renting it, the Special Edition is a good way to go.
B00007AJGH|5.0|I was so happy when they put this movie on DVD.  When I was growing up this was my favorite movie.  The cover is so creative and it has great special features.  It brings me back to my childhood!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|It is the best's better then there first one, we loved it & the casle in the back ground,just beautiful.
0385504209|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Totally captivating I could not put it down and finished in 2 days
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This offering from KWS is one of the best CD/DVD combos' I've ever seen/heard. It's a \\"must have\\" for any real blues enthusiast. If you are a real fan of the blues your collection is not complete without it. It's a must see for the true historian.  <br />Also check out anything by Chris Cain. He is the man.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you take this film for what it is and leave the political agenda behind, its great. The title sums it up because, as Americans, we have to have convienence. If something is \\"Inconvienent\\" than we don't want anything to do with it. I have never been an Al Gore fan or much of an environmentalist, but I did enjoy the film and thought that it brought some awareness and \\"shock factor\\" to some very important environmental issues.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I'm not going to lie. I liked this movie well before i even purchased this product. I loved the weaving dynamics of the story, and it's dichotomy of  societal issues and personal growth. But this is not about that. This is about the product. The plastic discs encoded with a set of zeros and ones, and wrapped in a hardened paper shell. When it comes to that, I am also grandly impressed. The casing was artistic to say the least. A cacaphony-esque melee of imagery and mixed reviews, it shows the good along with the bad. All too often we see case seething with blatantly optomistic reviews, bestowing great acolades on these movies, that in most cases, are sub-par. This is not the case. As with most great movies, this one was hated. And these scathing remarks were not left unmentioned. Kudos to you, 20th Century Fox. Along side this is a hodgepodge of movie stills, quotable quotes, and propaganda, enticing the viewer into the ever addictive world of Fight Club. So what are we to do in this situation? Well we do what any consumer does after devouring the external imagery: we put the dvd in. The first disc is of course the movie. It is as we all remember, so i am not going to get into that. However, the commentary was entertainment in itself. A riotous mixture of philisophical wanings, whimsical musings, and technical meanerings, this was one of the highlights of my days for a FEW days. After finishing the movie (and all of it's commentaried versions), I proceeded to put the second dvd in. This is where the product gets it's less than perfect rating. The second disc, though inclusive of many funny, and poignant moments, just seemed to lack the extras that make this a truely fantastic disc. I do however recommend watching the publis service announcements. They were a highlight on disc two. So in conclusion, I rate this a four star product. The movie itself is equal to five alone but when paying for a special edition, I was just expecting something a little more special. Do not get me wrong though. This was a great buy and I would buy it again if I had to, so i urge you to get it as well. You will be pleased with this purchase for years to come. <br />SCAR
B000JLTRIG|2.0|Being a hugh fan of Charmed I would purchase this set of DVD's, as well as seasons 1-6. The quality of the video is by far substandard of anything else I've ever purchased. Also, the small circular tabs that hold the center of the DVD have arrived broken in pretty much every season, on every disk. This varies from 3-4 tabs to almost all of them.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I received The Lake House in excellent condition and was extremely pleased by the whole transaction.  The service was fast and very smooth. Thank you for all your help.  This was the first time I have bought anything from Amazon.com but it won't be the last.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Quality DVD. The Searchers is my favorite John Wayne movie. If you're a John Wayne fan, the bonus special features disc is fascinating - you'll be glad you have it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Perfect voices in perfect musical layout.  I get goosebumps listening to this one!
B000MTOKXW|5.0|The music we know...but now Rhino has issued this timeless beauty in a mini Lp sleeve replica just as it was meant to from the beginning!Thanks!!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The faces and beautiful motion of this show is only topped by the beauty of the voices and music.
B000MTOKYQ|5.0|The music we know...but this is finally packaged in a mini Lp sleeve just like the original. Simply a delight to see this. Now if Rhino did the same replica authentic original packaging with Captain Beefhearts \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" and \\"Lick my decals off\\" it would be sublime!!This sure is!
B0007M22TI|5.0|Perfect voices blended with beautiful music.  A must hear experience.  Gives me goosebumps!
0060589272|4.0|This was a really good book.  Paul Coelho is an outstanding author.  Not his very best writing but a great look ay Sex, society and the person.
0807208523|5.0|I've read Charlotte's Web a million times. In fact, it's probably my favorite book.  One day I came across this CD of E.B. White reading his book and I fell in love with his words all over again. Hearing that flat yet warm voice tell his own story is an incredible gift.  Get this set!   (And if you can, get your hands on a copy of The Annotated Charlotte's Web for insight into how a master wordsmith creates a classic.
B000CNE092|5.0|My daughter, who is 7, loves this movie.  She first watched it on VHS when she was about 5.  It was a bit scary for her then.  Fast forward one year and she liked the movie so much that it started to show wear and tear at the beginning.  She doesn't watch a lot of TV, but this is a favorite.  Other than scary Rasputin, there's nothing offensive in the movie and in the end good conquers evil and everyone is where they are supposed to be.  Happy endings abound.
0399230033|5.0|This book proves the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words!  By looking at all the details on each page, the story unfolds. (We particularly loved to follow where the balloon went off to!) A cute little story with a sense of humor! <br /> <br />My dds are both almost teenagers, but this is still a fondly remembered book!
B000002NFM|5.0|I got the CD in very good condition and on time. I love this kind of survise. Keep it up :)
0399226907|5.0|Although I am partial to \\"real, paper\\" books, this is one that is worth buying as a board book.  Even a very young baby will enjoy following along with this story by putting his/her little fingers in the holes on each page. This is a wonderful story that every child should own!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Great music from a band that just keeps giving us more and more each time they record.  Both disks are great.  In Wisconsin we are getting radio play of a few of the songs so far.  The booklet that is included is great, neat pics and lyrics. I say, if you like the Chili Peppers, you won't be disappointed.
0805017445|5.0|The melodic way this story reads draws you in! By looking at the pictures, a very young reader has enough clues to know what the words are on each page are. So, a non-reader can actually \\"read\\" this book!<br /><br />This is a classic that we read many many times over the years!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  Originally called Lola Rennt in German, it is a neat view as to what can happen in a day if different scenarios were to take place.  I highly recommend it and enjoy watching it again and again.
0446691437|5.0|Pressfield is a novelist who takes a humorous but tough look at the key challenge in front of anyone embarking on creative production:  sitting down to do it.   You might have issues with the philosophical underpinnings of his approach.  But the sheer practicality of his approach will win anyone over. Certainly anyone who has faced the challenges of the blank canvas or the empty sheet of paper.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Personally I think Little Miss Sunshine is the best movie of 2006. I swear it just keeps getting funnier every time I watch it! They could not have cast this film any better than they did - each actor captures their role so perfectly (I especially love Paul Dano as Dwayne). My congrats to Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris on a fine piece of work (and of course Michael Arndt for his brilliant screenplay).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is not for everyone; after all, the show was canceled by Fox TV after only a few episodes. But for those it IS for, it's a real gem; users at the Internet Movie Database (imbd.com) give it a 9.5 rating - higher than any movie ever, and higher than any other TV series I've come across). Other polls have rated it the best sci-fi show of all time. <br /> <br />Firefly is both sci-fi and a western, both comedy and drama, with an ensemble cast that clearly enjoyed working together - all of which contribute to what is for me the most enjoyable thing about Firefly: Every genre, every story - including Firefly. - runs according to certain established patterns, certain formulas, certain clichés; but Firefly abounds with subtle and casual departures from these patterns. The departures may be just a few words of dialog, a minor character's reaction to some situation, or the way a whole episode turns out. The result though is an all-pervasive sense of mystery and delight to the viewing experience. <br /> <br />I won't offer any specifics on these departures. For one thing, it all works just fine without being aware of any. For another, the enjoyment of these subtle departures is far greater when discovered on your own. Watching Firefly episodes is a bit like eating chocolate cake or drinking a fine wine; you can do it again and again and enjoy the experience every time. <br /> <br />The Firefly series, having been canceled early on, didn't get to properly end, or even develop, during its TV incarnation. But it did, a few years later, get to have a well received feature movie called Serenity come out as both a sequel and series finale.  When I first saw Serenity in a theater, I'd never even heard of Firefly and so found nothing particularly wonderful about it. But then I did hear of Firefly, saw the whole series on DVD, and saw Serenity again. Amazing! Astounding! Wonderful!  <br />
0375751513|5.0|This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think. The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures.
0689878451|5.0|I heard about this book after all the hype about it being banned from some schools because it talks about a homosexual family.  First of all, this is a true story, and second, get over it people!  It's a story about two male penguins that formed a bond and were given the opportunity by the zoo keeper to hatch an egg.  I definitely wanted to get it to read to my children.  We have a close family member who is gay.  My children are too young to understand the other alternative family type books yet, but this was perfect.  It opens up the concept to them.  On a purely, scientific point of view, it's also a lesson of how animals can thrive under unnatural conditions (the zoo!)
0060899190|3.0|My only complaint with this book is that some of the postcards were blown up to fill 2 pages in the book and it was a little hard to read those postcards because the words would be accross the spine and you had to bend the book open to read all the words.  I think it would have been better to leave the postcards in their original size.
0375703861|3.0|Zadie Smith's first novel is an epic undertaking and it seems to be too sweeping a task for her.  Her mastery of language, her descriptions and nuance, are not in doubt.  This is a novelist who really executes beautiful prose.  What I had trouble with in the reading was the roundabout manner of getting to the point.<br /><br />The intertwining of two families over the course of twenty-five years to establish motivations for twins is not effective because much of the buildup is absent tension, and conflict is sacrificed for a wandering story that, while cleverly wrapped up in a final conclusion, isn't worth the journey.<br /><br />I do give it three stars because Smith has a knack for getting into her character's heads and making believable their actions and motivations.  Her writing is pretty to read, and her knowledge of social strata in England's immigrant classes is well-conveyed through the pen.  However, as rarely as I ever desire cliff's notes, or an abridgement, I felt this was on work of fiction that could've used it.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
B000KCHZK6|5.0|CD was received in very good time and I enjoyed it alot.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I saw the special on PBS and loved it. When I saw the cd available on Amazon I had to get it. These 4 vocalists are talented at their craft. They sound like the proverbial angels. The fiddler is very good but I don't like her as much as Eileen Ivers, who is a remarkable Irish fiddler. I thought this was a good value and have enjoyed listening to it over and over.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Madonna since the first time she appeared on the scene in the 1980's. While not all of her albums since then have been great at the same time they haven't been horrible. This collection we have the live version of some of her songs and an great dvd showing Madonna at what she does best....Entertaining a crowd. She is a charismatic and provocative performer. She may not be the most talented singer or songwriter but she is a great entertainer!

1401902197|5.0|Louise Hay has a way of making you believe in yourself and in the power of positive thinking.  This book is great because it comes with a CD you can listen to, and it's broken down into subjects so you can work on whatever area of your life you need help with at the time, e.g., finances, relationships, etc.  I've noticed a definite improvement in my life since listening to the positive affirmations.  I have her I Can Do It! calendar too, which has daily positive affirmations and reinforces what you learn from her books.  Highly recommended!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I loved this movie. The movie's premise was great; we were going to follow the blooming and flowering of eight different relationships in the 5 weeks before Christmas. Suffice to say, some of the movie made me cry and some made me laugh and all of it gave me a warm, tingly feeling inside.  <br /> <br />The acting is really superb and MOST of the characters interesting. The best story involves Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister who falls in love with his secretary. I admit I've been in love with Hugh Grant for ages and ages, but he is really a great comedic actor. His comic timing is impeccable. Most of the other stories were very interesting and we end up really liking the characters. However, naturally, because there are so many stories, we don't see as much of our favorite story as we'd like to. I wish we could have seen more of the stories featuring the prime minister (Hugh Grant), a couple facing a marriage crisis (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), a man teaching his son about love (Liam Neeson), and a man falling in love with his housekeeper (Colin Firth), probably just because their acting sucks you in. I also wish they cut three stories (porn stars, coworkers, and the British guy going to America) that, to me, were unnecessary, didn't go anywhere, and took screen time away from the better stories.  <br /> <br />But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie. The music is wonderful and you'll find yourself humming that `horrible' tune Bill Nighy sings through the movie. `Love Actually' is far from Richard Curtis's best, but a winsome British cast, a really witty script, and a shot of Hugh Grant dancing and singing down the stairs will make this movie incredibly enjoyable. Love is actually all around!
0790737345|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Valentine's day and I'm now a hero.  This is her favorite \\"chick flick\\".  Actually, I've been able to sit through a couple of showings of this DVD and still been entertained.  BTW, the sound track is excellent. <br /> <br />Be a hero, buy this for your wife or girl friend.
B000J103PC|4.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a lot of fun, and much better that the novel is it based on. Meryl Streep is a delight to watch as the boss from hell--someone who, without ever raising her voice, can make her employees weep and collapse. She's supported by a very good cast -the girl who plays Emily is great, and so is Stanley Tucci, as the gay art director and Andrea's unlikely ally at Runway. And the clothes? Oh, they are just fabulous!! <br />
B000KCHZK6|4.0|\\"Not too late\\" is good listening when playing on a car CD. Why?  it's easier to hear the words she is singing. When I listen with my laptop and ear phones I get the stereo effect missed with older speakers. I was dissappointed to find out after I purchased the CD that a DVD was packaged with the CD in local stores. <br /> <br />Herb Garrett
B000001FMX|5.0|After recently seeing the movie, \\"New York Doll,\\" I was jogged back to a time before we ever knew about The Ramones, Graham Parker, Cracker, and The Psychedelic Furs.  This was sometime around 1973 where the glam sound was subtly mutating into early punk.  And The New York Dolls may have been ground zero for that morph.   <br /> <br />With the possible exception of The Velvet Underground, I can't trace any more seminal linkage to what was to come in the late seventies than The Dolls.  Listening to this CD is like going back before the time of Constantine: no Sea of Marmara, no Anatolia, no Ephesus, no Byzantium.  Just Rome as the center of the universe in the way The Beatles and the Stones staked an Augustinian claim to that center.  The eastwardly itinerant Constantine seemed to be swiping at the wind; who could expect anything to come from that.   <br /> <br />But listening to this eponymously titled debut, you begin to see the shape of things to come.  At the time of its release, I remember the song \\"Trash\\" being introduced on a local New York FM station as the flagship cut from this raw new band out of the dross of Hells Kitchen.  I remember thinking it to be a discordant, sneering mess of cacophony, scratching it off my list, searching more for the mellifluous sounds of emerging early seventies semi-prog Brit acts like The Strawbs, The Electric Light Orchestra, and Stealer's Wheel in addition to new acoustic, Dylany singer songwriters like Elliott Murphy, Daydo, Ralph McTell, Nick Drake, and, of course, Jackson Browne.   <br /> <br />The Dolls simply didn't register on my new-bands-to-follow meter.  But hearing them now, and placing them into the context of  the post-Constantine period in rock and roll, I can suddenly feel their greatness.  How they, maybe singlehandedly, constructed a new musical cosmos through a counterpoint of Shirelles cooing and Peter Wolf goof-shouting.   <br /> <br />If you were alive in the early seventies, this is a great way to go back to a time in your life that was right at the dawn of modernism.  As Chrissie Hynde said in the movie, The New York Dolls were \\"the one pinhole of light\\" coming out of this time.  I still like Elliott Murphy, but there is no arguing with the vital sensibility The Dolls created that is with us today. <br />
B000KCHZK6|1.0|As much as I love this artist and enjoyed greatly her first two cd's, this one falls very short for me. I don't think there is enough mass appeal and many of the songs seem to run together in style, tone and rhythm.
B000021Y77|4.0|Most of the movies I buy from Amazon are sale priced gems I've seen already. They're additions to a burgeoning home library. As I add additions I screen them to make sure the DVD plays properly. In this instance I screened the movie for co-workers during lunch and dinner breaks. \\"Lola\\" was well received by those who had not seen it before. I think it's a terrific example of an alternative (foreign or otherwise) to mega budget (or even mid to low budget fodder) movies especially those with huge stars, and an over abundance of special effects, which play as if they were written for and by marketing robots. <br /> <br />If you can get \\"Lola\\" on sale do check it out
B000JLTRIG|3.0|I've loved Charmed ever since it first came out. On the other hand the sisters were all very discontent with having to \\"save the world\\" and their powers. When before it's always been about be who you are. Then again everyone gets tired of just being themselves every once in a while. Anyway, it's still Charmed, that didn't change.
B000M4RGA6|5.0|Amazing film, hands down. An amazing 50gb MPEG-2 transfer and great DD 5.1 and uncompressed PCM 5.1 track as well. Great for your first Blu-ray Disc as well.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This soundtrack was senational. Everytime i listen to it makes it seem that im watching the movie all over again. It was fabulous!!!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|Norah Jones is a great artist and I love her voice.  However, I found the selections on this album to be WAY too \\"mellow\\".  I was ready to drift off to sleep within a few minutes.  The numbers all sounded alike, and Norah's range was not at all highlighted.  She's recorded much better albums - try to listen to some of these selections before purchasing; if you like them, great, if not, you haven't spent a dime!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My wife and I loved the video.  We are Celtic Woman fans
1400064287|5.0|This is one of the most valuable books I've ever read.  It's well organized, is an easy read; plus all of the concepts are so practical, useful, and frankly obvious once they're read.  I've used the ideas in several business communications and a newspaper editorial letter so far and feel that my expression was more powerful after incorporating a few of the basic principles in the book.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This was so fantastic, it was mind blowing. These ladies can really sing and interact with the audience and each other. It took us back to our roots. The musical arrangement was fabulous and the video director did a fantastic job. This is a show for the whole family and is worthy of more stars than are available to rate it by.
B000M5B6Q0|3.0|The opening track Pop! Goes My Heart is the album's highlight as is the corresponding music video that opens the movie. Meaningless Kiss is another Wham-like jingle that amuses though the rest of the album consists of weaker material. Some of the lyrics are very 'Spinal Tap'-like, which is great if you like that style of humour.
B00005JKTF|5.0|very interesting ww2 story of the corrupt govt. ofwar time france as well as fine people doing what should be done .
B000LC55F2|2.0|The plot has been discussed elsewhere so let's get down to brass tacks. <br /> <br />We had heard nothing but great things about this movie and expected nothing less. I've been a Christian Bale fan since Reign of Fire and Jackman never fails to turn in a rock solid performance.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the film broke a cardinal rule right off the bat: Every story must have a protagonist and an antagonist to evolve and carry the plot. This film DOESN'T. <br /> <br />So intense and fanatical is the rivalry between the two, it quickly becomes apparent that the viewer really doesn't CARE about either character. We don't especially like either one of them, much less feel the emotional bonding needed to rally behind one or the other.  <br /> <br />Michael Caine is superbly understated. With no \\"hero\\" to root for, Caine could have easily stolen the spotlight and probably should have done exactly that. It has become readily apparent that Caine, a rare and undisputed \\"Oliver Class\\" actor's actor, simply becomes better and better and still better with age. Rest assured that there's a well deserved  Special Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in Caine's future. I seriously doubt that this film will be on the highlight reel. <br /> <br />Bottom line: This film wastes a lot of talent for no discernable reason. It was about as satisfying as spending two hours with a stuttering insurance man.
0399230033|5.0|A classic read and a must for all parents.  My daughter loves to read it over and over.  Great starter book for learning to read.
0143038419|5.0|From the very beginning of this book I knew it would be one that I would want all of my women friends to read. It spoke of the journey most of us have made; maybe not in such an extravagant way; but our quest for those spiritual lessons that this author so lovingly and honestly shares. It inspired me, touched my heart and soul and reminded me that life is a journey. It awakened and renewed my quest for those pleasures in life that the title addresses.
B00005MP58|5.0|My wife has watched this over twenty times and still goes back again and again. Just excellent acting and adaptation of Austin novel.
0694013889|4.0|I used this book for both my son and daughter when they were potty training. I love the story and the graphics in the book, The only thing that needs to be changed is the actually potty. It looks like a big mug. I don't think it quite registers with very small children. Both my kids (I bought the boy and girl version) were perplexed and didn't know what it was--I had to explain to them that it was a potty that you can't buy here-a very special one. If you can explain that away, then I would recommend this book--the story is great!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a long time. My daughter and I love it. It was my niece who told me to go online to Amazon, so I am very greatful to her, because I never thought to do it. I gave it to my daughter, and she was really happy. <br />Thanks <br />P. Myers
0736063684|5.0|the book was exactly as I wanted. Good descriptions and illustrations of the anatomy of a human body. Locates various muscles.
1590074688|1.0|I would like to comment on the reading of \\"Unnatural Exposure\\", by C.J. Critt.  This was one of the worst readings I have heard and I've heard over 200 audio books.  Her over-emphasis of words, several in every sentence, was very annoying and inappropriate.  Her pronunciation of some words, particularly ones beginning with vowels was often wrong, i.e. \\"eventually\\", pronounced \\"aventually\\" and \\"exact\\", pronounced \\"ugzaxt\\", just to name two.  When someone was being gentle or kind, like Benton, it didn't come through, rather the whole book was read of if Moreno was reading it, harsh and cynical.  Had I not wanted to finish the story, having heard the whole series, I would have turned it off, it was so irritating.  The whole thing was like an over-acted stage play.  I will make an effort to not get any books read by Ms. Critt in the future.
1932907009|1.0|Have you noticed how all the reviews of this book are 5 stars and have you noticed how every review tells you \\"to buy this book!\\" I don't think I've ever seen that on Amazon before, even with the best books out there! <br /> <br />I really don't recommend buying this book. The advice really isn't very good. When the guy's only two credits are \\"stop! or my mom will shoot\\" and \\"Blank Check\\", enough said! Don't emulate him. Try 'Story' by Robert Mckee or 'The Devil's guide to Hollywood' by Joe Eszterhas.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is the REAL star in this movie. Jack Nicholson is AWESOME!  Matt Damon (snitch) was also good.  5 stars.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I just love this movie and the soundtrack. I always puts me in the Christmas  mood when I need a lift.
B0000C23DO|4.0|If you're new to the Dead, this is a great place to start. Sound reproduction is very good, and the selection of songs is the best of their studio work.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Most (if not all) of the Shadows greatest hits and popular tunes are included in this concert. Some tunes are performed with Acoustic guitars (more jazzie). The Shadows are not really a singing group. The songs they sang were not too good (especially the Cliff Richard tunes). Overall, this is a must have DVD for Shadows Fans. I love this concert DVD.
0618164413|5.0|My daugther likes a lot this book, she enjoys a lot of the mischiefs of this restless monkey.
B000J233SK|5.0|I have had this cd before, my [...]son stepped on it and broke it. I had to have it replaced. When I am sick, or just needing to relax I put on Loreena Mckennitt.  Her soothing voice and music makes my stress level go way down. The music also helps lull my children to sleep if they are having a fitful time getting to sleep.  This is one of my favorite cds ever. I am never without a copy of it. It is a must have if you like celtic types of music, or if you have fussy kids. I highly recommend this cd.

0307237699|5.0|Great read.  Barack Obama really knows how to express big ideas in an entertaining fashion.  This guy has terrific writing skills.  As a Republican who was interested in his positions, this was the perfect book to read.
0321344758|5.0|This book is well researched and well documented.  And it's a quick read with great examples and screen shots to make it accessible to even the most print-averse web techies.  I got several copies of this for our web team.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Just as good as the early years. I did not think I would ever say that when I saw this new series coming out. This new series is really great. Dont rent this dvd , buy it! You will never regret owning this new series. Reminds me of the great Tom Baker years. By the way the Dalex live!

B00005JPG1|4.0|The highly anticipated new film from director David Fincher (\\"Seven\\", \\"Panic Room\\", \\"Fight Club\\"), \\"Zodiac\\" is a faithful recreation of the hunt for the elusive Zodiac killer in San Francisco during the early 70s. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., along with a wealth of well-known actors in small, supporting roles, \\"Zodiac\\" is a very good yet imperfect film suffering from two problems. More on that later.<br /><br />July 4, 1969. Vallejo, California. A teenage boy, impatient with his girlfriend when she is late to pick him up, doesn't realize she has a plan and they soon end up at a make-out point. Before they are able to get very far, a car speeds up behind them and the driver gets out and shoots them. Then an ominous letter arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle. The writer claims to be the killer and includes a cipher demanding the paper print it on the front page, he wants a different part of the same cipher printed in the San Francisco Examiner and a locaL Vallejo paper. If they don't, the killing spree will continue. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a political cartoonist at the Chronicle, gets a look at the cipher and tries to solve it. A couple of days later, two retired school teachers solve the cipher and turn it into the paper. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a reporter at the Chronicle, is in the room when the letter is read, so he gets the story and starts to verify the information revealed. Later, a cabbie picks up a fare in downtown San Francisco. Stopping on a residential street, the passenger shoots the cabbie and takes part of his bloody shirt. Detective Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner, Detective Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), investigate and soon everyone realizes the killer of both of these people is one and the same. In a future letter, the killer identifies himself as Zodiac and all of the parties begin a long investigation taking them to many dead ends, through many career and life changes, and into an obsession with finding the true identity of this elusive killer.<br /><br />From the opening frames of \\"Zodiac\\", we realize we are in the hands of a filmmaker who has gone to great pains to recreate a time and an era, to add authenticity to the story. A wide shot of San Francisco bay, complete with fireworks, leads to a traveling shot down a residential street in Vallejo. We see various people playing with fireworks in front of their homes. We see the obligatory families with the large fireworks, overdoing it, trying to make everyone jealous. Wait, what was that? Two mothers sharing a smoke outside of a garage? Yes, that's exactly what it was. Not every director would even bother to show this type of detail, but because Fincher does, we realize he is going to take us for a ride, showing us as much detail, relevant or not, good or bad, as he can. He wants to make a definitive portrait of the hunt for this killer, so he will provide us with a lot of detail; considering the length of the investigation, perhaps too much detail. This is why the film clocks in at over two and a half hours; there is a lot of story to tell and Fincher isn't willing to take any shortcuts.<br /><br />The details are presented in a clear and concise fashion. Each scene begins with a date and time stamp, helping us orient the lengthy, ongoing investigation. Some scenes are very brief, others present information leading Graysmith or Toschi in a wrong direction. This is all part of the investigation and therefore, part of the story of the hunt for the Zodiac.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" is more of a police procedural than I was expecting. It does this well, as mentioned, giving us a clear picture of the investigation, warts and all, showing us many of the leads the detectives or Graysmith follow. But the film is lacking in suspense. It isn't a requirement that a film of this nature have suspense, but given Fincher's last few films, and the subject matter, I kind of expected it. The film is very good, but a little suspense sprinkled throughout would help the film move at a faster pace and seem less long than it actually is. At two hours and forty minutes, you feel every minute of it when you get up and leave the theater. There are a couple of moments when Fincher seems to say \\"oh, screw it\\" and tries to inject some suspense, but these attempts are half hearted and do little more than help to establish another fact or make the film just a bit longer.<br /><br />The performances are universally good, but they are pretty low key, with Gyllenhaal exuding the most energy and Downey Jr. adding little interesting touches to his portrayal of the reporter who chronicles the story of the killer for the San Francisco newspaper.<br /><br />As soon as Graysmith gets a look at the first cipher, he is hooked. A political cartoonist for the newspaper, he admits that he enjoys puzzles. A number of other people, the FBI, Naval Intelligence, try to solve the puzzle, but a pair of retired professors successfully decodes the message. When Graysmith looks at their solution, the last line is left blank and he realizes they were unable to figure it out. As they receive more coded messages, he becomes more and more obsessed with discovering the identity of the killer, as though Zodiac's identity is a puzzle of its own.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Zodiac\\", Gyllenhaal seems slightly frantic. During a blind date with Melanie (Chloe Sevigny), he is preoccupied and more concerned with the whereabouts of Paul Avery (Downey, Jr.). Inexplicably, they end up living together and have children before his obsession takes over completely. Finally, he decides to write a book, but as the investigation goes on for a long time, the book takes a long time. Graysmith wants to make sure he has all of the information.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is fairly low key as Detective Toschi. So often, we see film detectives who blow up at the slightest provocation, presumably the filmmaker's way of making the detective seem believable, when in fact it simply makes them seem like a cartoon. Fincher keeps things very neutral; arguments between Toschi and Armstrong are more of a disagreement, when they interrogate suspects, they raise their eyebrows when something doesn't fit. There is no good cop/ bad cop here. During the course of the film, Graysmith and Toschi attend the premiere of \\"Dirty Harry\\" and his hunt for the `Scorpio Killer'. This is Fincher's way of indicating to us how `real' he is trying to make this experience. As they leave the theater, someone remarks the suspect got shot in the back. At the time, they were not close to uncovering the identity of the killer, so the story is clearly fictionalized. Also, Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan couldn't be further from Mark Ruffalo's Toschi, a detective clearly more realistic than Eastwood's famous, iconic character.<br /><br />Ruffalo's Toschi is also obsessed with finding the killer, but he seems more cognoscente of how the system works. He knows he has to work other cases, and won't be able to keep the case open forever. Therefore, he occasionally loses hope only to have Graysmith uncover a new lead and pull him back into the mix again, getting his hopes up again.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, the Chronicle reporter who becomes the lead reporter on the case. Downey brings a few moments of levity to the film, portraying Avery as a cross between a free wheeling reporter in the late 60s, experimenting with everything San Francisco has to offer, and Noel Coward. Avery isn't beyond saying what he is thinking, but he quickly covers up any faux pas with an acerbic remark. At one point, he and Graysmith are talking over drinks in a seedy bar. After Avery takes a hit of cocaine, he notices Graysmith's blue drink, complete with umbrella and states \\"That drink can longer be ignored\\". Graysmith offers a sip and the dubious Avery tries it. Cut to a table with twelve empty glasses, the remains of the watery blue drink in each.<br /><br />Avery's cavalier attitude gets him into more than one dangerous situation and he seems less intent on trying to figure out ho the killer is than with keeping his job, in an effort to maintain his lifestyle. Graysmith visits the reporter late in the story, after he no longer works for the Chronicle, to find him living in a seedy house boat, unwilling to get too worked up about the latest lead.<br /><br />The film features a wealth of well-known actors taking on smaller roles. Anthony Edwards plays Toschi's partner, Detective Armstrong. He is basically a sounding board for Toschi, and they share the same temperament. John Carroll Lynch (best known as Drew Carey's brother on \\"The Drew Carey Show\\") plays Arthur Leigh Allen, one of the suspects. In his few scenes, he quickly establishes his creepiness and makes us realize he could possibly be carrying out these murders. Brian Cox plays Melvin Belli, the San Francisco attorney who helped to set the stage for people like Johnnie Cochran and other superstar lawyers. Charles Fleischer (the voice of \\"Roger Rabbit\\") makes a quick appearance as a revival movie theater owner who may hold the key to the mystery. Dermot Mulroney plays Toschi's boss, the head of the Detective squad. Elias Koteas, James Le Gros, Clea Duvall and many others make quick appearances.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" is a very well made film, presenting the most important details of the lengthy hunt for this elusive killer. I like the film's attempts to show us the wrong turns the investigation takes, showing us the red herrings. I simply wish the performances held a little more fire, a little more passion.

The Swell Season contains most of the songs featured in the brilliant Irish musical film written and directed by John Carney. The songs on The Swell Season are beautiful and evocative and the melodies will sweep you away. Glen's voice is like a fine Irish whiskey at it's best and Marketa provides the perfect counterpoint.
B00008RWRH|5.0|Eugen Jochum was a truly great conductor without that reputation.  When you listen to this set, the greatness really shows.  First of all, these recordings sound like performances.  They have grace, style and most importantly, spontanaiety.  Of all the great composers, Haydn's music has the most humor.  Some of it is extremely obvious like the slow movements of 93 and 94.  Other times it is much more subtle.  But it is always there.  Jochum brings out the humor and spontanaiety as well as any conductor making this set absolutely delightful.  I have one complaint.  For some strange reason, they included two recordings of Symphony No. 98.  There had to be another Haydn symphony somewhere.  I would love to have a Jochum recording of No. 86, if he recorded it.  Nevertheless, this is a set that should be in your library if you love the classical era.

1400032717|5.0|This is one of the most original books I've read in years.  Autism has often been portrayed as a somewhat stange and mysterious condition e.g. Rainman, but this work takes a very down-to-earth yet entertaining approach.  By taking the perspective of the autistic cild in the first person it delivers incredible insight into how such people may in fact view the world.  I found it very moving and humbling as well as incredibly thought provoking and educational.  A great read!

B00000DHZJ|5.0|This compilation is truly the \\"best\\" of Hendrix.  In addition to the staples that everyone knows, the latter half of this collection reveals the new direction Jimi was heading in.  \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Dolly Dagger\\" both especially stand out as not only straight ahead rock, but have a nice R & B feel to them.  The arrangements of each song are well crafted, something many artists overlook.  It's a shame that Jimi's life was cut so short.  Who knows where he would have gone and how many more artists would have been influenced by him (think Stevie Ray Vaughn).  This CD is an absolute must to anyone's library of \\"oldies\\".  You will NOT be disappointed!
B000K7UBTI|3.0|Although I enjoyed this movie, I think I would have liked it better had they used real actors like they've done with Superman, Batman, and Spiderman and the Hulk.  Other than that it was pretty, I just have a hard time getting emotionally envolved with a cartoon.

0634022296|5.0|Although this book is dimensionally smaller than I expected, the layout is good with each song taking as little space as necessary.  You won't need someone to turn the page to play the complete song.  The chord fingerings are there, too, so you have it all. <br />The only thing that would make this book better is a spiral binding so it would lay flat.  The price is certainly right, and all the songs are there.  Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.

0743298020|4.0|Just about every hoary device from Gothic fiction is present in Diane Setterfield's very enjoyable potboiler THE THIRTEENTH TALE, from child ghosts to incest to secluded mansions to evil twins. (Although JANE EYRE is most often invoked as Setterfield's literary antecedent within the pages, the plot actually owes more to THE WOMAN IN WHITE and especially WUTHERING HEIGHTS.) For good measure, there's also a complex narrative form very in keeping with the Gothic genre and an innocent biographer of ambiguous social standing to interview the greatest novelist in the English language, Vida Winter, on her mysterious upbringing in a Yorkshire manor. There are a lot of lovely touches in this pageturner, from the treatment of the secret languages of twins to complex tricks with the narrative first- and third-persons; there's also some silliness that perhaps a more experienced novelist than Setterfield would have avoided. (How did Vida winter write so many novels given her lateness coming to a literary career, and why must she be the most popular and critically acclaimed writer in the language, given that she has no clear precedent or peer and is of such mysterious origin?) Purely as a page-tuner this more than satisfies, though Setterfield will probably prove (like Charles Palliser before her) to be an even more graceful revistor of the nineteenth-century Gothic/sensation novel form as she publishes more.
0920236162|4.0|My children really love this story and I like the message in it.  It's a twist on classic fairy tales.  The princess uses her mind to outsmart the villan, and then finds out the prince isn't even worth it. <br /> <br />I highly recommend!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This was a great presentation which I originally saw on public television.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered a copy of the DVD for myself and ordered two more as gifts.  The music is wonderful and the setting (Slane Castle) unique.  It's a great program for anyone who's drawn to Ireland and it's music.
0375413405|4.0|A substantial book, with none of the usual colour photos, relying on limited black and white line drawings.  Good range of recipes although some of the favorite French ones are missing, presumed in Vol 2.  Good instructions and general how-to instructions.  Overall a good book of na older style.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Excellent review of what is currently happening to our environment and our world today.  It was extremely scary but also reassuring to know that we can still do something if everyone does their part.
B000LC55F2|5.0|In 2006, so many duplicate movies came out. Two war movies, two film-noir movies, a virtual remake of a 2005 biopic, and two magician movies. The first was \\"The Illusionist\\" a great looking film, with some good stars and a hypnotic lead played by Edward Norton. It also had an actress, Jessica Biel, who isn't respected by many as an actress but ended up delivering a great performance. \\"The Prestige\\" also looks great, has a talent-laden cast, a very talented director, <br />great set design and special effects, and an actress named Scarlett Johansson, who gives a very good performance despite being dissed every time she shows up in a movie. Also, both films have twist endings that a lot of people say are implausible but are never bothered me. \\"The Prestige\\" is directed by Christopher Nolan, the talented director behind Memento, Batman Begins, and Insomnia. It's co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the story that inspired Christopher's script for \\"Memento.\\" The movie stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Johansson, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie, all of whom are talented and underrated actors with the exception of Caine (who is very talented and not underrated at all). Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. As the film opens, Angier is performing a very dangerous trick. Borden, hiding incognito in the audience, manages to sneak backstage and watches as Angier falls through a trap door into a tank filled with water and drowns. Borden is accused of putting the tank there and is convicted of Angier's murder. As Borden sits in jail awaiting his hanging, he begins reading Angier's diary. Angier and Borden had begun as friends and partners in a magic show. Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) was also in the show as the girl who has her wrists tied is dipped into a tank of water as a curtain falls over it. When the curtain is removed, the girl is free. Problem is, Borden ties a faulty knot which results in her death. Now Angier andBorden are bitter enemies, who will stop at nothing to learn each other's secrets and top each other in everything. Then one night Angier catches one of Borden's shows and sees the greatest trick he has ever seen. Desperate to find out the secret, Angier sends his assistant (Johansson) to spy on him. And later, he seeks the help of a scientist (Bowie) to help him design a similar trick that will top Borden's. Caine plays mentors and friends both the men. Both Jackman and Bale are so great in their performances and are really fascinating to watch. Caine, Bowie, and Serkis (as Bowie's assistant) turn in great supporting performances. Johansson and Perabo aren't really considered fine actresses, but both are really good here. Although if I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone criticize Johansson's English accent, I'd be a rich man. A lot of people also criticize the ending, many say it's implausible. Not implausible, just not very likely. But this is a fictional film that frequently reminds you to pay attention. Watching the movie the 2nd time, it makes a lot more sense. \\"The Prestige\\" is one of the best films of 2006 in the sense that it's one of the best-produced films of the year. It's incredibly entertaining, great to look at, and is more likely to appeal to a broader audience than the typical \\"best film of the year\\" selection. I'm not sure how many people will like it as much as me, but I'm sure, at least, that you won't regret watching it. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B000002UB3|5.0|I have this album on vinyl and the cd (for the car!). The only albums that id say come close would have to be \\"The White Album\\" or \\"Sargent Peppers Lonly Hearts Club Band\\". They really give you your moneys worth on this one. The way all the songs connect and intertwine on the second side is awsome. Truly an unforgettable record. Dont get me wrong i love all the Beatles material but this ones the best.
B000M4RG42|5.0|In 2006, Clint Eastwood launched one of his most inspired projects; Two war movies, set during World War II on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" was the first. It received generally good reviews, but had a lukewarm reception from audiences. Then came the 2nd one, the Japanese language \\"Letters from Iwo Jima.\\" That film received great reviews, was embraced by audiences, and was nominated for Best Picture. Having said that, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" definitely falls into the category of underrated. I don't particularly like war movies, but this is a great film and I think it's one of the best films of 2006. The cast is made up of mostly young actors, often called \\"pretty-boys\\" such as Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, and Paul Walker. <br />It also features an Oscar worthy supporting performance by Adam Beach and some great supporting work by Jamie Bell, Barry Pepper, and others. Phillippe plays John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, a Navy Corpsman. Bradford plays Rene Gagon, a runner. Beach plays Ira Hayes, an Indian. These three men go from mere soldiers to American heroes after a picture is taken of them raising the flag. Thrust into the spotlight, the men cope with being considered heroes when they point out that the real heroes are the men lying dead on the island of Iwo Jima. Eastwood uses cinematography with a heightened visual reality that makes the film a wonder to behold. Now, as I said, audiences haven't received this movie in the same way they did say \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" I will say that out of the last few films Eastwood has directed (Mystic River & Million Dollar Baby), this one is the weakest. But it's an inspired project with a great script, terrific cinematography, wonderful performances, and great direction. Beach (a relative newcomer) delivers the best performance in the movie, really getting under the skin of the most troubled of the characters. Phillippe and Bradford are also very good, although hardly Oscar worthy. A lot of people complain thatthe film doesn't make you care enough about the characters and that is partly true. It's certainly not as character-driven as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" but I liked the characters and did care about them so I guess it's just a matter of perspective. Even if you're hesitant to see this film because you don't like war movies or something, I urge you to see it. It's a great film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
B00000J7S8|5.0|Look at my previous review on Diana Krall. Everything is the same and believe me if she has a bomb CD I will be just as honest.
B00009P1O2|5.0|May be 20 years old now but still its a kind of magic, absolutely fantastic, truly the best live grand scale rock concert performance of all time. A time of music, when singers sang out loud and passionately to wonderful soaring melodies not mumbling words into a microphone to a dull repetitive beat. Freddie's marvellous voice carries the band through such Queen classics as \\"One Vision\\" with that fabulous buildup intro, \\"Radio Ga Ga and \\"Hammer to Fall\\" and many others. I can honestly say I enjoyed every track.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|This woman is a singer in the truest sense.  Her diction is perfect and somewhat like my all-time favorite male singer F.A.S. she tells a story and makes you feel up or down depending on your mood. Smooth as silk is her delivery from the jump tunes to the more mellow tunes.  Great buy. A must have for all MUSIC LOVERS (NOT NOISE LOVERS).
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This kid can only get better. What a great collection of songs. \\"New Shoes\\" \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" are your upbeats, \\"These Streets\\" \\"Million Faces\\" \\"Last Request\\" \\"Rewind\\" have amazing lyrics that only could be sung by the voice of P-Nut.

B00003CXC7|3.0|This 1954 film is taken from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. The opening shows apartment houses in Greenwich Village and the people who live there. It is 90F and people are sweating it out. [Crime goes up with the temperature.] L. B. Jeffries is a graying photographer laid up with a broken leg. His apartment overlooks the windows of other apartments, the adults there and in the courtyard. A woman comes over to give him a massage. His girl friend is from Park Avenue. The lighting in the apartments allows viewing into the rooms. Lisa Carol Fremont is quite well-dressed and brings along a fancy take-out meal. Lisa wants to domesticate LBJ, to get him to settle down and quite foreign travel. But LBJ loves his career as a news photographer (can he look into his future?). Lisa is an upper-class lady who is happy in her niche.<br /><br />At night LBJ sees a man from across the courtyard making many trips at night carrying a suitcase. He views the apartment with binoculars, then with a long-lens SLR camera. At times you hear children, but see none. LBJ is more interested in the man across the courtyard than in luscious Lisa, and this upsets Lisa. What happened to Thorwald's wife? [Decomposition would be rapid in the 90F heat.] LBJ seems cranky from being stuck in his room for the past 7 weeks. Lisa says Mrs. Thorwald would not have left her favorite purse and jewelry behind. Lt. Tom Doyle warns against imagining things, he checked out the shipped trunk. [No search warrant needed?] The death of a pet dog is ominous. Only one person didn't come out to look!<br /><br />The amateurs continue to snoop into Thorwald's life. They wonder if something was buried in the back yard. Lisa enters Thorwald's apartment, is found, but the police take her away. LBJ answers the phone without saying \\"hello\\" and talks too much. There is a suspenseful series of heavy footsteps (believable?), then Thorwald enters the room. Can flashbulbs stop a murderer? The police arrive in time.<br /><br />The temperature drops to 70F. We see what happened to the others across the courtyard. The success of this film tells much about popular taste in those times. It is basically a short story that is padded out to make a long story. I would not rate it among the top Hitchcock films. \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" and \\"North by Northwest\\" were better remakes of earlier films. Such snooping about neighbors is a feature of small-town life, unlike the anonymity of a big city. But some could call this concerns of small-town life friendliness or caring. Before radio or TV.
B000001ESF|4.0|I saw UFO with Michael Schenker in early '77 and word was out this off-the-wall band from Canada was the headliner. RUSH. I'd never heard of them before,so you can only imagine how I felt after I walked out after that show. Yeah,Geddy kinda screeches,but he's so original. Very few artist get to make an album of this caliber,and they have followed up grandly with many albums since. All The World's A Stage,compadre's... <br />OWN IT.
1582701709|5.0|It is a book that will help you see and live life in a better way, I love the CD too, I read it at least once a month and I see the CD at least once a week to remember how positive I have to live. Easy to read, and understand, and great book!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Immediately upon listening one can hear the thematic ache of escape from this second release from (The) Arcade Fire.  I think it's a logical progression from Funeral, especially after songs like `Wake Up' and `Rebellion/Lies', though in this album the theme is much more dire.  Fanaticism, religious/political fanaticism especially, as well as commercialism is the infection which the Fire is trying to escape through songs like `Keep the car running', `Intervention' and `Windowsill'.  This infection flows from the communal to the personal, though on the song `No Cars Go' Win Butler's plea to the young and old folks as well, to get going, though admittedly the destination is naturally uncertain, highlighting the tension of paranoia.  There is a definite progression to the songs, whereby escape equals the Fire's spiritual release on the last song `My Body is a Cage'.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have described this release as operatic, which I highly agree with. This is a lyric-driven, crashing record. The orchestration, guitars and horns are subtle, making way for excellent percussion, though not overshadowing the solid background vocals of Regine (and others).  For me, it is a combination of a semi-gothic, indie genre with the old-school rock & roll of the highway variety.  What I mean by this is that as the record progressed, I could swear that Bruce Springsteen was the one singing.  For example, after I listened to the song (`Antichrist Television Blues)' I thought Win Butler's voice was nearly indistinguishable from Springsteen's.  Scary, but captivating, in a good way.  I am certain that every song on this record deserves airplay because each is pure quality.  In addition to the others stated, I really think `Ocean of Noise' and `The Well and the Lighthouse' deserve attention as well.  This is a fantastic album which will probably win numerous awards; Arcade Fire has equaled and surpassed its initial effort.  <br /> <br />
B00005LK95|5.0|Well packaged. Arrived in good condition. <br />Some mild language present and violence directed toward the robot. Otherwise, good children's entertainment. <br />
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Eric Clapton loved George Harrison as a friend, as a musician, as a songwriter, as a guitar player, as a human being.  It definitely shows in this concert DVD.  The concert begins with the Indian music section, and this music is rather impressive.  Ravi Shankar and his daughter were in charge of this part, and I enjoyed it immensely.  The second part is done by Monty Python, which George absolutely loved Monty Python, but I, personally, can NOT stand Monty Python, that's why I give the DVD 4 instead of 5 stars.  So this part I skip.  Then Eric takes the stage with other musicians who were friends of George's.  For me the highlights are Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney.  If you are a George Harrison/Beatle fan this DVD is worth the price.  Even if you're just a music fan this DVD is worth the price.
1932100660|5.0|This is an excellent book. I read it when I was looking into changing my diet, it was shocking and informative. I have had it for about a month and have read it twice. After reading it the first time I reccomended it to my entire family. Especially my dad who uses the Atkins approach to dieting, and my sister who is a junk food vegetarian.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The liner notes provided by Sir George Martin are alone worth the cost of 'Love' - they reveal a friendship between George Harrison and Cirque founder Guy Lalibert&eacute; as the inspiration behind the Cirque-Beatles link-up.  As a result, the songs presented on 'Love' are probably a bit 'George-heavy' when measured vs. the recorded history of the Fab Four as a group.  But who's complaining?  As a George fan, it's nice to see him get rewarded.  He was always the true 'explorer' of the group.<br /><br />That said, the music that stands out on 'Love' is Lennon's.  The urgency of \\"She's So Heavy,\\" \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Glass Onion\\" is incredible.  It was especially great to hear 'Onion' - I hadn't heard that in years.  It's brilliant.  And \\"I Am the Walrus\\" - even 40 years later - simply dazzles as a imaginative and technical tour de force.<br /><br />I've not seen the Cirque show, but hearing 'Love' makes me want to book a special trip to Vegas to see it.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I am sure glad the radio station I was listening to at the time played a song from this CD. My favorite song on the CD is \\"SURE THING\\". The whole CD is good for people who like Jazz.
B000J103PC|3.0|'Devil Wears Prada' ostensibly stars Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Streep upholds her end of the bargain.  Her riff on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue) is an awesome sight to behold.  But Hathaway is outshone not only by Streep, but also by Emily Blunt.  In fact, Blunt - in conjunction with Streep - steals the movie.  She deserved that Golden Globe.  The line that absolutely killed me was:  \\"If you lose Paris for me, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area till I find you.\\"  Great line, perfect delivery.  Meanwhile, Hathaway is put in a bad place: she's forced to act in conjuction with Adrian Grenier, who's playing her boyfriend.  He's just totally 'blah' here, no other way to say it.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill is a fantastic singer. I wish she would put out more CD's. It is a thrill to hear every song she sings on this CD. She is the BOMB!!!!
B000M4RG4C|5.0|This is a patriotic, emotial film.I was mesmerised by the fine acting,especially by Adam Beach's proformance. I am an ex-Marine and this film just made me very proud again.This film tells the true story of the flag raising on Mt Surabachi on Iwo Jima.

1572814349|5.0|I own 6 Tarot decks, and Kat Black's Golden Tarot is definitely my favorite. It is very easy to use, since it's based on the Rider-Waite symbolism, but it is also very beautiful.
006056251X|5.0|The book was great. It arrived promptly and was in great shape.
0156027321|2.0|I enjoyed the book although had to skip over some parts that were too gorry for me.  I'm recomending it to others cautiously.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I laughed and laughed and chuckled through. The movie is a mix between an action movie and a comedy about an action movie, and never takes itself too seriously--either in the action as well as the gore (non too explicit, only implied) and bedroom department. VERY FUNNY, lots of BIG weapons and bigger jokes. Brad and Angelina are fun to watch, witty, and have enough facial expressions and moments of silence to have you feel for the characters (even if they are both trained assassins...) and their being manipulated by others. It is so over the top, that it is just a delight. Actualyl saw this at the theaters when it came out and knew that I'd HAVE to get it on DVD when it was available. Am not sorry I did--I'd seen it several times and don't remember many other action movies I'd enjoyed this much... <br />I recommend it to anyone who likes light sarcasm, not-too-slapsticky-comedy, and good visual effects, cool twists and turns, and moments of jaw hanging action. <br />:-)
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show is one of the best cop shows to everget on television. I have fallowed it since it started now to own the dvd is even more awesome
B00068NVI4|2.0|OK ,ever since Bruford,squire ,anderson etc blew me away with \\"america\\" on a K-TEL compilation I have welcomed anything by the band.This half hearted attempt..first half was enjoyable,but I guess they were so worn out by the end  of the half they had to move to an accoustic set.What a let down.Take a tip guys and watch other bands  ie TOTO do an anniversary concert ala Amsterdam live.
B000FL7B5Q|4.0|I liked the fact that there was an extra 17 seconds of music in the beginning for Prelude. Well, this album, generally, is really good. The first time listening to it all the way through, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />AFI has changed over the years, but I think it's great. I have a wider choice of songs that can fit whatever mood I'm in.<br /><br />As for the style and 'feel' of the album, I think it matches perfectly with the title, Decemberunderground. I don't know if I'm the only one, but it has a wintery and cold feeling.<br /><br />I'd say, buy this album. You'll enjoy it.
B000003TAR|5.0|Knowing what we know now, I can see how easy it would be to indulge in wild speculation on Kurt Cobain's state of mind when he wrote the songs on this album. Personally, I've never viewed Cobain as anything except a phenomenal talent who didn't just write songs from the heart but from the depths of his soul. Following the earth-shifting success of \\"Nevermind\\" it would have been very easy to put together another set of radio/MTV/VH1-friendly songs to please the masses but that is definitely not what he did here. There are a few hints in that direction; \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" for example but in the main, he did what he always did, and wrote and spoke his truth.<br /><br />That said, there can be no doubt that he wasn't exactly a happy bunny in the glow of his commercial success. I'd never heard the song \\"Rape Me\\" for instance before just getting this CD and I found that quite shocking. I'm sure he doesn't mean rape in the literal sense but still. And on \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\", he sings \\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\". That's deep. Even I've been there.<br /><br />I'm no Nirvana expert, just a lover of music. Maybe Cobain was already looking for the exit doors when he wrote this album, maybe he wasn't. I don't know as I wasn't there. What I do believe though is that this album is just as significant as any other Nirvana made in their time. I think it's amazing how you can touch people simply by being real, no matter how disturbing that reality might be. The history of music in the 20th century cannot be called authentic unless it includes Nirvana and I would argue that anyone who calls himself (or herself) a music lover, has an incomplete music collection unless and until they have this and all of Nirvana's music in it. Awesome.
0743201140|5.0|We've been ordering these books for the past five years or so at my work.  We love the book and have all of our new employees take the assessment as it is very accurate.<br /><br />Thanks so much.  Books arrived in great (new) shape!!!
B000KRNCYY|3.0|While I am enjoying this CD, it was a little disappointing that some of the songs from the TV special were omitted, namely Spanish Lady & At The Ceili.  These are traditional Irish songs & should have been included. I do appreciate the lyrics having been included.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I loved all of the tracks.  My favorites are Over and Out, Walking After You, Everlong, but especially the heavy/acoustic version of Best of You.
B000A6T262|4.0|Ten films for approx. $80 was a great price!  Three of the six movies with the original cast provide very enjoyable viewing--II, III, and IV.  The first film was very forgettable--boring plot, slow paced.  If you were a Star Trek series fan, and hadn't seen the \\"regular stars\\" in awhile, it would be mildly entertaining from a \\"reunion\\" aspect. Movies V and VI were adequate, but not especially riveting.  I think my favorite dvd is \\"Star Trek Generations\\" that combines both the old and newer cast members.  All three of the \\"Next Generation\\" dvds are entertaining with very watchable plots.  I would recommend the entire collection to Star Trek fans.  If you are a moderate fan, you might consider individual purchase of the \\"best\\" films in the set (II, III, IV with original cast and all three Next Generation films).
B000002JKA|5.0|When considering music, what questions does one ask one's self?  Are the tunes catchy?  Is it GOOD music?... Who is Dream Theater?  Well, all of these questions may be answered in a positive way when dealing with ANYTHING Dream Theater puts out.  I bought this album because it's one of the few I need to complete my Dream Theater collection.  For it's price you cannot go wrong, and for it's quality you CANNOT go wrong.   <br />Let's talk about the quality of the product...  <br />  <br />What you get: <br />-Mike Portnoy (awarded best progressive rock drummer for 12 staright years AS WELL AS being the youngest drummer inducted into the drummer hall of fame).   <br />-John Petrucci (One of the most saught after guitar clinicians in this country)  <br />-John Myung (Probably one of the most talented Bass players in the world) -Kevin Moore (A keyboardist  of high regard in the world of rock keyboarding)  <br />-James Labrie (A vocalist who has one of the greatest ranges to ever be put on a CD).  <br />  <br />Let's put all of that together and fix it with a late eighties hard rock style.  What you get is quality musicianship unmatched by any other band currently performing today... which is also because these fine gentlemen still perform worldwide.  I give this Album five stars.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|This movie wasn't what I would call a \\"blockbuster hit\\", but it was enjoyable to watch. The special effects are amazing, but the storyline could use some work. The plot jumps around a bit and was hard to follow the first time. This movie is about a group of four families who during the Salem witch hunts, formed a covenant of silence to protects themselves. There was a fifth family orginally, but the family was exhiled from the covenant. The movie mostly takes place in modern times and describes basically how the last remaining member of the fifth family tries to get revenge. Not the best movie I've seen recently, but fun to watch.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Neon Bible is the quintessential example that a band can go in a new direction yet still make great music (are you taking note, bloc party?). However, whomever was in charge of mixing this record needs to be banished from the music industry. A few songs sound just right (no cars go) while others a bit loud (the well and the lighthouse) and the remaining, muddy and  much too low. I would've rated this album 5 stars if it was mixed as well as Funeral and I could hear all the instruments clearly. Listening to this album is like watching an epic movie that was recorded with a personal video camera.    Edit -    I just found out that this album was recorded in a church. So I take back what I said about who mixed it, but I'm still disappointed they didn't record it in a studio.
B000002OTL|5.0|Even if you aren't a big fan of the movie, the Pulp Fiction soundtrack is a must-have for music lovers of all types.  It's especially enjoyable if you like the movie.

B000LPR9ZS|5.0|While not as ground breaking as the first one SAW 3 still delivers some cringe worthy moments.  It's not a scary movie, per se, but still makes you realize how weird some people are.  A must see for anyone who has seen the first two.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|No one else has a voice like Norah Jones - so you won't be disappointed.  I think Come Away with Me is her best.  She is incredibly versatile and this album will sooth away the pressures of the day.  Buy it.
B000I5X81A|1.0|Nothing exciting about this collection of trite old standard tunes.Two artists of this calliber can surely come up with a few good riffs.Entire album survives on the legedary names involved,not on content.Anyone interested in a discounted copy?
1596590440|5.0|The ideas and strategies presented in this book are very powerful.  I've had numerous transitions in my career, some with Fortune 500 companies, and the tools in this book would have been incredibly useful.  No companies I worked for have provided any transition guidance, regardles of size and resources.  Unfortunately it's always been 'sink or swim'. <br /> <br />If you have a job or position change in the offing, this book is a must!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This album gave me the same enjoyment that I felt whenever the Beatles released a new album, and I haven't felt that in a long, long time...George Martin shows how his contributions made the Beatles become more than an exceptionally good rock 'n roll band...he really was the mover that made them the greatest innovators and most influential force in the history of recorded music...some of the songs are presented in a very new and different style, some are just tweaked in a manner that would be obvious only to people who have thoroughly digested the original...some songs have gained much, in my estimation, as a result... <br />the \\"unplugged\\" version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, and I loved the original...I put this disc on without first reading the titles...I don't know why, but I am glad that I did, as I was continually surprised by the turns the music was taking...if you were a victim of Beatlemania, if you just respected the work that they did, if you are a fan of studio wizardry, if you love a good listen, get this, and do it today...
0684135051|5.0|I learned to knit when I was 8 or 9 by reading a very old Red Heart booklet that showed one how to make an afghan, baby sweater, poncho, and a pair of men's socks.  Not one word of how to change them into things I might want to make.  Luckily, at that age, I could practice by making oddly-shaped Barbie blankets and graduate into potholders--none of which needed a pattern.  Looking back--in all honesty I don't think I would have done as well if I were trying to learn from this book.  I think it's too daunting for the novice, and I have not used it when teaching people to knit.  That being said, if you have made a few scarves, you are ready for this book.  As a knitter of 20+ years I can tell you that your life will be easier if you learn the fundamentals of knitting and can learn to branch out from, or edit, patterns, or even create your own.  EZ is the best at breaking down the fundamentals of knitting & removing the rigidity that so many of today's books inspire.  I have never & will never make any of the patterns in this book, but I think it is well worth the money & invaluable reading if you want to become a great knitter.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I have always loved this show and have wanted to buy the collection since it came out. Buying from Amazon was a great purchase - it was cheaper than I could find it anywhere else, even with shipping costs. It arrived quickly and safely. I highly recommend making this purchase - especially if you love the show as much as I do!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was very intrigued by the creative re-use of the Beatles's classic songs. The recent successes of \\"1\\" and reissues of their 40-year-old music proves their durability, and the timeless treasure that their music is. On top of that, the work of George Martin and son in reinvisioning the songs for Cirque du Soleil provides fresh, exciting, fun and imaginative music to enjoy. It is not simply cobbling them together for another compilation album; older fans can probably appreciate the CD better, but even new listeners will enjoy the fanciful blending of tunes. By the way, the notes inside provide a nice peak into the creative process and the bit of serendipity that brought the ever-inventive George Harrison together with the Cirque du Soleil folks. All the more reason to miss George (and to consider George Martin \\"the 5th Beatle\\").
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, I love Firefly. I wasn't sure that it would be as good as Joss Whedon's other TV series, and I am not primarily a sci-fi fan, but I found the mix of western frontier and outerspace extremely interesting. The characters all had such thought out backgrounds, and the Firefly universe seems so realistic, with bits and parts just waiting to come out. Witty, well-written, and awesomely produced, Firefly now ranks as one of my favorite TV series!
0393327655|3.0|This book has a major flaw: it treats religion as an end, not a means. <br />As J. Diamond explains in `Guns, Germs, and Steel', religion is the institutionalization of people's irrational beliefs by the mighty. The ultimate goal of the latter is consolidation and /or enhancement of their power. Power means survival, a vastly longer lifetime. Jack London in his `The People of the Abyss' points at the enormous difference in average lifetime between the wealthy (60 years) and the poor (30 years) in the world's power centre (London) at the beginning of only the last century. <br /> <br />Religion is exploited by the mighty in order to impose their status-quo (`Do as I say, not as I do'). They can murder and steal, not their foot folk (10 commandments), unless the latter are ordered to do so. <br />Everybody can find what he wants in the Holy Scriptures: the best and the worst. I agree with the author that their God is a criminal; also, that `intolerance is intrinsic to every creed' and that `religion is a living spring of violence'. But the author fails to explain: cui bono? <br />`Religion is irrational', indeed, but not for those who institutionalize it. Religion is against progress if that means an undermining of its dogmas (its spiritual power base). <br />The mighty have always supported heavily religious fundamentalism (who created the madrasas in Pakistan?). By imposing children to learn by heart the Holy Scriptures, you create willing foot folk, not atom bomb makers. <br />The first estate (the legal or military or capitalist or political nobility) and the second estate (the clergy and associated groups) have always worked together to control and dominate the third estate. The legal nobility in Europe changed its religion as it changed its shirts (e.g. royal marriages) to consolidate its power base. <br />If some members of the second estate didn't follow the rules they were eliminated (Nobel Prize speech by Harold Pinter). <br /> <br />On the positive side, byhis ardent plea for rationalism and secularization the author seeks to wipe-out the influence of the second estate. By doing so, he attacks directly the first estate by killing its ally and, more importantly, by making the members of the third estate more conscious of their real interests. In other words, making democracy more transparent (no voting orders any more). <br /> <br />This book doesn't address all fundamental issues involved in the exposed problematic. <br />Only a worth-while read. <br />
1881273156|5.0|All I can say is this book could save your relationship. It explains how we all have 5 different love languages and each one of use one as our primary love language. It's amazing.
044661758X|5.0|Connelly comes through with the total package in The Concrete Blonde, as Harry Bosch stars as detective, courtroom defendant and conflicted lover.  Connelly delivers what I look for in a mystery/drama novel: all of the mystery and suspense without the graphic violence, gore and sophomoric writing that are present in many murder mysteries.  Connelly adds good character development to the story, so that not only will readers stay intrigued by the mystery, they will remain interested in the characters.<br /><br />Good ending, too.

0307383415|4.0|First, this very introspective analysis of Barack Obama by Barack Obama gets a little tedious a times and I found myself skipping through some segments, particularly the early days of commmunity activism in Chicago.  That having been said, the rest of the book is very enlightening.  Although Barack was never surrounded by wealth he lived a fairly privileged life, surrounded instead by a loving and supportive extended family.  He attended the best schools and was given the best of opportunities.  And yet he never seemed to find himself, he never seems to have any anchor.  He eventually comes to understand the richness of his life and his background but he still always seems to be adrift.  The conclusion one comes to is that Barack Obama is a very intelligent person, but also very inexperienced with life's more difficult lessons and seemingly indecisive about almost everything.  I would be very concerned about a President Barack Obama, not because he isn't a good or intelligent person - he is, but because he doesn't seem to have strong definitive opinions and he seems inclined to try to please everyone.  As a result he becomes indecisive and stalemated.
B0000013G9|5.0|This album without a doubt was their best.All the members got their shine and in result created a masterpiece. Dallas Austin did his thing in producing their biggest hits. All of their singles did well and other good tracks would be \\"Kick Your Game\\", \\"Lets Do It Again\\", and \\"Sumthin Wicked This Way Comes\\". This album is a classic and if you don't have it pick it up.
0743496728|5.0|It takes nineteen minutes to kill nine students and one teacher and wound 18 students to the extent that they need to be hospitalized.  On March 6 2007, Seventeen year old student Peter Haughton put a pipe bomb he constructed n a student's car as a diversion than went to Sterling High School where he shot a student on the steps, went into the cafeteria wounded and injured a few more, walked the hallways leading to the gym and into the locker room where his killing spree ended when police detective Patrick DuCharme ordered him by gunpoint to drop his weapon.<br /><br />He was carrying two handguns, two shotguns, and some incendiary devices.  Peter tells his lawyer that he killed those who made his life hell since he was in kindergarten when one of the bullies threw his lunchbox out of the school bus window.  Peter has been systematically abused verbally, emotionally and physically for the last twelve years because he was a misfit who didn't fit in.  His only friend Josie, the daughter of Judge Alex Cormier, was the catalyst that drove him over the edge.  His only friend Josie dumped him to be one of the in-crowd and be Matt Reyson's girlfriend.  Matt is the last person that Peter killed.  His defense attorney Jordan McAfee has to plan a defense even though his client was caught on tape killing students and there were hundreds of witnesses who saw him do the shooting.<br /><br />Jodi Picard blends a legal thriller with a family drama and comes up with a fascinating (in a macabre way) work of mainstream fiction.  The author doesn't ever excuse what Peter did but through the use of flashbacks and rotating perspectives shows how years of torture erupted in a killing spree.  Although readers will loathe Peter for what he did, they will understand that it takes a village to raise a child and in the case of Sterling, New Hampshire, everyone, including his own parents, failed in some way.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0374105235|4.0|Ismael Beah is not a great author, but this story is difficult to put down. The story of his life is one that will astonish you, and open your mind to the plight of these children. Some of the events likely are embellished, and the more gruesome atrocities omitted, in my opinion, but it is still a book I would recommend.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|what makes this movie as good or not better than the first is the flash backs in history to how these incredible monsters came to be.  again as with the first movie i took away a star for the use of fire arms in these movies.  it just seems gratuitous considering how formidable vampires and werewolves are.  they don't need guns to kill so there is no logical reason for them to be included in the story line
0739334085|4.0|After reading this I truly respect and admire Obama-- it will be interesting to see if his politics truly follow what he states are his values and goals.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie but i only gave it 4 stars because of the use of guns in it.  werewolves and vampires are formidable enough that they do not need to fight each other with fire arms.  that is my only criticism
B000BNX3B4|4.0|Any movie with Diane Lane is going to be great.  This is a great and lovable romantic comedy.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan since day one. I was at the very first Virgin Tour concert back in 1984 and have since been amazed at her visual representation of her work. She is an artist, whose stage is her canvas. This latest concert however exceeds anything she has done before. This concert is refined, provocative, political, touching and visually stunning. Madonna has always been on the pulse and this is no exception. No one does shows like Madonna. From her dancing, dancers, to costumes, lighting, visuals and awareness of Aids, famine and political inclination, Madonna is always with the current, hip and classy. She also looks amazing. Age has got nothing on her. Her ageless spirit comes through and through.  <br />at 48, she is an inspiration to many (including myself). Check out this show. Its beyond concert, its beautifully <br />produced and filmed. In one word, Flawless!
B000AP04OM|5.0|really a great movie. good quality and everthing.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|I am a Morse fan. from spocks beard on to his solo career, his prolifery and depth is astounding. this is his gutsiest effort to date. no doubt contriversial, however i would challange any listener to actually listen to the record, actually read the lyrics, look at the concept and read Neals personal remarks concerning it before jumping to conclusions. this album talks about the life of Martin Luther. if there is even a hint of catholic bashing or bigitry, it is in the context of history, what actually was happening at the time. His purpose was to transend the pettiness of picking at the old wounds of us church goers and encourage us to stand up and make changes, in the name of Jesus and the truth the He stands for.  <br />musically it is among his best. its got the edge to it that was lacking in testemony, and one. (though for what they were both those albums were brilliant and highly recomened) though the overall tone is darker than his usual work, the album still contains many diverse styles and great melodies. and as always, there is a quality to Neals work that surpasses that is not only refreshing but a pleasure to listen too.
B0009IW88A|4.0|I am a big movie score fan and I enjoyed listening to this score. Some parts were dark and haunting, but track 11 was even more haunting. An excellent buy.

B000GUJYLU|5.0|I found this to be an excellent telling of the Cinderella story.  I like everything that I have seen Drew Barrymore in.
1594200823|5.0|I originally bought this book after seeing a piece in the NYT by this author in which he very succinctly summarized my philosophy when it comes to diet (eat food, mostly plants, not too much).  I would add the word \\"real\\" before food just for emphasis since so much of the stuff people buy is not real food.  Anyway, it turns out this book is not about that question, although there is much to gain along those lines.  Pollan does and excellent job of tracing the origins of four meals (fast food, industrial organic ala Whole Foods, sustainable agriculture meal, and a hunted/gathered meal).  I learned more from this book about what I eat and where it comes from and how it was produced than anything I have touched in the past 30 years - the industrial organic meal was especially revealing.  As a result of this book I have been motivated to make substantial changes in what I buy, who I buy it from and how I buy it.  I highly recommend this book if you are interested in environmental issues, personal health, and/or how our food system works or doesn't work in this country.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|No wonder he concerts are pricy. She puts an extraordinary show together. From the lights, to the choreography, from the customs to the stage, the dancers, her energy, the music, the sound, the song selection. Amazing! Worth owning.
B000J103YI|4.0|I loved the movie and the soundtrack.  A must see and hear.
0790729644|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br />It's gritty and its not afraid to show it. <br /> <br />It's much more realistic than the typical draw in a millisecond and shoot ten guys in the eye at 1000 yards kind of movies. <br /> <br />It showed that not all heros are perfect and that there is weakness in even the strongest of men.  It even showed that even scumbags have a likeable side.  And, it even showed that sometimes a tough guy image is just a cover to hide vunerabilities. <br /> <br />This certainly wasn't Hollywood's typical lets make some big explosions to hide our weak story line kind of movies.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I loved all of the tracks, but especially Jenny Don't be Hasty, Last Request and New Shoes.   <br />The artists unique voice is why I purchased the CD to begin with.  I caught the artist performing New Shoes on a morning program and was hooked.  Looking forward to new releases.  Even though Paolo Nutini is only 20 you would never know listening to his music.  His somewhat raspy voice speaks of a more mature age along with the lyrics.   <br /> <br />Kudos!
B000002B35|5.0|There are never any disappointments with this concert and David Gilmour and others are at their very best.  Happy Birthday to David at 61 on February 7th.  You are truly a genius how you pick that guitar.  I never get tired of watching this final tour concert.  It provides a new thrill every time I have the privilege to watch it.  I have nearly every album ever produced by Pink Floyd, which provides me endless listening enjoyment of their music.      Fans will admit without hesitation that Pink Floyd was well beyond their time in the 70's.  Their experimenting with sounds was second to none with some of the most inovative music that we are every going to hear.  Let's face it, \\"Dark Side\\" of 1973 remains a listening legend to this very day with songs from the cut always coming up on the pop radio stations.      Yes Pink Floyd (and especially David Gilmore), you guys are the best of the best and I only \\"Wish you were here\\" still as a live concert group.  I am thankful for what you have given to us with your music talents and believe Pink Floyd will truly live on to eternity.
B00006JJ51|5.0|NWA was one of the first Gangsta Rap groups to hit it big back in the '80's. Several of their members (Dr. Dre, Easy-Z, etc.) became stars in their own rights as solo acts, and many have followed their treading footsteps into rap acts as well. This album ranks as one of my all-time favorite rap albums, simply because its original and unduplicated. Many of today's artists have fallen in love with sampling, which does nothing to show their own talents, but more in the line of showing respect to previous artists. \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is one of the more recognizable tracks on this album, and many have used the catch-phrase to adopt it to other sayings. \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" is a popular song from this album as well, often played back in the dayz in many youngsters' cars, cruising the busy avenues late at night. Even people who were far from being \\"Gangsta\\" loved the song and felt that it gave them street cred. \\"F**k Tha Police\\" was a mega-hit amongst the rebellious teens enamored with the idea of sticking it to the law enforcement, which received a lot of public criticism. It still ranks as one of the most controversial and memorable rap hits from the dayz. \\"Dopeman\\" was another popular hit with the hard-core rap fans, as it presented listeners with a unique sound of reverse-scratching and timely beat-pauses. With its unique sounds and original lyrics, NWA went on to release several more albums, but none caught more attention and fire than this one. If you're looking to add NWA to your collection, skip the others and add this one. This one, due to its originality, could be even better than their compilation albums... which leaves out some of the more underrated hits (\\"If It Ain't Ruff, etc.).
B00027JYLC|5.0|I finally bought this movie! Everytime it would air on TCM my 15 yr old daughter and I watched. It's not a scary movie, rather fascinating to see actual freaks of nature, not hollywood actors dressed in prosthetics and makeup. Prince Randian rocks. No arms or legs yet he rolls his own cigarettes, strikes a match, lights up and smokes. WOW! Have you ever seen a real pinhead! Not the freak with pins sticking out of his face, but a real pinhead. This movie has 3.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is definitely one of Michael Jackson's defining albums. Although he was a star at an early age, this was the album that put Michael into Iconic status. \\"Billie Jean\\" ranks as one of the most popular singles ever, and is still played in various radio stations. \\"Beat It\\" was another one of his mega-hits, and is one of the most recognizable songs in the past few decades. This was one of the first albums I ever purchased (some 20+ years ago), and is still one that I play once in a while. The underplayed hit, \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", a duet with Paul McCartney, remains a fun song to listen to... and \\"The Lady Of My Life\\" is a smooth ballad that shows the more balladry side of Michael. I'm guessing anyone that is looking to purchase an album has already purchased this one, or has burned copies of this album... but, if you're looking to add this one because you haven't already... No need to wait. I suggest you fork out the few bucks and add this one.
B000065PUE|5.0|It takes a couple of listens to get settled in (like with most good albums), but once you're there, it's a very enjoyable experience.  The Pixies seem to break every rule about song-writing, but that's the beauty of it-- that they are so unique, but still the music is very gripping (notice I didn't say \\"catchy\\").

B00009QG73|5.0|\\"Roxy at the Apollo\\" makes me remember how stunned the band made me WAY back in 1974, right after \\"Country Life\\" was released.  These guys acknowledged what the \\"Lester Bangs character\\" in \\"Almost Famous\\" said about rock and roll being dead.  So Roxy, in effect, re-invented it!  And I do have to say that I am EVER so grateful that Eno didn't deign to tour with the band in '01 - his \\"balding transvestite\\" appearance kind of scared me off the band's first 2 albums (althugh the music was fantastic!) NO problem - here, he's replaced by 2 stone-GORGEOUS Ladies, Lucy Wilkins and Julia Thornton, who handle keyboards/violin (no, Eddie Jobson's not along, either) and percussion.  There's a guy, Colin Good, along on the ride too, and he plays \\"just\\" piano, thus freeing Bryan Ferry to run about the stage and...well, he ain't the greatest \\"front man,\\" but let's not quibble.  I said \\"just,\\" when I mentioned Colin Good, because, I swear, it is sort of trite to say \\"he lives up to his name.\\"  Honestly, he sounds like he's \\"channelling\\" Chopin or Debussy! The original three other (MOST indispensible!) Roxy musicians are here too, Sax player, Andy Mackay, guitarist Phil Manzanera, and even drummer-extraordinare, Paul Thompson, augmented by noted session guitarist, Chris Spedding.  The sound is absolutely LUSH, even though Ferry's not the vocalist he was..\\"last millineum,\\" but the two Lady singers MORE than adequately hide any shortcomings. If you are a Roxy Music fan (a RABID fan, such as I) just ignore the other two Roxy DVD's, and right now, purchase this DVD.  It truly is something to sit down with your kids and enjoy, showing them Rock and Roll's last gasp.  (well...till the Ramones debuted in 1975, but this is a Roxy review...)

B000077VPU|4.0|Freddie, as I've mentioned in my \\"Queen+Paul Rodgers\\" review was/is absolutely irreplaceable.  Although there are several members of bands that I've been in that I wouldn't have missed at ALL, should THEY have taken a dirt bath, Brian May, John Deacon, & Roger Taylor are to be commended for quelling their grief at Freddie's loss.  And, believe me, the magnitude of Freddie's loss is sadly, brazenly displayed here, \\"other\\" performers \\"doing\\" Freddie's part.  In the \\"oh, be serious\\" category, a couple of members of \\"Guns 'n Roses\\" display how poorly they play/sing, and...well, my Mama always told me, \\"if you can't say anything nice about somebody, don't say anything at all\\" - so I won't mention Elton John or George Michael.  And although I have quibbled about David Bowie of late (\\"Americans Scare Me?\\"), he is definitely THE STAR here:  on \\"Under Pressure,\\" he duets with the great Annie Lenox, late of Eurhythmics (I don't know how to spell it and it's a stupid name!), and she is great, although that black makeup around her eyes is very distracting from her beauty.  Then Bowie reminisces about the music scene, late sixties/early seventies, and brings out Ian Hunter & Mick Ronson of Mott The Hoople.  They, with Queen, perform an effervescent \\"All The Young Dudes.\\"  Finally, Hunter leaves, and Bowie/Ronson/Queen perform an almost tender version of \\"Heroes,\\" a song from Bowie's \\"lost in the wilderness days.\\"  But what happens next is so shocking that it - alone - justifies the price of the DVD: Bowie drops to one knee and prays The Lord's Prayer. And I'm grateful that we get to see Mick Ronson (who, by all rights, SHOULD have gotten R Wood's job when Mick Taylor left the Stones in 1974) perform his last concert.  He's suffering from the cancer that would kill him just over a year later, but, by his performance here, you'd never know it.  These are MY interpretations of the Tribute Concert Film.

B0001XAPX8|4.0|Classics Professor Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), exasperated that two students have yet to show up for his class points to their empty seats and ask rhetorically, \\"Do they exist or are they spooks?\\"  He should have chosen his words more carefully because the two absent students are black and Silk is subsequently charged with using racial slurs by the college.<br /><br />Yes, this could definitely happen, although one would expect it to be cleared up once there was an investigation.  However, Coleman Silk gets more than a little uptight.  Something has hit a nerve.  He has enemies.  He doesn't cooperate and in fact resigns in face of the charge.  His wife drops dead, and at the age of 71 Coleman gets involved in a Viagra-hyped love affair with Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), a 34-year-old cleaning woman and high school dropout with a past.<br /><br />Turns out that Coleman too has a past, and that past partially explains why he got so uptight about the racial slur charge.  Seems that Coleman has \\"passed.\\"  Seems that he was \\"colored\\" and didn't want to be colored and so forsook his family and passed into the white world and never looked back.<br /><br />This is from the novel by Philip Roth, who has written many splendid novels.  The adaptation is by Nicholas Meyer who did most of the scripts for the Star Trek movies.  Robert Benton's direction is professional and clear.  Anthony Hopkins is very good as one would expect and Nicole Kidman as a hardtack brunette with worry lines on her face is vividly real as the bitter, but vulnerable Faunia Farley.  Ed Harris plays her also bitter, spaced-out, estranged husband, a twisted Viet Vet with malevolence on his mind.<br /><br />The story is told in a straight-forward way with flashbacks to Coleman's past where we see that he was a welterweight prize fighter for a while and had his heart broken because his very blonde bride-to-be just couldn't stomach the thought of marrying into a Negro family.  Wentworth Miller plays young Coleman and definitely looks and acts the part.  Anna Deavere Smith plays his mother with the kind of dignity you would expect from a woman who raised the son of Pullman porter to become a classics professor at a small New England private college.  Gary Sinise as Coleman's neighbor, Nathan Zuckerman (and Philip Roth perennial), narrates the story from the novel he eventually writes.<br /><br />All in all an interesting movie that recalls an age gone by while at the same time reminding us that the politically correct postmodern world is upon us.<br /><br />See this for Nicole Kidman who is on her way to becoming one of the great stars of the cinema as yet again she shows that she cannot be typecast, and for Anthony Hopkins, one of the more accomplished actors of our time.ays young Coleman and definitely looks and acts the part.

1932100660|5.0|The most comprehensive study I have ever read on nutrition and the co-relation between that which we eat and the ails that afflict us. It was convincing enough to cause a major change in my diet. The result after the first 3 month was most impressive causing me to feel my fittest and strongest. I simply eliminated meat and milk from my diet with occasional fish and cheese as alternative when eating in places where the menu simply does not have good choices. I had no weight problem and did not decrease my new diet. In fact I increased my intake with lots of fruits and vegetables. The end result was a drop of 12 lbs, which I never even knew I had as extra fat. It was the great catalizer for me and my health.
B000002UTY|5.0|Classic Filmore West Rock.  Just as good as as it was on vinyl years ago (too many).  Has the longest recorded version of \\"Who Do You Love\\" that I have ever heard.
B00009XITQ|5.0|A great fun to watch movie and an inexpensive way to visit England and see the sights. Good storyline with good acting, lot of fun.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We are hard core LOST fans and this season is even better then first season!
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Our daughter rented this movie for our 4 year old granddaughter. Our granddaughter fell in love with this movie and Peter Pan so we purchased it from Amazon.She wil watch this movie over all the other movies she has acquired. This movie is a wonderful fun filled movie for children and family. Our granddaughter thinks this is the only Peter Pan movie that is original. She will not watch any other Peter Pan movie or cartoon movie. Highly recommend for all in the family.
1582701709|5.0|This is an amazing source of happiness and power if you choose to have this in your life. The book will cleary and simply explain how to create whatever it is that your heart desires
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Great movie.  Got it for the wife for valentines, and it was great!
B000MQC9H4|3.0|If you are a fan of the typical plot of girl meets boy and falls in love at the end than this movie is for you. Even before it came out in theaters you could tell how the movie was going to end. There is no twist at the end of it and every ends on a high note. I love a good chick flick as much as the next girl but this movie was packed to the rim with sugary sweetness that'll give you a tooth ache. I would say that its down falls [besides the obvious ending] is Cameron Diaz's \\"crying\\" issue. I found it not only annoying but her faces made me feel nausous.<br /><br />Reguardlss of that if you have a teenage daughter and you want to find a film with limted profanity and good ol homesome life stories at the end than this movie is for you. Although it made England seem like its country fantastic, its still a good film.
B00062ZE58|5.0|Although I'm still relatively new to this genre of music, this is my favorite so far.  Beautiful vocals, strong guitar riffs, and orchestral musical style combine to create an epic sound, and thoughtful positive lyrics make it even better.  All the vocals are clean and there are a few epic style ballads, so it is significantly \\"lighter\\" than most of my favorite albumns (like Pantera, NIN, Kittie), but songs like \\"See Who I Am\\" and \\"Stand my Ground\\" are so strong & powerful that I get swept away.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I must say this movie was to me one of the best of the year. I really haven't seen Jack Nicholson in anything good since Batman. But this movie had the drama, action and just overall feel of a new Godfather. The ending was great and just made me not want to leave the theater.
0671015206|5.0|This book is loaded with useful information. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  I have recommended it as a must read to many friends and family members.  If your goal is to be financially secure, this book will help you understand the behaviors that support achieving that goal.  Most fascinating was the role of your spouse and how your parents behaved with money when you were growing up. After reading this book, your perception of people wearing $1,000 watches and driving fancy imported sports cars will drastically change. More often than not, millionaires are not the people you think have money.  Read the book.  You won't be disappointed.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Well... it's a different NIN from the Trent Reznor of Pretty Hate Machine.  He's got a band now.  He's still tortured, angry & masochistic, but now there are other guys there, & the arrangement is, well, maybe more balanced.  I can listen to \\"Physical\\" all day; the grab-your-scrote groove is simply luxurious.  No, I don't have one, but still.  Pretty Hate Machine was revelational, but Broken is simply pleasurable.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Thanks for this hard to find cd.  CD in great shape.
1582701709|4.0|This book came very quickly.  The back paper cover was bend slightly, but otherwise the book was perfect.  Great price also. <br />Thanks.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you liked the old  Night Stalker shows you'll love \\"Supernatural\\" with its better music and less whining, not to mention the brothers are much better looking.  It can run a tiny bit preachy (mostly in the second season) but if you're fighting evil I guess its' easy to get preachy.  All and all, entertaining and great eye and ear candy.
B000000XCK|5.0|Great Cd from a much underrated band of all times.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I like to keep my reviews short.  Buy this CD if you are a George Michael Fan period.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I challenge everyone to see the documentary for themsleves - then make up you own mind about the occurrence of Global Warming. I'm old enough to  remember how we were snowed and manipulated by the tobbaco industry. I'm smart enough to be wary of our government/corporate agencies agenda to not disrupt their little economic gravy train. Let's not be bamboozled again folks! Don't be distracted by the personal attacks on Gore or so-called liberals - afterall the Clinton administration didn't do much for the environment either. It ain't about politics - it's about business profits!<br /><br />Gore explains complex scientific ideas in plain English. He also interweaves personal events that are relevant to the storyline.<br /><br />This documentary is not political. Afterall, Mother Nature doesn't give a damn about your political affiliation.<br /><br />I would recommend this for all adults that care about the environment; the quality of their life; and the future quality of their children lives. Take your kids, then have a good conversation with each other.
B000J103PC|4.0|The Devil Wears Prada is a must for all would be actors, musicians, artists, models, writers, in fact; any creative person who dares to stick his or her head up above the crowd. The film presents the real world of fashion and the harsh world of competition and all that goes with it. <br />Well worth owning. <br />
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This fine recording that was released back in 1987, (and I remember it well!) was a long time coming and it was worth it.  This recording comes to life in full form, thanks to the remastering and all of the b-side recordings that was once very hard to find if you could.  I was thrilled to have found the \\"Rock Of Ages Medley\\" that I heard played on the radio back in 1989.  The Who, Golden Earring, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin are paid tribute to in a way that Def Leppard did very well.  And the song \\"Elected\\" is a song I have heard for the first time and it has a strong 70's feel with that Def Leppard \\"magic\\" that should have been released on one of their albums back in the day.  Anyway, I strongly recommend this 2CD package to all Def Leppard fans and to anyone who is interested in listening to a \\"now\\" classic heavy metal/rock-pop band.  Cheers to the boys from Sheffield, England!
B000LC55F2|5.0|I'm Just gonna say one thing about the film that everyone gets confused about---:SPOILER: <br /> <br />The machine isn't real..it was all an illusion--if you watch the movie closely, you'll figure it out and realize what a magnificant film this is <br /> <br />are you watching closely?
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|My kids and I love this CD. Especially \\"Explosive\\". The kids like to listen to it on the way to school, it gets their blood pumping. I have it on my MP3 running play list.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An Inconvienient Truth was so well documented, that it has affected the way I live my life everyday. I am sharing this video with all my close friends and family. Thank you for offering this wonderful climatic warning. Sincerely, Ron Boehlke
B000KRNCYY|5.0|These beautiful young ladies are as talented as they are lovely! Orla is my favorite! They have the most beautiful way of letting their emotions pour out with every word they sing. Their gorgeous Irish harmonies, their sensual melodies and their flowing passion are what make these amazing young ladies as breath-taking to see as well as hear! Every song they've ever sung has touched the very soul of everyone who listens! They've certainly touched my heart and I hope that whoever listens to these Celtic goddesses will feel the exact same way I do! They can make your heart melt with every song they sing and with every feeling they've created!
B000002L3P|5.0|This is a great bunch of music; very addicting. Play it at least once a day.
B00070Q7VO|2.0|I love the songs \\"Home\\" and \\"Save the last dance\\" but everything else is different. Had I known, I would have just downloaded those two songs. I'd pass on the cd.
B00000099Y|5.0|Before I get into the review, I must say one thing: I'm sick of people dismissing the album because they find it \\"pretentious.\\" It seems people today only use the term to sound like they have a better vocabulary than they actually do, which would actually fit that word! Not just that, some of the interludes are kind of intermissions to show Tool's experimental side that had greatly grown on here. Sure, it's not for everybody, but can't you at least admit that sometimes you just don't enjoy something because you may not get it? That doesn't make it pretentious. <br /> <br />Also, while a couple of interludes do seem ponderous at best, some of the songs are just so good that they make this album five stars. Sure, you know about the five singles maybe, but one track that's EVEN better than those is \\"Pus--t.\\" 11 minutes long, it shows some of Maynard's most impressive vocals; the melody just catches you in. The song doesn't come off as the least bit overlong. I also like how the intro sounds like it'll be something kind of weird or orchestral, but then you start hearing standard Adam Jones riffs. Of course, the structure of \\"Ænema\\" is just breath-taking, and I find it very interesting. It has some really awesome Danny Carey drums too; there's no one quite like him. \\"Third Eye\\" is fourteen minutes long but can be suspenseful, especially when it reaches to its climaxes, descends, then builds back up. Hearing \\"prying open your third eye\\" is something that's going to get stuck in your head. Oh, and there's some really amazing melodies on that track as well. Sometimes the lyrics are kind of ambiguous, yet I have my own interpretations (I somehow think \\"Stinkfist\\" is about sex). There's some more straightforward stuff here, like the structure of said song and the slow-burning \\"H.\\" as well as the sell out lyrics on \\"Hooker.\\" It may seem a bit juvenile for some, but I find the track amazing. Also, some of the interludes are kind of interesting and mildly funny, like the cool futuristic organs on \\"Intermission\\" and the German-spoken recipe on \\"Die Eier Vor Satan.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Ænima\\" is an astounding album. I actually think they've outdone themselves with \\"Lateralus\\" and perhaps I'll even view \\"10,000 Days\\" as such, but this record is totally worth owning. If you like alternative metal, or just rock in itself, you owe it to yourself to give this record a chance. \\"Undertow\\" is also excellent. <br /> <br />Worth the money.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Great CD,listening to it I relive the whole play in my mind.Enjoy every song.
6305428050|5.0|Funny, brave, adventures of 80's kids from the suburbs was the intention of this movie, but the key element here is the music.<br /><br />This is your only chance to see one of the greatest blues legends in a movie...namely Albert Collins.  If you love and live the blues, then the movie is about the scene with \\"Babysitting Blues\\".  Albert Collins (aka The Iceman, aka The Master of the Telecaster) is worth the price of the DVD.  Along with him you get the music of Koko Taylor's \\"Evil\\", Edwin Starr's \\"Twenty-five Miles\\", Muddy Waters, Southside Johnny, the Crystals and more.<br /><br />Actually (for the Canadian reviewer) the movie is about overcoming racism.
B000002U3P|5.0|Its that simple. If there's ever been a soundtrack that goes so good with the movie this is one of them. Now you can relive Trainspotting any time.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|The music is what inspired me to get the movie.  It's the kind of movie that you want to see around the holidays (or anytime, really).  It gets you in the Christmas mood.  A happy movie.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Spectacular movie!<br /><br />I am very much a fan of Anne Rice's books, particularly the Vampire Chronicles. Though the movie does not quite match parts of the story, it does very well to compensate for parts left out. I never expect a movie based on a  book to be the same. The choice of actors for the parts are absolutely wonderful. Even if you are not a fan of either Cruise or Pitt, their normal personas are completely clouded with Rice's characters.<br /><br />Again, well worth the watch.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|I just happend to turn on the TV one saturday afternoon and saw this. What more can I say?  I bought it shortly after and have seen multiple times since.  I recomend it for any one who likes 80s teen flicks. Now I don't exactly agree with the whole teen rebellion thing(I find stuff like that really stupid), but this movie is good for other reasons.  Its loaded with memeroble lines. For example-\\"I'm sorry to hear that, now come over here and pick me up!\\" My best friend and me quote that constantly. In fact we have actualy called each other asking for rides using lines from that one scene. I don't think theres ever been a teen flick as much fun as this one. The breakfast club, though more well known, is second to this among John Hughes' films.
B000000Y59|5.0|The artistic greatness of Bill Evans resides in his spelling treatment of the piano. He not only plays the keyboard; he plays with the instrument and certainly he would seem to establish with it a sort of spiritual connection making of it an extension this inner thoughts and moods.<br /><br />That's why there have been so many versions about his compositions and however, just a few have been able to perform and express with such kind of feeling and inspiration the core of his compositions.<br /><br />This is at least to my view, the main reason I recognize in him the essence of the genius. As Midas King all what he played it was pure gold.
1569242739|5.0|These recipes are soooooooooo good.  All of my friends are not vegan and when I gave a cupcake to them they even loved it.  One even asked for the recipe (which I of course didn't give- it can be my little secret).  They don't taste like vegan and \\"they are better than regular cupcakes\\", one of my friends said.
B00007E8V4|5.0|this album is one of my favorite albums from system of a down!!!! The only thng is you have to get the unedited version for it to have the full impact!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I heard the news about this movie been filmed, I couldn't believe it. Then, when I saw the trailer online, I cried in emotion. I have seen this movie (especially the last 30 minutes) everyday for two months and 6 days, and everytime my eyes are covered in tears. A honorable ending for one the most beloved characters in movie history. Thank you Sly for a beautiful, touching and nostalgic movie!!! It worth the wait.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Clint Eastwood's adaption of James Bradley's best selling story of the men who raised the flag on Mt Suribachi is almost as good as the book.  Told through flashbacks, the movie covers the events leading up to, and the bond tour following the battle for Iwo Jima. <br />The movie is very well done, portraying the men as reluctant celebrities scarred by their experiences.  Three of the six men who appeared in the classic photo survived the battle.  They were whisked back to the states and exploited on a tour to sell war bonds.  The battle scenes are intense and graphic, and Eastwood has done a great job of recreating the atmosphere of 1945 America. <br />However, while the book gave life stories of all six of the flag raisers, as well as another marine who was mistakenly identified as having been in the photo, the movie does not.  If you have not read the book, you may not even recognize all of the characters.  We learn nothing of their backgrounds or their personalities.  The book also goes into much greater detail on the relationship of \\"Doc\\" Bradley and a young marine known as \\"Iggy\\" and the impact of that relationship on Bradley for the rest of his life.  This is gone over superficially in the film. <br />The other complaint that I have is that the DVD has no extras other than a trailer for the companion film LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA.  I suppose there will be a deluxe set of both movies when LFIJ comes to DVD and that we will have to wait until then for any extra features.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Super movie.  Great inspirational to all health care providers.  Highly recommended!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this CD. Every song is unique and never boring. It is great to listen to after a long stressful day because it helps you unwind.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|The movie is great but why do they have to advertise it on the cover? What's with the big blue strips blocking the rest of the beautiful poster and the stupid melodramatic \\"the timeless story blah blah blah?\\" What is this, a Disney fairytale? Who designs this? It ruins the whole experience for me. My DVDs are like books. Not only is the content important but the cover should be sexy too. Or are they more like lovers?? <br /> <br />Either way, if it's such a \\"special edition,\\" why don't they do something classy and artful like the Criterion Collection does instead of making it look like an 1980's self-help book from WalMart. <br /> <br />SO MANY movies get the \\"DVD COVER DESIGN\\" shaft and you have to wonder why anyone passes on these?
B000INAXGU|5.0|With the exception of the people who bought \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" when \\"Virtual Insanity\\" became a mainstream hit, there are very few, \\"Middle-of-the-road\\" Jamiroquoi fans. This means that if you're like myself, you probably already own all of their albums. Ergo, you probably already have many or all of the songs on this album. Let me say this however, having all the hits all in one place, on one disc, and even further, remixed is in of itself the reason to buy this album. They also included (I think) three new or previously unreleased tracks. The crappy thing about some 'Greatest Hits' collections is that groups ususally include songs that \\"they felt\\" should have been greatest hits, even though they weren't. This album shins that approach. Rather, Jay Kay (lead) demonstrates his connection to his audience by choosing the RIGHT songs for this collection. It rocks.<br /><br />What's also crazy is that I really can't believe that I've been listening to Jamiroquai for 14 years. Have I gotten that old?<br /><br />5 Star rating = I promise you will enjoy this product. No regrets.
0440229081|4.0|Michael and his family have just moved to a new home, and Michael is not happy about it at all.  The man who lived here before them was very old and he died in this house.  It is not well maintained, and includes a falling-down garage.  Michael is far away from his school and his friends who go there.  The other problem in Michael's life is his baby sister.  She was born too early and is very sick.  His mother and father worry that the baby might die, and she is in and out of the hospital as the doctors desperately try to make her strong enough to survive. <br /> <br />One day Michael sneaks away and enters the dangerous garage--a place his parents instructed him not to go.  But Michael is not alone in the garage.  There is someone, or something, there.  His raspy voice seems human, but how could a human have lived in the garage for so long without moving?  Michael and his new friend next door, Mina, make friends with this strange creature.  When they bring it out one night to move it to a safer place, they realize something truly amazing about it. <br /> <br />I loved the slightly supernatural element in this book.  Everything is very realistic except for the creature in the garage.  I really liked the character of Mina; she is a good balance for Michael. <br /> <br />The tone of this book is a bit dark, especially at the beginning, but it worked for the story.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|As an avid Pink Floyd fan, I was speechless the first time I saw Pulse.  The production must have cost in excess of a million dollars, the show was filled with the best - ever changing - images and sounds.  If a Pink Floyd fan doesn't have this in their collection they are truely missing out.  This is a great show for a lights out volume up experience that will BLOW THE MIND AND SENSES!
B00005JOCS|5.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is an absolutely outstanding adaptation of the stage production.  Jennifer Hudson absolutely shines.  This is the first movie I have seen in many, many years where an audience was moved to cheer and applaud. During Jennifer's rendition of \\"I am Telling You\\", the audience responded as if we were at a live concert.  \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a treat and an absolute delight.  The acting, the singing, the musical score and the costumes are all award-winning calabre.  I congratulate a great cast on their wonderful performance.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Buchheim's book is a very good, but difficult reading. In the movie, however, this hindrance is overcome and the viewer is simply absorbed into the terrible life of the submarine's crew. The movie is also an excellent description of the behaviour and acting of the captain, being anti-nazi, but fully aware of his duty which is understood in strictly \\"German\\" terms.
0553382179|5.0|should be \\"sink reflections\\". If you own only one 'home' book, this should be it, bar none. Your sink is a reflection of your life, and if you clean up your sink, the rest will follow. <br /> <br />
B000A158TM|5.0|CLASSIC. <br /> If you didn't know about it you are probably dissapointed with all of  the anime you've seen,with the exception of the Basilisk series.  <br /> <br />From a teen to an older person and everyone in between won't be able to deny the genius of this movie. <br /> <br />A must have for any type of DVD collection. College students, or anyone with roommates... lock this one away.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Man, can I tell you that I just love this show.  Most people haven't heard of it, but once you watch it, you'll love it.  It connects perfectly with people who are looking for love, who just lost love, and those who don't care to find love and just want to party.  Each character is a perfect portrayal of being at a different stage of relationships in their life.  My favorite is Barney who honestly makes the show go over the top.  He says everything and does everything that only everybody else thinks of but never says or does.  Every minute of Barney on the screen will have you ROTFLOL :)  It's always a party.
0975991477|5.0|Not having studied Biology at school, or since, I was  fascinated by the clarity of explanation of cellular function.  Bill Bryson's book 'A short history of nearly everything' touched on the area also. <br /> <br />The explanation of the process of 'environmental' awareness, apparently increasingly so in multicellular organisms, leads to thoughts on how 'thoughts' themselves are created.  In addition, what senses do we have apart from the standard ones, e.g. hearing, taste?  Or are so called 'wacky senses' like 'telepathy' real but just unused in most of us (until our scientific fraternity find a means to accurately and repeatably create/measure them). <br /> <br />Thoroughly enjoyable read, well presented. <br /> <br />
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|What can I say? This album stands up to multiple listenings. It came out around the time one of my sons was born, and now that he is grown,  he enjoys listening to it almost as much as I do! It is ageless and universal.<br /><br />I don't think I can add anything profound to all of the accolades this album has received over the years, but I can say that I just don't get tired of listening to it. Ever. It is definitely a \\"desert island album.\\" It is absolutely brilliant, probably as close to perfection as one can get.
6304779356|5.0|I loved this movie when it first was released and still enjoy it to this day ! A true classic for everyone.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|Siempre shows Il Divo getting better and better. Once again, however, with only ten songs - including several repeats from the previous CDs - it is really good but leaves you wanting more. I think it is time for longer CDs and newer songs by some of those great Swedish and Italian composers. Nevertheless, Il Divo has attracted a number of 'crossover' soloists, none of which can compete for voices, arrangements, looks or charm. We fans need to find a way to complain to Simon about producing short CDs.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I read most of the top reviewers listed and was wondering what the hell do they go to the movies for.Most of them centered their attention on environmental issues instead of watching a Great little movie which by the way gross $195 Million and as of this writing the #11 Top Animation movie of all time. <br />One has to ask themselves what do you go to the movies for? Hopeing to be \\"Entertained\\" and this movie did just that, and to ALL ages not just for the youngsters. I'm over 50 years old and quite frankly I've seen the movie at least a dozen times, why? the animation is FANTASTIC and I, like over 95% of the audience in my area were very much entertained.Every time I went to the movies when it was airing I went in to see who were watching and was quite stunned to find the older generation more so than the youngsters and this is when they [kids]were out of school and could go. <br />The little kids that went to see this movie,went to be entertained and NOT looking to find fault or in this case environmental issues. Different forum and place for that.If we all go to the movies looking to find fault then stay at home because I gurantee that ALL movies will have some issues effecting our lives in it in some form or another. <br />Go to the movies first to be ENTERTAINED and if the writers and all the people who works on a movie do their job right then you've gotten your $$$ worth and will eventually buy the DVD's to be ENTERTAINED over and over again. <br />See it...Buy it...ENJOY it, for what it was made for in the first place...to ENTERTAIN us.
1582701709|1.0|More warmed over hype.  Unfortunately shrouded in the cloak of science.  Astonishingly the author is claming a scientific law governs our experiences.  This is the language of Nomological science, that is to say a universal law of nature underlies the theory of The Secret. Well, \\"laws\\" of nature require measurable occurences which when configured in a particular mathematical relationship will predict future outcomes quantitatively.  Such as : measurable mass times measurable acceleration always generates in nature a specific force than can be confirmed through measurement.  What is the Scientific Law in this book!? Attraction? What is the mathematical model they are suggesting exists. And if the author is not speaking of Nomological truth (which they imply consistently that she is) but merely principles that affect how people feel and behave, what is the evidence for this?  Testimonials are not proof.  Sugar pills can reliably change who people feel about and experience their lives.  Placebo and suggestion are exceedingly powerful and \\"scientifically\\" proven to be so.  There must be objective evidence that The Secret does anything. If you claim a scientific method you must be willing to subject your hypothesis to scientifc scrutiny.  <br /> Now it has been shown that changing one's thinking can change how one feels to some extent. And Buddism for instance has long adhered to principles like this.   But to generalize the principle to all experiences in life and claim scientific rigor is inexcusable and dangerous.   <br />And what is it that is being advocated?  That we should wish for our every Epicurian desire be met.  Through most of human history there was a word for this - Sin.  And most of us know people who seem to have everything and yet are not happy.  Getting \\"what we want\\" often is not what leads to a good life.   <br /> <br />Also always be sure to check out carefully the credentials and training of those whom you choose to follow.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The DVD rates a 5-star easily.  Being able to see the entire concert was awesome.  I had DVRed the London show when it was on the Bravo channel but I knew that it was a very censored version.  A censored Madonna is not quite as much fun to watch so I was extremely happy to see this set for sale.   <br /> <br />Regarding the actual concert: every piece and person put into the show was phenomenal.  I personally think it's the best show she has ever done.  It was the perfect mix of new music and old and, in pure Madonna form, the music track of the old songs were brightened by alternate beats and harmonies - my favorites: Like a Virgin and Erotica. <br /> <br />The only thing that could have improved this purchase was for the producer to have placed ALL of the songs from the concert onto CD.  I knew that when I bought the set so I wasn't surprised.
074356619X|5.0|I have owned The Secret on DVD for several months.  The CD set is a great adjunct.  It is amazing how much one's outlook changes after listening to The Secret rather than some airhead on talk radio (not you Rush).
B000M4RG42|4.0|This movie was phenomenal.  Wonderful characters, amazing cinematography.  Brilliant.  Job Well done by young talented actors, another directoral masterpiece by Clint Easthood.  Highly recommend this film. <br />
B00000DR8R|5.0|I first bought \\"Rattlesnakes\\" when it was released in 1984 and immediately loved it for its catchy songs and intelligent lyrics.  While Morrissey was introducing his gloomy following to Oscar Wilde, Lloyd Cole had his listeners finding information about Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Simone DeBouvoir, Grace Kelly, Greta Garbo and Eva Marie Saint.  This album will make you smart if you care to understand all the literary and cultural references.  What exactly is a \\"Grace Kelly car\\"?  How do you know if you're \\"looking like a friend of Truman Capote/Looking exactly like you are.\\"?  Lloyd Cole lyrics are smart, funny, clever and deep.  It is not surprising then that Tori Amos covered the song \\"Rattlesnakes\\" on her \\"Strange Little Girls\\" album or that Camera Obscura wrote the song \\"Lloyd, I'm Ready To Be Heartbroken\\" in response to the closing track \\"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?\\"  There is not a bad song on this album.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This 2 disc edition is well worth it, do not cheat yourself by getting the standard DVD (regardless this is an amazing movie and will not dissapoint).  This 2 disc collectors edition is filled with extra features and insider information about the movie.
B000JSI7AI|4.0|the film is a fiver, but this collector's edition didn't quite cut the mustard with me. The package is nice, and the cards (one a replica of the one Jack sent to Ennis!) are great, but I'm mainly interested in the bonus material, and that was pretty mediocre. A lot of comments from people involved in the film, or film people in general, but especially the exclusive 'reactions-to-the-film' segment should have probed deeper into the reactions of the average American movie-goer, both good and bad. Since the film caused controversy it would have been fitting to address it properly to show that many movie-goers actually changed their minds about homosexuality after seeing the film, and that the film transgressed this theme.   The overall impression of the bonus material is that of an internal affair, which is a pity since this film is very much addressed to the public. That's its strength.   An interview with writer Annie Proulx wouldn't have gone amiss either.
B000K7V6Y2|5.0|I'm a big Bloc Party fan and couldn't wait for there new CD. Well worth the wait. The Import CD is worth the extra price if you want the bonus DVD with 2 videos and a making of the album video. Also the red plastic case is a nice touch too.
B000001EUL|5.0|There is a reason hair-metal came to be and this one of the main ones. It's both a blessing and a curse. This album and it's immediate follow-ups were so  good that it couldn't be stopped. Other bands liked it and began to imitate it, soon it became mainstream and every one was doing it...just not as well. <br /> <br />The main difference between this and-hair metal is that this was the source. Scorpions created great songs with fast guitars, ripping solos, good arrangements and great production. By the time Poison, Warrant, Ratt and other posers came along they neutered and formulised it. Gone was the edge and originality. Unfortunately, the Scorpions, too, sold out and went commercial around Love at First Sting and, well, too bad. At least we have this. <br /> <br />There is not one clunker on the album. The sequencing is great and the songs are all different. Another Piece of Meat and Can't Get Enough are balls-out rockers. Lovin' You Sunday Morning and Lovedrive are also pretty heavy and their original power ballads Always Somewhere and Holiday created the formula that so many other bands made careers of ripping off. <br /> <br />I'll always have an appreciation for the heavy bands of the late 70s and the early (pre-84) 80s. They did it right and it's a shame that by the time metal became mainstream the great ones had to sell out or become irrelevant. The other worthwhile albums by Scorpions are Animal Magnetism and Blackout. Great, but in a different vein is Tokyo Tapes. <br />
0375703764|5.0|Fantastic book. I've never read a book like it, and I don't mean soley in terms of content, but presentation as well. You should be prepared to become engrossed in this book like very few others.
0596009208|5.0|I looked at a lot of java books at amazon and based on the reviews I picked this one.  I was very happy with my choice.  It covers a lot of material and is a very easy to read.  I think based on my experiences with this book I will try other head first books.
B000H305U0|5.0|Wasn't a huge fan of Justin's pop career but he seems to have taken a new direction into the R&B and hip-hop genres - and I like it.  <br /> <br />In this album he seems to have unearthed some successful beats and melodies which peak at points in the songs, most of which are very good. There is the subtle feel that this is a new style for him but judging by it's success promises a brighter future if he keeps it up. <br /> <br />Well worth it for the radio hits and more so for the other songs as well. Plenty to make it a good buy regardless of your feelings for his pop-past.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|OMG wow the added scenes to each movie was totally worth the price paid.  I am glad I waited for the price drop but would have been just as pleased when the 4-pack first came out.  Ripley does her thing the way we all like it.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is the best book I have read in many years.  Had it not been for the fact that I must work to earn a living and sleep and eat to work, I would have read it in one sitting. I could not put it down. When I was away from it I longed for it. I have now finished it and I miss it. You must read it. I don't like to give any hints of plots, but this book hooks you in the first paragraph and latches on. This is a book for people who love books and reading.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|A lot of great Steely Dan music but this \\"Definitive Collection\\" is not <br />very definitive when it's missing a great song like Pretzel Logic.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is an old favorite.  True, the story itself is nothing new.  Sheriff in trouble, out numbered and out gunned.  He has only some misfits to back his play.  Given that, what sets this apart from many other westerns is the cast and script.   Take John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson and you have the makings of an all star entertainment.  While there is plenty of action, the story concentrates on these characters and how they handle the situation they are in.  Look for plenty of back up characters like Claude Akins or Ward Bond.  This is plain good movie making. Watch this show.
1932100660|5.0|RECENTLY I HAD A DOUBLE STENT PUT IN ONE CORONARY ARTERY. I HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING ANGINA AND HAD GONE TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE I HAD  A CORONARY EVENT REQUIRING THE PADDLE SHOCK EMERGENCY TREATMENT. I WAS HOPITALIZED FOR A WEEK THEN SENT HOME. VERY SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING HOME, PERHAPS A WEEK, I STARTED TO HAVE THE ANGINA PAINS ONCE AGAIN. <br /> <br />IT WAS THEN I DISCOVERED  'THE CHINA STUDY \\" ON LINE AND IMMEDIATELY ORDERED IT. AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT I DEVOURED THE INFORMATION GIVEN WITHIN AND PUT IT TO PRACTICE. <br /> <br />ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. TWO OR THREE DAYS, THE ANGINA DISAPPEARED AND HASN'T RETURNED. I'M TRULY A BELIEVER, AND I THINK I NOW HAVE A MORE PROBABLE FUTURE. THIS HELP CAME OUT OF A BOOK WHICH IS NOW A CLASSIC. <br /> <br />I NEVER GOT INFORMATION LIKE THIS IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. THERE ANGIOPLASTY AND BYPASS SURGERY WERE THE THE TREATMENTS OF CHOICE. BIG,BIG DOLLAR TREATMENTS!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Thought I loved the first album, but love this one even more. I'm just never disappointed purchasing any Celtic Woman music.  I'm hooked!
B000J103PC|5.0|I didn't want the widescreen edition but the seller was happy to refund my order. Very nice and helpful
0060254920|5.0|This was the first book I read to my first child 36 years ago, & it was one of the first I read to my grandchildren in this century.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Its not too bad. The creature effects on Grendel could've been a little tighter; and the longhouses could've been more authentic. In my opinion, there wasn't enough musical score. I'm not usually a fan of \\"a lot\\" of music in a movie, but hero-introductions, suspence-building moments, obligatory love scenes, and struggles need it. <br />     On the lighter side, the cast carried the movie well. It wasn't the type of B-movie that was filled with missed cues and bad delivery. Some of the views were beautiful. It also took a different route with Grendel and Grendel's Mother than I had not imagined from the original tale. Also, the movie showed Hrothgar in a whole different light.
0393317552|4.0|If you like a really wide look at human culture all the way back to the spread of humans from the origin of the human species, this is fascinating. Why did Western Europeans and Americans become so powerful and rich? Are they inherently smarter? He says of course not, there were other factors like climate and food availability and so on in other parts of the world that caused this. I don't agree with the left-liberal slant of this author sometimes, and don't agree with some of his conclusions and assumptions either. But without a doubt he makes you think and that's what's fun.  He covers the gradual spread of humans all over the earth--except the migrations of the Jews, for some completely unknown reason.  Yet he's a biologist, not an anthropologist or paleontologist or sociologist.  Anyway, anything by this author is really, really good, even if you don't agree with him.  I'd give his book five stars if he hadn't omitted the story of the spread of the Jews and if his viewpoint were a little less biased toward the left, or even if he would state his biases up front as most very good scientists or historians do.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|I had expected to be able to go to a menu and play any one episode that I wanted on a disc, but I was not able to do so.  I could see a 30 second preview of any episode, but if I wanted to view the second episode or later ones, then I had to fast-forward through the disc.  That seems a little ridiculous, especially for such a large purchase (the whole series).  Each disc should contain a menu allowing the viewer to choose any one episode and go directly to it.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I grew up on GREASE.  I loved it then and love it now.  It was great to share with my family again.  FILL YOUR HOME WITH THE MUSIC...If you loved it then, you'll still love it now! <br /> <br />**NO leather jacket case came with my copy - but didn't want it anyhow.
0060752610|5.0|What are you waiting for, buy the book and rock your world. I am reminded of the old joke we use to tell in Wall Street when I was with Lehman Brothers back in the 1970's. It's the story about the guy who is given permission to remove as much gold as he can from Fort Knox but he only has a morning, and must work alone. He's given a truck and a wagon to haul the gold with. He gets in the truck and heads the wrong way. \\"Where are you going, you are going the wrong way, you only have a morning to work with, and the clock has started.\\" His answer is classic, \\"I am going to get breakfast first.\\"<br /><br />The point is very simple. People are reading Wall Street Journals, getting MBA's, and watching the talking heads on television. I've got portfolio managers who would kill for an edge, and every one of them, all of them are missing the point. It's all there, all the knowledge, all the wisdom you need to become a MASTER in the financial markets. You simply have to know what to read, and you begin by reading THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR.<br /><br />At Harvard we use to say they divided the building up into two lecture halls tonight. The door at the first hall has a sign that says LECTURE ON GOD, on it. The door of the second lecture hall has a sign that says GOD on it. Everybody wanted to go to the lecture. Listen up folks, this book THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR, it's the real thing. This is not Madison Avenue sitting down with a author that they pulled out of Hollywood, and said let's put some interesting witticisms into a book on investing, dress it up, market it smart, and make a couple of bucks.<br /><br />This is a book by a man with an Einstein type IQ, whose natural abilities were in the financial arena, who has the uncanny skill sets to explain himself in beautiful prose that just about all the rest of us can understand. If you want to be in the stock market, and you haven't read Benjamin Graham, it's like being in a gunfight in the old west, and not having a gun. You got to do the basics, and very few people do.<br /><br />Wasn't it Woody Allen who said, \\"80% of making it is just showing up?\\" If you want to be in the market, and outperform everybody else wanting the same thing, than you can't do the same things they do, or you will get the same results, and that means mediocrity. You are in the race for Alpha, the extraordinary return. To win the race, you need an EDGE. Now how many people do you think are doing the basics? The answer is about as close to zero as you can get.<br /><br />Investors, just like people want instant gratification with a minimum of effort, energy, and pain, and that's not how smart, astute investing works. You need to read books like this one not once, but over and over again, until it becomes part of you, until emotionally its wisdom becomes imprinted in your brain. You then need to start implementing it. See what kinds of results you are getting, and then make the adjustments necessary to make its wisdom YOUR OWN.<br /><br />In other words, you need to OWN THE KNOWLEDGTE THAT'S IN THIS BOOK. Can it be done? Yes, but not easily. Benjamin Graham spent a lifetime figuring this stuff out. He didn't hit the ski slopes at Sun Valley. He wasn't sitting by the pool at Bungalow 5, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. He was grinding out the \\"Margin of Safety\\" concept, and testing it against the real world, did it work, and did it falter? Was it a 100 percent reliable.<br /><br />I have heard Warren Buffett his most famous, but not only successful disciple tell the story of how the students in Graham's class room at Columbia would challenge the old man. Graham would used those challenges to make his thinking better, sharper, more real, and in so doing he became a better investor.<br /><br />You want to know about Mr. Market, and why just about every investor ignores this theory, which is the equivalent of the Quantum Theory in Physics. You need to read the book. In Chapter 11, he teaches you how to value a business, his way. The teachers at Harvard, Wharton, Ross School, and others have nothing on Ben Graham. We are all students at his feet.<br /><br />In my lifetime, I have worked with some of the smartest people on the planet. My direct mentor is the richest man on Wall Street, and I have known just about every major national and international investor worth his salt in the world in my generation. Every one of them could quote Benjamin Graham, meanwhile the want-to-bees, were out getting fitted for suits, after having lunch at the 21 Club.<br /><br />Absorb some wisdom from someone who has been there. Read this book; learn about the \\"Circle of Competence\\", and the overwhelming importance of investor psychology. It is amazing that in this book several generations old, Ben is dealing with the same issues confronting us today, director independence, broker conflicts, frequent trading and the lack of performance it creates, management teams out of control, and dealing in a self-serving manner.<br /><br />Each edition of this book is unique in its own way, with different world-class players commenting along side the text. I happen to like this edition because John Bogle (read his books also) is a man who I respect enormously who has impacted the investing world. The revised edition with Warren Buffett commenting is wonderful also. You simply can not go wrong touching anything that has been written by Benjamin Graham. Good luck.<br /><br />Richard Stoyeck<br />[...]oss School, and others have nothing on Ben Graham. We are all students at his feet.

B000002GVO|5.0|The title says it all.  I scrouged $5 of pocket money from my parents in 1977 to buy the vinyl LP and it stayed on my turntable for about a year (only occasionally to be replaced for a breif moment by other greats such as Dark Side of the Moon).  This is the Eagles at their absolute peak and not a throwaway track on the album.  30 years later it is on my iPod. The title track is haunting and the ripping guitar solo at the end is a simply brilliant guitar interplay between two of the most brilliant under-rated and genius rock guitarists about, Joe Walsh and Don Felder.  The album is a nice blend of hard ripping rock (Felder's solo on Victim of Love is simply \\"wicked\\" - supposedly done \\"live in the studio\\" with no overdubs) and lovely melodic softer tunes (I really like Randy Meisner's often passed over \\"Try and Love Again\\"). Only bands of the quality of the Eagles can do this variety on one album and pull it off.  The guitars are alternatively, haunting (like Henley's vocals), melodic (like G.Frey) and hard edged. Lyics are bitingly cynical and still relevant today... how many people still say the famous line \\"...you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave?\\"  Sadly they never could rise above this peak and their more recent offerings are nowhere as good as this. In particular, the departure of Don Felder in 2001 (he wrote all the music to Hotel California's title track) has rendered their latest offering (the Long Road out of Eden) a terribly bland and overproduced yawn...  If you like this classic you will also like Joe Walsh's \\"You Can't Argue with a Sick Mind\\" CD - after all it featured most of the Eagles as well as Joe Vitale and Jay Ferguson.  Pity they never really released any decent DVD footage from this era - the boys might have been stoned on cocaine for most of the shows (see Don Felder's book \\"Heaven & Hell\\") but they could still put on a decent live performance back then.
020530902X|5.0|A must in a world where language has fallen to the lowest common denominatior.
0671027573|5.0|Mr Perfect is laugh out loud funny with a who done it plot, which is a standard Howard style. Main character Jaine Bright has attitude and issues with her house guest cat Boo Boo, and the hunk next door who just happens to be a cop, and of course there is a killer on the loose. The story is intense and funny. This is a great read for mystery, humor and roamnce.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Well I do not have to write to much since the other reviews say it all. For those who followed Diana's death and never understood what was going on with THE QUEEN, this is a must see movie. Helen deserved the Oscar, what a performance!!
B00027JYLC|5.0|Don't be put off by the claims of exploitation that had this film banned for many years, and make it still unavailable in the UK. A little research will show that the so-called expolited individuals were heavily involved in the production of the film, and this shows in the content. There is no film like it. It is both a revenge thriller, and a Historical document. At times disturbing, I feel it is redeemed by the outcome. Over 70 years old, it still grips in 2007, and is  a fascinating insight into what was acceptable not so very long ago. The DVD is great, as it has accompanying documentary footage and interviews, as well as the original Theatrical 'warning' disclaimer. I urge any serious film fan, and those interested in Social History, to get a copy while they can.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Now this is CINEMA!<br /><br />The Criterion Collection DVD is filled with extras, from original Japanese documentaries and interviews of the departed Kurosawa (with English subtitles, if needed) and a booklet containing scene sketches<br /><br />by the Master himself, which help you to understand why his movies are so poetic and his photography so masterful.<br /><br />The movie is presented uncut and in its full splendor. The sound is just a conventional Stereo, which is probably the original soundtrack.<br /><br />Pity, because if there had been a Surround division of the channels, some very spectacular battle scenes would have been more involving.<br /><br />But perhaps, Akira Kurosawa wanted precisely that, to avoid the viewer to be distracted by the fluff, and rather concentrate on the story he is trying to tell.<br /><br />Also known in the Western hemisphere as \\"The Shadow Warrior\\", this is truly an Epic picture with a very beautiful and touching storyline.<br /><br />This picture is the true and natural tie to other Kurosawa movies like \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Yojimbo\\", \\"Sanjuro\\" and \\"The Hidden Fortress\\".<br /><br />Unlike \\"Throne of Blood\\" (adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth) and \\"Ran\\" (adaptation of King Lear), both also masterpieces, \\"Kagemusha\\" is an original Japanese story and gives a thorough insight of Japan in the 17th Century.<br /><br />I always tought that Criterion was just out to steal our hard-earned money just for its name, but after having now bought Akira Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\", the present \\"Kagemusha\\", as well as Luchino Visconti's \\"The Leopard\\", I will stick to Criterion like CA Glue.<br /><br />Although pricey, it is through and through, money totally well-spent, for the quality in DVD rendition (very clean and sharp transfers), very acceptable sound, although some more work on this would be nicer, especially with more recent movies.<br /><br />Criterion has really proven that quality has its own price and believe me, I have never seen \\"Kagemusha\\" and \\"Ran\\" the way I have watched them on my flatscreen LCD HD TV.<br /><br />Going to the movies nowadays, with a technology like High Definition TVs, has totally become obsolete.<br /><br />DVDs, when properly treated and produced can knock out any movie theater in the world.<br /><br />Thank you Criterion for the work of love you put in remastering and transferring such classics on DVD, not to mention the tons of extras you include with them.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well worth its price.gemusha\\" and \\"Ran\\" the way I have watched them on my flatscreen LCD HD TV. <br /> <br />Going to the movies nowadays, with a technology like High Definition TVs, has totally become obsolete. <br /> <br />DVDs, when properly treated and produced can knock out any movie theater in the world. <br /> <br />Thank you Criterion for the work of love you put in remastering and transferring such classics on DVD, not to mention the tons of extras you include with them. <br /> <br />Highly recommended and well worth its price.

Every theme is explored, including some very dubious (though hilarious) sexual practices!The lampooning of Political figures is spot on, though the portrayal of the USA zapping everyone they dislike may not sit too well with some US viewers.This is belly laughs for the boys with a few beers inside them.Relax, and enjoy...

B000I5X824|5.0|<br />I have never really been a big fan of Staind, however I have loved certain songs of theirs here and there, but I am an overall Alternative rock fan. So I came across this album and it had all the greats that I really liked plus a few I like from others in acoustic versions so I got it. Wow, this is one compilation that will be tough for Staind to ever overcome! I would say the absolute best album they have ever compiled! This rarely comes out of my CD player! <br /> <br />Jeremy <br />Jacksonville, FL
B000MGUZM0|5.0|When you start listening to \\"neon bible\\" i don't know you but echo & the bunnymen comes to my mind, the haunting and melodic voice and of course, that music, 100% post punk and indie rock. Although the 80's alternative influences are present with arcade fire, they manage to send a message of their own invention. if you are a music fan and not some \\"top hits\\" follower, then \\"neon bible\\" by arcade fire is just for you.

B000BNX4MC|5.0|I love this movie because it is fun, entertaining, I wish something like this would have happened if I ever pulled a prank like this. The near misses they had at every place they went were too funny! The principal played by Jeffrey Jones actually had the best part especially at the end of the movie, I love this part the best! A lot of good acting by some very good stars. This is a movie you can watch over and over again and love it every time! Danke Schoen!!
B00005JPFQ|3.0|Rating this film is hard.  On the one hand, I think the \\"professional\\" critics are usually way too hard on what are to be considered \\"popcorn\\" movies.  They expect that every film must have a \\"deep\\" meaning, \\"classic\\" actor, \\"great\\" director, or a \\"serious\\" plot/theme to be a good movie.  The rest are relegated to the garbage bin, particularly when they deal with what are usually considered \\"juvenile\\" means, like comic books.  Forget one of the best \\"serious\\" dramas in recent years, \\"Road To Peridition,\\" was based on a graphic novel.  Also forget critic favorite Robert Rodriguez did something truly special with \\"Sin City,\\" another comics-based film.  The truth is that \\"real\\" critics will always tend to look down their collective snout on anything pop-cultured related, forgetting that the first criterium for fiction films is the ability to entertain. <br /> <br />On the other hand, when one has seen many action and comic-based films, we do have an expectation for new things.  A different view of what we've seen before.  \\"Die Hard\\" will always be a classic \\"popcorn\\" actioner because it really opened the door for over-the-top theatrics where you didn't expect to see them, or hadn't seen them before (namely in the confines of a skyscraper office building).  If you've seen it before, many many times before, you can get bored if there isn't a new twist on the theme. <br /> <br />Which brings us to \\"Ghost Rider\\" itself.  Mark Steven Johnson did what I thought to be a bang-up job on \\"Daredevil,\\" only to get slammed by everyone.  Which was why I was so looking forward to this.  The character is a \\"B\\" level one from Marvel canon, but what the heck, \\"Blade\\" was too, and look how they \\"cooled\\" HIM up.  And, for all the changes Johnson made on the character's background, he still is the Ghost Rider.  CGI now makes it possible to make a truly believable Ghost Rider image work, and work it does!  The antagonists, Peter Fonda's Metasopheles and (I can't remember the actor's name, sadly) Blackheart, are truly first rate, right down to Blackheart's henchmen. <br /> <br />But, and for all this, it's still very...mediocre.  Nicholas Cage does an adiquate job with John Blaze.  However, we've seen better from him in a lot of movies.  I guess it's kind of hard for a name actor to play second fiddle to a special effect.  I really get no feeling of chemistry from him and Eva Mendes, which is a shame because she is VERY attractive and good at playing tough, yet vulnerable.  I like Sam Eliot, and he plays a very valuable role in the film (performing to his high expectations, as always).  And yet, and yet..... <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" does what it sets out to do.  It's a very serviceable movie and very enjoyable.  Yet we've seen so much better done with other characters, both from Marvel and DC Comics.  So what's the verdict?  The movie is entertaining, true, and very successful at it.  But it really does live up (or down?) to its popcorn movie roots.  It's tasty and satisfying for the life of the bucket, but you'll be hungry for something a bit more substantial later.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift for my husband because he is addicted to watching the show Charmed.  He has the whole series and can't wait for the 8th season to be available. I would recommend This series to all who love the show and to others who would like to watch good TV
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Oscar voters, they're hard to please, aren't they?  I was reading a scorecard published in \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" that called \\"The Departed\\" \\"warmed-over Scorcese.\\"  The film is a revisting the \\"gangster epics\\" that, for some strange reason, Martin Scorcese is most associated with (they actually represent a small percentage of his film portfolio), true, but the man is brilliant as always, particularly at his usual - bringing the best out of his actors, and creating stirring visuals to punctuate the story. <br /> <br />I also may be biased, coming from Massachusetts, and knowing the Southie story of Whitey Bulger, but Martin was able to take an idea from one culture, Hong Kong, and make it work in another, South Boston. <br /> <br />Not much else to add.  The one criticism I have is that Scorcese stuck, for my tast, a little too closely with his adapted source material, but he does still succeed in making it his own.  Yet another sign of a true master. <br /> <br />Rent it.  Buy it.  See it.  Love it.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|Truly, truly, truly: this is a fine, a superb, and a great movie to watch with your friends, your loved ones, your spouse or partner, or by yourself.  Truly, the scenery is spectacular, and the story moves along at a nice pace, just like a good horse - or so I believe would be true with a good horse.  LOVE is the theme, the core, and the basis for an exploration of humanity and what can or cannot be accomplished.  Truly, truly, I highly recommend this film for everyone, whether you are straight, gay, or otherwise.  Wow: this film is a keeper.

0684135051|3.0|I have been purchasing a lot of knitting and crocheting books lately because i wanted to get new ideas.  My first impression when i opened this book was to be a bit upset that it wasn't what i expected but after i started leafing through i started reading bits and pieces and actually i got some good ideas from her and all i got to say is that don't judge THIS BOOK BY THE FIRST PAGES OR EXPECT SOMETHING ELSE BY LOOKING AT THE COVER.  It's informative and that is what i wanted so i shouldn't complain.

B000301YY8|1.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of my 9-year old daughter and on the strength of one song, \\"You're Beautiful\\".  I also liked the fact that Blunt has a long military lineage in his family. <br /> <br />This is the most depressing bunch of junk I have ever heard.  This is why I-tunes have taken off and any technological arrangement that allows people the choice of jettisoning most of the stuff on albums to get to the good stuff.

I really appreciate Norah Jones's talent and dark beauty, but her lack of range has become tiresome, and the songs on this album are weird and lack musicality or hooks.  I could not wait to get it out of my CD player in the car and safely on Amazon Marketplace for sale. <br /> <br />Better luck next time, Norah.  These songs just don't make it for me.
0671015206|5.0|This easy read outlines the behaviors that can lead to wealth accumulation, and the authors make a solid case for leading a frugal lifestyle, living below your means, in order to accumulate enough wealth to have financial independence.  The point is not to have flashy consumer goods but to parlay your unspent income into solid growth.  The outstanding aspects of the book are the attainability of their plan and their examples.  You will read about characters and feel that you know exactly what type of people they are talking about.  It makes you look at the jewelry, the fancy cars, the huge houses in a different light.  There is further value in the authors' recommendations for teaching fiscal wisdom to children.  I got this book from a financial planner and after reading it bought copies for my siblings and friends.  It's that good.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|They say that many great works of fiction feature fictionalized versions of their creators. With that in mind, is it possible that the character in the \\"Star Wars\\" saga who most resembles George Lucas is none other than... Emperor Palpatine?<br /><br />Think about it: Palpatine has managed to convince large numbers of people that he is a humble man whose actions are all for a higher cause, while in reality he is manipulating events in order to further his selfish ambitions. George Lucas claims that his constant tinkering with the \\"Star Wars\\" films is all an attempt to fulfill his \\"original vision,\\" although in reality it's all about lining his pockets with fans' hard-earned money.<br /><br />Anyone who researches the development of \\"Star Wars\\" from the early to late 1970's will quickly realize that Lucas never had any \\"master vision\\" for the trilogy, despite what he likes to imply now. Several versions of the scripts were written, with numerous changes in plot, characters, etc. Lucas clearly had many IDEAS for his series, but so much constantly changed along the way that it's clear there was never, at any point, one \\"official\\" version of the series. Lucas is simply continuing his history of tinkering with the saga, and claiming that he's trying to \\"restore\\" some long-held vision is nonsense (one example: did the \\"budget constraints\\" on the original film, which he always cites, keep him from having Greedo fire first? What, he didn't have enough money to film a simple blast from Greedo's gun at the time?)<br /><br /> Worse than altering the films that we know and love, however, is Lucas's drive to milk every last dollar out of hardcore fans. Lucas says that his decisions on the films are based solely on his \\"vision,\\" but notice how fast Jar Jar Binks's screentime plummeted in the prequel trilogy, once it became clear that fans despised the ill-conceived character. How much do you want to bet that if Binks had been a hit (i.e. sold tons of toys, the profits from which flow to Lucas), he would have dominated Episodes 2 and 3?<br /><br />But most of the time, Lucas withholds things simply to sell them in repackaged form in the future. When the dvd set of the original trilogy came out, Lucasfilm crowed about the feature-length documentary included on a bonus disc, but I noticed the lack of deleted scenes right away. The only reason for this is that Lucas will release another set someday which includes the deleted scenes, and hardcore fans will feel compelled to buy the movies yet again. The \\"withheld-bonus-to-be-offered-in-a-future-release\\" trick is behind this current individual release of A NEW HOPE... if you want to own the beloved original 1977 theatrical release, you have to buy the Special Edition dvd (which you almost certainly already own) once more. And still no deleted scenes!<br /><br />I've been a huge \\"Star Wars\\" fan since seeing the original film several times in 1977. Those early years of the original trilogy were magical, akin to the era of the Old Republic of \\"Star Wars\\" lore. But as time went on and the money poured in, it seems that George Lucas has crossed over to the dark side, to the point where he is now obsessed with the misguided notions of \\"enhancing\\" special effects and building his empire by selling the same movies over and over, turning the once-noble saga into a moneymaking machine.<br /><br />All is not yet lost, however. Perhaps there's a chance that the \\"Star Wars\\" character who best represents Lucas isn't Palpatine, but instead, Darth Vader. I write this because, as Luke did with Vader, I sense that there is still good in George Lucas, and my hope is that if enough \\"Star Wars\\" fans feel the same, we will one day bring balance to The Force... and, like Vader, the machine that \\"Star Wars\\" has become will return to its basic humanity once more.m which flow to Lucas), he would have dominated Episodes 2 and 3?   <br /> <br />But most of the time, Lucas withholds things simply to sell them in repackaged form in the future.

B000005JA8|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Dylan, Tom Waits, Bruce Cockburn and many other 'offbeat' artists for years.  I hear that this was a great album, one of the first to break the genre of industrial experimentation and that it was a must listen; rated highly by Rolling Stone.  All I can say is I must be turning into my dad, because 95 percent of it just sounded like random noise with little rythm and NO rhyme for the lyrics to eventually lead back to.  I got most of the way through it in the first sitting. Several days later I tried to give it another chance but frankly it was just too annoying to overcome.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|I enjoyed this alluring film.I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing. The cast (Paul Walker, Josh Brolin and Scott Caan) was refreshing.

Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey. Rocky's fight scene in this Blu-ray edition should look fantastic since that sequence was shot with digital cameras.

B000001E7L|4.0|Delores O'Riordian has a voice like no other, perfectly suited for the upfront Irish anger of this 1994 album. Single digits ahead of the St Valentine's Day accord and its imperfect afterlife, O'Riordian and the Cranberries lament--this *is* the dominant tone--the things that are wrong with families, fathers, lovers, and the hatred that has made 'the Troubles' so linkable an expression with Northern Ireland.<br /><br />The front lady's severe, alto and usually unaccompanied voice drives each song forward with self-propelled force. You either love it or hate it.  Not too many simply liked this album. It was one of those musical offerings that invoked strong response from across the spectrum of listeners.<br /><br />I mark the album's release date (1994) as the year I arrived in England to study. It represented one of my first moments of exposure to European (sort of ) pop music and the edge that often distinguishes it from its cross-Atlantic counterpart. A decade and change later, I can still remember where I was when I first heard several of these tracks.<br /><br />The album is well constructed. The first track begins with O'Riordian's famous a capella 'Doo .... doo doo doo .... Doo ... doo doo doo' entrance to the spooky 'Ode to my Family.The CD ends with the eerily gripping organ intro to 'No Need to Argue'.  In between comes a lineup of tunes that together comprise the kind of album that is often called 'honest', a descriptor that often means the postponement of the kind of self restraint that works in the rest of life but is not always the domain of artistry in its awful naked truth.<br /><br />If this kind of transparency is a virtue--and arguably it is--then No Need to Argue represents a kind of moral pinnacle. What carries the attempt through a dozen and one titles is O'Riordian's 'I'm-not-done-yet' persistence in emoting with that beguilingly odd voice and the Irish turn of a syllable that drives it from theme to theme. She is, after all, the only vocal thing the Cranberries have got goin'. She makes the most of a monopoly.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the boys in back lay down a pretty spare groove that showcases the singer up front. This is true both on the raucous/metal end of the continuum ('Zombie') as on the violin-accompanied love song side ('Dreaming my Dreams').<br /><br />All this considered, I place NO NEED TO ARGUE in the category of those landmarks albums that don't necessarily wear well by keening to the common core of changing musical tastes. Rather, it comes as an archived witness to a new and slightly revolutionary sound that gripped us momentarily and for a year or two in the mid-1990s. That's no small feat.'.

B000062XE1|5.0|I originally ordered the collection to obtain LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN, a play written by Oscar Wilde, inspired by the life of Lillie Langtry, and offered to Lillie Langtry for the original stage production - which she refused for reasons of 'vanity'.  The play is very well done.  I was also interested in viewing THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.  I was only familiar with the Hollywood version of the film.  This version, in my opinion, outshines the Hollywood version one thousand fold.  Very well done, and very well casted.
0446528056|5.0|To be quite honest, I had grown bored with Sparks' last few novels. I was a little hesitant to even read \\"Dear John\\" for fear of reading another boring novel. But I was greatly surprised as I read it. Not only did it have an amazing storyline, but there weren't any \\"filler\\" chapters as in his other novels. The story was told in the perfect amount of pages, no added stuff. [Which I hated about True Believer.] <br /> <br />The book is filled with several surprises [which I won't give away, no worries]. And I find it continually amazing how Sparks can write in the correct tone of the narrator. Example: If the book's narrator is a 50 year old, his writing truly sounds like the voice of a 50 year old. This book was told in the voice of a young man in his early-late 20s and Sparks wrote it that way, with realistic things a 21 year old would say. <br /> <br />I, being 22, really enjoyed reading about a young love. I was a little tired of reading about 30, 40, and 50 year olds in love. This book went back to Sparks' original roots...\\"young love\\", the love we first read about in classics such as \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember\\". I was so relieved that he finally wrote another novel I could really relate to. It was a relatively fast and easy read.  <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book to all Sparks' fans. I know a lot of them will be hesitant at first because of the Sparks' latest novels being flops. But I promise, it's worth the effort of borrowing [library] or buying [bookstore].
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Yes, well, of course most people don't like this movie. If people don't realize by now that Brown Bunny is aimed at a limited audience--especially after all the hullabaloos (hullabali?) raised by this film--I don't know what to say about the movie-viewing public. The following are the facts of the matter; let them serve as either a warning or invitation to prospective viewers.  <br /> <br />(1) The film is (materially) uneventful. By this, I mean that nothing much \\"happens\\" as far as dialogue, events, or otherwise obvious Hollywood razzmatazz. There are no car chases, explosions, fist fights, cute romantic foibles, jokes, sight gags, or secret government plots. What there is, is a lot of driving--of a van, across the U.S. There are minor, nearly wordless encounters scattered around, but the film is predominantly a mood piece, meditative, allusive, cathartic, evocative... If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then by all means save yourself the hassle and avoid this film like the plague. But to all those who think this is nth degree in a director's self-indulgence, this movie doesn't even come close. See a movie like Goodbye Dragon Inn or, for that matter, any of the major Taiwanese directors, and then you'll see a slow movie! (But not necessarily a bad one, however.) <br /> <br />(2) The movie is brutally depressing. If you make it all the way through (and many will not), you'll unlikely be whistling a merry ditty or feeling particularly chipper. It is certainly not a feel-good movie; in fact, it might qualify as a feel-very-bad movie, which I prefer anyway. A lot of people complain about depressing movies--they would rather watch something light and diverting. But here's the discrepancy: this isn't the cinematic version of Muzak, here to pacify the populace; it is art--which may (fear or fears!) be distressing at times. Life's like that. Get used to it. We have more than enough \\"entertainment\\" around to neutralize us into thoughtless zombies... pop music, magazines, TV, sports, and (ahem) the internet, just to name a few.  <br /> <br />(3) Okay, here's another doozy, and this is the reason the movie has gotten any public notoriety whatsoever. There is an actual sex scene containing actual oral sex (apparently anyway) between Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. But, if you are visiting this page, you probably already know this. After all, why would 95% of people be visiting this page? If you are thinking of watching this film for the erotic factor, skip it. There are countless adult films better formulated to satisfy your needs. This scene is hardly what I would consider titillating. It's more sad, in a way. And, no, Chloe Sevigny hasn't destroyed her career by doing this, nor has she made an especially bad choice. (Notice that not many people accuse Vincent Gallo of destroying his career by doing the same thing. But of course many people strongly dislike Vincent Gallo anyway. I myself don't like his right-wing politics, but I still love this film.) <br /> <br />Okay, those are the three main obstacles preventing most casual viewers from \\"enjoying\\" (is that even the right word?) this film. If one or more of them seems unappealing to you, then save yourself the ninety minutes. It's as simple as that.  <br /> <br />It was very appealing to me, however, and I imagine that some other people out in the world will find this film as important, moving, and meaningful as I have.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|Not having seen some of other critically-acclaimed films of 2006 yet, I am not sure whether Martin Scorsese' Oscar-winning \\"The Departed\\" really better than they are, but it is safe to say that \\"The Departed,\\" good as it is, is not Scorsese' best. His Oscar would be one of the numerous cases of `better late than nothing,' and it is true that Academy should have awarded him one (or more) Best Director award much earlier.  <br /> <br />Having said that, I must say I found myself drawn to the violent world of \\"The Departed.\\" The remake of Hong Kong noir \\"Infernal Affairs\\" has many plot contrivances like its original (which I won't repeat here), and the film requires suspension of disbelief at times. Foul-mouthed detective Mark Wahlberg is convincing, but some say Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy, touch undercover cop is miscast, and Jack Nicholson's portrait of gangster Costello sometimes becomes caricature. Yes, I know these things.  <br /> <br />But what attracted me most is not the acting of the cast - don't get me wrong here because I think they are all good - it worked for me because of its grim and dark shadow hanging over the doomed characters. From the first sequences in which Costello talks to a little boy Colin in South Boston to work for him, we can smell death with the Rolling Stone song \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" grainy footages of the 70s and Nicholson's sneering voiceover. The boy's fate is sealed as he becomes a police officer who is actually a mole. <br /> <br />From then on, the story of \\"The Departed\\" goes on with twists and turns. The pace is not fast, taking time to explore the theme represented by a phrase the faithful departed. Billy and Colin are both haunted and tormented by their father figures they are strongly conscious of - Billy by his dead father and Colin by profane Costello. They both seek solace in the same woman while sticking to their faith. In fact everyone in the film stick to their faith and belief whatever it is, and get what they get. <br /> <br />Perhaps you don't like the occasional bloody violence or the slow pace of the film (it runs 150 minutes) and I think the film overlong, too. You cannot actions here for obviously Scorsese is not interested in shoot-outs which another director like Michael Mann would have taken more time to describe. Some may say Scorsese remake pales compared to Hong Kong original. I found the change to the ending is unnecessary, and remembered Andy Law, original's star's interview with Japanese press in which he said that he found (or regretted) the remake does not have the Buddhism philosophy of \\"Infernal Affairs.\\" He is right and Scorsese knows it, infusing another theme instead, with frequent reference to the themes of faith and betrayal in the characters with hazy morality in \\"The Departed,\\" the themes to which I couldn't help being attracted.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I was blown away by this film, as a photographer I thought it was spectacular to look at and the acting was passionate and genuine. An amazing blend of fantasy and history, action and drama. I can't compare this film to any other, its in a category all its own. Granted there were certain elements that were a bit over the top, but so what, if you want a realism watch the history channel, this is about entertainment. The battle scenes were amazing the oracle scene was just gorgeously visualized and the plot kept you cheering for the Spartans from beginning to end, even though anyone who knows the true story knows how it ends. Its not A+ work but its at least an A- or B+ in my book!

B000LC3ID8|4.0|As Saw III begins, we find crooked Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) trapped and with a tough decision to make, while Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) finds herself captured by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) as well, with an imminently grisly demise at hand.  Yes, it appears that Saw III is the end of the series as we know it (doubtful though) as Jigsaw's increasingly debilitating health leads him and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) to orchestrating one last, terrifying game.  This time around, a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) and her vengeful husband (Angus MacFadyen) are now pawns in what could be Jigsaw's last game; and needless to say, things don't turn out well for anyone at all.  Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the lacking second film in the series, returns to helm this chapter, and does considerably better this time around.  The traps and death scenes aren't as intricately put together as what we've seen before, but they're all the more grisly.  The gore level gets upped as well, as people are tortured and dispatched in ways that if they don't make you squirm, consider seeking help.  James Wan and Leigh Whannel, who crafted the first film in the series, are reportedly done with the franchise, but rumor has it that Lion's Gate won't let the Saw series ride off into the sunset just yet.  All in all, Saw III is a better than expected entry into what is becoming a predictable series, but let's hope that the Lion's Gate execs know when to call it quits.

I didn't realize when I ordered the CD set that it actually contains more than the original book does. The audio portion has been updated, and having the author actually deliver the audio further increases the value baecuase you get all of the emotion and other inflections. Another bonus is that the topic, when carefully considered, can be extended to your own personal life and applied to your everyday outlook on personal things as well as business things. I have recommended it to my spouse as an alternative to certain approaches she has explored in dealing with family and friends in a variety of situations. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in improving their life and their relationships and success overall as a human being.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes \\"Dracula\\" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi.<br /><br />A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.<br /><br />Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.<br /><br />Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.<br /><br />Technically \\"Dracula\\" wasn't the first adaptation of \\"Dracula\\" -- that honor belongs to \\"Nosferatu\\" -- but it was the first to actually tackle the storyline in Stoker's book. And to date, it's perhaps the only to portray everyone's favorite vampire with the necessary atmosphere -- ominous, dignified and creepy.<br /><br />Tod Browning sets it in all the necssary places -- crumbling castles, savage mountainous villages, foggy London streets, and sumptuous Victorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside. Granted, a fair amount of stuff is changed -- Jonathan Harker is partially replaced by the mad Renfield -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.<br /><br />And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality. But Browning also knows how to pour on the subtle horror, without blood or violence -- like any scene with Renfield.<br /><br />The script is just as great as the direction, with some unspeakably good dialogue (\\"For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you're a wise man, Van Helsing\\"), usually from Dracula. But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, \\"Listen to them, the children of the night.  What music they make!\\").<br /><br />But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula, his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (\\"Not when I can get nice fat spiders!\\").<br /><br />The original \\"Dracula\\" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work.ally replaced by the mad Renfield -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.      And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality.

But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, \\"Listen to them, the children of the night.  What music they make!\\").    But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula, his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (\\"Not when I can get nice fat spiders!\\").    The original \\"Dracula\\" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|The collection of talent and the performances on this 2-disc piece of work are exceptional. A superb tribute to an extraordinary artist. Harrison's ability and range were a marvelous contribution to music. Disc 2 alone is worth the bucks.
B000MGUZMU|4.0|i don't quite get the springsteen comparisons, the vocals on \\"keep the car running\\" reminded me more of, hold on now...eddie and the cruisers?! <br />who? <br />actually they were somebody and \\"the beaver brown band\\".  nevermind.   <br />just google it or watch the movie. <br /> <br />arcade fire is a new and interesting band and while their sound isn't particularly innovative, it is honest and doesn't sound manufactured to sell the most copies.  i have yet to really sit down and listen to it, it's been background music while i was online and while driving, but it is evocative and seems to take the listener away, maybe to the place that is closer to what we thought life would be like when we got older, instead of how day to day life really is.  it isn't obscene or offensive or made to shock you.  it isn't filled with negativity towards women or other races.  it isn't loud and stupid and aggressive.  when i went to the store to buy it, the header card was heading an empty section.  i asked the employee who said he will check and see.  he came back saying that they only had the deluxe edition.  i said that's fine.  he came back with it, fresh off the truck and handed me this weird little box with a strange lenticular cover.   <br />anyway, it rocks and it makes me smile and feel melancholy all at once so i deem it good.

0743496728|5.0|This time around, Picoult finally lived up to my hopes and she did so by tackling a difficult subject, one that has been in many novels thus far...a school shooting, a look at both the victims' world and that of the shooter  (who is also a victim, in his own way),  the alienation of kids who are on the outside and the interconnection between the popular kids and those who aren't. Although the novel is graphic, it would certainly provoke plenty of discussion and understanding between parents and teens, although parents may want to consider how ready their teen is to read a book so detailed and so complex and with graphic sexuality (including rough sex).<br /><br /> As a long-time reader of her books, my one disappointment with Picoult has always been how often her endings seemed to fall apart into stereotypical or \\"pat\\" solutions, when the rest of her writing, up to that point, would be so very, very strong. And yet, I KEPT buying her books, because she did everything else so well - solid, compelling characters,  great plots (until those endings), riveting events. I kept rooting for her. I knew she had the chops to produce a solid book, from start to finish, without those letdowns at the end (and I'm sure others will disagree with me about the endings, as she IS a popular writer).<br /><br />  This time,with Nineteen Minutes, she pulls it off, does everything right...and I'm delighted to be able to say so. I wasn't able to stop reading, except for short periods when I had to stop and think about WHAT I was reading. I have raised three teenagers and her portrayal of teenage life, the cruelties of the bullies, the fears and insecurities suffered by even the most popular kids, was eerily accurate.<br /><br />  Buy this one, savor every word and take time to think about how you'd feel in a similar situation. This is the kind of book that can be life-changing and motivate readers to change things and make the world better for our children. How and why readers do that is up to them, of course but, at the least, they'll be haunted by this book long after they finish it.<br /><br />  As for me, I'm going to reread it - and soon.

0345350472|5.0|Philip K. Dick's work has to be taken as a body. All of it encompasses what I call his \\"ironic paranoia.\\" \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" fits right into this.<br /><br />The problems with Dick's films are two. They are either (1) too philosophical or (2)  action films. Or they are both. What they have not been is ironical. And without irony, you haven't got Dick.<br /><br />\\"Minority Report,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" and even \\"Screamers\\" were enjoyable films. But they all lacked Dick's wit. Only \\"Total Recall\\" came close, with its unexpected twists feeding on paranoia, though the overall result was more burlesque than satire.<br /><br />Stick with \\"Androids\\" and the other novels and short stories, especially the earlier ones (through 1965). Taken as a body of work, they are monumental.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Hands down, this is Pitt's best work, not only because he veers away from his handsome image, actually looking aged and allowing his performance to ADD to the movie, rather than showcase his looks. As a result, he delivers a standout performance - and the rest of the cast is equally strong.<br /><br />  There are three main stories in this movie, all connected, however vaguely. One revolves around a deaf/mute teenager, another about a couple with marital problems (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) traveling to a foreign country and the third dealing with the couple's babysitter. Be forwarned - the film does jump back and forth in time but this all makes sense and I think it is an effective approach. It takes awhile to figure out why the director would use this technique. I think it was used to clarify just how difficult it can be to see a situation in its whole and complex entirety, to see how pieces of individual lives interconnect with others, even if those others are half a world away.<br /><br />  What is the particular plot or \\"message\\" in this movie? That was harder to discern and, if you buy the regular DVD, you should know that Special Features will not help solve any questions about THE MESSAGE of the movie, will not hit you over the head the THE POINT that you are supposed to get (thank goodness). There are no actor or director interviews on it, no interpretations...and I actually LIKED that. This is the sort of movie that shakes one to the core and raises questions about alienation both within one's own culture and when traveling in other cultures, about how one tragic event can be linked to several countries, etc. It raises questions about our role in the world and how hard it can be to make the right decisions in the wake of violent and dangerous situations. I understood how and why certain things happened but I also wondered if certain decisions were ethical or moral....and how they could have been averted, if at all and how a single tragedy might have been prevented from setting off others.<br /><br />  For me, misunderstanding and alienation between people, both within and without their home cultures, and how quickly seemingly small actions can lead to tragedy were the themes that struck me most powerfully as I watched this movie. I felt for nearly every character in this film, even those who committed terrible acts, but so many of those were done with a certain naivete or innocence...most of the time. People acted without thinking fully,  not seeing the possible ramifications of their decisions or how things could go so terribly awry.<br /><br />One final suggestion: Please don't try to predict \\"what will happen next\\" in this film. I guarantee you'll be surprised at some point because the director doesn't follow stereotypes. If you're looking for a film that ties everything up neatly, with no loose ends, this isn't the film for you.<br /><br />  But if you're ready to tackle a film that will have you thinking about our place in the world, how people can resolve conflict and understand one another better and (perhaps) reach a point of greater understanding and develop new ways of relating and handling terrible situations, this is a great film for fueling THOSE thoughts.een prevented from setting off others.

B00007BKVC|5.0|The very best line in \\"Thelma and Louise\\" is when Louise tells Thelma, \\"you get what you settle for.\\" I have quoted that line time and time again to my children, friends, family, etc. There are many such literary gems contained within the writing of this wonderful movie.<br /><br />Virginia Slims specifically marketed carcingenic tobacco products to millions of women by promising them \\"you've come a long way, baby,\\" but we really haven't come as far as we should have. Thelma and Louise illustrates that very point with fine accuracy and almost too-close-to-reality dialogue.<br /><br />I was so enamored of this movie that I purchased it and then watched it with each of my three daughters. After the movie, we had a discussion about why this was such an important film. The ending of \\"Thelma and Louise\\" is unspeakably sad but it too makes a powerful point about the futility and frustration of a woman's lot, even in our modern times.<br /><br />The movie is very well written and provides painfully honest portrayals of marriage, men, women and their relationships.
0307346609|5.0|Like many other readers, I have also read Brooks' Zombie Survival Handbook.  I enjoyed it, but wasn't wild about it because well... it read like a handbook.  It was a book essentially without characters, and thus a little dry (but still worth reading). <br />World War Z remedies that shortcoming and then some.  I stand amazed at how much thought was put into dealing with how a global infestation of zombies might play out. <br />True, most of the \\"characters\\" that are interviewed only appear for a few pages, but the vast variety of these characters make for an engrossing book. <br />Bottom line:  if you enjoy zombie fiction, and are looking for something other than a lot of the cookie cutter books that have exploded on the scene lately, this novel is an excellent choice.
B000J10ERO|2.0|In a movie overpopulated with miscasts, Brandon Routh was a delight as Superman. Sadly, he wasn't given much to work with. The movie itself was anything but a delight, as it didn't pass my \\"must make sense\\" meter. <br /> <br />I like to watch films that would be classified as fantasy (and this would) with people who don't intrinsically understand fantasy. What I mean is that if a little green man pops up behind a tree and does something magical, the person I'm watching the film with should understand what the little green man's purpose is at some point prior to the conclusion of the film. If they don't, then I think the movie or story failed to establish itself appropriately. One friend of mine, who is a scientist, reads the books that win Pulitzers, yet loved the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films. To me, his assessment of whether the filmmakers did what they needed to do to make fantasy reality is a good one. That said, I've disagreed with him more than once, and the word idiot has surfaced. When it did, that never went well with us. &lt;grin> <br /> <br />That said, I believe that fantasy needs to make sense. But, you say, it's fantasy! It doesn't need to make sense! <br /> <br />Not so. <br /> <br />More than any other genre, fantasy has to make sense, because it has more to prove. You question this? Think on Gollum. <br /> <br />Here we have Lex Luthor, taking a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude and encasing it a hand-made cylinder of Kryptonite (what a guess!), and launching it into the ocean, using it to try to create a continent that somehow - magically perhaps? - creates a habitable continent that will not only destroy all of the United States with the exception of the western states (YIKES...is Bryan Singer really a friend of Ann Coulter?) but will have its own mapped states - for indeed, the continent as Lex showed it looked a bit like Australia, chopped up into \\"regions\\". <br /> <br />Sigh. <br /> <br />As to the miscasts, Lois Lane looked morelike a porcelain doll, and her son - and I feel horrible for saying this - just couldn't be a product of his parents, regardless of what angle they're playing. Lex Luthor was a brainless wimp who resorted to stupid bully tactics when faced with a \\"kryptonited\\" Superman. For someone smart enough to encase a crystal in kryptonite, he certainly showed himself for a fool. His thugs - well, some of his thugs didn't even have muscles. One appeared in a movie that served as a White Castle commercial. <br /> <br />My guess is that since Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor in the 70s, they wanted another good actor to play Lex Luthor. The problem with that line of thinking is that when they tried to pick a good actor in the 21st century, they settled on an average actor: Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br />One who wasn't miscast, but also wasn't given much material: Parker Posey. She's always a delight in whatever she does. I just saw her in \\"For Your Consideration\\", and she took what she was given and did a terrific job with it. Here, she did the same. Again - she wasn't given much. <br /> <br />Even though I felt this was a disaster of a film, I'd like to see another. Certainly not from the same production team or screenwriters, but there is something in Superman's \\"mythology\\" to mine: \\"The Death of Superman\\". In the early 1990s, Superman faced a foe capable of astonishing destruction, and that series of comics sold more for DC than any other. The sequence needs to be brought to the screen, and I believe Brandon Routh is the right Superman to play the part. With CGI where it is (again, think Gollum or anything from The Lord of the Rings that wasn't human), the timing is right. <br /> <br />Let's see it. <br /> <br />And let's have the studios give Brandon Routh another chance with better material. He did a terrific job with what he was given.

B00005JKTF|2.0|Let me state the obvious.  Charlotte Rampling is phenomenal in anything that she does.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I can go so far as to say that Cate Blanchett ranks well into the second place position with her strong body of work and amazing ability to evoke the strongest of emotions.  It doesn't matter if you are watching her in the phenomenal \\"Elizabeth\\" or the slightly obtuse film \\"The Shipping News\\" or even the hysterical Armstrong pic, \\"Life Aquatic\\", she is worth every moment of screen minute.  Blanchett ranks up there with my philosophy of Gene Hackman.  The man may not make the greatest of films, but he is always worth watching.  The same can be said for Cate.  She may not make the greatest film choices possible, but she does keep you eye focused on the screen.  This was my thought as I watched the disappointing biopic entitled, \\"Charlotte Gray\\".  I was actually looking forward to this film with such amazing actors taking the helm as Blanchett, the amazing Michael Gambon, and the quieted Billy Crudup, but even with such power players behind the words, one could not cover up the mush-mouthed film that director Gillian Armstrong attempted to create.<br /><br />I don't mean to be harsh, but there were some serious flaws in this film that even director Armstrong addresses in the audio commentary.  The first which was obvious as the film began its downward stroll, was the issue of language.  This was an Australian film, beginning in Scotland, going to England, and ending up in France.  So, what language would be best to be used?  Anderson took the southern approach and decided to not  use the native tongue, and instead throw at us a very weak French accent for all occasions.  Gambon, obviously, chose not to do any of these options and went with his own accent.  Crudup seemed the least apt to handle this non-American accent, while Blanchett ... well ... she did what she could, constantly fluctuating between her Scottish accent and that of something that could only be called \\"French\\".  It was not a strong way to lure the historical cinema guy into the picture.  While I realize that it would have been tough to \\"sell\\" this as a foreign language film, I do believe that it would have pulled me deeper into the story and into the trenches of what these women had to do for their country.  Instead, it just felt cheap and extremely Hollywood-\\"ized\\", though it wasn't.<br /><br />The story followed suite.  It was supposed to be this grandiose story of a woman's plight for her country.  It was supposed to be this story of independence and self-discovery, but alas, it transformed into this mushy story about love with no cohesiveness.  We begin this adventure with a woman who is afraid to smoke around others, afraid to drink in public, and suddenly falls head over feet with a man whom she is willing to do anything for.  While Armstrong did address the quick courtship in this film, I just felt like we needed more explanation.  We needed to see her independence further before making the rash jump into bed, so to speak.  Then, quickly, we are placed into training, lies, and finally dropped over France.  All before we can really see who this woman really is.  I wanted, needed, desperately desired, to know who Charlotte Gray was before getting deep behind enemy lines.  I don't mind a two hour film, but two hours in France not quite understanding our main character is not a way for a film to just be thrown in our faces.  Who was Charlotte?  Who was Gambon?  Who was Crudup?  I needed this, but alas, Armstrong was too busy focusing on love, random acts of children, and a family torn between two generations.  Haven't we heard this all before?<br /><br />So, we have this weak message, sent by mediocre voices, through a war that gets more and more random as the minutes progress.  Can anyone answer to me what the true mission was of Gray during her tour?  Why would she fight so much with so less reward near the end?  Did those we viewed through the film just disappear by the end?  Too many questions for what should have been just a straight forward film.  I wanted concise direction and a focus towards our main character, Gray, but instead we were handed a hodgepodge of stories that never quite connected.  Armstrong attempts to answer those nay-saying critics through the audio commentary with feeble responses and dramatic \\"I was the director\\" cards.  It becomes difficult for foreign directors to try to capture the feel and truthfulness of another country's hero.  Armstrong failed in this case.  She even second-guessed a couple of her scenes in the final film, a sure-fire sign that it wasn't the film that you wanted to finish with.  The only director that can successfully critic his  own films, and that is Uwe Boll, and that goes without saying.<br /><br />I can't say that I was happy with the overall finale of this film.  The glue wasn't very tight and instead of honesty, Armstrong seemed to focus on the randomness of love, circumstance, and scenery.  I didn't think this was a solid film at all, and have to side with the critics that seemed to think that this was just another biographical fluff film.  Blanchett acted her heart out (for no apparent reason), and Scotland was beautiful, but I cannot credit anything else with this film.  If you are looking for history, I would find something else.  If you are looking for a title that you would find in the \\"romance\\" section of your local bookstore, then \\"Charlotte Gray\\" is the film for you.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of ***** (one for Scotland, one for Blanchett - that is all)viewed through the film just disappear by the end?

He has hidden 5 golden tickets in his candy randomly throughout the world. 5 children find the tickets and adventure ensues....<br /><br />This is a terrible remake by Burton. The movie looks like Burton tried to rip off Dr. Seuse with extremely odd angles, charlies house being built out of square etc.<br /><br />The Good: Nothing<br /><br />The bad: as previously stated, the look of the movie was annoying. Depp's potrayal was absolutely annoying. They take the character of Wonka and turn him into a guy who has \\"Daddy issues\\" and try to fill in a back story about him. Part of what made the Wonka story good was that you didnt know his back story in the original. All of the new tweeks that Burton added to the story and the changes he made just didnt play well. The list goes on but I will stop there.<br /><br />Overall: Terrible remake. The 115 minutes it would take you to watch this movie would be better spent staring at a blank wall. Try something else.
B00009RDGA|4.0|This is that rare case of a book (ADDIE PRAY) and this film, based on the book being equally good. That said, if you've read the book, avoid the film and vice versa. I had read the book and had a vision of what the film should be. What Peter Bogdonovich made didn't match what I wanted. The characters are vastly different with Addie becoming almost the leader. (As with many other reviewers, I agree that Tatum O'Neal deserved to be nominated as a \\"best\\" rather than \\"supporting\\" actress.) Without a scintilla of sentimentality, the film still has enormous warmth, charm and even grace. Unusual in a movie that is essentially about two con artists. (I thought of Borsalino.) So see it, buy it or buy it and read it but not both. Either way it's a treat.
1592220045|4.0|This book really drew me in, for a lot of reasons. Martin has an outstanding gift for dialogue, and his ability to describe setting is in my mind unparalleled in the genre. The characters in this novel are interesting, especially the protagonist Tuf. He isn't the typical hero, though his surprising streak of altruism makes him both unpredictable and endearing. Fans of Space Operas and Fantasy alike should give this sleeper a shot.
0517548232|1.0|I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics.  I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall.  I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's. <br /> <br />I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them.  I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid. <br /> <br />I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was. <br /> <br />I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's. <br />
0553588486|5.0|This book starts a series that every fantasy fan should read, even if they don't enjoy it. Though this cliche is oft repeated, Martin has created a truly unique and realistic fantasy world. His 'heroes' aren't romance cover models who always win and embody everything that is noble and chivalric. In fact, it could be argued that Martin doesn't even write about heroes, which is supported by the fact that among his readers, opinions vary wildly as to which characters are most important or the most loved.<br /><br />If Fantasy novels were TV shows, this would be the one shown on HBO. It's for an adult audience and contains many mature, adult themes.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This Academy award nominated film is certainly one of the most serious films of 2006. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett head the credits, but surprisingly share the real leads with Adriana Barranza, who plays a loving Mexican housekeeper, and the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi, a deaf Japanese teenager struggling with the demons of disability, adolescence, and the death of her mother. I thought the most compelling themes of the film were about responsibility, fault and guilt. In a world where the random act of a Japanese traveler giving a gift to his guide on a hunting trip sets in motion events with tragic consequences, how can we ever really know the results of our actions? how can we be held responsible? Is anyone to \\"blame\\" for what happens to the characters in this film? So much in life is random, but to make sense of it all we search for perpetrators, with often disastrous results. <br /> <br />An older, worn and tired Brad Pitt is excellent in this movie. His prominence on the cover of People magazine every week masks what a fine actor he really is. From the sophisticated humor of the \\"Oceans\\" movies, to the trash of \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\\" to the potboiler family saga \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" to the thought-provoking \\"Babel,\\" he really has an extraordinary range. I've become a big fan--although the role here didn't really qualify as a lead worthy of a Best Actor nomination.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I can't believe this is the film that finally won Martin Scorsese his Oscar- it has to be a make-up call.  This was a vastly overrated movie, with a mildly interesting subject matter that has been overplayed the last several years.  The Irish mob fascination was at a peak in 2006, particularly in Massachusetts, and several years from now we'll all be scratching our heads about what the appeal was.  Do we really need another mob film, particularly one that arrives via a Hong Kong picture remake?  Is this the best you can do, Hollywood?<br /><br />The acting was awful, particularly from Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon, the supposed authentic ones of the group.  Jack Nicholson is pretty much a joke nowadays, and has been running on fumes as a caricature of his Hollywood image for the last two decades.  I thought Leo's acting was decent enough, although he in particular embodied the difficulty I had with accepting Hollywood pretty boys as street toughs (yeah, yeah, they could all probably beat me up- it doesn't make them believable as hoods and connected guys).  The accents were deplorable, and bested only by the dialogue for least believable aspects of a film in which there's a lot that's tough to swallow.<br /><br />The dialogue was so obscenely difficult to accept as true.  Jack Nicholson spat out one liners at inopportune times of stress and violence that were enough to make fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 80's films cringe.  The indiscriminate use of the F word didn't bother my sensitivities- it offended me that I was sold a bill of goods where curse words were used as such an easy and acceptable crutch for well-scripted and realistic dialogue.  Close your eyes and imagine people speaking like that to one another.  You can't- you get New Jersey bookie wanna-be's, and Joey Buttafucco, instead, right?  I didn't buy this language any more than I thought guys walked around calling one another \\"baby\\" as shown in Swingers.<br /><br />The same thing with the violence- it didn't offend me as much as insult my intelligence.  How naïve and far-removed from reality does a Hollywood type have to be to as a rule substitute six dozen shots when six will do?

B0007XTOKC|5.0|After two years of absence Elvis was back at the recording studio to turn a new leaf and provide new and exciting sounds <br /> <br />This is an album that is filled with Elvis vocal mannerisms that no one can master just as well.  Throughout the various rock tunes, he provides again an example of a high pitched voice that can be next to a low baritone note.  Do notice how he still passes his trademark of muffling or accentuating verses in order to escape from the constraints of a solid rocker.  Inescapably, Elvis manages to jazz up the rock tunes based on his vocal acrobatics. <br /> <br />As far as the ballads go, Elvis is at the top of his form and never fails to provide full sound and distinct them all apart from each other.  For example, Soldier Boy is a doo-up ballad that up to that point only major black vocalists could validate through their performances.  Elvis is giving a new approach to this style.  On the other hand, the ballad Fame and Fortune is a distant cry from doo-up melodies. Still Elvis manages to blend an operatic feeling with a doo-up following to it. <br /> <br />Overall, the album is a must for collectors. <br />The package presentation once again is superb and the outtakes are gold. <br />Do notice the  one-two-three-four  whisper preceding the epitome of Elvis  Blues sound:  Reconsider Baby  <br /> <br />Enjoy!!! <br />
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Ed Norton sure is cool.  For the most part, he eschews the blockbuster material that his brat pack contemporaries gravitate toward (seriously, has the \\"Ocean's\\" series become the new Police Academy franchise?), and picks roles that aren't afraid to challenge and/or bore the audience.  I mean bore as a compliment, in the way that movies without explosions, gratuitous sex, or cartoon violence risk doing these days.  By these standards, The Illusionist is boring.  And great.<br /><br />Norton can act, too.  He brings a gravity to his role as Eisenheim the Illusionist that lends the perfect weight to the film: you believe he could exist in turn of the 20th Century Vienna (despite a wavering and unconvincing accent)(just try imagining Ben Affleck in this part), just as you believe he's tortured by the pain visited him throughout the film; yet he enchants you with each trick up his sleeve, and he's mischievous enough to keep your hopes for comeuppance against the film's villains alive.  Paul Giamatti, as always, is excellent, and Jessica Biel showed more maturity than I knew she had (to be fair, I knew her more for her looks than for any acting I'd previously seen (those work here, too, incidentally)).  Rufus Sewell captures the unctuous arrogance and privilege of the aristocracy very well as Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />The film is gorgeously shot, like the film equivalent of an old-time novelty photograph.  The illusions themselves are visually captivating, and don't at all seem anachronistic.  They grow darker as the film does, though not in such a way that you mind the symbolism.<br /><br />**PARTIAL SPOILER AHEAD**<br /><br />One complaint I had with the film curiously resolved itself for the better after some thought and another viewing.  Without giving away too much, The Illusionist's end reminded me of a early 1900's cross between The Usual Suspects and The Shawshank Redemption, but with less realism than either of those films.  I was angry at how neatly and summarily everything got wrapped up.  Then I listened to the commentary for the last scene and felt a little better, as I heard director Neil Burger remind me of illusion as the film's central theme, and describe the film's last few minutes as potentially real or a just figment of a character's imagination.  You're left hanging a little, but it at least feels better than being asked to swallow the tidiness of events as you first witnessed them.neatly and summarily everything got wrapped up.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|There have been many good movies since Shawshank but none of them, in my estimation, have been as exciting and interesting as this movie.  That, along with the best acting around by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore and the rest of the cast, just made the movie even better.  Why Tim Robbins and James Whitmore were not nominated for Oscars I cannot understand.  Robbins plays Andy DuFresne, an unemotional type guy in prison for a murder he didn't commit.  His outward lack of emotion was the main reason the jury found him guilty of the crime.  Freeman plays his buddy, Red, and the guy everyone goes to when they want something from the outside.  They form a tight, life-long friendship and everything revolves around them, especially DuFresne.  The ins and outs of this movie and the wonderful, surprising ending make this a feel good movie despite some violence.  It's a don't miss movie in my estimation and I've never heard of anyone that didn't absolutely love it.
6304698682|4.0|The main character is typical Clint Eastwood - strong, stoic, independent.  The plot has just enough complexity to be entertaining without too much confusion, and the characters have reasonable depth.  The only troubling scene is a rape scene in the beginning.  The audience is supposed to accept that she \\"really wanted it\\" - a dangerous message, I think.
B00004YX39|5.0|This album was bought on a nostalgic-for-high-school-days jag while far from home.  I think this album has some of this group's strongest lyrics and melodies.  \\"Babylon Sisters\\" and \\"Hey Nineteen\\" -- what great stories they are; everything you need for the end of a perfect day.  Other albums by Steely Dan have not aged so well and the new stuff by Donald Fagen is a train wreck.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|The most memorable songs on this classic album are Grace Slick's rousing \\"Somebody To Love\\" and psychedelic \\"White Rabbit.\\"  However, Marty Balin's and Paul Kantner's contributions should not be overlooked.  \\"She Has Funny Cars\\" starts the album off on a strong note, with a hypnotic drumbeat and chiming guitars, leading to the vocal interplay between Marty and Grace.  The superb \\"Somebody To Love\\" is followed by \\"My Best Friend,\\" a catchy pop song that would have been right at home on a Spanky & Our Gang album.  \\"Today\\" (written by Marty Balin and Paul Kantner) is a breathtakingly beautiful ballad, and is one of Jefferson Airplane's best songs.  \\"Comin' Back To Me\\" is another outstanding Balin ballad.   <br /> <br />The rocking \\"3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds\\" is a combination of the Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\" and a sixties protest song.  (Do away with people laughing at my hair.  Do away with people frowning on my precious prayers.)  \\"D.C.B.A. - 25\\" is Paul Kantner's folk rocker with trippy lyrics.  (Here in crystal chandelier, I'm home.  Too many days, I've left unstoned.)  \\"How Do You Feel\\" is a tuneful ballad, sung by Paul Kantner and Grace Slick, that would have been right at home on a Mamas & Papas album.  Jorma Kaukonen's acoustic guitar instrumental \\"Embryonic Journey\\" segues perfectly into \\"White Rabbit.\\"  The album also ends on a strong note, with Marty Balin's fantastic \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover.\\"  No, it's not about something inflatable; it's an ode to the boob tube.  The bonus tracks are a welcome extra, adding to an album that's already filled to the brim with great songs.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I really liked her first two albums, but this one just didn't grab me.  Am I missing something?
B0000004F9|5.0|The Soft Machine left a legacy, this innovative talented 60's UK band were totally unnventional,rocked,jazzed,sang all in a totally creative fashion not comparable to any in a class all their own.<br /><br />Yet there is beauty and total structure..Art and music meet.<br /><br />This CD is a  bargain fusing their 1st 2 albums with glorious sound and original artwork intact.<br /><br />Vol 1 1s easier to grasp than Vol 2 and by Vol.3 the Softs were known to most achieving critical acclaim.<br /><br />Also check out the 2 CD sets of their BBC Recordings for a taste of this exciting era.
B00000J2PH|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM!  This is my all-time absolute favorite collection.  I have the vinyl LP from the 70s, then later I bought the cassette, and then later the CD - I even have the \\"Tapestry Revisited\\" CD (the Tapestry songs re-recorded by various artists) and coffee mug from several years back. <br />EVERYONE should have this collection on some form.
6305692572|4.0|This movie was wonderful to show to adolescents who are struggling with addictions. What I really enjoyed about the movie, and its portrayal of addiction, was the emotional work involved after the main character left rehab. It showed the struggle to regain normalcy (if there ever was normal within the family). It showed the struggle of learning how to live together sober and how to enjoy life sober. She ended up leaving her husband for a time in order to work on herself before trying to work on her marriage, which was a healthy thing to do. Great movie.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Being a colletor of WW2 items and having read the book, I would say \\"WATCH THE MOVIE\\". We nowadays need to feel the compassion and excitement that our loved ones went through. This movie will take you through all of your emotions. Hang on and you will not be dissappionted.
1594481938|4.0|Deciding to read \\"A Long Way Down\\" seemed to me somewhat like settling a score.  I had previously read two of Hornby's other novels - \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\".  I enjoyed \\"High Fidelity\\" immensely and could easily go on and on, raving about it far beyond the reaches of this review.  I felt the opposite, however, of \\"About A Boy\\", which was uninspiring and one of the more regrettable reads of mine.  Quite frankly, I felt like I didn't quite have my finger on Hornby yet. <br /> <br /> As expected, \\"A Long Way Down\\" mixes a clever blend of pop culture - showing us the poignant effect songs, celebrity and books have on us.  There's also no curtailing of profanity by Hornby; the f-bomb flows so freely throughout the prose, you'd think the Osbournes were the four main characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive qualities about the novel is Hornby's use of humor.  The timely laughs keep the story from being overcome by an excruciatingly serious subject.  I don't think any writer could effectively take a \\"lighter\\" look at suicide - let's face it, it's just not possible - but at no point does the story become too dreary or depressing.  Instead there is a refreshing sense of honesty, candor and likeableness that surrounds the four main characters and the reader can't help but pull for these four souls that got just a little off track during their journeys.   <br /> <br /> Although the story dragged a little down the stretch, it finished strong, or to describe it nice and simply, Hornby delivered a meaningful ending.  To Hornby's credit, the book provides a much more glowing than morose reminder of the things in the world that are important and worth living for.  I would recommend this book as an enjoyable summer read.  So, my verdict on \\"A Long Way Down\\" is that while it is no \\"High Fidelity\\", it is much, much closer to this respectable tier than it is to \\"About A Boy\\".   <br />

0375505091|5.0|Definitely the best photographer that really knows how to capture the personality of the subject she is shooting. She becomes completely one with her subject and really does her homework before the photoshoots. This book is a great buy and finally a book that shows us what her life is really about. A great way to connect Annie with her life and not solely on pictures she has shot. This is a true representation of a photographer and very pleased with the outcome of the book.

It was a normal day nothing fancy, just a package in the mail.  Her heart lit up like the fourth of July.  I was so happy to make her happy.  The story is AWESOME and perfect for kids of all ages.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|After purchasing their first CD and seeing Celtic Woman in concert, I was much anticipating this new journey.  I was not disappointed!

0752864726|5.0|Oh my goodness! For the last few months, I have been just marginally aware of a phenomenon called \\"Dexter.\\" It was just a whisper in the back of my consciousness, a hint of something that I ought to know but don't know. So, as I browsed through the daily digest of the wish list and kept seeing this Darkly Dreaming Dexter book listed as someone's fondest wish to read... Well, I put it on my wish list.<br /><br />A month or three later, there it was, in my mailbox. Wow.<br /><br />I read the covers and thought, \\"Why would I want to read something about a guy who enjoys carving up serial killers?\\" Why indeed.<br /><br />So I picked it up and began to read, just to satisfy myself that I wasn't going to like this so I could put it down and move on to something more appropriate. Ah, the best-laid plans....<br /><br />I found myself in the mind of a handsome young creature who looks like a man, but isn't quite as human as he ought to be. He's quite charming, for a police-employed serial killer. How could I be comfortable in such an enviroment? Well, I couldn't be comfortable, but I could be interested, even fascinated.<br /><br />I won't describe the story, but I have to tell you that even with my naturally sharp dislike for that which is immoral, evil, ...whatever... I was quite taken with Dexter. He's compelling, interesting, disturbing, logical, funny, and, well, scary.<br /><br />I decided today, after finishing the book, to check and see what the phenomenon is. I found that there's a Showtime TV series about Dark Dexter, and I watched a couple of brief clips online. It looks interesting, but as a poor underpaid school teacher, I can't afford cable TV, so I won't get to watch it. (I just learned about Monk this year--he's only on cable, too--and I have to watch him on full-season DVDs we buy.)<br /><br />So, my advice to you is to either get this book and read it and be discomfitted in a fun way or run screaming away as fast as you can. Both are good plans.ns. <br />
1582701709|5.0|I watched the video and was completely inpspired by it.  As time passed, however, I started to forget.  Having the book around helps me to keep the inspiration.

B000002L68|5.0|What can I say that the other 166 reviewers already haven't? <br /> <br />One thing, the greatest travesty in all of music... The title track \\"PURPLE RAIN\\" only hit #2 on the charts. <br /> <br />My wife of the past 10 wonderful years was my high school sweetheart at the time.  She had a boyfriend and was seeing me on the side and couldn't quite break it off with him.  Well we went to the Prince concert at the now \\"gone\\" Market Square Arena in Indianapolis (most famous as the site of Elvis Presley's last concert).  The greatest moment was when Prince was singing \\"Do you want him, or do you want me, cause baby I want you\\" it was like he was just singing to us.  I looked into her eyes and knew I would never love another like her and never have. <br /> <br />Buy the album, buy the Dvd, also (much harder) find the live concert VHS that has an almost 20 minute version of Purple Rain at the end of it. <br /> <br />Wasn't the purple \\"rain\\" at the Superbowl awesome?
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Listening to Madonna is my guilty pleasure.  It's not enough that her albums are great, but I adore the live concert CD's and DVD's (like Truth or Dare and I'm going to Tell You a Secret).  Madonna is the best live performer around, always entertaining and always emotional.  This CD is amazing, she blended her most recent hits with some of my personal favorite older hits.  The music was awesome!  Simply great.  Anyone who loves Madonna will fall for this one!
B000JLTRIG|4.0|The show is still good, but much cheesier than before. It was alot darker when Belthazar/Cole Turner (Julian McMahan) was on the show. It has become less serious, but it does kinda come back near the end of the season as Leo meets the \\"Great Power\\" that has had everyone a little on edge.
0375831002|5.0|This is being read but all the Junior High classes at my daughters school so I decided to read it. It was excellent. It is a very compelling story taking place during Nazi Germany. It invoked many good discussions. I felt it talked about a horrific period of history in a way which was digestible by young teens and showed the compassion of many of the Germans.
0515141429|5.0|The Killing Floor is hard to put down.  The plot is riveting.  The characters are realistic and believable.  There is fine detail concerning the special way the villains have managed to get away with there nefarious scheme; that is, until Jack Reacher stumbles onto the case - a case that turns out to be one his brother had been on before he was murdered.  This novel keeps you guessing the whole way through and the action is intense and exciting.

B000JLTRIG|5.0|Yet another wonderful season with the Charmed Ones. This show has so many wonderful stories and characters. It features strong independant women who can take care of themselves and kick a little butt. Yet each episode is full of advice and lessons on life, love and morality.

B00008WJBU|4.0|`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.<br /><br />The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.<br /><br />The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting.
1582701709|1.0|Oops, I just channeled negative energy out there. So I will get rubbish back, my bad. <br />Actually, what \\"The Secret\\" proves, when it comes to the \\"law of attraction\\" is true -- stupidity attracts the stupid. <br /> <br />That's why stupid secrets generate stupid money. Stupid is as stupid buys ...  <br /> <br />Gosh darn. I'm being negative again. I need to burn me some more DVD's... <br /> <br />

B00005JPCF|1.0|This had all the makings of a great animated film had they stayed with the storyline and educational aspect of March of the Penguins. Unfortunately, Hollywood cannot resist poisoning the youths minds with social engineering messages. You just can't leave it alone can you people? This was a thinly veiled assault on our religious beliefs disguised as \\"that's the way the old penguins think\\" and showing the older penguins as paranoid control freaks. This, along with other neo-liberal brainwashing otherwise ruined what could have been a good movie for families. Instead it is a steaming pile of excrement.

B000065AI3|5.0|In the genre of \\"mood music\\" rock few songs can match Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"Wilde One, Forever\\" with their restrained time registers and the jazz like precision of the instrument voices, with each taking a lead and then dropping back to chorus through the song cycle. Mike Campbell, known to cognisceti. as one of the world's most technically gifted and underappreciated guitar players (along with Jethro Tull's Martin Barre) shines here on leads everyone thinks Petty is playing. \\"American Girl\\" shows off the full dimensions of back to back Rickenbachers on lead and rhythm. Perhaps we inflate the significance of those few albums we could afford in our youth, and their repetition driven by economic deprivation and the horror of pay-ola sludge pumped from the radio reinforces the perception of their greatness. But when one of my current students overheard me playing this album they said \\"cool new sound...who is that?\\" Proving forever that accurate garage rock crossed with power pop energy never looses its appeal through the generations.
1881273156|2.0|While the book did offer a few common sense statements about listening, communicating and interacting with your partner, it contained very few true insights.  I found the writing to be full of cliches and general platitudes.  Very \\"dumbed down\\" and almost insulting to the reader.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Great take off on \\"Trekkers\\" and \\"Trekkies.\\" Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen are at their comedic best.Great takeoff on the Star Trek shows. Shows what actors can do when they have to go beyound their acting skills to save a doomed planet from destruction. Great special effects. Great make up and sets. It was also a light hearted salute and tribute to Star Trek and Star Wars. Loved the attitude of the British character. It shows how fiction can be reality to many people.It was great how the fan of the tv show came to the rescue to help Tim Allen and crew succeed.  I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver and have seen her do serious sci fi, this was her chance to take a lighter look at the sci fi format. She did it well. Tim Allen was also good in his role.  I have enjoyed this movie several times. This is a great movie for sci fi fans, Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver fans and comedy fans. A good movie for the whole family.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I bought this for my wife who was a Charmed fan. Great shows for those with some imagination!  The final episode was wrapped up in a great way, especially compared to final episodes on other series.   <br />Well worth the price.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a very excellent source of information regarding global warming.  It does its job in enlightening people on the basics of the problems out there and gives ideas on what can be done to help. Not all of us are environmentalists or scientists so this Dvd is a great way to inform the mass public of a very serious concern.  Al Gore does an incredible job in his presentation and the integration of his history helps to connect you to him as a speaker instead of just being subjected to a lecture.  We see the path that brought him to where he is today and we understand his dedication and know that it is not just a paycheck.  It would not have been as believable to just watch a paid celebrity present this same material.  This most defintiely comes from his heart.  I highly recommend this to everyone.  Learn something--do something.

0393327655|4.0|Critics of anyone suggesting a closer look at sacrosanct beliefs with the light of reason as opposed to dark, blind faith are always quick to assume athiesm - and with that word and all its inherent connotations - dismiss the reasonable as deviant, different and dangerous. This is not helpful. <br /> <br />A reasoned approach to the history and development of the Abrahamic religions with its contradictions and outright fallaciousness is always fun sport and makes for some humorous asides from the author.  One of my favorites being the ironic wondering as to why God made Shakespeare a superior writer to Himself. <br /> <br />Back in the day, humor towards the topic of God and Man was a relatively acceptable way to poke holes in matters of faith.  Harris' point about the faithful, now on the verge of being armed with Weapons of Mass Destruction, having ironclad belief in the nature of the afterlife and, therefore, the will to take us all there is simply frightening. <br /> <br />Add to that his philisophical premise that Faith (or unreasoned belief) is Faith no matter the Book upon which it is invested and leads to the same behavior in all Faithful; and you have the ingredients for Armegeddon (which many faithful of all tribes wouldn't mind). <br /> <br />Given this nation's unwillingness to face the consequences of Faith in the 21st century; its fear of antagonizing the 70% of Americans who would never vote for a non-believer or the 50% of Americans who believe that Jesus shall return in 50 years and end it all anyway; and depression can set in regarding our future as the Human Race.  <br /> <br />Harris' book is important just because he puts all of this out there and makes an honest, rational and reasoned attempt to identify root causes for terrorism and religous conflict as well as the consequences of religous fervor - i.e., faith. <br /> <br />The End of Faith only gets four stars from me because, while disavowing religions, it does suggest an alternative - spiritual exercise through mediation and a rational approach to understanding and exploring the spiritual element of our natures - but doesn't take it far enough.   <br /> <br />There is a spiritual need in humanity and religion exploits that because a real alternative has not made itself known.  Sam hints at that but doesn't take it farther. <br /> <br />However, his concept that the rules of science and its many disciplines (biology, psychology, neurology,...) can be brought to bear on the nature of our spirit and help us to nuture it is intriguing, though fleetingly glimpsed. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I find it challenging and - even a little noble - for Sam to exhort us to find our better selves with ourselves.  It seems to me that a reasoned search for our spiritual natures can only be rewarding. <br /> <br />To put it in terms Sam might not completely agree with - It seems reasonable to me to begin a real and reasoned search for God now than assume He has found and reported a couple of thousand years ago by a clergical committee driven by politics, prejudice, and a complete misunderstanding of the physical nature of the Universe. <br /> <br />Those men weren't even educated enough to know themselves - let alone God. <br /> <br />Thanks, Sam.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This DVD set is more than worth the money I payed for it.  The replay value is extremely high and I know I will be enjoying these episodes years from now...they're just that good!  For anyone who has stumbled on one or two episodes at a friend's place and want more, or for anyone looking for a well-written, intriguing and often humorous show with original characters, this is definitely a purchase to make.  It's just too bad there aren't more Firefly episodes to be included, it really was a gem among so many other boring and predictable tv shows.

B00005JPLU|4.0|I will get it out of the way and say that this was not and was not meant to be a historically accurate depiction of Ancient Greece. It was never meant to be even when it was still just an Eisner-Award winning graphic novel from the mind of iconic graphic novelist and artist Frank Miller. With that out of the way I was able to watch and enjoy Zack Snyder's film adaptation on its own terms without the criticism of historical accuracies looming dangerously over my head. 300 deserves the label of being the first event film of 2007. From start to finish, Snyder's film practically screams blockbuster and popcorn and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Frank Miller's 300 was at its time an interesting depiction of one of history's greatest military last stands. Miller already known for hyperstylizing the look and feel of the noir genre with his Sin City graphic novels, takes the same approach with his depiction of King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans taking a final last stand against Persian God-King Xerxes at a narrow mountain pass called Thermopylae (literally meaning Hot Gates in Greek). Zack Snyder took this graphic novel and painstakingly stayed true to the visuals Miller and his colorist wife, Lynn Varley put on paper. Looking back at my memory of some of the panels and images from the graphic novel. Snyder and his crew of art directors, cinematographers and CGI-artists were successful in translating almost every page of the graphic novel onto the screen. Like Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Miller's Sin City, Zack Snyder's 300 pretty much brings the graphic novel to moving life. This means he stuck to the source material quite literally which limits his own take on the graphic novel. And like Rodriguez Snyder doesn't really put his own signature stamp as a director to the film. It's not too much of criticism since he does a great job of translating Miller's work onto film, but one wonders what sort of personal touches he could've added to the finished look that wasn't lifted from Miller's style and whether it would've changed the overlook look and feel of the film.<br /><br />The story is quite simple and just takes the basic summary of the historical event itself. Spartan King Leonidas (played with visceral gusto and machismo by Scottish thespian Gerard Butler) makes a decision to go to war and confront the encroaching and fast approaching massive Persian Army led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) intent on conquering the Hellenic city-states of the Greek Peninsula. Persian ambassadors ride forth to demand oaths of fealty from those city-states ahead of the army's path. Sparta is one such city-state, but different from the rest of its Hellenic brethrens. Sparta has gone down in history as a word synonymous with unbending dedication to a strict, ascetic warrior code. Warfare and battle were what Spartans were born and trained to do from an early age. Weakness and physical imperfections weeded out from the time of birth (the film explains just what happens to male newborns with physical imperfections and deformities). The answer Leonidas gives the Persian delegation could be seen as somewhat extreme, but not contrary to his nation's warrior-culture of never surrendering and seeing death in battle the greatest glory for a Spartan to achieve. From this sequence right up to the end of the film we get to see just how much of a warrior culture the Spartans were in extreme detail.<br /><br />It's during the prolonged battle scenes between Leonidas' Spartans and Xerxes army which will have everyone chomping at the bit. If you have to see this film for any particular reason outside of watching superbly-trained underdogs slaughtering and endless supply of enemy troops then you will most likely be disappointed by the slower scenes away from Thermopylae. Indeed, this film and its original source material would've worked even better without the extra filler Snyder and his writers added to give the film more depth. I'm all for more emotional depth and characterization in my films but when a movie is all about a bloody and heroic last stand of a few against the many, scenes which slow the story down does more to break the rhythm and tone of a film than add to it. Other than a deeper understanding of the kind of partnership Leonidas had with his Gorgo, his Spartan Queen, most of the subplots added by Snyder and his writers could easily have been left out and still get a kick ass action epic.<br /><br />It's the action scenes which reall stand out visually. Some people might see the style tricks of speed ramping certain action sequences then slowing it down considerably to show the minute detail of the battle scene as being to gimmicky, but I would disagree and say it actually gives the movie a fable-like quality in its storytelling. One thing I have to say about Zack Snyder as a director (his remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead better than what detractors have made it out to be) is that he knows how to film action and with special mention to bloody and gory action. He makes these scenes of dismemberments, decapitations, and disembowlments look like a piece of performance art. These scenes of carnage would be considered extremely gratuitious if it didn't look so computer-enhanced good. Even the way the blood flows, spurts and splashes look like something Jackson Pollock would take interest in. The speed up and slow down of the sequences also gives the fight scenes a certain rhythm that once an audience picks up on will follow it through to the end. This is why the scenes back in Sparta with a duplicitous politician and his powerplay to assume control and power seem such a downer instead of enhancing the sacrifice of Leonidas and his men. Those scenes just feel tacked on and completely superfluous. Luckily, there's not enough of them to slow down the frantic pace developed by the battle itself.<br /><br />The performances by all actors involved really doesn't require too much criticism or reflection over. Gerard Butler does a great and convincing job as the Spartan King and his conviction in confronting Xerxes and his army with so few seem very believable. It's not a star-making performance but it does show that Butler can add a bit of gravitas to a character and role so basic in characterization. Lena Hedley is radiant as his partner and Queen. Despite the weird sounding name of Gorgo, Hedley plays the strong-minded and equally influential wife to Butler's Leonidas. It's only her scenes back in Sparta as she tries to rally her people to support their king which keeps these slower sequences from fully pulling down the film. Really, the performances are just done good enough to keep the acting from becoming too campy or too serious. It's an action film and with enough action going on in the movie I could forgive the writers (both Miller and the screenwriters) from scrimping on character build up.<br /><br />All in all, Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 succeeds in bringing the book to moving life. Throughout the run of the film it was hard not to get lost in the beautiful visuals. Whether it was the muted color pallette which puts most of the scenes in an almost sepia-tone look to over-emphasizing certain colors to set a certain mood. From oversaturation of reds in one sequence to one where everything seem to be tinted with the many shades of blues at night. This is what 300 will be best remembered for. It's technical use of CGI to paint the environment in unrealistic but beautiful ways which gives the scenes a 3-dimensional look to them when the actors are superimposed over them. The film really is a painting come to life and it shows once again how computer technology has now afforded directors in making what used to be impossible logistically to something that could be done with the limit being the artist's imagination.<br /><br />This movie will not win many acting, directing and even screenwriting awards, but it doesn't have to forpeople to enjoy it. It will entertain and pull its audience into a living and modern retelling of a legend. Whether all that happened on the screen was exactly as it happened in 480 B.C. doesn't matter. What it does show is that through retelling down the years even all the embellishments added to the story of Leonidas and his men doesn't diminish the fact that they did something heroic. For those excited to see 300 I am preaching to the choir. For those who are not quick to fall to the hype given the film I still recommend it for the epic spectacle Snyder and his band of filmmakers have put on the screen.and convincing job as the Spartan King and his conviction in confronting Xerxes and his army with so few seem very believable.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|I have to rush to be among the first 20 people to write about how this album will change your life and make you cry and sit down and write beautiful poems about completely abstract thoughts that you didn't even know you might have.  [Insert more over-dramatic hyperbole here!]<br /><br />The truth that there is no easy way to describe the Arcade Fire.  There were hundreds of things written about them after their last album, and there will be hundreds more this time.  There are comparisons to every genre and desperate attempts to lump them into some category when it's just not possible.  Indie?  Folk?  Post-punk?  Chamber-pop?  None of them quite fit.<br /><br />And that's the beauty of this album, as well as the first one.  It defies categorization, yet it's excellent.  This album isn't Funeral Part 2.  There are some of the same elements--grandiose production, tons of instruments, etc.  But there are also differences.  This album is more of a \\"rock\\" album, if that makes any sense, where the last seemed to be more of an operatic piece.  There's definitely no sophomore slump, it's just a slight change.  But the important connection between both albums is that they seem effortless.  It just sounds like people making good music without pretension and having a good time doing it.  If you like bands like Stars or Wolf Parade, this will probably appeal to you.  It might also remind you of early Cure, or early Radiohead, though it's not much like either one.<br /><br />If you want to know if you'll like the album, check out the songs \\"No Cars Go,\\" \\"Keep The Car Running,\\" and \\"Intervention.\\"  Those are among the best on the album and they'll give you a good feel for how the whole thing sounds, but they also illustrate the diversity within.
1904233023|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading Ender's Game for the first time, and I must say it has established itself as one of my favorite books.  I won't focus on plot synopsis or spoilers--let me just share with you some of the things I most enjoyed.  Oh, and by the way, Ender's Game stands on it's own.  So you can read it and end with a sense of completeness.  Although it does set the stage for its sequel, it does not do so at the expense of a good conclusion.<br /><br />Card presents a world that is plausible--a distant future, but not one so disconnected from today that we do not recognize it.  He did a superb job of expressing the human condition, especially in the primary actors of this story--genetically engineered children who were created solely in the hope that one of them would be the super-soldier they need to save the world.<br /><br />His insights are profound, yet very simply stated.  For example, in a society where conforming citizens have sworn-off their religious beliefs, Card gives insight into Ender's past by describing how his father insisted on baptizing the boy at home, even after disavowing his faith.<br /><br />As a technologist, I was profoundly impressed by Card's insight into some technologies that were yet to see their rise:  student \\"desks\\" that are (what we would today call) tablet PCs (with holographic displays); the reach and influence of \\"the nets\\" (or \\"newsnets\\")--a vast internetwork that foreshadowed the Internet (as we have known it since the early '90s).  Card even foresaw how identities on such an internetwork could be assumed--that anyone could, indeed, be anyone on \\"the nets.\\" His vision of what we would call the Internet included a two-tiered system: one that allowed anonymity, and one that required registration and identity verification--a very interesting picture of the future (I hope he was not prophetic here)!<br /><br />The story moves quickly and the characters are very compelling.  Yet, at the same time, they are disturbing.  The engineered children of the Battle School, and particularly Ender, come across as adults in much of their thinking.  Juxtaposing those thought patterns against the ages of these characters made them stand out as very unique and disturbing, yet all the while I found myself relating to the main character and many of the supporting cast as well. Yet, on top of all that genetically engineered maturity, Card still captured boyhood quite well (even if the dialog is a little dated) with dialog that reflected typical, gross boy-talk (e.g. fart-talk).  I found myself pitying Ender even though he was always painted as the superior being.  I found myself wanting him to win--wanting him to overcome--not just the enemy buggers, but to overcome the life he was presented so he could emerge as what he always wanted to be: just a boy without a care in the world.<br /><br />Also, given the date of this story's writing, I found Card's socio-political insight keen, too.  He did not foresee the fall of the Soviet Union, but he did envision that Russia would eventually end up dealing with uprisings in the Islamic states.  Perhaps that one was a given with the Russian involvement in Afghanistan during that period, but I still find it profound given the tender nature of that region (and Russo-Islamic relations) today.<br /><br />Wheter or not you are a sci-fi fan, I believe you'll enjoy Ender's Game.  It is a wonderful book with a quick pace and memorable characters.  You can't go wrong with this one.g.  The engineered children of the Battle School, and particularly Ender, come across as adults in much of their thinking.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is a magnificent family movie.  The characters are well played out, thoughtful direction, and the special effects not overdone.  Ron Howard (Opie) directed this fairy tale.  This is the classic tale of good vs. evil.  There is the evil queen,Bavmorta; the reluctant heros (Willow and Mad Mortigan); the good magician with fairies and brownies pitted against impossible odds to help fulfill the prophesy to end the evil queens reign. It is a story of how even the smallest can succeed.  <br /> <br />I bought this for my son when it first hit the big screen, and repurchased it to add to our collection again.  It is a must have if you have children, grandchildren, or enjoy good clean entertainment.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This was one hell of a film.  If you were one of those that wrote off the Bond franchise as old or out of touch, then check out Casino Royale.  It basically restarts the franchise, wiping clean the slate and ignoring every Bond film that came before it.  Which is fine, because, let's face it, if all the Bond films were indeed sequels, Bond would be in his 70s.  And although I though Pierce was an excellent Bond, he's not that old.  The character is very much like The Simpsons, he never ages, even though the world around him does.      So, Casino Royale reintroduces how Bond became 007, and the movie rocks.  My only problem with Daniel Craig is that he doesn't have the sophisticated English gentleman trait, who is just as smooth with the ladies as he is with his liquor.  This Bond is gritty, from the streets.  As everyone who's read the Amazon review knows, when asked how he likes his martini, he replies \\"do I look like I give a damn?\\"  Now, the Bond we all know and love would never say that.  In Diamonds are Forever, Bond even knew the vintage of the whiskey that the Sherry he was drinking was based on.  That's class.  This Bond wouldn't know nor care about that...YET.  I get the sense that this film will set up the next film, in which many of the traits that are missing will slowly appear.  Time will tell.    So, if you want a hard edged, violent, sexy (PG-13 rated) adventure, check this out.  It's definitely a great film, even if you don't like Bond, James Bond.[...]
B000MGUZMU|3.0|Where is the raw energy? <br /> <br />I truly love Funeral, but this CD is just not moving me. Maybe I expected too much.  <br /> <br />With the exception of No Cars Go (which is a fine little pop tune), these songs are not catchy and they lack the energy, inventiveness, and big-sound drive that Funeral had.  <br /> <br />Black Mirror is especially dreary and bogged down. Ugh. <br /> <br />Intervention sounds like a Bruce Springsteen cover song.  <br /> <br />I thought the album would grow on me, but I've spun it like 10 times now, and I'm not finding much to get into.  <br /> <br />So far, it's the most overrated album of 2007.

Its narrative is vivid and outstanding and its intensity is extraordinary.<br /><br />Esther is perturbed, she is a loner in a world of multiple possibilities; she has so much to choose from that she begins her descent into a world of darkness known only to those who are really desperate, to those who have the tendency of breaking with reality to those who experience a deep breakdown.<br /><br />The power of this material is astounding and the attention to imagery and rhetoric is ruthless.<br /><br />I recommend it and give it 10 stars. Unforgettable.

I had never seen the black and white version, the BBC version, nor had I ever picked up the book to read it.      I was loaned this movie by my daughter during recovery from surgery.  After having viewed it once, I think I watched it on a daily basis during my six weeks at home, and I try to watch it at least a few times a month.      I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this movie, but it didn't stop there.  Amazon.com and I have become very good friends, seeing how I now own the original P&P story and the BBC version, (which I've not watched yet) but I have also bought or ordered every book there is on Elizabeth and Darcy.  Yes, so they don't all follow Jane Austen's lead, but these are two characters to wonderful to be left alone in one story.    I don't care that the movie doesn't follow the book to the letter, what adaptation does, very few.  My advice is if you are so smitten with the book or any book; DON'T ever go see the movie version.    This is a wonderful \\"love\\" story (pft, who said it's not a love story?).

B000HCO83Q|2.0|I thought the first two movies in the series were pretty great.  Yes we know that most of the mutants start to have problems when their powers manifest around puberty, but most of the tragedy of being a teenager was pushed to the background in favor of the plot and the struggle between Dr. Xavier and Magneto and the philosophies they were trying to instill in their adherents.  This last one though, was way too cheesy.  Let's put as many special effects in as we can, focus on as much teenage angst as we can, and then have a big fight scene at the end, with Keley Grammar in blue fur.  Pass please.

He has a soaring vision of emotional patriotism, freedom, and equality; but when it comes to practical solutions, not so much.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Ok, I don't understand why everyone's hated this movie so much. And normally I quite agree with amazon reviewers rather than pros. This was a lovely movie about a fantasy life everyone of us thinks about. It's got a slow pace, relaxed and with humour, heart and good looking women.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that Mezmerize was a mild letdown. Needless to say I didn't rush out to buy Hypnotize. It kills me that they would put Daron Malakian in charge of a majority of the vocals when you have a truly incredible vocalist like Serj in your band. Serj made this band for me all those years ago and continues to be my favorite part of System Of A Down. However, after countless listens to not only Mezmerize, but also Hypnotize, I can honestly say that I'm thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />System Of A Down have always been ahead of their time. Serj's insane vocal-stylings boggle your mind at times, the lyrics are always strangely intricate, and the music never fails to get your blood rushing. Those things haven't changed a bit.<br /><br />Attack is the most reminescent of the older System stuff thanks to the excellent sing-along quality of the chorus. Dreaming shows Daron's vocal ability off quite well, particularly towards the end of the track. Hypnotize has great dual-vocals with great lyrics and music. Tentative is one of the few tracks where Serj conquers the running time and, as expected, he commands your attention. Holy Mountains serves as the best song, along with Attack. The beginning is quite haunting until you get to the intense chorus. Vicinity Of Obscenity is your typical strange SOAD track, much like This Cocaine... was on Mezmerize.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Attack, Hypnotize, Tentative, Holy Mountians, and Vicinity Of Obscenity. Hypnotize was far from an instant hit with me so if you're anything like me and dismissed this after the first couple listens I definitely recommend going back and giving it a few more detailed listens. This is still SOAD and all the elements that made them so amazing are still prominent. So yeah, if you've yet to hear this check it out.
0679809015|5.0|We love this book!  It was an instant favorite.  The pictures are cute and the book is sturdy.  It is small, as mentioned in other reviews, but I think that's a good thing since it takes up less space in the diaper bag!  I would recommend this to everyone.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I remember the first time I saw an episode of Firefly.  THERE WAS NO SOUND IN SPACE!!!!  Just the simple fact of introducing that reality floored me.  I was intrigued.  The rest of the shows lived up to the high expectations that the pilot set.  Great storylines, pithy dialogue, no pandering to pre-teens with some Wesley Crusher type character.  What a shame that the network had to screw it up so badly and air episodes out of order, and then fail to pick it up for a second season.  Their ineptitude probably helped push the big screen version to the level of greatness it achieved though. <br /> <br />Without any worry about what to do with a sequel or another season, Whedon came up with a plotline for Serenity that wasn't burdened by the necessity for a feel-good ending where everyone survives.  I thought it was incredible that not only did he choose to \\"off\\" a few of the major characters, bu that he did it in a believable way. <br /> <br />And let's face it, we all were hoping for some further explanation of the Reavers, right?  They were a huge menacing force throughout the series that you never really did get a grip on.  I think his decision to tie that answer into the great chase plot that went on with the assassin after them from start to finish shows what a great touch Whedon has with a story.   <br /> <br />I can't help but wonder what the HD version of this one looks like.  Sadly, I'll never know, as I don't intend to rereplace all the stuff that I traded in my VHS's for.  Sorry big money entertainment industry.  Regular DVD is as far as I go.
B000001G50|5.0|A superb CD. I am not a great fan of Albinoni's Adagio, but would recommend this CD simply on the basis of the performance of Gluck's \\"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\\". The playing captures the tranquility and serenity of the piece wonderfully. The Mozart is also performed with aplomb.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|When Macgyver was on the air my mom was a big fan but I never watched it since I was young at the time. Now I bought the first season for the heck of it and just can't stop watching. It stars Richard Dean Anderson (Stargate: SG1) as Macgyver who's the man to call when ever there's a problem. He's not the A-Team but he uses his brain to solve problems and can even figure out how to save the day with a gum wrapper! The show is ingenius and always great entertainment. When you think you know what's gonna happen next the show turns out to not be as predictable as you think. I mean when you think he's going to go against just another villian in an episode, he's facing deadly red ants or an uncontrollable fire instead. This is a great show and I want more. I have the first season but I might have to get everyone now and also they really need to release those Macgyver movies on dvd too!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|The acting in this was amazing.  It's a great book and the actors really brought the characters to life.  Nicole Kidman as Ruby and Brendan Gleeson as her father, Stobrod Thewes, were brilliant together.  It's worth it to watch those two act.  The music was so fabulous for those of us who love Bluegrass.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of blood and violence and some graphic sex.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Cahrmed - The Seventh Season is wonderful, if you are a charm fan like I am you will love the seventh season, so now I am waiting for the next season to come out.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I am not highly critical of movies. I actually watch plenty of movies and enjoy pretty much all genres. This movie is a classic example of an overhyped movie with a good cast that was exremely overrated. The fact that this movie was nominated for an oscar makes the academy look bad.  <br /> <br />Babel is almost worse than Mars Attacks!
B000K9L32U|4.0|After a hugely successful TV documentary, and an even more successful tour last year, Take That return (minus their most famous alumnus) with their first album in 10 years.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful world\\" sees them ditching the youthful pop sound of their past, in favour of a more adult rock/pop format, resulting in the strongest album of their career. All four guys pitch in lyrically and vocally. The album has already topped the UK album charts and sold over 1.2 million in the UK.<br /><br />Opening is the sunny, upbeat \\"Reach out\\" with tight 60s sounding harmonies a-la Beach Boys, Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel (something showcased throughout this CD) and a catchy sound. In a similar vein is the floaty titletrack \\"Beautiful world\\".<br /><br />Lead off single (and UK #1) \\"Patience\\" is a brilliant Beatles-like mid tempo charmer with a towering feel. With an even stronger Beatles feel is the upbeat \\"Shine\\", currently #1 in the UK. Need I mention the excellent harmonies?<br /><br />A real surprise comes in the folk ballad \\"Wooden boat\\" with brilliant lyrics. The soaring piano ballad \\"I'd wait for life\\" is a real winner (great instrument build up towards the end). However, the melancholic \\"What you believe in\\" has got to be the best Take That ballad ever. Awesome!!<br /><br />Take That are back, and all grown up!
B000M4RG42|2.0|The movie had a few touching moments and a few good action/war scenes but overall it was not that good.  The story line was a bit weak and felt forced. It defintly does not hold up next to some of the great movies like Saving Private Ryan.  I even think Pearl Harbor was better then this movie.
B000008ERZ|5.0|Found an old notebook with Headbanger Ball playlists written in it.  Jumped online and found D.A.D. again after all these years.  I owned this cassette and loved it (actually still have the cassette in a crate, I just don't have anything that plays cassettes anymore).  Distinctive vocals and sound you'll love it too.
B00005JMJG|5.0|One of the best romantic comedies EVER!   It is a WONDERFUL movie!
B00006F1IJ|5.0|I love this group!  They are enjoyable to listen to all day and night!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I woud reccomend this package to any si-fi fan. One of the Best Si-Fi films even though dated. A true Classic!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I love this movie! It's great to see it a little different after all these years. If you're a Superman fan, you must check out this Richard Donner cut.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|A great rendition of one of the best Broadway type musicals ever made.  If you like ALW, you will love this movie. It just does not get any better than this.  Recommend highly
0060254920|2.0|The authors idea for the book is good, however the illustrations are very weird. My three year old son does not feel comfortable seeing the pictures. There are better books depicting the concept.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Most of these CD songs are in the movie \\"Once\\". I loved the story line in the movie,and the accoustical songs give meaning and feeling to the near love relationship of the two characters. Listening to this CD, reminds me of the possibility of \\"What could have been\\". Easy listening.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Got my kids to actually sit down and watch it with me.  Teenagers!  When we did research on the history and background of the film and actors they enjoyed the movie so much more.  They said it helped put them in the mindset of the 1940's movie goer and felt the sheer terror they felt watching Dracula come to life.
0553296981|5.0|I read this book when I was in school (many years ago).  But reading it now is a whole different story.  This is an amazing book.  But of course everyone else already knew that.
B0000542D2|5.0|Remember this is B & W.  It is still great and has great music.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I loved this show and season 7 is as fantastic as all the rest. ; )
1569242739|5.0|these recipes have been tried and tested a dozen times and all work perfectly. the chocolate, vanilla, carrot cake, peanut butter, and lemon cupcakes all work magnificently. the frostings are also amazing. i've been a vegan for 15 years - and their gingercupcake with lemon cream cheese frosting is the best thing i've ever baked. we call this 'the bible' in my house. and we call Isa a genius. non-vegan friends and co-workers also go crazy for them - which is the true test of vegan treats.
0618680004|5.0|This book does a superb job explaining why religion is no more special than any other superstition.  It gives many logical reasons for the feelings of atheism that I have just felt in my gut.
B000E6UK32|5.0|Fantastic!!!  The best songs and the best videos.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I love the music.  I first heard it on the TV series \\"Nip/Tuck\\".  Great
B000M5AJQS|4.0|A thrill story about morality and faith: how to be serene when one's true identity has been disguised yet life is your chip on this big game. The ending is also an intriguing surprise, to which reflects more truth on our real lives: life is not always a fair deal.<br /><br />The casts in this movie probably encountered challenges in playing their roles for this movie is a remake of \\"Infernal Affairs.\\" Nevertheless, time, space, and culture are all different from the origin, it would be inexplicable to elucidate which one is better.<br /><br />If you explore this movie with American culture and background, you will find this movie...not bad at all.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This was candy for the eyes. The women are real women and their voices and choice of song took you on many different journeys. The drum section was out of this world. Enjoyed!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I FIRST HEARD THIS YOUNG LADY ON OPRAH AND WAS MESMERIZED WITH HER STYLE AND HER SAULTRY VOICE AND HER TALENT FOR WRITING.  <br />I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I LISTENED TO THIS GREAT CD! THIS IS A KEEPER!
1569242739|4.0|The Intro was great as were the recipies.  A newbie to the world of vegan cooking, I thought the cupcakes might taste a little...funny, but they were good.  The photos in the book were great as well
B00005V9IJ|4.0|An excellent dramatic performance by Tom Hanks.  You can't underestimate how difficult it must have been for him to hold the audience all on his own (I don't think the volleyball counts as a character).  His display of fear, dementia, hopelessness, and loneliness is genuine and powerful.  The depths of his sorrow are unbelievably well-delivered.  By the same token, his moments of hope and happiness are both believable and imaginable.  One of Tom Hanks' best performances, easily.
9707704667|5.0|Thank you for your prompt service. The book was in an excellent condition.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|Love the music. Wish they had all songs on the CD that they sang on DVD.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I have been addicted to friends since about 2000, well into the series, but I got hooked on it every week and watching reruns to catch up on what happened previously. I have been watching it almost nonstop when I'm home by myself since January when I bought it- it's now march. Plenty of unseen tidbits throughout the episodes, which I don't believe were aired at any time, especially not in reruns. One whole dvd of special extras and others on every DVD as well. FANTASTIC!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is great! Such a messed-up family, but you can't help but love them. Poignant and hilarious...the ending is fantastic! I couldn't stop laughing. At many points in the movie, I asked myself, \\"Is this happening??\\" I would definitely recommend it!
B00005JNTX|5.0|Do you like Bruce Willis and Clive Owen?  Do you like Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson?  Do you like treachery, guns, sex, and blood?  If so, pick up a copy of Sin City.  There isn't anything about the movie I would change, except Michael Clarke Duncan's cameo is kind of forced.  I'm excited for the sequel.  Excellent supporting performances by Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, and especially Benicio Del Toro.
B00005JPLU|5.0|As a guy, if this film doesn't get your blood churning and your testosterone pumped up to a deliriously critical level, well, you're either dead inside or you're a Tibetan monk with complete mastery over your cardiovascular and hormonal systems. 300 is a man's man's man's flick and is a muscular love poem which celebrates the ideals of honor, courage, sacrifice, and standing up for your beliefs. Righteous stuff.<br /><br />Not being much of a history buff, the only famous last stands I can instantly come up with are the Battles of the Alamo, of the Little Big Horn, and of Thermopylae (I guess I could also throw in Game 7 between the Lakers and the Blazers, 2000). Of these, the legendary Battle of Thermopylae is the most dramatic and is the mother of all last stands. I first heard about the Battle of Thermopylae (480BC) and the 300 Spartans way back when I was in high school, and I thought it a nifty story from the very first. A few years ago, I read Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 and enjoyed it tremendously, not caring at all that he altered things here and there as he opted instead to focus on the story's artistry, its sense of grandeur, and its mythological aspects. The filmmakers, make no mistake, take their cue from Mr. Miller. Remnants of historical facts are still somewhat represented under the film's glossy veneer but with some tweaking. You just have to see past the somewhat ridiculous parade of grotesque LORD OF THE RINGS-like creatures which Xerxes and director Zack Snyder send out.<br /><br />SPOILERS begin now:<br /><br />The film itself begins with the voiceover detailing the austere Spartan credo as we watch a baby boy quickly transition thru several phases of maturation as he grows into a young man, all the while being instructed and severely tested in the extremely brutal and uncompromising warrior ways of his people. We see him confronting his final test and craftily passing it, thus officially entering the ranks of Spartan soldierhood. This young man is Leonidas, who will become the king of the Greek city-state, Sparta.<br /><br />We pick up decades later as a Persian emissary pays a visit to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his proud, beautiful wife and Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey). The Persian calls for Sparta's submission to Xerxes, the God-King of Persia. After some deliberation, Leonidas's response isn't as much couched in diplomacy as it's couched in a sandal which propels the haughty emissary into a deep pit. Then, against the wishes of a lecherous, inbred group of mystics (who, nevertheless, control the Oracle) and the wishy-washy Spartan council, Leonidas gathers the 300 most capable soldiers in Sparta and, armed with a clever strategic plan, marches away to take on the vast hordes of the Persian invasion. If you've read your Greek history, you know what happens next...<br /><br />End SPOILERS.<br /><br />300 is bold in its scope and relentless in its take-no-prisoners attitude. It is a sweeping and sumptuously stark visual feast and would've made Frank Frazetta cream on his canvas. If 300 is based on Frank Miller's work (and it is), then Miller's art has to have been influenced in some ways by the great Frazetta. The film is saturated in mostly monochromatic hues which lend luster and even more drama to the bold crimsons of the Spartans' cloaks and the frequent spatters of blood and guts. I'm not normally a fan of slo-mo sequences, but I have to admit that, this time, the slo-mo-abruptly-segueing-into-fluid-motion (yeah, I think that's the technical term) bits are nicely executed and result in more thrilling battle scenes. The sword/spear fights are so stylized anyway that, after a while, they resemble a form of ballet. But a manly ballet, with hair on it. And, I don't often mention music in relation to films, but composer Tyler Bates truly adds an extra dimension of thrills with his thundering, pulse-pounding score. For sure, I'm gonna own this soundtrack.<br /><br />Gerard Butler comes into his own here. With his compelling and righteous performance, with towering machismo sweating out of his pores, he out-GLADIATORs Russell Crowe and, by comparison, reduces that silly ponce into a puddle of wussiness. No doubt, you and I'll be directly quoting from Leonidas in days to come: \\"This...is...SPARTA!\\" or \\"Tonight, we dine in Hell!\\" or (my favorite) \\"Give them nothing but take from them...everything!\\" As Leonidas, Butler displays all the innate qualities of leadership necessary to command an elite force like the Spartans, he's very convincing. Yet, his fierce and uncompromising temperament and his joy in battle are tempered by the obvious love and respect he holds for his wife. Whether knowingly or unknowingly, by his ideals and actions, he paved the way for the Greeks eventually routing the Persian masses.<br /><br />Lena Headey as the beleaguered Queen proves to be a match for Leonidas as she attempts to fight tooth and nail on the homefront to get the council off its collective arses and muster reinforcements for her husband. As Gorgo, Headey works hard to be fierce, dedicated, intelligent, and realistic. The actress is successful as I never doubted for a sec that this resolute woman is a Spartan to the very core. Her main adversary is the virulent Theron (Dominic West), a politician who reeks of underhandedness while holding a certain resemblance to Harry Hamlin. Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro has a showy but crucial part as the towering and deep-voiced King Xerxes.<br /><br />In the world of sword-and-sandal cinema, 300 quickly separates itself from the likes of TROY and ALEXANDER. I'd place it at the same excellent level as GLADIATOR. The story is unmatchable in its timelessness and resonance, the action is non-stop and visually compelling, the images are oh-so-memorable, and the lead characters are mezmerizing. And, from a mythological standpoint and in terms of cultural impact, the brave yet tragic 300 Spartans strike a chord as no other heroes do as they continue to be a testament to steadfast loyalty and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. \\"Go tell the Spartans...\\"wn here.

B0000024JN|5.0|I've waited way too long to buy this album.  This album is definitely a must-have in my book, not only for pioneering the area of Caucasian rap, but also for the unique style of rap that they brought.  As I get older, it makes me sad when I see the generation gap, and \\"Fight For Your Right\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" isn't part of the new generation's collective memory.  If I ever have a child, I'm buying the casette tape for this album, sticking it a boombox, putting that boombox on my shoulder, and blasting \\"Paul Revere\\" as the child exits the womb.  These songs are simply classics, and it's a crime for kids today to not know what they are.
B00004RLYF|5.0|There have been several king arthur films made over the decades. but, none have ever come close to be as excellent as this film, excalibur. we have the legend here in a 2 hour and 20 film that is worth every minute. the acting is fine, and the cinematography is breath taking. I didn't realize Ireland ws this beatiful. You will recognize some of the actors when they were young and starting out (patrick stewert-was in star trek, liam neeson has made many us films-includung an oscar nominated turn in schindlers list, nigel terry, was in troy, and of course helen mirren won best actress for the queen) <br /> <br />I was 13 when this film was released in the u.s. and i didn't understand what the arthurian legends were. as the years went by, i read about many of the legends and even read le morte d'arthur and i grew to appreciate what a fine film excalibur was and still is. <br /> <br />this film is not suitable for younger viewers asthere is an intense sexual scene and a few scenes of graphic violence. but, still worth watching.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I saw this soon after it came out in theaters, and it's one of the cutest movies I've ever seen! It was so romantic, funny, and just cute. They all did such great performances...don't rent it, buy it!! :)
B000031EGV|5.0|I like pretty nearly anything Robin Williams is in, but this was great for the whole family - a perfect vehicle for Williams' brand of slapstick humor.
B00006GA4C|4.0|...from my perspective, that is.  I'm sure somebody will jump up and slice me into pieces for saying such blasphemy, since there exists some band out there that I don't know about and had a similar style or something, but this album was way before my time, and I really don't know much about what kind of music played back then, which I'm sure is the case for many who will read this review.  Specifically speaking, the cover of The Animals' \\"Inside Looking Out\\" is hands-down my favorite song on the album, which in my opinion is the best display of the guitarist's style and best use of the lead singer's voice and style.  A real turnoff for me was the extended guitar solo in the song \\"In Need\\", with the man yelling in the background.  I don't know if there's some story behind that or if the generation of that time was into that stuff, but it just felt dragged out and pointless, kind of like a Jimi Hendrix solo, except without the unbelievable talent of Hendrix that made his solos extraordinary to the very last note.  The album as a whole is loud, energetic, but most importantly has a distinctly unique feel, a difficult feat for a rock and roll album like this.  Recommended for anyone like myself that likes to dab around in classic rock music as a hobby, not really a must-buy, but definitely not a waste of money for anyone like myself.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is my favorite CD!  I NEVER watch re-runs unless they're really good, and I never play CDs over and over again.  I played this CD continuously for a couple months, it's that good.  Enjoy!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Incredible.  I have been a casual RHCP fan for years.  With this CD, I am now a full fledged fan.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I don't often write reviews about music, but after listening to this one for two years, I feel it's become a part of me.  This is Mark Knopfler at his mellow finest: some of it soothing and tuneful, some of it gritty and bluesy, all of it down-to-earth and honest, and none of it boring or pretentious.  The lyrics are always intriguing, and the guitar, though not as flashy as his earlier work, is unmistakably Knopfler (with a hint of Carlos Santana in the closing number).  The CD flows beautifully, the backing musicians are top-notch and the sound quality is flawless.
0780622650|3.0|Okay, at least Matt tried his best with a cast better than the cast of Friends. Unfortunately, Robot was even better than him. Heather Graham, William Hurt and the rest of the family did justice to the old tv show. I loved the cameos from the old cast. The only thing I didn't like was the bad guy (an infected Dr. Smith) and the writer's attempt at the time paradox plot. I'd rather watch Time Cop again if I want a paradox.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Oustanding piece of fresh film making.  Ferrell does a stand-up job <br />in a lightly dramatic role, and Hoffman was well cast as the lit <br />prof.  The use of digital numbers and charts on screen was a nice twist, <br />and the writing was creative yet economical.  The romance was fairly trite, yet loveable.  Fine soundtrack.  Thompson and Latifah had <br />pedestrian roles that only served to keep the plot moving.  If you buy <br />into the concept (and ignoure the fact the Hoffman's advice is often ridiculous or non-sequitur), you'll find it a charming and engaging film.
B0002OERI0|4.0|My 15 year old son played this in my car and I love it.  He gave me the CD for my birthday (52nd) and Holiday has become my favorite song.  Also Homecoming is like a mini-rock opera. In fact the whole thing reminds me of a sped-up Quadrophenia by the Who.  The protagonists even share the name \\"Jimmy\\".  Looks like Billy Jo is a \\"WHO\\" fan, or maybe his dad was before he died. <br />Anyway, I jam with my buddies occasionally and we're putting Holiday and Blvd in our repertoire.
0694003611|5.0|This is my son's favorite bedtime book.  We have read it to him before bed since he was 5 months old.   He is now 19 months old and still loves it!  We usually read 2-3 books each night, saving \\"Goodnight Moon\\" for the finale.  He sings \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" on the Goodnight Stars page.  When we travel, this book is never left behind.  A must-have for every baby.
074356619X|5.0|Best purchase I've made in a long time.  Listen to it almost everyday.  Changing my life!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|My reaction after seeing this film at the theater was positive although reserved. After buying the DVD and watching the film a second time I came to realize how I had this film vastly underrated. There are holes in the conception of the film and if one wants to be hyper critical you might fail to be drawn in to its glowing romantic atmosphere. It lingers in the mind and was my favorite film of the year.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I received the package exactly how described and in less than the estimated delivery time.
B00005N9CV|4.0|A woman's voice is my favorite musical instrument. I treasure my CDs of great vocalists with a variety of different ranges and working in a wide range of musical traditions. Anita O'Day, Maria Cristina Kiehr, and many others. <br /> <br />Diana Krall has been gifted with a very fine voice and talents. But in this CD, she didn't knock me out. She seems to take it for granted that we will marvel.  <br /> <br />Her Christmas songs CD was superior. Whatever the season, if you want to listen to Krall at her best, try that one.
B00007K02F|4.0|This version of Jane Eyre is good by all means but not quite as good as others I have seen. I would watch it again but not as quickly as I would watch the A&E version. I hope you like it and enjoy it!!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|The digital remastering is excellent. The widescreen edition restores the film to the way I remember it. No longer at the end of Summer Nights will you only see half of Sandy's head. The extras are great as well. It is much more comprehensive than the last release. The only thing that upset me was that when purchasing through Amazon I didn't get the T-Bird jacket that covers the DVD. Not he biggest loss since I have a copy with it and while cute it doesnt make or break a great new edition of a timeless movie that is excellent every time viewed.
1932100385|5.0|I found the book to be quite enlightening.  I appreciated the scientific approach to studying the effects of our diet on our health.  I feel that I was given the knowledge to better assess my diet.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|On top of the fact that it has been solidified that Steve McQueen is the \\"king of cool and action\\" of the 1970's and 1960's. It's always best not to forget his more challenging films with so much character development and intimacy like Papillon is. I only wish this DVD had more extras and got a better special edition treatment than it did, but we all can't be winners. Nearly all of McQueen's films got that treatment in the past year or so, including my favorite Bullitt. Dustin Hoffman's early career proves to be impossible to top with The Graduate, Straw Dogs and this as well. I simply can't stress enough how great this movie is, upon first view many years ago, I couldnt take my eyes off the screen. That sentiment is still very much the same as I have the ability to watch this film now over and over and it still hits me the exact same way.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|As far as the movie Pride & Prejudice is concerned I do really like it.However, the A&E version is BY FAR THE BEST!!!!! However if your in for a Darcy & Elizabeth fix and don't have alot of time, this is the movie for you! It is a good movie for men as well, I have gotten many good reviews and comments from my husbands friends or my friends husbands. They found it \\"interesting\\" or \\"an alright movie\\". However, none of them complained about it or belly-ached in any way! Its a good movie!!! Try it!! You'll like it!! I promise!
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I think the title of my review says it all.  Testimony was released a year after Neal quit Spock's Beard and its 2 CDs are basically his autobiography as told through music.  There was genuine concern among fans whether we'd ever hear from Neal musicall again.  As an artistic achievement as well as a musical work, it is quite simply stunning.  Neal plays guitars, bass, and keyboards and handles all the lead vocals.  He's joined (as he is on all of his post-Beard solo discs) by the superb Mike Portnoy on drums as well as a cast of musicians on strings and backing vocals. <br /> <br />The double disc set starts with Neal singing about the \\"Land of Beginning Again\\" before busting into a killer Overture, No.1 to be exact.  I'm not going to go into detail here as this album is long and has so many high spots (2 hours!).  However, some of my favorites that stick out are the 3 overtures, Ready to Try, Break of Day, California Nights, The Prince of the Power of the Air, Sleeping Jesus, and the suite containing Oh Lord My God. <br /> <br />As far as story goes, the album chronicles Neal's attempts in his 20s to make it in the California singer/songwriter scene, where he played loads of long gigs for little pay.  Getting depressed and bitter and dumped by his girlfriend, he hits his lowest ebb as he enters his early 30s.  However, he begins to pary and go to church. He moves to Nashville, meets his future wife, gets married, starts having kids, Spock's Beard begins to take off, and he's finally a huge success.  But something inside him is restless, and through his spiritual quest, he embraces his Christian faith, leaves the Beard after 8 years and 6 KILLER albums (culminating in his opus with SB, Snow), and begins anew with this disc.  Obviously I wish Neal hadn't quit the Beard, but they and he have both done fine since the split. <br /> <br />Even though I am a devout Christian, I usually run the other direction screaming from Christian music.  However, Neal's lyrics can bepositive and uplifting even if you don't agree with his Christian message, and the musicianship and passion with which all of his work comes across is certainly worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br />In short, this is a stunning achievement and well worth your time!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|If you like Eric Clapton you will love this DvD I first saw it on Public television and knew I had to have it. And was not disappointed.
157330087X|5.0|There was no lead in on the dvd - it just jumped into a interview with Bonnie Raitt.  But the music is the only thing that matters and this cd has the best of the best!
B00005MP58|5.0|There are no words to describe the absolutely wonderful feeling you get after watching this movie!!! I have seen it hundreds of times and plan on seeing it hundreds of more times!!! This movie is one that I truly love and sticks VERY WELL to the book!!!! I highly recommend that you spend the money and get it!!! Especially if you haven't seen it!!!!!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|As always, I am very pleased with this product. I started purchasing my DVDs through Amazon last year and this purchase, like so many others, was very satisfactory. The DVD is in mint condition, as promised, and the price couldn't be beat! <br />J. Stout
0374105235|5.0|A great book, I could not put it down. Read it.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is one of those few albums we can all name that embodies not just an eight track or vinyl, but a range of experiences that are linked with his music.  It is the \\"moon-walkin Micheal\\" who was the soul of the 80's.  Owning this album is like retelling our \\"his story\\"s without the egomaniacal images and the de-constructing of his self.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites for years!!! My girlfriends all like it as well! It has to be right up there with Pride & Prejudice!!! I love it because it has the romance and the adventure and it is a movie that even my husband doesn't mind sitting down and watching! Yeah I know!! Anyhow, its a really good movie and I would recommend it to ANYONE of ANY age!!! Young or old!!!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I just can say, I felt like a teenager again :). Whenever this show was originally on, I was 18 and up and watching it now, was kinda travelling through time. Very recommandable, if you like the old shows!
B000EHSVOG|5.0|I have loved \\"Towering Inferno\\" since the first time that I saw it. I can relate to a lot of the fire safety issues presented in the movie as my Dad is a retired firefighter.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|2 pac's pac's life is a great cd. If you like 2 pac then this cd is is a must have. There is a lot of very good songs on this cd and some big name artist too. So buy this cd you will enjoy it.
B000BT97AO|5.0|It is a really special and interesting film; I like the drawing and the cartoon images a lot. I like the soundtrack, too; and I have already purchase one.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|There is a new company out there that can be employed for carbon emission offsets.  What this means is that \\"for a fee\\" they'll figure out how much carbon emission you produce and then they'll go find someone across the planet (in the land I call make believe) that will lower their emissions by that amount, thus offsetting your carbon emissions making you feel better about yourself.  This company also gets huge tax breaks for being a \\"Green\\" company.  Well, guess who is a chairman and major stock holder of this company.  Bingo.. you guessed it, Al Gore.  So ask yourself this question, is Al's movie a documentary or a commercial for his business.  You decide...
1594481938|5.0|The book cover premise of four suicidal Londoners meeting on a rooftop sounds like a bad bit of skit TV.  But, Nick Hornby fleshes this out into an engaging story.  I was particularly taken with the unpredictable, yet plausible paths that each character follows separately and together.  The writing is funny and thoughtful.  Mr. Hornby has moved onto the short list of authors that warrant a book purchase as soon as their next work is published.    Kasey Cotulla  [...]  Sacramento
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Ive been told to steer clear from this album for years and for what? absolutely nothing. And to think I could've been listening to this rather than avoiding it the whole time! A truly genious masterpeice that stands out in the Floyd discography.<br /><br />This album really steers away from the classic Floyd style musically,  likely due to Roger Waters' virtual total creative control (as I am led to believe). Rather than the sweeping effects of the early classics, ('Animals', 'Wish You Were Here', 'Dark Side of the Moon',) 'the Final Cut' steers back towards the song structure of 'the Wall', minus the 'rock' sound and plus the newer, versitle experimentation of the later albums.<br /><br />This album is way stronger than any of the Gilmour albums, and even stronger than most of the Waters solo albums. While not in the same form as the classics, this is a deep, layered and strong effort from Floyd. This album really stands out on its own. Do not let its bad rep keep you from experiencing 'the Final Cut'
B000I2J76I|5.0|This is the third time I've owned this movie. The HD experience is without a doubt the best way to watch it. The picture was crystal clear no more lines or glitches in the film just purity.If you have a Dolby Surround Sound that heightens the experience in sound. There is nothing like the total HD experience. I also have the original Leathal Weapon in HD and it's a great item too. Both in HD, both an HD experience, and both worth every penny!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|This DVD is PACKED with special features, especially a segment where the original stars reminisce about it all - Don't want to give too much away.  :)<br /><br />DEFINITELY worth the price!!!
B0009X7664|5.0|Last year I watched To Kill A Mockingbird in my drama class for the first time. We were told we'd be performing it next year. After watching the movie, I was immediatly in love with the story. <br /> <br />The movie was amazing. In my school production I played Mayella, and I love her scene in the movie. I really love the bonus disc that comes with it too. It gives you an inside look on life in Maycomb County.
B000AP04OM|5.0|It is very good movie.  I will keep the movie for my pleasure.
B000GTJT0C|4.0|This film looked and sounded great. It was an Angelina Jolie movie but it just wasn't what I expected. I come from the time were Lara Croft was controlled by your fingure tips so I don't think they captured my Lara Croft Tomb Raider. It is still a film I have seen in standard and own in HD. The HD looks great. The film itself just didn't do it for me. They really didn't capture the essence of Tomb Raider.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Detractors of this film will harp on how it sullies the tradition of Bond, how it usurps the normal conventions and reinvents something that was already perfect to begin with.  Most of these people seem to be more in love with the formula than with movies that are memorable and well-done.  The Bond series, indeed, is a beloved institution, but this movie proves that it can be so much more.<br /><br />Whereas the films were once merely vehicles for every spy trope in the book (nifty gadgets, cool cars, easily-bedded babes, and villains with vatloads of henchmen), \\"Casino Royale\\" opts instead to embrace a story with vaguely realistic elements.  Bond himself was relegated long ago to the status of a mostly meaningless symbol.  He was less a human than he was a poorly concealed fantasy of slick, emotionless machismo.  Sure, throughout the years Bond has shown his share of fear, hate, and even love, but those feelings were always sublimated beneath the glossy veneer of a man who is never ruffled, never confused, and never orders anything other than the standard shaken martini.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" opts to rip off that veneer.  Daniel Craig plays Bond with your typical bad-boy stubborness, but you can actually see what makes him human, restrained (just barely) beneath his laser-blue eyes and his awkwardly handsome smile.  He's a classy Bond, as always, but that class seems uncomfortably worn on him; he prefers to get straight to business, prefers to barge rather than sneak, and when the bartender asks him if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, he snaps back, \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\"<br /><br />Oh, he gives a damn.  Just not about drinks.  This time around Bond is up against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), illegitimate banker for the world's wealthiest terrorists.  His weakness (aside from an eye that occasionally weeps blood) is gambling, mostly with his clients' money.  Due to Bond's meddling, he's deep in the hole and facing some villains of his own.  To break even, he hosts a high-stakes poker game.  Of course, Bond is there, accompanied by Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a British Treasury official, who is there to finance Bond's hand and make sure the agent doesn't lose millions of the Queen's hard-earned cash.  She is \\"Royale's\\" answer to the Bond girl, a frigidly beautiful woman whose guard is up as high as Bond's, and this time, when they clash, the sparks that fly are legitimate.  Previous Bonds were played like men who would slip into the sack at the slightest provocation, men of pleasure as much as anything else.  Craig's Bond certainly has that in him, but he is business before anything else, and so is Vesper.  It's no wonder they are both drawn to and repelled by each other.  They both think they've got the other's number, and they play their hands accordingly, but of course, nothing is quite that simple.  At one point, Bond says, \\"You don't play the cards.  You play the man holding the cards.\\"  In this case, the man is a woman, and Bond has finally met his match.<br /><br />The poker game that forms the heart of this film is, thusly, all about taut and riveting psychology, and it mirrors the rest of the film, a movie that deigns to show a less-glossy and more-vulnerable man in the place of the Spy Who Always Gets Away.  \\"Royale\\" offers action, sexiness, intrigue, and plenty of explosions and wrecks, but its centerpiece is its dark, whirling mentality, the fact that, finally, the audience is allowed a glimpse into the heart and soul of a spy.  It may not be the prettiest view, but it sure is great to watch.To break even, he hosts a high-stakes poker game.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|The characters are not fully developed and the plot is pretty simple, but this movie is about Grand Prix racing itself.  In that sense, the movie does a superb job of providing the look and feel of Grand Prix driving. The characters and plot are merely a framework to introduce the public to Grand Prix racing, and \\"hollywood\\" dramatics are kept to a minimum.  <br /> <br />In many scenes, 1966 film technology was used to place you in the cockpit at 130 mph.  The quality of this 1966 version of virtual reality surpasses the effect achieved by placing minicams inside modern racing cars.  Most minicams record scenes of race cars negotiating a repetitive oval track.  In \\"Grand Prix\\", you are liable to loose your orientation when a camera car rounds a hairpin at Monaco at about 45 mph.  The whole picture becomes an abstract swirl of smeared shapes.  Never again will you see yourself racing down a straight away with unprotected spectators blurring passed you at 130 mph as they stand just 15-20 yards from the road.  Safety was atrocious in 1966.  In other scenes, the movie becomes an art film where racing scenes are montaged into overlaping and blended images that keep time with classical music selections. <br /> <br />The characters and the plot never over-power the movie.  They do provide breaks from watching too much racing, and the characters portray the motivations of the drivers, the owners, and the significant others who are affected by such a dangerous sport.  Several real Grand Prix champions have minor parts in the movie, which lends some additional interest.  It is a little eerie to see a movie about race car drivers where real race car drivers sort of drift in and around the actors during the \\"people\\" scenes. <br /> <br />Character, plot, 1966 virtual reality, and film artistry blend perfectly to provide an exciting, entertaining, and virtually flawless film about racing in the 1966 Grand Prix season
8489367116|5.0|I do a lot of reading and find it hard to rate a book as a favorite, but this one qualifies.  It drew me in and held be captive.  My every emotion was touched at some point.  He is so human and so flawed that he seems like someone you know yet his experiences are so fantastic and mind blowing.  I felt lost after I finished the book, I wanted more.  I feel like I knew the characters personally and longed for more interaction.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book strongly enough.
6304779356|4.0|Filmed in my home town ... Santa Cruz ! This movie rocks.. its of course a cheesy vamp film ... but all I say to that is \\" more wine please .. ! \\"
B0000A1HQP|5.0|My husband and I recently ordered this French farce from the AMAZON menu and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Although the DVD's length is barely 90 minutes, the film's plot is fully-developed and well-paced.  If you want a good laugh, you will discover \\"The Dinner Game\\" to be a tasty treat!  If you still hunger for  another helping of French comedy cuisine after sampling \\"The Dinner Game\\", try \\"The Closet\\".  \\"The Closet\\" is another amusing entree featuring many of the same actors as \\"The Dinner Game\\".
B000MNP2KI|4.0|All you will say is ouch!!! a number of times by the way.. This has plenty of action and a whole lot of pain...
1591795230|5.0|Splendid reading.  Dr. Lipton makes this scientific information both thrilling and coherent.  With very little in the way of biology background I was able to grasp his ideas and to find that they opened a whole new world to me. Thank you Dr. Lipton...I listened to the CD and y ou made it delightful listening.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|This album did not have as many good songs as the previous one that I purchased.  I liked only about two or three songs.  I do love Norah Jones though.  Here voice is so calming.
0143038419|5.0|This was the perfect read for my recent 'milestone' birthday.  Taking stock of my own personal priorities, I found Elizabeth Gilbert's life-learning journey inspirational.  Ms. Gilbert writes with refreshing clarity and unique perspective.  She gives you insight to the authentic atmosphere of each country and then brings you along to share the truly personal lessons she finds in each.  Her approach is humble, honest and humorous.  Between the many 'ah-ha' moments this book brought to me, I found tears and laughter as well.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie, only buying it because my daughter suggested it. It was pretty good-a feel good movie with some laughs. A typical disfunctional family comes together for a greater cause. The acting was great, the story line cute and an overall enjoyable viewing.
0060578793|5.0|I just got this book and I followed the instructions and I caught a rabbit within an hour of starting. Of Course I let the little thing go because I had already eaten. I would recomend this book for anyone. You might want a person to help you go through this because its a little difficult to follow. <br /> <br />sincerely, <br />a fellow woodsman
B000002MUN|5.0|Every single song on here could be on a greatest hits record. It just shows all the ranges of Petty, from slow to folk to faster rock.  Simply incredible, if you have any interest in Petty you must own this record.
630469654X|4.0|This is a big, funny, romantic movie with a terrific musical score and an awfully good cast. A perfect Valentine's Day gift for your favorite movie buff. <br /> <br />Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer are perfect as star-crossed lovers and the late Leo McKern is a charming rogue monk. John Wood is a chilling villain in a role that isn't terribly big but tightly written. <br /> <br />A wonderful film that never got the notice it deserved, this is the perfect disc to cuddle up with in front of the fireplace with your significant other and a glass of brandy - or alone in your bunny slippers with a pint of Cherry Garcia and a box of Kleenex. <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This was a gift for my Mom.  She loved the music, but especially the songs.  The voices of the girls are pure and clear - none better.
0920236162|5.0|This is my two-year-old son's favorite book.  I have memorized it, and we tell it call-response style now: \\"Elizabeth was a beautiful...\\" \\"PRINCESS!\\" \\"She lived in a...\\" \\"CASTLE!\\"  and of course, his favorite \\"...but you are a...\\" \\"BUM!\\"
0790744295|4.0|This film is essentially 4 stories woven to create equally frightening tales in true comic book format. Stephen King's brilliance shines in all four tales of murder, tragedy, love, betrayel and desperation. \\"Father's Day\\" still gives me the creeps. \\"Meteor Man\\" will leave you questioning yourself. \\"The Sea Lovers\\" will frighten you. Enjoy.
6305181810|3.0|Would have enjoyed movie more if I hadn't read the book first.  Book was terrific, movie left out a lot of important details.
0810945797|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child and this book brings a new dimension to it. It is whimsical and informative. I keep it out on my coffee table for all to see.
B00006RAKP|5.0|<br />the songs on this collection are all the best. Like stepping back in time and knowing all the words. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who even thinks they might like elton.
B000M341QE|4.0|There was a lot of violence in this movie, but that wasn't a surprise because of the background on the story.  The acting was superb for all the major characters, and it won an Oscar for best picture and best director.  I wanted to see it anyway because of the cast, but all of the Oscar nominations it got added to that, and it was not a disappointment.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|This is the best Incubus album yet, and on of the best albums of recent times. A blend of melodic rock with intense emotional guitar parts and phenominal bass lines. A great mixture of hooks and musicianship.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this version of Jane Eyre.  It is closely related to the book and Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester has such a presence on screen.  The actors of this movie suck you in so when they are posessing any feeling, you are feeling it too. Wonderfully adapted and will watch over and over.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I have been a fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd from the beginning.  He is a guitar god, and has been a great part of the modern blues. <br />This collection is a tremendous addition to blues history. <br />This is a no-brainer for anyone who has even a passing interest in the blues. <br />
B000GY729M|5.0|Not since Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run has a song grabbed me like The Killers \\"When we were Young\\". Flying down the highway with the stereo playing as loud as I can stand it, I imagine myself to be the guitar wizard I always wanted to be. The opening riff makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and from there......well I get absolutely lost in the song. And it doesn't end there. This is a great follow up to Hot Fuss, from a couple years ago. This gets played more than anything else right now. No techno noise here. Just good solid rock. There are a few tracks you'll be hearing on the airwaves from this CD. Check it out now-before you can't find it .
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I own every CD Incubus has released, and I am proud to add this to my collection. <br />These guys are in some kind of zone that never lets up.  This is as good as any album they've ever done. <br />Fantastic. <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|An absolutely great sound to this relaxing artist... of course it is a 5.
B00000342V|5.0|Take the boxed sets out of the equation and I don't know of a better deluxe edition that is on the market. From the packaging, booklet and additional tracks, including Curtis Mayfield discussing Superfly and songwriting, this is what a reissue is all about.<br /><br />The unique jacket opens to a movie still, which neatly houses the two CDs and booklet. The booklet itself is highly informative, with an explanation on how the additional tracks were found, song lyrics and a lengthy essay concerning the music and its (mis)use in the movie.<br /><br />The first CD has the original nine tracks issued on the album and the single mixes of one of my favorite songs ever, Freddie's Dead & Superfly. The second CD is a treasure chest of demos and instrumental versions of songs, including an alternate mix of Pusherman and the full-length cut of Junkie Chase.<br /><br />A pair of Curtis Mayfield radio spots and the interview - which ends the disc - are absolute gems.<br /><br />If there is only one CD set that you are going to purchase this year, you can't go wrong with this silver anniversary edition of Superfly.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I personally loved Evanescene's debut \\"Fallen\\", so much that when I heard about their new album, I rushed out to buy it.  While the \\"Open Door\\" is very good, I found it to be lacking for my tastes.  Its been a few years, and perhaps my tastes have changed (I'm finding that I enjoy bands such as Keane or Coldplay more).  Personally, I thought it was too \\"Goth\\" and only really like two of the songs on the album, \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" because it is insanely catchy, and \\"Good Enough\\" because it reminds me a bit of contemporary jazz. <br /> <br />However, if you like that dark industrial sound, this album is probably perfect for you.
B0000024JN|4.0|Who didn't listen to the Beastie Boys back in the '80's? Their crossover appeal to rap and rock fans made the group one of the biggest hits during that era. The album was indicative of their unique style of rap, along with their penchant for including heavy rock sounds/backgrounds into their music. Although some thought that this album was a bit commercialized, it didn't keep it from becoming one of the most popular releases during that time. \\"Brass Monkey\\" is a memorable track that almost every Beastie fan can sing along to, and \\"Fight For Your Right\\" almost became an anthem for party-crazed teens in the '80's. \\"Time To Get Ill\\" was one of my favorite songs on this album, since it displayed skilled Dj'ing and catchy backdrop beats. Lyrics were also easy to memorize, which always helps when you feel like rappin' along with the track being played in your car. \\"Hold It Now, Hit It\\" is still one of the most sampled tracks in today's rap songs, and its catchy beat and rhythm allows for regular play in many listener's stereos. \\"She's Crafty\\" and \\"The New Style\\" were less-known hits, but still allows for fans to enjoy, as beats and sounds are similar to other hits... but, just different enough to keep the album from being boring. With their unique style and memorable lyrics, who wouldn't want to buy this album for the right price?

B000NPHGZO|5.0|This is an amazing movie with twists, drama, romance, and disappearing acts, this is one of those WOW movies, a definite keeper. I bought it after renting the movie and it gets better and better every time you watch it. 10 out of 10 a must see for anyone!!!!!!

B000AP04OM|5.0|This is a great production with a lot of amenities involving \\"behind the scenes\\" with the production of the movie.  I got this movie because it has always been one of my all-time favorites, and I know from time to time I will watch it again!
1582701709|5.0|I do not think it is as inspirational as the movie but good to have to refresh the ideas it conveys. To pick out an inspirational saying to keep the movie momentum and make envisioning easier.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I have had my swivel sweeper for about 4 months now and I love it.  It does all it says it will do.  My 7 year old son begged to do the sweeping for me!  When the battery would no longer hold a charge, I called the customer service line and asked what to do.  She told me that the battery is only designed to last six months.  So, keep in mind when you are purchasing this item, you will spend $[...]+ $[...] s/h each six months on a new battery.  Like I said, I love the swivel sweeper, but I'll be using my vacuum from now on which only sucks dirt, not my pocketbook!
0618477942|5.0|If you enjoy graphic novels infused with acerbic wit and tug-at-your-heartstrings pathos, you will love Alison Bechdel's Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic.  The author is able to tell the story about her unusual family life in a serious, yet light way, that is engaging and endearing.  Although it is basically a serious comic book, I still found myself becoming involved with the characters and rooting for the heroine, just as I would in a novel.  The book is a quick read and a fun ride.
B000LPR9ZS|4.0|I really enjoyed this freaking movie.  Interesting twists all through the movie and in some parts it was terrifying.  If you liked the first two movies you will love this one.  Pretty awesome... go on and buy it and enjoy the gore.
B000I2J76I|5.0|This looked great on HD-DVD. I can't wait until everyone moves to HD-DVD so the prices get even better.
091581112X|5.0|Although I love this book, I don't advise people to start here on the path to spirital awakening. I am of the opinion that you should first read up on information about channeling. Doing so will help you accept the fact that you are always being protected by benevolent beings such as your Higher Self and will enable you to ebrace the notion of connecting with such a being with an open heart. In the beginning, I tried to jump right in but found that without adequate information about the subject my mind conjured up all types of fear-based fantasies about being posessed. Eventually, I learned to trust spirit and allowed my heart to be \\"touched by an angel\\". Once you begin this journey you will never be the same: your want to improve yourself mentally, physically, and spiritually will grow exponentially. This will probably be challenging for most because growth often translates into having little to no room left for old patterns and friends. Approach when ready.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version definately takes liberties with scenes that are in the book, but it is good none the less.  I have over 4 versions of Jane Eyre and I can say that i like this one the best.  All of them are from BBC.  There is much more sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  I my opinion neither Jane or Mr. Rochester are as unattracive as they are depicted in the other versions, but I like it.  Worth the buy!!
B000M06K5C|5.0|A nice follow up to \\"Silent Alarm\\". I wasn't sure what to expect but the guys from Bloc Party have managed to create another classic. Strange new rhythms with a musical sheen. Beutiful lyrics and charming vocals. A pleasure to listen to from start to finish. Catch them live if they come through your town!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Big fan of P&P, I have 2 different versions.  Great to add to a collection
B000JRYOPG|5.0|The acting was outstanding. Very believable characters. This story needed to be told. I hope this discourages our Jamaican youth from a life of violence and encourages the powers that be to do something about the Shottas culture. The fact that Jamaican actors and musicians were utiliized was awesome! I love that it was shot on location in Jamaica! That certainly lends validity to the project! Ky-Mani Marley did a great job in his role and I was pleasantly surprized with Spragga Benz's performance. Well done cast and crew! Well done, Silvera!
B000784WMW|5.0|I have just finished this version of the film and I am surprised to find that there is a version of Jane Eyre that I like more than the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version which up til now has been my favorite.  I was skeptical at first about a former \\"James Bond\\" playing Mr. Rochester, however Timothy Dalton was amazing in this role.  The parting scene between him and Jane after his secret had been revealed, left me crying for both of them.  He looked and sounded like a man for who all hope was lost.  Zelah Clark's portrayal of Jane is just what I had imagined from my numerous readings of Charlotte Bronte's wonderful work.   <br />I will say that it was a little difficult at first to get past the almost soap opera look of the filmography, however the powerful acting by the cast soon overshadowed this.  I have watched many versions of this story, and I want to see the latest version, however the Dalton/Clark and Welles/Fontaine verion will stand out as the best I have yet seen.
630476524X|4.0|If this movie had been the first in the Crow series, then its likely that more movie fans would have liked it.  However, there was a first Crow movie starring the late Brandon Lee and its to that first movie that this Crow and the other Crow sequels are compared to.  On those grounds, this Crow merits no more than a 4 out of 5 rating.   <br /> <br />Let's face it, Vincent Perez is not a good substitute for Brandon Lee.  The first 15 minutes of this movie were incomprehensible and had little to do with the rest of the movie.   <br /> <br />However, there are some redeeming factors to this movie namely the music and the cinematography.  Add in a script that has a strong second half, and you have a movie that is worth a rental at least.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This movie really ties my DVD collection together.  I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I love the way these gentlemen sing and the way they blend their vocal talents together.  I have all their CD's, and they just keep getting better and better. Their CD's are an automatic buy for me. <br /> <br />I also have their piano books and the purchase was worth the price.  I highly recommend all their CDs and piano books.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|His style is very easy to listen to, perhaps he does a little of the same style too much, but his lyrics are always revealing, witty and soul bearing.  A few of the tracs on the CD border on great, all are good, in my humble opinion.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This item brings great peace to my 85-year old mom, who lives alone. Thank you.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Her voice is as beautiful as ever and she's grown as an entertainer. For those of you that didn't take Norah Jones seriously because she sang others songs, you'll be pleased to know that every song on the CD was written or co-written by Ms. Jones.  I love this CD
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Fantastic music, wonderful blend of voices <br /> <br />When I share the album with friends, they don't return it until they have their own.  As one friend (a guy) put it \\"I enjoyed the hell out of it\\". I play it loud, over and over.  It's just beautiful.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Were it not for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, this film would have - should have - won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  While O'Brien fans may quibble about how closely the details align with the novels, this is an outstanding picture in nearly every respect.  From Crowe (as Captain Jack Aubrey) on down, the acting is superb, believable, and effecting.  In the title role, Crowe manifests - in both demonstrative action and subtle coaching - the attributes of leadership, rich in this film.  Costumes, editing and cinematography are outstanding.  Uniforms, equipment, weapons, food (yes, including weevils) take you to His Britannic Majesty's navy of the early 19th Century.<br /><br />The story line is a good balance of edge-of-the-seat action to quieter, reflective moments examining superstition, duty, conscience and character.  The scene as HMS Surprise \\"rounds the Horn\\" is harrowing, leaving the viewer to wonder, How did men in such ships sail the world?  Doctor and naturalist Stephan Maturin (played by Paul Bettany) contrasts the dutiful Jack Aubrey with conscience and not an insignificant biological insight that inspires Aubrey and HMS Surprise to its final victory.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater three times, on each occasion glimpsing something more, something different.  In addition to the film itself, the Collector's Edition includes a fine documentary on the 19th Century Royal Navy and other \\"extras\\".  The movie Captain Horatio Hornblower (1952; Gregory Peck) and the 8-part AE Series, both based on C.S. Forester's novels, are superb in their own way.  However, I believe this film to be the sine qua non of naval dramas in the age of sail.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Norah's still the bomb. She hasn't failed to produce. It's one of those nice, laid back albums, though not particularly upbeat. It's a rainy day in the city type groove. I love the flava.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|A younger person may enjoy this mish-mash of rapid scene changes, pointless, and many, flashbacks,an overlong tennis match, and a thin predictable plot line. <br />Beautiful French scenery was quickly bypassed by a cameraman gone wild. <br />Without the everpresent cell-phone (hello Paris- London calling) there would have been no sense to the story at all. <br />We never did get to enjoy the wine----
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I purchased this for my Dell laptop. At first I was debating whether I should use this as I do not have a 'High-end' PC. It took almost a month for the compound to actually kick in. It feels as though performance has increased, but at least I know I have a great product protecting my processor and video card.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|This movie was one of the worse that I have tried to watch.  The f word seemed to be the key focus of the script.  I was hoping that this would stop and the plot would soon take over.  If the f word was left out this would have been a silent movie.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has any morals. No, after about 1/2 hour of this DVD I pushed the stop button and turned on a basketball game on my set. If this is what the academy considers the best picture of the year they need to rethink and consider that hollywood should clean up the dialogue of the film industry.
B0000C8AW2|5.0|In the fall of 2005, WXPN (88.5 FM), the public radio station from the University of Pennsylvania, did a Greatest 885 Albums of All Time countdown, based on listeners votes.  We voted for our 10 favorite albums.  My #1?  Street Legal.   To put this into context - I've been a huge fan of Dylan's since the fall of 1964 when I first heard Bringing it All Back Home in a college dorm room.  Among my other favorites - Blood on the Tracks, Love and Theft, Another Side Of, Blonde on Blonde, New Morning, Saved, lately a lot of the live ones...well, most all of them are great.  So, what is it that makes Street Legal special?   Since favorites choices are just about what you like, in this case what you find yourself wanting to listen to again more than anything else, I could just say \\"Don't really know\\" and get out of here.  But how much fun would that be? <br /> <br /> On the surface of things, the musical choices I love - the horns and backup singers (from the echoed \\"sixteen years\\"  at the start, to the \\"hey, hey, heys\\" at the end) are great.   Dylan can express amazing stuff with his voice alone, but adding this fullness to the mix is like watching Picasso go from blue to the full palette.   As to  the whole Dylan's trying to go Las Vegas Revue theory - its pretty clear that whatever resemblances to that form are there (including that funny photo on the back) are satirical, a Dylan staple from the get go.  And the music is hardly smooth Vegas big band stuff - its funky, bluesy, gospely, loose Dylan music. <br /> <br /> One of the patterns I see over the course of Dylan's career is kind of a slow orbit (to allude to the line \\"drifting, like a satellite\\") from close to the sun of the mainstream, where he makes an album targeted for commercial success and a new shot of \\"critics grace\\", maybe putting himself in the hands of a producer with a distinctive sound (Mark Knopfler or Daniel Lanois), getting serious, so to speak, then moving out into the deep space of his own instincts, exploring, and letting his own natural reactions to the times and the stage of his career guide him.   Moving from the structure of folkie political songs on The Times They Are a Changin' to the inner poetry on Another Side; from the end of the epoch defining, symbolist poetry spewing, early rock star period of Blonde on Blonde to the spare, biblical, apocalyptic feel of John Wesley Harding;  from the clean folk blues stories of personal struggle on Blood on the Tracks, through Desire to ... whatever it is that is Street Legal. <br /> <br /> That's as close as I can come, and why I love it.   To me, its the hardest to put your finger on, with the most fully \\"Dylan-realized\\" batch of songs he's ever put together.   I still wouldn't know how to classify Changing of the Guards and No Time to Think as types of songs.   The latter flirts with being \\"classical\\".    I wonder if the relative failure of the album with the critics and the public turned Dylan away from further attempts at these longer, more complex melody phrases.   If so, too bad, cause he mastered the form like he did all of the others he tried over the years.  And, as someone else pointed out in one of these reviews, this is the last album before the Christian trilogy - when perhaps the inner life was most inchoate, when the need to stretch to make the music organize the chaos the greatest.   To my ear, that's great art lurking within that Vegas lounge act. <br /> <br /> OK, this is long enough, and I need to do some work.  Just wanted to say something about my favorite album.    Last thought - what might be next?   If history holds then the Time Out of Mind period should be about over, with Modern Times.    I say to Bob, go back to Street Legal and do your Love and Theft thing on your own roots - lets have some more of that big band, quasi-classical, who knows what it is stuff for the new millenium.
B000KJU182|5.0|First off, let me make sure that it is clear my review refers to the March 6, 2007 release of Billy Budd from Warner Bros. for the reasonable price of about $15. I pre-ordered it before March 6th & it arrived today. I am ecstatic. In fact, I have a confession to make; I invited all the reviewers on this page to be my friend, just so I could message them & let them know about this new release. I have also uploaded a pict of the cover from the DVD to help distinguish it from that other awful copied version.<br /><br />MOVIE - 5 STARS, DVD - 5 STARS.<br /><br />Like many, I saw this movie when I was young and it made a great impression on me- I have never forgotten it. I was in 10th grade in literature class and that was about 24 years ago (holy smokes!) This movie, adapted from the Herman Melville story is about many things- its complexity and nuances are something wonderful to behold. I have read the story and seen the movie & I must say, I prefer Ustinov's adaptation to the book. I think Ustinov did a more than masterful job of acting, directing, producing and writing. Not many people can wear 4 \\"hats\\" so very well. I personally have always felt this was his opus magnum- and I've heard it was a personal favorite of his. To me he captures so much of the struggle of what it is to be human in every frame of this movie. From the every day struggles of dignity to the struggle between the law and justice.<br /><br />The acting by all is wonderful. Terrance Stamp's screen debut is perfect. His understated way is just what Billy needed. Robert Ryan is the perfect villain- why? Because he is HUMAN- like us all, he struggles with his own demons- his are just closer to the surface than most. In that unforgettable scene on the deck at night with Billy, it is almost as heart-wrenching as the final scene where injustice makes its ugly presence known. In the deck scene with Claggart you can see the armor of his slowly drop, there's just a hint of a tear in his left eye-  and then,in a flash, his armor of evil is back in full force. Ryan's performance is just awesome to behold! How lucky are we all to have this entire movie on DVD to enjoy for years to come!<br />All of the supporting roles are well done- all believable. The on location shots in Spain on the open seas are fabulous! It adds a huge sense of reality to the whole movie. Lighting and the music is just beautiful too.<br /><br />The extra features... yes, I'm such a fanatic, the minute I checked the mail I put the DVD in & listened to the commentary by Stamp & Soderbergh. If you are looking to find out a lot about the movie, you may be disappointed- if you wanted to find out a lot about Terrance Stamp, you'll be happy. He speaks at length about his own career and some things unrelated to the movie. There is not a lot of scene by scene commentary. He does speak about Ustinov and some of the things about production. His discourse is erudite and even occasionally stimulating. Soderbergh is in the role of an interviewer in this case. I enjoyed the commentary, but one does wonder how much it would've been enriched if someone had gotten off their dead butts & done this before Ustinov died. (I mourn him openly- he was my renaissance man- funny, smart and a humanitarian.)<br /><br />All and all, I'm quite pleased to have this DVD. I'm thankful to Warner Bros. for putting it out on DVD with a quality picture and sound.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I admit that I originally purchased this soundtrack because I love Hugh Grant and would buy a CD of him reading the phone book.  However, all of the songs - even those not featuring Mr. Grant - are highly infectious (in a good way!).  Love it!!
B00000ILDE|5.0|great movie that i enjoy watching again and again.  great acting by bill paxton (typical career private that, when the #$@! hits the fan, he gets it done or dies just like our marines typically do) and paul resiner (corporate, opportunistic, self involved, profit no matter what weasely prick you hate from the first time he opens his mouth and you cheer when...).  not much sit around and talk dead time, almost non-stop action, suspense and surprises until the final credits.  a movie you want in your collection because, as stated earlier, you'll enjoy watching more than once.
0195170776|4.0|This is a great dictionary.  I love it because I have referred to it many times since purchasing it and have always found the answers to what I am looking for.  It has helped me with game show questions, crossword puzzles and word debates between my husband and I.  It is so much more than just a dictionary.  The only reason I did not rate this dictionary a \\"5\\" is because of it's size.  It is quite large and bulky, but then again, if it wasn't - it might not contain all the answers I was searching for.  This is truly an informative book which I would highly recommend.
0743246616|1.0|Based on the reputation of this bakery, I purchased the book.  I made 2 recipes from this book so far and have been very disappointed.   Looks like this one will gather dust on the shelf.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I'll first say this movie is not for everyone. It's not full of in your face action. It's a very subtle story set in Japan involving 2 people that cross paths. They lead very different lives. Scarlett Johansson is young, newly married, and tagging along with her husband on this trip to Japan. The husband is busy working. She is sort of stuck in the hotel in a culture very different from her own, not knowing language. Bill Murray is a famous actor in Japan with a advertising sponsor, shooting commercials, etc. He has been married 20 plus years. Appears to be in a period of marriage where they are going in different directions. Busy with kids, work, etc. He has alot of down time in Japan also. Doesn't understand the culture or language. <br />They strike up a friendship. Nothing physical involved. They enjoy each other's company, they both appear to want more, but realize it's probably never going to happen. The more they are together, the more they think about the pssibilities. Time comes for Bill Murray to leave. It's tough but ultimately it's the right thing to do. Alot of powerful emotions and acting without alot of words. Great Movie. <br />
B0002KVULG|5.0|Love this creepy film: from the storm-tossed opening scenes, to the horrifying netherworld of the undead under the graveyard, to the final mysterious closeup of Lucy's face. Does she still love Dracula? Or is she relieved to be rid of him? (Who wouldn't prefer the dashing Frank Langella to the sappy Jonathan Harker character?) The only part I didn't like was the red love scene. The movie wouldn't have stalled out so badly if they'd skipped that. Otherwise, what a hammy performance out of Olivier! And Langella! A good time indeed.
B000002UY3|5.0|Really uplifting album. Its fun, its bright, and it doesn't drag. Its an energetic album with a dated sound but nonetheless its has a feeling that is reminiscent of the 90s-seattle-grunge-indie era that I'm surprised it wasn't on the singles or reality bites soundtrack.
B0000062FJ|4.0|Okay, each of Santana's first five albums (everything from this, his/their debut, to Love, Devotion, Surrender) is awesome to a certain degree. And this is the weakest of it. Why? I'm sorry, but three of the four songs sung in English BLOW. It's true. Do I buy a Santana album because I want to hear Greg Rolie bellowing \\"You've got the Persuasion, blah, blah, blah...\\", whining about how \\"You just don't care...\\" (a true statement!) or babbling about Shades of Time? No. I buy a Santana album because Carlos Santana can play his friggin' guitar. Okay, the notable exception is Evil Ways. [...]. It's true. Come on, sing it with me... \\"You've got to change your evil ways/baby...\\" Pretty damn catchy, no? And Rolie makes up for singing all those crap lyrics on those other song with that little organ blurb after the first chorus.<br />Don't panic, though. If it's not sung in English (or is an instrumental, for that matter), it's probably an absolute KILLER. Soul Sacrifice is a showstopper, the song that broke them through at Woodstock and is, without a doubt, the best song here. I especially love that part when Rolie and Carlos trade bars for a couple seconds. Cool, no? Jingo would've made for a killer opener, I think, but what the hell. It's one of my favorites regardless of where it was sequenced. You want polyrhythm? Well, you got it! Waiting kicks things off on a solid note, sure it sounds a bit like Soul Sacrifice but Soul Sacrifice is so damn good that doesn't mean a thing. Savor takes a bit longer than the other good tracks here to get its mojo workin', but once it gets past that introduction it's good. Not great, but good. Treat's the only instrumental here I DON'T like - it's just kinda blah.<br />Don't start here if you're building a Santana collection - Abraxas and III are places to go. But don't miss it, either. Added bonus: The best cover art EVER to grace a Santana record.
B00001X590|5.0|When I fist listen to the old vynil LP it seems fantastic to me, now it sounds the same. It's impossibe not to own this CD.
0399230033|4.0|What I like about this book is there are only a few words on each page and on some pages there aren't any words at all. This invites creative thinking on all levels. I ask my children what the animals are thinking, what they might be saying to each other and so on. My daughter who is 3-1/2 also can \\"read\\" this since the word \\"Good Night\\" appears on each page and she knows which animal is saying it. So as a stepping stone to really knowing how to read this is a great book to start. Also, the illustrations are beautiful! A classic!!
B00014NE62|5.0|\\"Maurice\\" came out in 1987. It is my favorite of two hundred gay-themed movies I have seen.  This would make a great gift for anyone who isn't spaced-out one way or the other. I have introduced it to other gay and non-gay friends and watched it many times alone but I have never been able to complete watching it without crying.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|My 9 year old daughter and I are obsessed with Charmed so we couldn't wait for this season (and can't wait for the last 2).  We'll be sad all over again when we finally get the last season on DVD since be still can't believe it's really over. <br />We love every season, so this one is no different!  We just hate that it takes so long for them to be released!
B000I5X81K|4.0|I like all his more classical than contemporary music.
0374105235|5.0|A vivid autobiography of young boy caught in a brutal war.  Seeing through his eyes was overwhelming.  He would have been a survivor in any circumstance, he is a remarkable person in his own right.  His intelligence and straight forward writing style make the translation of this experience accessible to the reader.  A book of this nature cannot be \\"enjoyed\\", but I appreciate deeply the opportunity to understand a life so different from anything I have seen.
B000001G5H|5.0|I am not an expert but I must share my own personal thoughts about this disc before I fall over dead.  Not much more can be said but I have heard the third of Chopin's etudes played by probably fifty some pianists.  <br /> <br />Whenever I hear it I always felt it expressed a love for one to another.  Like a sonic love poem.  Love has different levels.  There is eros, filias, and agape to name a few.  In the past I have heard pianists play this with too much eros or with too much of a animal type love.  After all we are humans.  We have a higher side to us. <br /> <br />And that is where Pollini takes his pedestal.  Sure his third etude is maybe a bit faster and a bit restrained, but in the end the love he expresses is transcendental.  It is a raw, primal, masculine, powerful love bursting forth like I never heard before.  Perhaps it is the depth of Chopin's soul properly expressed for the first time.  And yes like any fine wine it takes time to acquire a taste for it (multiple listenings). <br /> <br />Thank you Herr Pollini, now I can die.
B000002J2B|5.0|This was Genesis' high water mark. This is the last album with Steve Hackett on guitar. when Steve left, he took a certain ethereal quality with him that the band has missed ever since. The music here is intense and intricate with long instrumental passages in most of the songs. If you haven't heard this album and you like this band, get it. It's all Genesis and then some.
B000286S8S|1.0|I cannot believe that I am the only one who gave this pile<br />of dump 1 star? All these rave reviews for this piece makes<br />you wonder,does anybody love hard rock anymore? Including<br />the band themselves. I am writing this review for the hope<br />that at least one person who reads this and does not know<br />the true essence of what made VH will find out. Please<br />whoever you are if your new to VH don't buy this,if you<br />really want the best of both worlds so to speak then I<br />recommend VAN HALEN,VAN HALEN 2,WOMAN AND CHILDREN FIRST<br />and FAIR WARNING,for Hagar I totally suggest the albums<br />MONTROSE,Sammy Hagar and STANDING HAMPTON. Although if you love broadway musicals and still<br />blowdry your hair then this is the heavymetal masterpiece<br />for you with such bone crushing classics like \\"JUMP\\" \\"RIGHT NOW\\"<br />and of course the very best for last \\"WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE\\"(c'mon<br />people shake your booty's clap your hands and repeat after me \\"It's<br />got what it takes\\") It boggles the mind to think people prefer 5150<br />over WOMAN AND CHILDREN FIRST??? C'mon everybody snap your fingers<br />\\"IT'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES\\"(P-EE-YUKE)
0953104907|1.0|Not satisfied.The book should be entitled, \\"the history of electic guitar\\". VERY poor information about construction,ultra low quality photos.
0061020710|3.0|I am not really certain why this particular book got 5 stars from many reviewers. I suspect they are basing it on the whole series, rather than this first book. I would have liked to have liked this novel a whole lot more than I did, but 3 stars is a fair grade. Its a short book, it reads quickly and isn't bogged down in long Tolkien-esque parading around the hillsides. In fact, several months can go by in the storyline and you didn't miss a thing by not reading about every minute of them!<br /><br />It is a tentative start, Pratchett clearly had a vague idea of where he was going, but it probably didn't fully develop until later in the series. In this book, we are introduced to the city Ankh Morpork and some of its characters. He also tosses in some playful spoofs of insurance (insewerance) and Conan. The main characters are really interesting and fun (even the names: Twoflower & Rincewind!) and manage to get themselves constantly in ridiculous situations.<br /><br />Still, its not perfect. It takes the reader until the third chapter to get a handle on what the heck is going on and then late in the book, characters and scenes get a little confused. Anyone who likes Douglas Adams and/or the Pip & Flinx stuff of Foster would like this book.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|It is the best DVD I have had in a while!!  I absolutley love the concert and feel like I am there each time I watch it!!!  I love the Eagles so it isn't too hard to enjoy their music!!  The DVD was perfect and I am totally pleased with how fast I received it!! Thanks so much
0887307280|5.0|Business owners typically learn about corporate pitfalls the hard way. After falling into a professional pit, entrepreneurs are forced to yank themselves up by their fraying bootstraps. Fortunately, Michael E. Gerber provides a well-written tutorial about business plans, strategic growth and employee management. He delivers an elegant dose of reality with strategic examples, concrete numbers and marketing insights. At times, some of the examples and scenarios are a bit sappy and repetitive, but the book scores points for delivering difficult lessons in bite-sized portions. We recommend this book to entrepreneurs and other dreamers.
1575666286|5.0|This is a very informative book.Well written and for the most part easy to read. <br />I refer to it often. Even though we do not have a very serious medical condition it has helped in focusing on various aspects of our diet and lifestyle.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|First of all, for those reviewers who are bashing this because of the Catholic bashing and negative, confrontational energy in the lyrics: this is a story about Martin Luther, the man who confronted the Catholic Church, of the time, with accusations of corruption and grave misdirection of the people in the name of God. Martin Luther was angry folks, and he was going to do something about it. Naturally, Neal shares these views absolutely about the Catholic Church of Luther's time, and most probably to a certain extent about the current Catholic Church. I'm not saying that I share the same beliefs as either Luther or Morse--I'm not even of the Christian faith for that matter--but I do believe that Luther's anger was justified and that it's a compelling story to be told.<br /><br />So, why did I feel the need to say all that? I feel it's important to put the lyrics in historical perspective. When I listen to this album--I've listened to it several times so far--I approach it the same way I do as when I read a book. I don't have to agree with everything that's being said to appreciate the story that's being told. To me, this album represents Morse's empathy with Luther's cause and passion for God. I can respect that, and even be moved by it in some way.<br /><br />As for the music, I think this is Morse's best solo work since Testimony. I found One a little stale, and ? was just lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. I still greatly enjoy and appreciate those two albums, but Sola Scriptura just has something a little extra in my estimation.<br /><br />Portnoy, without question, puts on yet another astounding and passionate performance. I must admit that I'm not familiar with the bassist, but his job here is done very well, and adds a great dimension to the music (I love that rolling bass sound). The special treat for me on this album is Paul Gilbert (Racer X, Mr. Big). He really adds something to the sound that hasn't been heard before in Morse's music ... neo-classical/shred metal guitar technique. It doesn't get overused by any means, just a hint here and there that adds a nice edge to the music.<br /><br />All in all the music has a very full, well-produced sound, and has a great structure that you can really sink your teeth into, i.e., no needless noodling passages.usic ... neo-classical/shred metal guitar technique.

0767903862|4.0|Not as funny as A WALK THROUGH THE WOODS, but very entertaining.  I really like how he combines his personal journey with history of Australia.  He tries to get inside the culture, but freely admits to being an outsider.  I would especially recommend this book if you are planning on going to Australia in the near future.  It will help you to connect with the country in a big way.

1582701709|1.0|I cannot believe how people suddenly feel compelled by The Secret.  It's crap, crap, crap.  I cannot believe that Oprah would even back this book up.  My boyfriend has the book and all he does is talk about The Secret, but refuses to answer any real hard questions when I ask him and dances around the whole thing.  The DVD is mystical nonsense.  It's just another fab that a few people are getting rich off.  The reality is, BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOOD ENERGY YOU SEND OUT.  The fact that you can get anything you want by asking the universe and reaching for positive energy is stupid and crap.  I can't believe people are brainwashed by this garbage!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I saw every one of the theatrical versions of the Alien movies before I ordered them so I knew that I was going to enjoy them.  My motivation was being able to see the director's cut versions.  However, that is not what made my experience unique.  After the delivery of the Quadrilogy, I found out that one of my dvds was faulty and would not play.  I thought \\"Oh no!  This is going to be such a pain to fix!\\"  I was wrong, Amazon.com quickly sent me another Quadrilogy free of all charges...I received it, made sure all the movies played correctly and then sent the faulty Quadrilogy back.  Thankyou Amazon.com for making that, seemingly painful, experience quick and painless!
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Most of my knowlege of Iron Man comes from the '90s cartoon, but the plot seemed to divert a bit from what should have been.  It didn't even really seem consistant with the first movies, as there was no mention of the suit sustining Stark's heart. <br /> <br />There were definately some very amusing scenes.  The mix of 3D and 2D was pretty smooth for the most part.  My disk seemed to have interlacing problems, but I haven't taken the time to figure out if it was the disk, the player of the combination of both.  There's one more story in this series of direct to dvd movies, Doctor Strange, which I'm greatly looking forward to.  But that aside, I'd love to visit this Iron Man again to see what happens after the movie ends.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|The Celestine Prophecy movie helps us change the way we see things.  The energy around all and the focused energy we exude is all important as well.  This movie is perfect for anyone who is exploring expanded thought possibilities.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Well worth the cost, if you love Madonna. As usual her live performances take expected twists that reveal her album cuts' similarity to old classics such as \\"I Feel Love\\" by Donna Summer & Giorgio, who should be honored by her tribute. The dance floor lives! Her dancer troupe excels at creative interpretation, using freshly created and applied props. The only negative comment of the video might be \\"too many fast and short edits.\\" Aside from that, this is as good as being there. Since the tour included only a sparse sampling of major US cities, many of us would-be concert ticket-buyers were left out in the distant cold and couldn't make it to the show without a major road trip. This is an adequate means to make up for that unfortunate consequence of this superstar's world-wide popularity. Look for her trade-mark figurative messages of importance to us all as citizens of the world today.
B000002WPI|5.0|their first release and it's in my opinion their best work everything after that was commercially corny...
0553382179|5.0|This book has changed my life.  If you are overwhelmed with your home.  If you feel like you are doing all the work.  If you can't stand listening to yourself whine anymore...BUY THIS BOOK.  Fly Lady really does change your perspective on housework.  She makes it fun.  She makes you love it.  I'm not kidding.  This is from someone who would rather do ANYTHING, but house work.  Now I can't wait.  Because it is so simple, and takes so little time, I have so much more time now to do ANYTHING!  I love Fly Lady and highly recommend her to anyone who can't seem to get their homes under control.  AMAZING.  [...]
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I eagerly awaited release of this album. The voices are crystal-clear, arrangements are fantastic. My only disappointment was that some of my favorites from the concert are not included (Going to the Ceili, Somewhere).
0307277887|4.0|Before purchasing the book, I saw a clip of the Showtime series Dexter.  Moving between two forms of media I was hesitant and I didn't know what to expect after watching Michael C. Hall as Dexter.  I felt the book started slowly but quickly picked up pace and I had a difficult time putting it down after that.  It's a short read but very enjoyable. <br /> <br />Occasionally predictable but overall an interesting story and an interesting peak inside the mind of a mild-mannered serial killer.  I'm interested in continuing with Jeff Lindsay's next two Dexter installations.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|There's not much information left to say about this film. Everybody had made it personal when it came to talk about this one. Well, there was, still, missing this edition (that was originally announced for Eastern 2006t summs it all. Gibson (a la Riggs) and Deschanel tells it all through the entire running commentary. And all the documentaries get really to the point (even for some of us that, working for this industry, think we've seen it all). <br />Also thinking Apocalypto is the one of the best \\"adventure\\" films I've seen in years, I can only expect the next Gibson film to be, simply and again, a crowning achievment in film history. <br />
B000M5AJQS|1.0|They should have called this motion picture \\"The Retarded,\\" because it's wicked retarded, as people from Boston like Marvin Scorcese would say. <br /> <br />I haven't seen a lot of Marvin Scorcese movies, because I tend to only watch critically acclaimed or decently directed films, but I do plan on seeing some of his other ones just to see if they're any better than this one.  I hear that \\"The Age of Innocence\\" is considered his best, but I don't like movies with subtitles so I may just wait for the book for that one. <br /> <br />Anyhoo, this movie is very not entertaining mostly because it's about a group of friends, one of whom is the usually excellent Jack Nicholson, who go around trying to make more friends and then they shoot them in the face.  Now, anbody that knows me knows I am firmly against face-shooting, but I love friendship--so this one was a coin toss for me. <br /> <br />To sum up, here is what I didn't like about this movie:  Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Donnie Wahlberg's brother, Alec Baldwin, any of the \\"dramatic\\" scenes, the cinematography, the face-shooting script, the Irish music (pointless!), the editing (choppy at best), the feel-good ending. <br /> <br />Here is what I did like: the scene where Martin Sheen flies through the air.  It reminded me of Superman III (the one with Richard Pryor), and Richard Pryor makes me laugh.  If this movie had been more like \\"The Toy,\\" they may have had something. <br /> <br />If you want to see a good movie about friends go rent the first few seasons of \\"Friends\\" or \\"thirtysomething\\" and then you'll see that Marvin Scorcese missed the boat.  Probably a duck boat, since it's Boston (that's an inside joke for Boston people) <br /> <br />Or see \\"Club Paradise\\" with Robin Williams, because he is totally on an island with friends in that wonderful drama.
B000M341QO|5.0|This movie is amazing and even better the second time around.  Great action and possibility of a sequel.  Definitely Oscar worthy!
0385337388|5.0|At the time, Doctors were Gods, and nurses were slaves. The patient was somehow a non-being. The book was right for its time, and is one that is enjoyable thirty years later. Howl with laughter, cringe in fear, this tumescent book will engage you throughout.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|The Netrebko and Villazon pairing elevates opera at its highest degree of enjoyment. It's all that opera is supposed to be: glorious singing, great music, looks and the ACTING! Watch those two and see what one can do with a rather silly story. And watch Villazon joggling with apples WHILE singing! Were 5 stars not the maximum, I'd give them 20 stars! Not to be missed. I only wish they'd do more operas on DVD together.
B0000009OP|4.0|If you're not sure where to start with Morphine, start here.  Amazing album from start to finish.  Even the sax on the title track somehow escapes being cheesy, despite its 80s wailing.  Mark Sandman's voice is sex wrapped in chocolate.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|After reviewing the Invincible Iron Man, I found that the writers had left the story pretty much the same as the original Iron Man.  There were changes made that were updated to a more 21st century version and Marc Worden stuck to the same story of \\"ol' shell head\\" when I was a boy.  Iron Man's armor was different then (red and gold) along with the golden make-shift suit he has in his armor room.  Of course, I did not understand why Tony S needed his armor to keep him alive then either.  In this present updated version, I found out why.  Iron Man back then was was a bodyguard for Stark Enterprises whereas the movie, Tony Stark was befallen by an accident and is in origin.  The story is very much like I remembered it, with the exceptional feature of the armor room.  The extras in the movie/dvd are really good too.  They will assist you in understanding Tony Stark as Iron Man.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This new CD delivers exactly what we have come to expect from Norah Jones. Nicely  delivered vocals on a collection of well written songs. Well Done.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We love this show!! It is almost an addiction. It was hard to take a break between episodes, they just keep you glued to the TV!! We never watched the show when it was first on, but we heard such good things from people we decided to buy the 1st season on DVD. We LOVED it, so then of course we had to get the 2nd season too! Now we are anxiously awaiting season 3 to come out!!
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Great, great album. And great selection of songs, too. The version of \\"Jezebel\\" is one I'm not particularly fond of, but the overall is very good. Nice to hear Belinda back.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album is a wonderful CD, great lyrics and a nice blues feel.  Worth the investment to anyone's collection.
6302859204|5.0|This movie is one of a kind , also a true story..  Ive been unable to find it in dvd format , and its not being produced at the moment. Strange huh ?
0060899190|5.0|You can't put it down...  Bizarre, funny, sad...personally reflective. Makes for great conversation too.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|if you love the Floyd this is a must. a classic of our time. (or your dad's!) if you're unsure don't be it's a worthwhile purchase but make sure you get the longer version (you may have to get it from [...]) cos one of these has half an hour or so more stuff on it.  happy viewing and make sure you put the sound through your hifi!
B000784WMW|4.0|someone finally got Jane Eyre right!  After seeing almost every Jane Eyre ever made - it's nice to see someone finally got close to getting the wonderful book made into a decent film!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The movie was great.  Although, not for kids to watch.  But the movie was fun, funny and heart warming.  The sound track is terrific.  Great songs.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a double CD and I love/like most of the songs.  I can't recall this ever happening and I grew up in the 70's so I have years to work with. It's just fabulous and I hoping the fab four will keep up the great work.  John F just shines here, but then again he always has.  I should not have to have my Rolling Stone magazine upside down. He should have been front and center..Oops I am getting off track.  Death of a Martain, Storm in a Teacup, Strip My Mind and Make You Feel Better are favorites. Also purchase B side I'll be Your Domino from I-tunes (I love it)...I don't know why this is not included on the album, but I am glad it is on my Ipod.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|If this is comedy. I am  very concerned where todays peoples heads are at.This family is not only disfunctional. It is seriously in trouble. The only parts I did like were the Volkswagon bus that could only crank over with a running start by it's owners. I loved Alan Arkin except he was snorting Heroin that ruined him for me. this is a movie that I did not like for the most part but I am probably in the minority in that feeling. never the less that is how I feel, so there you have it.... It is definitly not a kids or family friendly film

B00005JO9J|5.0|i began watching grey's anatomy the third season, so i missed a lot! <br />i would have to ask other people what went on the previous seasons or would have to infer what was going on.i love this season because everything is just so fresh & its great to see how much the character's have changed.although i was a bit upset that there were only a couple of episodes, this was definetley an amazing buy.
B00008972S|5.0|West side story..it is growing young day by day.keep it in your library.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|i first started watching gilmore girls way later when it first premiered. i was so in love and obsessed with this show with the first couple of seasons, the last few, after rory had her first time with Dean, i no longer was interested in the show, and actually began despising it. My love for Jess was   the only thing that would keep me watching. However, i bought this for my sister as a birthday gift, and of course she loves it, and i had forgotten how much i loved the first seasons of gilmore girls as well.  The writing was funny, Rory's character hadn't changed that much, and of course Milo Ventigmilia is hot.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This, with McQueen's Le Mans are the pinnacle of motor-racing cinema, the people involved, the level of commitment and production, the innovative visual context and a little less professional and paranoial era, got together to create a masterpiece, away from cliches (If any, it created some that are now commonplace in Hollywood). This can never be done again in modern times. Can you imagine anybody allowing or wanting a camera (a big cinema one) strapped to a modern F1 car DURING the race?. <br />Plus, the additional material is superb. Definitively a must have for any piston-head. <br />
1582701709|5.0|I have bought several of these books and the matching DVD and have given them out as gifts. As a result I have influenced many people and have made a difference in their lives. I have followed these principles personally for most of my business career and I know they work.
1400064287|5.0|Excellent book.  Easy to read.  Entertaining.  Practical.  Has great explanations and numberous examples of how we can have our ideas heard, understood, remembered, and acted upon. And the cover is neat, too!

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Sorry, this version didn't cut it for me.  I guess I have been spoiled by too many BBC versions of Jane Austen's work. Neither actor was as convincing as Darcy and Elizabeth as Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
B00000DFTH|5.0|This was a great disc I picked up on the day of release, new black sabbath with the original line up, unthought of for so long.  All the classics with Ozzy.  Now I keep waiting and hoping someday they will get together and do a new full album, but hope is shrinking.  The two new songs are OK, Pscyhoman sounding more like recent Ozzy songs, but Selling my Soul sounds more like the Iommi riffs of past.  Must have CD for the sabbath fan, the first official live release endorsed by the group with Ozzy on vocals...20 years after his leaving.  Live at Last has been around for years, but was never endorsed by the band, and Live Evil, although good in its own right for DIO fans, just is not Ozzy.  So Get this, its Sabbath at its best.
1582701709|1.0|It's an old idea, warmed over.  Some one is making alot of $$$ on desperate     <br />stressed out people.
B00006LJ72|5.0|The music is excellent and the purple velvet box looks nice as well.
0743496728|5.0|In \\"Nineteen Minutes\\", Jodi Picoult presents a case for how a normally sweet and sensitive teenager can become a killer. He is bullied at school, deserted by his one constant friend, lives in the shadow of his superstar older brother to whom he bears no resemblance, and is basically left alone to live in a world of make-believe video games. Picoult digs into his past, looking for abnormalities at birth, in childhood, behavioral patterns that would have alerted his parents, but none appear.  <br /> <br />The author humanizes Peter so completely that you can understand, with each incident of bullying and as he loses bits and pieces of himself slowly, how he could become someone unrecognized by his parents but understood by others who have been in the same situation. You ask yourself, \\"Is he justified?\\" and if you answer yes, what then, is an appropriate solution?  <br /> <br />This is a polarizing story as are the real-life tragedies which continue to occur. Ms. Picoult urges us to think about our responsibilities to each person we come in contact with. Not simply to avoid becoming a victim, but also, to learn to live as we are meant to with each other - humanely. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult is known for exploring \\"hot-button\\" issues but this is by far her best work.
B000002J09|5.0|A great CD!  I have had this before, in LP and CD and it was wore out.  Had to get another one that would actually play.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It's a memory card, it works just like it is supposed to.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|I like the CD  as I like this kind of music, but it seems a little slow and repetative of some of her others.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This was Il Divo's best so far.  Even my husband enjoys it.  Highly recommend it to everyone.
B000M341QE|5.0|I love Leo, and this film is packed tight with fabulous well known actors we've all enjoyed over the years.  The ending absolutely floored me, I totally wasn't expecting it & when it happened I actually jumped in my seat.  Great movie with an unexpected twist at the end.
1582701709|5.0|This  book  discusses the Secret Law that we can use to increase the possibilities in our lives.  It does not take away the good things we have developed but is full of information which allows us to be and to develop more of all that is possible. If you have ever sought to develop a more positive outlook in life, this book stands ready to enable you to do just that.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I bought one of these for me and one for a friend who is an AVID music collector.  He likes the Foo Fighters but hasn't been a raving fan of them until this CD.  He ranks it among his top 5 best ever (he has 1000's of all types of music).  Don't be intimidated that it is a live recording, they keep the crowd noise to a minimum, unless it is enhancing the recording.  Unlike many live recordings where the crowd noise is obnoxious on this recording it isn't noise, but rather interaction with the performers.  This will likely become your favorite Foo Fighters CD, especially if you're an \\"acoustic\\" junkie.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|If Spielberg wanted to make the point that violence begets violence, he should have spoken through other characters.  I find it hard to believe that the squad sent by Mossad, the most effective intelligence organization in the world, would be a group of self-doubting amateurs who could be taken in by a girl in a bar.  For a good twenty years preceeding the events in the film, the Israelis successfully hunted down escaped Nazis all over the world.  For the squad to have to buy information from a French family isn't believable either.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|It was exactly the spare battery pack I had looked all over town, out of town, and online for. Amazon had it and I got it tout suite and can now go further afield with my camera without worrying about when/if the battery pack is going to die on me. The price was great, too.
0140157352|5.0|I received this book 2 days after I place my order. The person was pretty fast because school had already started and I needed the bood asap.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|This album is an improvement from Norah Jones' second album. Her first one, Come Away With Me is an instant classic. The first time you listen to it, you're hooked.  <br />Not Too Late, however, takes a couple of listens, but it grows on you like a pretty flowerbed. The songs are largely her own, along with guitarist/boyfriend. But you can still hear her influences. I would prefer to have Nora go in more of a challenging, jazz-oriented direction, but her vocal quality is excellent throughout. In fact I believe Norah is potentially the next truly-great Jazz singer of out times. She is playing more folk/blues-oriented music this time out, but give her time--she'll develop as an artist! <br />Wouldn't you like to say you were listening as it happened?
0385472951|2.0|The book is predictable, and the ending only serves to acknowledge the failure of Grisham to establish a sensible and believable plot. Once you realize the entire premise of this book hangs by a thread you are forced to contemplate the alternatives, and in doing so reveal the \\"twist\\" ending to yourself half-way through the book. Grisham wrote one or two decent books early on in his career and his continued success is a tribute to his ability to recycle formulaic plots into stories just original enough for most literate adults. Next time someone tells me to read the \\"new\\" Grishman book, I'll just say \\"No thanks.. I've already read the Firm.\\"
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Super fast shipping! Brand new item, no damages, and packaged with care. Hope to do business again!
1582701709|5.0|The best book that I ever purchased. An amazing journey into the realm of truth. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It will be a book in your library that will be one of THE most valuable and one that will be refereced frequently. Raise your arms high and embrace abundance in every aspect of your life.
B000LC55F2|2.0|\\"The Prestige\\" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was. <br /> <br />WARNING: Spoiler ahead! <br /> <br />Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that. Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved! <br /> <br />A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended...
B00004R9A4|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it at a young age. So I sought it out when I was older and I still enjoy it just as much. It is a great adventure for all ages and the live action animation with the cartoons and people interaction is something rarely seen in many flicks now a days; it is a great effect.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna is the hardest working woman in the music industry. Period.  And she is so energized by performing that she is truly a sight to see.  She will keep you entertained, she will keep you dancing, and she might even make you think. <br />   This DVD & CD is the perfect example of that - the DVD has her ENTIRE uncensored performance from London, with every song beautifully flowing into the next.  If you didn't see the show live, this is truly the next best thing.  The CD has a great number of tracks as well (all of which are on the DVD), but it is missing a few that are on the DVD.  But if you have the right DVD software on your computer, getting the other songs off the DVD and making them into mp3's isn't very difficult. <br />   I really wouldn't have thought I'd like Madonna a few years ago. But the first time I heard 'Hung Up' I was really intrigued and began to listen to her more.  And, before I knew it, I had every song off her album (almost) and was listening to them all regularly. <br />   And the live versions of the album songs will blow you away if you haven't heard them already.  Incredible remixes and dynamic choreographed dances will keep you watching this DVD over and over again!  She is the true definition of an entertainer, and proves her worth in the music industry over and over again. <br />   If you like Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor album, or you are just intrigued to see the new (dance) direction her career is going in, this DVD & CD is for you.  Great price as well - same as iTunes, but you get extra bonus features (backstage stuff) and of course an actual disc, rather than just a download.  This is the place to buy!
0790729342|5.0|This is one of the best post-apocalyptic action classics ever. Not to mention one of Mel Gibsons best roles. It was a favorite when I first saw this science fiction great and was one of the reasons I wanted to see Mad Max and Mad Max and the Return to Thunderdome. Furthermore it is one of the reasons I am anxiously awaiting another film of the same type i.e. a Road Warrior 2. All in all a great action flick that is a must have for all action adventure fans.
B000H5TZXG|5.0|Every song on this album is just amazing.  Justin really went out on a limb with this album, but it totally worked.  I listed to the whole album for the first time with my jaw on the floor.  Every beat, every word, every chorus is just flawless.  Justin rocks, and he has truly grown up from NSYNC (and I wouldn't be caught dead buying an NSYNC album, by the way).  He is so good at making music, and I will be watching his career intently for a long time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the great series of all time.  It had a great story, and great characters.  It was a huge injustice to cancel the series.  There will be no other show like it.  It will go down in history as one of biggest mistakes fox has made.
B00009W0U4|2.0|This movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy. It shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it. Not a movie for children at all!
0440180295|5.0|Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, and so the novel is also unstuck from the shackles of linear time progression.  Throughout the work, Vonnegut explores the modern world, World War II Dresden as a prisoner of the Germans, and the planet Tralfamador where Billy is displayed like a zoo animal.  Everything is happening at once, so we get snippets from various points of time and the plot lines are disconnected.<br /><br />Through this narrative, Vonnegut works his themes like a virtuoso.  He shows that war can do nothing but destroy, that nothing flowers from the remains of war except a shell of what could've been if there'd been no massive deaths, no societal collapse, no degradations and dehumanizations.  He lives through Billy Pilgrim as a witness to the firebombing of Dresden, through the lives lost to a greater degree than Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  He shows that horror so vividly that it's the very horror of that experience that tosses him about time and space like a pinball in a game.<br /><br />He rips through the concept of free will, when Billy decides he can just change history and prevent war.  He shows the futility, illustrating it with this great line, \\"writing an anti-war book is like writing an anti-glacier book.\\"  Billy can't simply ignore war, and his sanity erodes as a consequence.  Everyone should just ignore war is the advice of the Tralfamadorians, who have their own history of wars, once even destroying the whole universe.  But Billy is human and can't understand the circular nature of time.<br /><br />Vonnegut doesn't so much write a novel as have a heart-felt conversation with the reader, throwing in some fiction, some religion, some politics, and a laugh or two. After reading this book, you'll have new understandings, and a great new friend.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
B00005JMX6|4.0|You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school. <br />This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too.
B00006L9ZT|3.0|An earlier reviewer said that since Wagner was a great writer and essayist he had no need to infuse his operas with political meaning. I'd rather ask how such a deeply political person as Wagner certainly was could possibly NOT try to get his message across through his art. <br />Be that as it may, this production doesn't care about politics one bit. It's old-fashioned in more than one sense of the word, and in fact may just be the single greatest anachronism early 21st-century theatre has to offer. (It's still playing at the Met.) \\"Liking\\" it or not, therefore, has nothing to do with taste and all to do with the fundamental opinion each of us has of what theatre is all about. <br />So, given the fact most of the reviewers here seem to believe opera should be a museum of the past, what really astonishes me is that not one of them even mentions the director's name. It's not James Levine (who does an astonishing job of conducting the score.) It's Otto Schenk. <br />
B000KRNCYY|5.0|We really like this album. We have seen it on TV and love the songs. We already have tickets to see them in April. I can't wait!!
B000JSI7AI|5.0|This film broke my heart.  The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission.  The actors' portrayals of these characters was almost disturbingly realistic, believable and moving.  I read the short story on which this film was based and was surprised at the ability of the film's director to stick so exactly to the author's words and to paint the pictures described.  This is a truly great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can look beyond the simple fact that this tragic romance takes place between two men.  While central to the plot of the story, this film is not about homosexuality per se.
B00005JPLU|4.0|If you've read the graphic novel, here are some changes:    1) Gorgo becomes a major character.  In the graphic novel, she's on around 3 pages.    2) There's a whole subplot about the goings on in Sparta proper during the march and battle.    3) No 'Stumblios.'    Other than that, it's a resonable adaptation of the graphic novel.  Gerard Butler is very good as King Leonidas, and many of the other characters come through also.    Be warned that if you're a purist of the 300, but haven't read the graphic novel, it's not as historical as it could be.  The phalanx fighting is quite good, although there's a fair bit of sword play as well.    BTW, the sky goes dark twice.    All-in-all, pretty good but not perfect by any means.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Well, I wanted to wait until the HD-DVD of Universal for the film Scarface was comming up. Obviously we'll have to wait a \\"little\\" longer. <br />The picture quality is much sharper than all previous releases - US 1998 C.E., UK 2000 C.E., US 2003 A.E. <br />The title sequence - red font on black background, till now always faded and blurred is crystal-clear, simply incredible. <br />The high sharpness is still bought with minor grain througout the entire picture.Nevertheless no comparison to any previously released version. <br />Concerning the sound - completely new restored, the great soundtrack of Giorgio Moroder shines in a new light resp. new sound - more powerful recorded and the shoot-out's - especially at the end with Tony Montana's M16 + grenade launcher - really crash with a vengeance. <br />As if the movie was released in Dolby Digital era. <br />Who wants/likes the original soundtrack of Scarface, still has the Collector's Edition or Anniversary Edition of this film. <br />Everyone who doesn't want to wait for the \\"possible (?)\\" HD-DVD of Universal can buy it without hesitation.Great film in the so far best version available. If you watch it, watch in DTS 5.1 - you won't believe your ears. <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna has stood by far the test of time. When people call bald headed crazy chichs like Britney or Celine Dion 'Divas' it always makes me cringe! It would be like comparing Green Day to Led Zeppelin, insane comparison, leagues apart. And in this WONDERFUL DVD/CD set, Madonna really shows why she has been at the top since her debut in the early eighties!<br /><br />The DVD is absolutely FABULOUS, if you are looking for a superb sounding and visually stimulating dance DVD this is it! She does a song with the backbeat of Disco Inferno and even comes out in the Travolta suit and does the Saturday Night Fever dance perfectly! The DVD I cannot say enough about. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT - quite a trip for sure...<br /><br />The CD is just as good, and I have not quit listening to it in my car, she does different styled versions of like a virgin, and erotica, and they are PHENOMENAL!!!<br /><br />I cannot say enough, the only downsides are that she does not do Hollywood, or anything from Bedtime Stories which are some more of my faves of hers. But it does not take away the shining performance laid out for you and your eyes and ears.<br /><br />If you want a quintessential Madonna, this is the real deal! I am a rock fanatic, but man Madonna really makes Disco fun in this awesome set!!

0783225482|3.0|LUST, LIES, BETRAYAL, MURDER...(OR SOMETHING LIKE IT) HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG? THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FROM THE 90'S. ITS ORIGINAL, COMICAL, AND GETS YOU THINKING ABOUT ETERNAL LIFE, AND THE EFFECTS IT COULD HAVE ON YOUR BODY! SPRAY PAINT ANYONE? WATCH IT, TRUST ME!
1582701709|1.0|The so-called \\"Secret\\" is nothing that isn't already inside you - that you don't already know. Sometimes, someone has to say the same thing to you ove and over using different words until you finally get the bright idea, but the the only \\"secret\\" is these people are gobbling up tons of your hard-earned dollars from unsuspecting people who are in rush to find out how their lives can be better - when it's been slapping them in the face all along.  <br /> <br />Someone told me to buy the DVD and watch it for 30 days in a row. The money was definitely a waste, and I watched it only once. No fool in their right mind would sanely and rationally watch this brain-washing nonsensical drivel 30 days in a row and expect it to make any sense, when one time is once too many. Surely the book would be more boring to plow through than to watch over one and a half hours of it on DVD. <br /> <br />If you want to waste your money, be my guest. My copy of the \\"Secret\\" is on the floor waiting disposition. Had I known such a big splash would have been made over this silly thing a couple of months later, I probably probably could have sold my once-used copy for $50! <br /> <br />I feel sorry for all the fools who are parting with their hard-earned money on this garbage just to find out the only \\"secret\\" is that they've been bilked out of money that could have been better spent on necessaities.  To each his/her own.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|A top performer gives a top performance.  Great tunes, and Madeleine's unbelievably beautiful voice does them justice ... and then some.  She sings with great clarity and deep feeling.  A must-have album.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Great cd. I enjoy almost all of the songs and I am way over the age this band probably normally appeals to.  I love the melodies.
B0007KTAU4|3.0|This cd has some nice tunes, and Carla has a sexy, come-hither voice, making for a seductive album.  But ultimately her songs all tend to sound mostly the same, and the monotone of her voice and style can tend to annoy.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer just goes from strength to strength. Another incredibly well crafted Album from him. His vocal style combined with his excellent guitar work makes for very easy listening indeed.
0060536977|5.0|Awesome.  One of the best books ever on all that nano-technology futuristic stuff.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|If you already like Norah Jones then this Album will blow you away. Norah has stuck to her formula of heartfelt Jazz with a touch of Country lilt but at the same time has found an aspect on this Album that is very appealing. Definitly her best so far.
0786191465|5.0|He was a concentration camp survivor; he is a psychologist/doctor.  He found people in that setting that still had purpose ...He learned that \\"the last of human freedoms was ... the ability to choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances.\\"  In his after-concentration-camp-counseling, he would asked patients why they did not kill themselves ... by their anwsers, he was able to determine their purpose and in many cases, help them to help themselves.  Small book; tremendous message.
1582701709|5.0|I said *makes* for a reason. This audio book has become a big part of my life. Every day I am better in every way. Thanks for a positive future, and a very happy NOW.
B000EHSVQ4|3.0|This four disc set offers a more complete understanding of the film and the decisions director Ridley Scott made with staff support along the way to bring it to the screen. The extra disc support a picture of the actual history as well as an understanding of how the various technical teams supported the creation of scenes that viewers would believe.
B000255LNE|5.0|This is a wonderful assortment of love songs. If you a Phil Collins fan, this album will bring you endless enjoyment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|First of all, I'm amazed at some of the negative reviews which suggest, among all things, that this album sounds like any other album out of the 90s, and is extremely unoriginal. While I respect different viewpoints, such suggestions show juvenility, naivety and/or simple ignorance. This album sounds nothing like any other albums from the 90s (except some weak attempts to copy this album) and neither is this album unoriginal.  <br /> <br />Secondly coming to the album itself, while I can't add much to the praise which everyone else is bestowing, I want to note that in terms of pure influence, this album is second to none (Nevermind, Sgt. Peppers, Pet Sounds come to mind). This album was before its time, and seems to fit more comfortably in our increasingly wired world. <br /> <br />I have recommended this album to all I know and far from any complaints, I only get converts :) .
B000ICL3KG|3.0|WITH ALL THE HYPE, I EXPECTED MORE.  IT WAS A GOOD START FOR THE CAUSE.  THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AFTER THE AWARDS SHOW, SO EVIDENTLY I'M IN THE MINORITY.  PERHAPS THE NEXT TRY FOR GLOBAL WARMING, IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE, WILL BE A BETTER PRODUCTION.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I saw this tour in person in Philadelphia so I just had to get the dvd.  Again this is the best show ever!  I love Madonna!
074356619X|5.0|IF YOU HAVE THE TIME, THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN TO THE SECRET.  IT GIVES YOU TIME TO SOAK UP EVERY WORD LISTENING TO RHONDA BYRNE'S VOICE.  I'VE READ THE BOOK, WATCHED THE DVD AND LISTENED TO THIS CD SET.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|I loved this DVD enough to buy each of my friends a copy who love her too.  You won't be disappointed and will pick this out of your collection to watch often. It really is a collection of the best!
0446691437|5.0|This books explained that I am not alone in my struggle to stay in the creative life.  Very helpful.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Typically I don't like gory movies. This is a gory movie, but it goes beyond that. It makes horror in a real world setting. It draws you into liking the main characters which makes it more tragic all the bad things that happen to them. The blood and gore wasn't really needed. I'd have preferred more spooky moments, but this movie kept you wondering if even the main star/stars would survive. This is a great popcorn movie. Nudity and sexy women are also a big plus, but it wasn't nudity for it's sake. The storyline of young men vacationing would be an obvious choice for why there was sex and naked women in this movie. Hopefully Hostel 2 is as good as this one or even better. I'd put this movie up there with SAW & SAW II but rate it better than SAW III. The ending had a good revenge theme but it left me a little underwhelmed.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|My wife and I absolutely enjoyed this video!  It is very well done and extremely informative.  We both highly recommend this to everyone who cares about our environment.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|personally I am a sucker for a good musical...and music in general...This however is exceptional.  I love it, it is one of my favorite versions of the musical, and I have been eyeing this cd for sometime now, i am so happy to finally have it in my collection.  the quality is good, the music great, and the voices are fantastic!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|THIS IS GREAT MUSIC, THE COMBINATION OF ENNIO & YO-YO IS EXCELENT, I WILL RECOMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ENRICH THEIR LIFE WITH GOOD MUSIC...
073934272X|5.0|I have always been a zombie fan, mostly the Romero style (Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead), the kind that make you think about why they are here and what makes them tick - not the \\"Oh Noes!\\" reaction type movies. <br /> <br />I heard about then read World War Z, loved it, then I bought the Zombie Survival guide Audio CD. But you really must read it to get the whole feeling of the book -  part comedy, part survivalist logic, with a lot of though given to the whole subject. <br /> <br />Max Brooks rocks. <br /> <br />A must-read for any self respecting zombie survivor.
B00003CX5P|5.0|It came fast, in great shape and hubby loves it.
B00005JPG1|4.0|\\"Zodiac\\" is the most brilliantly uncreative movie of David Fincher's career. For a popular director of such renowned innovation, Fincher has once again avoided all expectations with a film unimaginably straightforward in execution. This may sound like sarcasm, but it is not. I came into \\"Zodiac\\" wondering how Fincher would use his usual visual flair in a film tackling actual events, events from which some still hold wounds. I was shocked to find that Fincher had dumped the usual tricks (imaginative credit sequences, CGI bolstered visuals, editing that makes MTV jealous) in place of a very straightforward approach to the material. By doing so Fincher has allowed an extremely riveting and compelling story to become a riveting and compelling film, and has put to shame those numerous generic Hollywood directors who seem unable to make genuinely entertaining mid-budget genre movies anymore. \\"Zodiac\\" is better than their films because Fincher knows his story, knows his characters, and knows the exact tone and style with which to present them.<br /><br />The story is easily the most important ingredient of \\"Zodiac\\". First of all, everyone loves a good serial killer movie. Add to that the fact that this is a true serial killer story, taking place over many years and involving numerous interesting people, and you can't go wrong. Plus it has never been solved, an intriguing bonus. The filmmakers have obvious gone to great pains to research this film, and their understanding of the events and players involved really shines through and carries the tone of the film. Accuracy is certainly attempted, in terms of the catalogued facts, and even where liberties have been taken, in terms of depicting events and conversations impossible to recreate exactly, it seems that nothing completely unsubstantiated has been pawned off as fact. The movie is still just a movie, and the idea of `accurately' portraying any actual event is always questionable, but the filmmakers here seem to understand that the greatest disservice they could have done to the material would have been to falsely embellish it. The story is interesting enough, and the people involved compelling enough, that to try to make the film an exercise in cinematic enhancement would have seemed cheap and inappropriate.<br /><br />And Fincher, the king of cinematic enhancement, shows surprising talent in pulling this off. The story is told in a very straightforward manner. There is little fancy camerawork, the editing is noticeable only in how well it handles the scattered chronology of the story, the actors are allowed to use talent alone to get across their characters, and the film itself is astonishingly uncomplicated. There are a few creative moments, such as a time lapsed sequence of a building being built, but even these are integrated so well into the general tone and pace of the film that they are hardly noticeable. This is a key word, because Fincher has always had, or lately anyways, a very noticeable touch as a director, whereas here, if you did not know who directed, or who David Fincher is, you wouldn't think twice about the direction while watching. Which is the film's greatest success, the fact that it utilizes and relies on its compelling story to drive the film, and doesn't try to use the film to make the story compelling. Does that make sense? The ability to simply tell a great story is still the most important talent needed for a great director, a talent not readily found, and Fincher here has proven that even without his usual bag of tricks he is still a extremely able director.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" isn't a masterpiece, or even Fincher's best film, but it is one of the best mid-budget crime films I've seen in some time. It knows just what it is trying to be and do, it concentrates on doing that well, and pulls it off with great success. It's actively compelling in a way few Hollywood films manage and its story is one that will continue to intrigue for some time to come. David Fincher has once again, and in a very different way, proven himself an exceptionally gifted director.ome. David Fincher has once again, and in a very different way, proven himself an exceptionally gifted director.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is probably one of the best shows of 2006. Each & every episode had something unique to offer. This DVD also has some great extra's which definetely make worth buying.
1881273156|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read on realationships and marriage.  The author brought extreme clarity to his concept, these 5 languages.  Other books allude to or describe nearly similar concepts and practices, but none seem to describe things as well defined as this book does by grouping them in 5 specific type languages.  Also similar could be said of the book's \\"love bank(ing)\\" concept, which ive read similar things alluded to in other relationship books, but nothing with so much clarity and definition as this book.  I loved this book!!  It really helped me understand my own manner of loving and understanding love, and thus my expecations of what love is (to me), as well as groomed me to see more clearly others manner, and helped me finally be able to SEE in a logical way that others manner might not be my own (different love language), and what their manner might be if different from mine.  That very skill alone was worth far far more than the cost and the time to read this small and easy read book ever were.   <br />YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK!!!  The concepts and teaching within it are priceless!
B00004RF98|5.0|Our whole family loved this movie.  It's funny, entertaining, free of offensive material, and heart-warming.  What a talented cast!
068987474X|5.0|Every single woman should read this book!  I had no idea men actually think this way...totally hilarious!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|While the 'cautionary tale' plot of 'Children of Men' may bore some, this film is far and away the best directed motion picture since 'Munich' -- and I say this with my sincerest apologies to Mr Lee and Mr Scorsese who both directed fine pictures in 'Brokeback Mountain' and 'The Departed' respectively but who broke new ground in neither. Simply put, the storytelling on showcase in 'Children of Men' is nothing short of breathtaking.  <br /> <br />4.5 STARS... I was thoroughly engrossed every second of the film... but the over-all story feels a bit out-dated.
B00002E224|5.0|This a lovely real-world love story where the characters meet on a train in Europe and decide to get to know each other better in a day and night stay in Vienna. They talk about interesting things, they stroll through beautiful places in Vienna and they fall in love!! It's so sweet how their relationship develops during the movie that you may think that the love of your life is waiting for you somewhere on an European train!! <br />I simply love this movie!
B0009SOFGI|5.0|This is a nice introduction to the man who had so much influence on the rock and roll to come in the 70's and 80's - iggy pop... the stooges are kind of somewhere in between the later sounds of punk rock and the experimentations of the velvet underground.. this album features many direct rockers like 1969.. but also delves into such strange territories as the delightful 'we will fall' - which clocks in at about 10 min.. This is a nice departure from what was going on in the rock scene at the time -very influential - and very fun..
B000002J1Y|3.0|The choice of music is perfect (one is missing, which is \\"South side of the sky)  This is the perfect live hightlight of the three previous CD <br />(Album-Fragile-Close to the edge) but the sound is horrible. <br />You should consider Keys to Ascension Vol I and II for great performance and sound, instead of this one.  Music is five star but sound is one single star, hence the mid section rating of three stars.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I loved the series 'Supernatural'. It is scary withpout being revolting. Also the stories have a very human touch which makes them more attractive. The changing relations in between the two brothers and their father have been very gently potrayed. And... the cast is definitely very good looking. Jared is cute with his dimples and Jensen is drop dead good looking !!!! I have really enjoyed the first season.
B000301YY8|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband for Valentine's Day because he loves \\"You're Beautiful\\". We actually love the whole CD. James Blunt has a different sound in his music, but his lyrics are great. This is an awesome CD!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|A new album just washed up on the shore of this deserted island that I'm shipwrecked on and has created a problem.  Something's going to have to get kicked off the island.  There is only room for 10 discs on my Deserted Island List and this new Neil Young Live At Massey Hall has to stay.  There won't be a challenge or a task...Massey Hall has immunity.    <br /> <br />Ok, enough of the Reality TV analogy.  What we are talking about here is the 2nd release from Neil Young's Archive series.  This one is Live At Massey Hall 1971 and it captures Neil on stage performing solo a group of freshly penned tunes that would soon end up on the famous Harvest album.  Incredible versions of 17 songs with outstanding sound quality.  A real gem unearthed and revealed. <br /> <br />There is a companion DVD with concert footage, and some old documentary type film clips.  Clicking around the DVD I found some more video with Neil on the Johnny Cash Show and a radio interview where Neil discusses some of the tunes. There is a photo gallery, some original lyric sheets and newspaper reviews. <br />The DVD also has high resolution 24 bit/ 96 khz audio which sounds great through my home theater setup. <br /> <br />Wow...thanks Neil for sharing this music with the world.  What else is in your archives?
B000F3AAUW|3.0|I was looking for a new sound in music. I love the song \\"Crazy\\" which they played on the radio first and I am amused my the Boogie Monster song. However, his voice gets a little annoying after a while and I am not quite sure what most of the sounds are actually about. This CD is for those who live outside of the box.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Do i need to disagree with any of the 5 star reviewers? The movie is too gud. My son, who is only 1 year and a whole bunch of my cousins and nephews, ranging from 3 to 8 years, LOVE this movie. No trouble till the movie is over :-)
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Brilliant piece of cinematic magic! Strongly suggested for all who enjoy mulling their movies over as they watch.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is one of the greatest films of all times in the genre.  It is in the same class as The Song Of Bernadette.  The film is true to the book of the same name.  5 stars +.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I fully expected to be irritated by \\"Love\\" when I bought it.  After all, The Beatles' music is perfect in every way in its original sequence and context.  I'd had enough trouble accommodating myself to the differential in the UK releases when I discovered them in the 70s.  Like millions of my peers who had The Beatles hard-wired into their DNA as adolescents, I found every song to be sufficient unto itself -- discrete, individual, perfect.  And we had developed the reasonable expection that Every Little Thing follows Tell Me What You See, and Helter Skelter follows Sexie Sadie, and night follows day.  And so on. <br />This was my frame of mind when I first took \\"Love\\" into my musicspace.  Dubious.  Ready to find fault. <br />Much to my surprise, however, I love this record.  Right from the beginning with the Because vocal track and that terrific montage leading into Get Back, it just worked for me.  I was nodding my head throughout, thoroughly entertained by how well the mosaic treatments worked.  And the different production touches were noticable, but not off-putting.   <br />\\"Love\\" may well be a good means for introducing a new cohort to the Beatles music.  Yes, it's derivative and patch-work, but maybe that works better for the iPod generation.  And for geezers like me in the Original Beatles Generation, it can be different way of looking at the music, considered from different angles as through a holographic image. <br />It certainly hasn't been long out of my playing rotation over the last several weeks. <br />
B000M4RG4C|4.0|This Movie felt like the real story coming alive all over again & again<br /><br /> it seems like I was there.
