0385338686|4.0|I'm not a fan of Kinsella's usually ditzy female characters but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Samantha is a top-notch lawyer at a prestigious firm who makes a mistake for the first time ever. In desperation, she flees the city and becomes a blue-ribbon housekeeper (unbelievable) and falls for the gardener, leaving behind her overachieving family and dream of making partner at the firm <br /> <br />SPOILER:  <br /> <br />While on exodus, she discovers a scandal that's big enough to win back her job and fulfill her dream. Now she must choose between her career, complete with a budding romance to a fellow lawyer or her new life in the countryside with her new love. <br /> <br />1 star for believability but hey, its just chick lit. So overall 4 stars for its warm, fairytale ending and strong heroine.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Blame it on Yo-Yo Ma. Perhaps he is the reason why this soundtrack reminds me so much of the one for \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\". If that is a problem, that is one great problem to have and certainly it shows that Williams is a very flexible composer who can absorb influences in a transparent way.<br /><br />The album tells a tale you want to listen to (and this is something I've done non-stop since I first heard it). It is every bit intimate as it is epic, without ever breaking out of the world where it belongs. Perhaps the graceful violin of Itzhak Perlman helps ground Williams and makes his combination with the cello of Yo-Yo Ma a match made in heaven.<br /><br />Another fine soundtrack that landed a spot among my favorites for 2005.
0307276902|1.0|The minute I hit the part about the priest in Paris, I knew something smelled funny. Well, it was a tossup between that and the conveniant suicide of Lilly, just a few hours before Frey's release.  If it were just the one incident, he'd get away with it, but taken all together the book gives off the odor of trying too hard.  It all reads like your basic movie-of-the-week, except with more vomit.
B000A2H2TK|4.0|The more I get old and years go by, and the more this album sinks into me as quintessential Gentle Giant! They are flirting here on a few tracks with power FM rock, and I hate power FM rock, but they do it with such finesse, humor and vigor, they still manage to sound like no one else but the Shulman brothers and their incredibly odd yet strongly creative, tight cohort of faithful musical partners...  I know this is not Octopus. But Octopus is (supreme) progrock...  While The Missing Piece is ...supreme God-knows-what, and I love it just for that!  Was this \\"Prog's done and over, long live the Giant\\"?... It didn't turn out exactly that way in the end, but I am sure \\"For Nobody\\" will live on forever anyway!
0783228457|5.0|For all of you rare people that are unfamiliar with David Croenberg, he is the maker of the new A History of Violence. This is one of his most famous movies and rightfully so. It is a masterpiece, a visionary experience from 1983.  <br />Even though it came then, it has absolutely unbelievable special effects. The special effects notably found in the hallucination sequences are magnificent and stunning.  <br />This is James Wood's best movie who gives a good performance playing, Max, the owner of channel 83, hard core stuff. He's trying to make a living but still is a pervert. He's into this nasty stuff he finds. Yet comically enough he says that he stays away from the bad stuff.  <br />He is a perverted man, and he has a bizarre relationship with his girlfriend. When he and his partner are trying to pick up stations, they come across a torture station, very realistic and disturbing. Max becomes more and more interested in it until he finds out horrible secrets behind it. He realizes that this trully is \\"real\\". And sick. This program called Videodrome has a spell on him and causes him to hallcinate in very original and very well made sequences. He will literally enter inside his TV or his flesh will just open up.  <br />This is when the creators of the program start to program him. And make him do very bad things. But can Max overcome this posessing power. The fact is that the TV, and this program is posessing him and changing him. <br />The movie combines lots of \\"fantasy\\" elements along with science fiction and is definitely out of the ordinary. It is hard to understand at times and very creative. The fact is that this movie, this crazy story is masking, implying that the real world is a very bad world. It's showing the new arrival of horrific TV programs and it shows the horrifying spell TV has on its watchers. Don't belive me? Where do you think a lot of the influences for crimes come from? Sawing people up in GTA! <br />And that is the genius of this movie. This movie is in all fairness a critique of thesociety but it does it in such a cool and creative way that it's hard not to love it.  <br /> <br />Videodrome is a piece of genius, Croenberg's best, and one of my favorite movies. It is brilliant, disturbing and creepy. The world we live in is trully a scary place and this movie shows that. The visual effects are jaw dropping (1983! No Way!). <br />It is a masterpiece, a chilling tale, a true tale, a fascinating tale. It's so creative and the hallucinations will have you fully engaged. They are surreal! Croenberg (writer + director of this movie) is definitely a very creative man and I applaud him and praise this masterpiece.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives was a huge hit and rightly so. It is the story of several housewives living in Wisteria Lane, an expensive American suburban street. The main characters are Susan, Lynette, Gabrielle and Bree.<br /><br />Susan (Teri Hatcher) is the ditsy divorced mother with one daughter and a fancy for her hunky new neighbour. Lynette was a high flying career woman but is now tied to the home and her unruly brood of 4 children. She could cope with anything at work but has problems coping with domesticity. Gabrielle is the Latin beauty, married to Carlos who is rich enough to provide everything she could want. However it's not enough and she is having an affair with her very young gardener. Bree is perfection personified, immaculately turned out and with a house like something from ideal homes. However her husband and children cannot live up to her ideals or live with this perfection. The narrator of the whole series is Mary Alice, a friend of all the women who, in the first episode, commits suicide. The central thread of the tale is why she was driven to this and what dark secrets are hidden in the lives of the characters.<br /><br />Although there is a central theme, each episode does have a `stand alone' story for the occasional viewer, but to really enjoy it at its best the series should be watched in its entirety and from the beginning. Twists and turns, murder and mayhem, love and friendship are all to be found in a series that is by turn both wickedly funny and poignant. This is TV at its best; not to be missed.
1860498825|2.0|I am afraid that I completely missed out on what is meant to be so mesmerizing about this book (judging by the other glowing reviews.) Firstly, the plot is melodramatic, verging on ludicrous and unbelievable. The two main characters, Maud (the lady) and Sue (her maid and lover) never come alive. They are like wooden dolls moving through Victorian London, and are almost interchangable. The only thing that is good is the accurate period detail and Water's ability to create atmosphere. But much of it is just padding, padding, paddding, and even when you get to the bones of it, there is nothing much there, save a few good sex scenes and some very detailed descriptions of ladies underwear.<br /><br />Admittedly, I gave up on this half way through. Maybe it picked up towards the end, but I doubt it.
0393327655|5.0|This book should immediately be translated into Old English and touted as a recently discovered book of the King James bible. That way the Christian fundamentalists will be fooled into reading it and make Sam Harris a new prophet. It could prove more popular than Tim LaHaye's, Horse's Behind series. It should also be translated into Arabic and a million copies should be air dropped on Mecca during the hajj. I'll bet there is already a Hebrew translation, copies of which are being distributed at the wailing wall. Harris is the Grand Ayatollah of Sanity. I wouldn't trade this book for fifty virgins, two red heifers, and the number one slot on the Rapture list.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|It's the height of the Depression in New York City, and down-on-her-luck actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) accepts movie director Carl Denham's (Jack Black) offer to sail off for an adventure and make a movie.  Playwright/screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) gets stuck on board and they all sail off for Skull Island, a mysterious place that just happens to be the home of bloodthirsty natives, prehistoric animals, and a 25-foot tall ape called Kong.  When the natives kidnap Ann and sacrifice her to the big gorilla, Jack, Carl, and the ship's crew must rescue her.  But rather than eat Ann, Kong falls for her.<br /><br />For me, Jack Black was miscast as Carl Denham; he was much too young and silly. Naomi Watts was quite lovely and convincing as the poor and innocent actress, and Adrien Brody looked like a nerdy playwright, but there was no romantic chemistry between them (probably the fault of the script which emphasizes Action, Action, Action all the time).  The character of Kong is amazingly well done and gains our sympathy immediately, but the depth of his love for Ann is too unbelievable.  With all manner of dinosaurs, giant cockroaches, and city streets full of crashing period autos, the screen is so full of computer-generated images, I actually longed for real scenes.  It's all done superbly, of course, but it just isn't real.  The movie was also too long, but action fans will enjoy it; it's as good as the original, and that's saying a lot. My favorite part of the movie was showing New York in the throes of the Depression; the attention to detail was wonderful.  I give the movie four stars for the astounding special effects.<br /><br />Kona
0451191153|2.0|I am an avid reader and have always put-off reading Ayn Rand for some reason or another.  I knew of Rand and her philisophical undertakings while taking some courses at university, but I had always been apprehensive about reading her work in a literary form.  After finally reading The Fountainhead, I now I understand my own reluctance.  Ayn Rand is a great writer, and a great thinker.  The first hundred pages of The Fountainhead are very insightful, intriguing, and provocative.  However, as the book goes on, I grew very weary of the author's philosophical objectives personified through the main characters.  These are not characters but charicatures, they are philisopichal essays in human form - complete with the philosophical language, speech, and worldviews that would even make Nietzche shudder.  This is the essential problem with Rand's book - it is less a novel about real people in real life situations than a normative statement on human interaction, behaviour, and power.  Even with my wildest imagination I just can't fathom a self-made man from Hell's kitchen, a rich architect's daughter, and a kid who went to architecture school discussing man's place in the world ALL THE TIME.  The conversations get so ridiculous you'll want to turn on an episode of The Simpson just to recall what \\"real\\" people talk like.  If you're like me, and can appreciate what Ayn Rand is trying to do in The Fountainhead, pick up a much more superior novel such as Hesse's \\"Damien\\", Musil's \\"The Man Without Qualities, or (if you're time is at a premium) read Satre's \\"The Outsider\\".
B00007LTIC|5.0|The opening track, \\"Going For The One\\" is the most uplifting track Yes ever did. I would go as far as to say it's the most uplifting song I've ever heard. The music is so incredible, that it leaves you in awe. Sadly, the next three tracks aren't as great as the first one, but \\"Awaken\\" is up there with the title track, posssibly even better. This epic doesn't go on for too long, like some of the songs on \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" and \\"Close To The Edge\\" do, and it's beautiful. A must-buy for any prog fan, or anyone with any music taste in general.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Yes, Irreversible is a monster of a movie, brutal and sickening in all the worst ways. It's also a magnificent piece of storytelling, a finely crafted film and something everyone (who loves film) should see once.    I have a question though, regarding the impact scene at the Club. Two major surprises unfold here, firstly that it is gentle, cerebral Pierre and not raging, coke-fuelled Marcus that commits the murder (one of the most horribly realistic murder scenes I've ever seen, and so long, it gets to the point where you want the guy to just die already and let it be over) and secondly that 'The Tapeworm' is not the man killed, but his colleague/friend. (The scene of Tapeworm looking down on the dead body and smiling was a knife to the heart (at least it will be the second time you watch the movie and realise he escaped))    I wonder, though, if the movie had been played scene for scene normally, from true beginning to true end, what the impact of these two \\"twists\\" would have been. Playing the movie backwards, you just don't get it. You don't know Pierre's character yet. You don't know what the rapist looks like. Hmmmm....    Although working in reverse does have it's benefits. The scene with Marcus and Alex waking up to the telephone in particular, where Alex has had a dream of a long, red tunnel (the underpass) and Marcus can't feel his arm (the one that get's so disgustingly snapped in the club)    And of course, the first scene (aka the last scene) of Alex in her summer dress laying in the park with the kids playing on a gorgeous sunny day, it wouldn't mean anything if the movie played forwards, I guess. Same with the party scene. It hits harder backwards.     I also have to mention the soundtrack - the music is alright, but it's the throbbing, repeated blows to the head of the ambient noise that makes the movies sound. Especially the noise in the club. Just a horrible experience, especially with the camera all tilt-a-whirl and out of control, just showing (very explicit!) glimpses of the depravity that is going on.     On the DVD, the extras are slim but interesting. One guy breaks down how they did the special effects (and trust me, it does make the murder scene a little easier to take) and the digital penis is just...funny weird. I think the best part of the extras are the original French teasers. One of them is simply Alex's view as she is being raped, you can't get more simple or effective than that.    Oh yeah - the DVD says it has deleted scenes, but I couldn't find any....???

1417634391|1.0|Yes, I too have now read smoking guns investigation into James Frey's 'terrible and shocking life as an addict and Criminal' and can no longer recommend this book except as a work of fiction.<br /><br />When I first read it, (as someone who has been through a treatment centre and spent years in recovery) I did find myself questioning how he remembered so much considering he was such a 'hard arse'. But then the book was so damn entertaining that you ended up being swept along by it anyway, forgetting all your niggling little thoughts.<br /><br />And uh where were Oprah's researchers?  Why has it taken so long for someone eg Doubleday to bother checking the facts?<br /><br />Good on him for making all that money I suppose....his credibility as a capitalist - unquestionable - his credibility from one 'addict' to another - priceless.
0767020308|5.0|A terrific adaptation of a wonderful novel!  I can (and have) watched this many times, and have yet to be bored or to find fault with this, other than the fact that I wish they would have adapted it in a similar format to Pride and Prejudice by making it longer and exploring all the little nuances of the novel and its characters!   <br /> <br />Significantly better than Gwenyth Paltrow's Emma, this is well worth adding to any movie collection!
B00005JOFO|5.0|Is it possible for a film - any film - to truly make the world a better place?  I have no way of confidently answering that question, but if any movie COULD do such a thing, then \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" would be that film.  Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself.  By putting something never before seen on the screen, director Ang Lee and writer Larry McMurtry earn their place in movie history - and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.<br /><br />By now, most people know that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" tells the story of Ennis and Jack, two young cowboys who, in the summer of 1963, sign up to herd sheep in Wyoming and wind up falling in love.  Jack is the outgoing one of the two, seemingly more in touch with his homosexuality than is Ennis, who is introverted and taciturn almost to the point of somnambulism.  Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways - Jack to become a rodeo rider and get married, Ennis to settle down on a ranch with his wife and two little daughters - the attraction they feel for one another never lessens.  In fact, it becomes only more intense over the years, as the men come to realize that each has found in the other his true soul mate, his ideal partner for life - if only circumstances and society weren't conspiring to keep them apart.  Instead, all they have to hold on to over the next twenty years are a few fleeting but passionate encounters in the one place where they are free to be who they truly are.<br /><br />Tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre.  Forced to look at it from a novel perspective, we feel as if we are seeing romantic love being played out for the first time.  There are those who have accused the film of trying to \\"glorify\\" adulterers, as if this were the first time in which a story of unrequited love involved cheating spouses.  Would these same people object to \\"Anna Karenina,\\" \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" or \\"Brief Encounter\\" on such spurious grounds?  If anything, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" points out the absurdity of a society that tells gay people they shouldn't even BE gay but should  live their lives as heterosexuals.  If Ennis' and Jack's wives are victims, they are far more the victims of a society that forces gays into loveless marriages than of Ennis and Jack, who are simply conforming to what society itself claims it wants them to be.<br /><br />By making the two central characters rugged macho cowboys, the author of the original short story, E. Annie Proulx, not only shatters a gay stereotype, but brilliantly finds the hitherto elusive portal into the consciousness of a mainstream audience.  Certainly, this story would not have worked commercially had it been about two gay hairdressers living in San Francisco.  For the first time in a Hollywood film, we have major gay characters who are not AIDS victims, psycho killers or limp-wristed best friends of the main female character.  Moreover, the movie subtly plays with the latent homoerotic undercurrents that have always been a part of western folklore but which have heretofore been hidden safely enough under the surface so that only those looking for them could find them.  Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love - deep, raw, all-consuming love - and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.<br /><br />As Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting.  With his tightly pursed lips, barely whispered monotone and slumped shoulders, Ledger brilliantly conveys the soul of a man struggling with the truth about himself and straining with every fiber in his body and being to avoid acknowledging that truth.  So tormented is he in his life that Ennis seems to be trying to pull back his words even as he's uttering them.  A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time.  As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him.  Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband.  Anne Hathaway is effective in her few scenes as the girl who ends up roping the rodeo star Jack, unaware of who it is she has really caught.<br /><br />Ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser-like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama.  Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.<br /><br />Just to show that even a great film need not be perfect, there are times when the movie - a tad too long at two hours and 15 minutes - sags a bit by wandering off into one too many subplots.  But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are.  This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.<br /><br />When the history of the movies comes to be written, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed \\"watersheds\\" or \\"landmarks,\\" movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do.

B00042YBTK|5.0|The Sixties zeigeist, at least on the face of it, was one of peace, love, and freedom. Love Is, originally released as a double vinyl album was Eric Burdon & the Animals' most ambitious effort and very much epitomizes that period. It's a recording that truly reflects its times with equal amounts of great musicianship and inspiration but a good deal of pretentiousness and overkill as well. River Deep, Mountain High is one of the most energetic cuts on the album as Eric pays tribute to the lovely Tina Turner with a great rendition of the song that she made famous. I'm an Animal is fun in a sort of dumb bar song type way while I'm Dying or Am I is basically a throwaway. I love Eric's version of Ring of Fire. It doesn't sound at all like Johnny Cash's original but Eric more than does justice to the tune even though there's some sloppiness (the harmony vocals don't always sound in tune and Barry Jenkins comes in a tad too early on drums on one of the choruses). Some reviewers have dumped on Coloured Rain but I have to disagree. This is a great version with an outstanding guitar solo (apparently by a pre-Police Andy Summers) and cool horns. The only negative note on it is again the harmony vocals. Although I've never particularly liked Eric's version of To Love Somebody, it's a sweet production job complete with soulful singers in the background and mellow guitar lines. As the Years Go Passing By is Eric's heartfelt tribute to the blues, \\"the ball and chain around every musician's leg.\\" This minor key blues has it all: powerful vocal, smoking guitar solos, and real feeling. Whether you like Gemini and Madman or not depends on your personal taste. I have loved them since I first heard them on the vinyl release with all the psychedelic effects and trippy choruses. So this album is a mixed bag but I think that most of these \\"double-album\\" efforts during the Sixties tended to be part inspiration and part filler. George Martin once said that he felt that, looking back at the Beatles' White Album, the really good material would have made one great album. There is definitely one great album within the grooves of Love Is. You just have to be patient and stick with it.eatles' White Album, the really good material would have made one great album.

B00005JOQ9|3.0|I liked \\"Hostel\\" for the most part, I expected a \\"SAW\\" ripoff but I was glad that they altered the plot to not make it into another serial killer movie.     With that said, it is pretty violent, however amazingly I still think it wasn't too gory afterwards probably because I've seen my fair share of movies like these (Audition, CAT III)    Yes it's predictable, silly in some parts but in horror movies that goes with the territory. In this day and age after a million horror movies have been released over the past thirty years it's hard to be shocking or original anymore.     The acting was OK, the plot good, the twists OK as well. For me the second half of the film saves it, they even managed to add some humor to it. I have to admit as well when the American tourists who is still alive goes on his revenge spreed, the Audience I saw it with loved it....especially we'll you'll see.     (Spoilers)    We'll the plot gives a lot away a couple of horny American guys go aboard to Europe and find the \\"Hostel\\" hotel where they think they're fantasies will come true.    Enter Natalya and Svetland the local sluts who in fact are part of the torture ring in which they get paid for their \\"services\\"    Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are too naive to see what's going and when they get drunk they fall for the trap.    Josh is tortured brutally (as with all the other victims in the slaughterhouse).    There were some memorable images, Paxton's \\"tour\\" of sorts inside this asylum is very creepy. Especially when he sees that this bastards clearly are getting a sick satisfaction of doing this.    He escape by sheer luck , and thus his revenge takes place. Hernandez is good in this although there's not too much character development. His revenge is pretty well played out though.    I'am sure we might see more blood and mayhem on a DVD cut but for now Hostel is a pretty entertaining but perverse little flick.    It was as Quentin and Roth admit filmed on a low budget and it shows but they do manage to use that to an advantage setting up some creepy shots and delivering the \\"goods\\" when the movie calls for it.    It ain't that bad of a movie, Quentin did produce it so it ain't too bad. Now there's word of a possible \\"Hostel 2\\". Interesting stuff. I would recommend but be warned of the content.     Ask for those (...)who complained about how sick the  movie is or it's in bad taste? Damn people get a life!!!!    It's only a freaking movie, and it's geared for horror,  if it's not to your liking go rent a Disney flick.  If you don't like the movie for the content alone  and don't ever bother to discuss the script,  acting or directing then you're really not doing  a good review.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Some things cannot be captured with images alone.  This is true of the recent film \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" based on the bestselling novel by Arthur Golden.  Where Golden's novel relied on beautifully crafted storytelling devices and imagery, the film drew from the beautiful performances by Zhang Ziyi, Ken Watanbe, and Gong Li as well as this masterful piece of music, composed and directed by John Williams. <br /> <br />Like his other film scores before it, William's \\"Memoirs\\" captures the culture and feel of the film with sweeping instrumentals and beautifully crafted pieces.  With magnificent solos by professional musicians Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman, this album captures the power and emotion of Sayuri's life as portrayed on the silver screen.  Pieces like \\"Journey to Hanamachi\\" and \\"Finding Satsu\\" rely on haunting melodies and sharp notes from the woodwinds to evoke feelings of loss, desperation, and fear while \\"Sayuri's Theme\\" and \\"A New Name...A New Life\\" draw on the talents of Ma and Perlman to convey the beauty and sadness of the geisha's life.  All soundtrack collectors would do well to add this wonderful album to their libraries.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|Jamiroquai's latest effort \\"Dynamite\\" was long overdue. They hadn't recorded any new material in years, and the fans were looking forward to something fresh. This album doesn't disappoint. Upon first listen, I'll be honest, I didn't like this album much AT ALL. For me, \\"Dynamite\\" was an acquired taste. I'm not sure if I prefer this album to \\"A Funk Odyssey\\" or \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\" ... but this album is pretty solid. There are some skippable tracks. IMO, \\"Electric Mistress\\" isn't a very good song, in fact, I think it's pretty safe to say it's the worst song on the album. I also don't like the lead single \\"Feels Just Like it Should\\". I don't mind the dark feel, but I do mind the cluttered feel of the song - Jamiroquai can do better. Everything else is pretty standard Jamiroquai: great, non-skippable music. I'll be the first to admit that the sound is a little different (which may be due to the fact that some members left), but it is enjoyable.  <br /> <br />TOP 3: <br /> <br />3) Dynamite. <br />2) Don't Give Hate a Chance - dance anthem which reminds me of classic Jamiroquai <br />1) Black Devil Car - IMO the best song on the CD. It feels a bit out of place, and it's not typical Jamiroquai, but it's great. <br /> <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this album to any Jamiroquai fan. But if you haven't listened to Jamiroquai before, I would recommend \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" or \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\" to get a better feel of their music.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|Must Love Dogs is a good, enjoyable movie with witty dialogue and appealing characters.  It's basically a less substantial version of Dianne Lane's earlier \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\".  Just subtract the fantastic scenery and add a more traditional ending.<br /><br />Lane (just as gorgeous as ever) is a newly divorced teacher being pushed, pulled and prodded back into the dating world by various family members.  Sadly, one possible suitor offered up by an elderly aunt is a first cousin (but he was adopted!).  At the behest of her sister, she answers an online singles ad and arrives at a restaurant only to learn that the ad was placed by... her father!  Of course that doesn't stop sis from ghost-writing an ad for her.<br /><br />Lane rebounds from her self-characterized \\"disturbing on so many levels\\" blind date with her dad to browse through the various prospects and suspects, meeting with decidedly mixed results.  The one prospect among the respondents is John Cusack, at his rumpled and affable best.  Cusack manages to be that rare personality that women fall for, without being threatening to the men.  He wins the girl without having to flash washboard abs or artificially white teeth.<br /><br />Watching Lane and Cusack work is fun enough, but they get a strong assist from a supporting cast that features Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing.  Plummer is Lane's father, a poetry-quoting widower determined to enjoy life despite losing his beloved wife of over forty years.  Somehow though, I wish that his character might have lapsed into a brief performance of \\"Edelweiss\\" instead of reciting another poem by Yeats.  Wouldn't that have been a nice little homage?  Channing plays one of Dad's many girlfriends, with all of her usual (and substantial appeal).<br /><br />It's a light and very appealing comedy.

B00067189O|2.0|I have a Super Audio CD player and I love the format. But I got this DualDisc as a present and was willing to give it a go since I've always wanted \\"Kind of Blue\\" on a high resolution format. <br /> <br />First of all, Dual Discs are NOT a high resolution sound format! The DVD side's sound is merely Dolby Digital or PCM encoded information and no better than any soundtrack on a feature film that is released on DVD! And the sampling rates are very very similar to CD anyway! You basically get a two sided disc that HOPEFULLY works on one of your players. <br /> <br />As I said, I own a SACD player, a rather expensive Denon that also plays DVD-Audio mind you. And it can't read the CD side of ANY dual discs because Dual Discs don't conform to CD standards. But it will play the DVD side just fine. But what is the point? If you're not going to invest in a SACD player than buy the regular remastered Audio CD version. <br /> <br />Also, I've had no problems with copy protection software because I used a program called CD-EX to get my bought music onto my iPod which can rip anything! Download it!

0385513755|2.0|One can look at \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" in a couple different lights: as a suspenseful thriller, and as a historical conspiracy story. Either way, the book ends up as something of a disappointment.<br /><br />I've certainly read better, more engaging thrillers than this. Dan Simmons' \\"Darwin's Blade\\" is a good example, or Thomas Harris' excellent \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" lacks four things I consider necessary for an effective, compelling piece of thriller fiction. It lacks believable characters which the reader cares about, it lacks mystery, it lacks a sense of peril, and it lacks a good punch at the end.<br /><br />The characters of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" are paper-thin. There is no sense of depth or personality to any of the characters, not even Robert Langdon, the main protagonist. I found myself a step ahead of them almost right away, and constantly wondering why these supposedly intelligent people were behaving so stupidly. The first third of the book is spent in a dead end, which the reader knows is a dead-end from the first few pages. The \\"big mystery\\" of the book was transparent to me by the time I was halfway done, and the solutions to many of the smaller problems were almost painfully obvious. There is never a real sense of danger in the book, as just when things should be getting intense the story screeches to a halt for long passages of exposition. And at last, the potential for an intriguing end pulls its punch and just sort of peters out.<br /><br />So, let's look at the other aspect of this book: the historical conspiracy. Once again, there are far better examples of this sort of story available. If you find this aspect of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" compelling, I recommend these books heartily. Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\" is an excellent novel in this field, but the Holy Grail (heh) of historical conspiracy novels has to be Umberto Eco's masterpiece, \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\" The latter book sets up such a complex web of connections throughout history that it stands up to multiple readings quite well, which is one of several things I can't say about \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"<br /><br />A good historical conspiracy story needs only three things to work for me. The first of these is originality. The second, a solid foundation of history. The third is that the story behind the story should be presented in such a way that doesn't insult the reader. Few things annoy me more than an author who \\"talks down\\" to the reader or deliberately dumbs down history. Unfortunately, this is the path that Brown chose to travel, and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" disappoints as a result.<br /><br />The idea behind \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" with its merging of Templar, Masonic, and Rosicrucian history with Grail myth, seems cribbed from other books, most notably from Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\" The history presented in the book is, to put it kindly, simplistic. What should be major points of the story are glossed over quickly and without much depth. Even worse is the treatment of Grail legend, in which all the complexity, drama and deep background of the Grail story is given only the most cursory nod. Grail legend is an extensive field with a great deal of history and controversy surrounding it, both from within the Christian church and without. Unfortunately, Brown focuses on a single interpretation and largely ignores the pre-Christian, pagan roots of Grail mythology.<br /><br />Much of the history is presented in the form of the ubiquitous flashback in which Langdon, a Harvard professor, recalls classroom sessions that have all the depth of an info-mercial. One hopes that a Harvard classroom is much more engaging than what Brown presents here. Other parts of the back-story are presented in discussions between characters which bring the story to a screeching halt. These passages of exposition are not only at odds with the story itself, they made me repeatedly grimace at the way Brown oversimplifies the history he presents. Brown's statement at the beginning of the book that all of his descriptions are \\"accurate\\" seems disingenuous at best.<br /><br />For me, there is little to like about \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" The prose of the book is serviceable but unremarkable. The characters lack depth, the story lacks suspense, the pacing is completely off thanks to all the exposition, and the history is diluted to the point of being meaningless.<br /><br />The funny thing is, this is a book I should like. I love a good thriller, and I love history. I enjoy examining some of the mysteries behind \\"established\\" history. I even agree with some of the ideas I believe Brown was trying to express. But ultimately, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is too shallow and too dull a book too engage me on any of these levels. I didn't utterly hate it. It's a quick read, and an entertaining book, but little more. I wanted to like it, but when I put it down after reading the last page, I simply found it lacking.s.

0064407667|4.0|This is a wonderful, scary, intriguing story. It is a book that you cannot put down. It starts with a bad beginning and an even worse end. Trust me, by the end of the book you may not have any fingernails left because u will be gnawing away on them.  <br /> It starts with the three Baudelaire children. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Violet had a knack for inventing. Klaus was the intelligent one. And Sunny liked to bite. They get caught in an awful disaster. They have to stay with an evil relative and work and help him. In the story they learn how to cook, clean, drive, and live in horrible conditions. They learn that they can never be to prepared. <br /> To me this story was very well written. I love books where I can't put them down. I would recommend this book for anyone 11 and up who loves wonderful, scary, and intriguing stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Hottie <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|Some great scenes where Jake really goes ballistic. I like the scene where he shows up at his brother's house with the sole purpose of beating the living daylights out of Joe Pesci who definitely is deserving of a whooping for fooling around with Jake's wife. Cathy Moriarty as the petulant wife does a good job working Jake into a lather.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|this really isn't my kind of music at all, but the CD is surprisingly good
B000089CJI|1.0|My indie loving friend recommended this album to me.  When I complained that there were only two good songs on the CD, she said, \\"I know, but I just listen to the whole thing anyway.\\" Strangely, every other person I know who has the album listens to the whole thing for just two good songs.  What is this odd phenomenon? It is the plight of a lousy album that has somehow become popular.  Listen to The New Pornographers instead, or Stars.  Don't be surprised when indie kids actually listen to the songs and The Postal Service goes out of service.
0307276902|3.0|I broke my neck trying to get this book because of all the hype. When I watched Oprah all I heard about was how gut-wrenching and addicting this book was.  When I finally got the book, i dove right in expecting it to be off the hook. As I started getting into it, I realized that this book was nothing out of the ordinary. I had to force myself to keep reading because I thought maybe it was because i was biased to a certain kind of book and i wasn't used to this type of story. But no, i couldn't even finish the book. I haven't finished it because i was too disappointed. The fact that i haven't finished it has nothing to do with the rumors that are going around or nothing like that, i just can't bring myself to read on. There was nothing spectacular about his story, plus the fact that he writes it with little punctuation like a poem doesn't help matters. Maybe it's because i can't relate to the story of an addict, i don't know. But i've read book about addicts before and never had a problem getting through it. I give him 3 stars only because this book is probably helping others. The only reason this book is so popular is because of Oprah otherwise we would've heard of it before now.
B0007OCG56|4.0|This movie surprised me in a couple great ways.   <br /> <br />The first surprise was Adam Sandler.  In all the previous roles that I've seen or heard about, he's been a goof off and slightly crazy.  He was very serious in this role and he did a great job at it too.  There were moments with his daughter that made me want to cry because he was so sensitive to her feelings, unlike his wife, her mother. <br /> <br />The second surprise for me came in the fact that from the advertising for the movie, I thought that it was going to be a little different.  The movie focused on the houskeeper and her daughter, and not the family, as I had thought it would.  I loved the fact that the daughter narrated through her college application essay.   <br /> <br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of five, was that there were a few times later in the movie when it seemed to drag a bit. <br /> <br />All in all this movie was very touching and showed that the father is not always the \\"bad guy\\".  It showed that you have to be yourself and not try to be what other people think you should be.
1400032717|5.0|I never really understood Autism until I read this book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. So, what better way to try and understand it then reading about a person who is autistic and going deep into their own thoughts and the way they see life. <br />Christopher John Francis Boone is an autistic 15-year-old boy and is also the narrator in this book. Thought Christopher doesn't show it, being autistic doesn't just involve him. His parents do not know how to deal with Christopher's lifestyle and his mother especially, can't deal with it and eventually is said to have died from a heart attack later on.  <br />The story starts when Christopher comes along his neighbor's garden and finds their dog, Wellington, dead. This is very disturbing for Christopher because his favorite animals are dogs. After finding the dog, Christopher is wrongfully accused of the dead of Wellington and Christopher decides that there is no other choice than to take matters into his own hands. <br />Christopher is very thorough with his thoughts and would never lie to anyone, especially his father. Starting Christopher's investigation on who killed Wellington started with the help of his teacher Siobhan, to write a book about his investigation. Christopher's father does not agree with this investigation and doesn't believe that Christopher should be snooping around in people's buisness, and leaves it at that. Christopher, having a very hard time with talking to strangers, decides to resume with his investigation.   <br />Throughout many of Christopher's investigations he stumbles upon many clues and secrets that aren't just about the death of Wellington. Eventually his father finds out he had decided to proceed with the findings of Wellington's murderer and takes Christopher's book away. Christopher, not happy with this, decides to find his book from his dad and soon reveals facts about his parents disgustingly solved separation.  <br />Coming to the answers of material that Christopher has stumbled upon will be a lot harder than most people would come to believe. Dealing with his autism and the understandings of what has just happen with will be Christopher's biggest challenge yet. <br />
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie is wonderful.   <br /> <br />The story is about a man who writes plays.  At the beginning of the movie, he has just finished a play and the audience didn't like it.

This play becomes Peter Pan. <br /> <br />When he finishes the play, however, and goes to bring it to the stage, the adults don't understand it.  He has to find a way to make them see, and of course he does, but I won't give away how.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Network is a interesting ride into the cynicism of man.  It was startling to hear Beale rant on about the Arabs buying up large portions of the country.  Especially when I heard a conservative coworker complain about it.<br /><br />The Beale show would probably work today when thinking of shows like fear factor, amercian idol, and the whole \\"reality\\" show barrage that went on.<br /><br />The cast was great!  I can't think of a bad part.  One thing that was kind of sad was that Peter Finch(Beale) died the following year.<br /><br />If you want to get your healthy dose of cynicism, this film is it!  Again it's surprising that people are complaining about the same thing Beale ranted about:<br /><br />\\"I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's work, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. .....\\"<br /><br />A great film with a great cast.

0060839872|3.0|I was recommended \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" from someone with a little too much enthusiasm for the book.  As a result I was a little let down.  My friend's enthusiastic endorsement sounds a lot like the reviews posted up on this page.  <br /> <br />The key question this book poses--\\"What is Quality?\\"--in my mind is never really answered.  This may be like the Zen koan were a monk is hanging off the edge of a cliff by holding onto a branch with his teeth and a student asks him \\"Why did the Buddha come from India to China?\\"  If the monk answers, he falls to his doom.  If he keeps his mouth shut, he cannot answer.  The answer to the question ends up being \\"MU\\", which is a Zen way of saying \\"unask the question\\". <br /> <br />All very quaint and insightful, perhaps, but a little over the head of this Western thinker.  It's not that I don't enjoy exploring a question I know has no definitive answer, if only to gain an appreciation for the mystery it addresses.  The problem is that I dislike metaphysics.  I dislike jumping up one level and speaking of things in a convuluted and deliberately confusing matter by making concepts essential objects, by making grandoise claims about what happens between conscious experience and the event one is conscious of in a forum that doesn't demand a rational defense. <br /> <br />Pirsig apparently doesn't either, and he offers a few fleeting attempts at self-criticism before jumping right back into the metaphysical lingo and leading the reader back into the fray. <br /> <br />The book did get me thinking.  I started to wonder \\"What is quality\\", and, more specifically, \\"Does this book have it?\\"  As to the first question, I was led to think of it from angles I wouldn't have thought of before, but still am at a total loss.  As to the second question, I think the answer is \\"yes\\", but a tentative \\"yes\\".  Don't expect your socks to be knocked off by Pirsig's blizkreig through three hundred years of philosophical thought.  Expect some uncomfortable chapters, some evocative and highly objectionable claims, and some unnecessarily confusing dialectic. <br /> <br />The book has an interesting narrative flow, and when concepts are introduced into this flow it can be quite enlightening.  Unfortunately, it sometimes breaks this flow altogether, loses ground, and makes for less enjoyable reading.  I recommend the book to those who are interested, specifically, in philosophy (not to be confused with \\"ideas about things\\", but the philosophy of the ancients).
B0002F6BRE|5.0|\\"Elf\\" is a cute Christmas movie with a great (and funny) script, great character acting, and a great Christmas soundtrack. Elf was a surprise hit a couple years ago and is (If I remember correctly) Will Ferrell's highest grossing film. The movie stars Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, and Faizon Love. The movie begins when Santa (Asner, who is perfect for the role) is making his rounds at an orphanage and a young baby crawls in his bag. Santa doesn't discover the baby until he returns to the North Pole and one of the elves, Papa Elf (Newhart) volunteers to raise the baby who is named Buddy. Well, Buddy grows up and at the age of thirty finally realizes that he is not in fact an elf. <br />Buddy then learns that his father is on the naughty list (god forbid) and begins his journey to New York city. When Buddy meets his skeptical father Walter (Caan) a workaholic children's book publisher, he is thrown out of the building but doesn't let it get him down. Buddy migrates to Gimbels where he meets the store manager played by Faizon Love. This is easily the most underrated character in the film, Love delivers several jokes which had me bawling. Love is very good with physical humor as well as verbal...But anyway, it is at Gimbels that Buddy meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, who I've seen in several other films but looks absolutely gorgeous in this movie). I'm glad the Jovie character existed in the movie, because Deschanel is great (and very hot) but Buddy and Jovie don't make an extraordinary couple. Anyway, after Walter discovers that Buddy really is his son Buddy moves in with Walter and his wife Emily (Steenburgen) and son Michael and then well...See the movie. I have to add that in the movie Deschanel sings the song \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" and I need to add that she's got a great voice. She's an amazing singer, she was so good in fact that I bought the soundtrack. But, yeah this is a great Christmas comedy and is destined tobe a Christmas favorite. A- <br />

1594200653|5.0|This is an excellent survey book for the general reader that pulls together the disparate developments in European history since the end of WWII.  The result is a cohesive overview I have not found elsewhere, especially consideration of the turmoil in the Eastern bloc and the practical political problems. <br /> <br />I disagree with several criticisms levelled at the book in the following particulars.   First, it is claimed that the book offers nothing new.  That is true in the sense that what is reported it not new; however such an excellent overview is new. <br /> <br />Second, there are complaints about the lack of footnotes.  On this I again say the book is an overview and not directed at specialists.  Inclusion of anything approaching an academically adequate footnoting would have expanded the work to two or more volumes.   <br /> <br />Third, it is claimed there are errors.  Well, sure there are.  Judt is writing about developments in 40+ nations which ranged from advanced to backward.  However, given the volume of factual matter, there appear to be few errors. <br /> <br />Fourth, it is claimed that the book is too long.  I disagree and believe that Judt did an excellent of job of editing down to get the book to the size it is.  A reader who is not interested in some parts can skip them. <br /> <br />This is not a work for specialists who will likely criticize it as a popularization as they proceed to write their dry tomes no one but other specialists will ever read. <br /> <br />I grew up in the forties and fifties and spent most of 1961 to 1965 in West Germany in the military and as a foreigh exchange student.  It was a delight to read Judt's research about those years and those that followed. <br /> <br />Great Book!

0307263118|5.0|Books like this are a dying breed. Banville was half expecting his manuscript of 'The Sea', his 14th novel, not to be published at all after a long back catalogue of novels that only sold two to three thousand copies apiece. He was known as a difficult and wordy prose stylist, totally obscure. Then in October last year 'The Sea' won the Booker prize, guaranteeing it instant media attention, and several critics claimed the choice of winner would ruin the status of the Booker indefinitely, given its verbosity, its lack of plot, its supposed inaccessibility.<br /><br />The Sea sits firmly in that quiet, reflective erudite continental tratition of intelligent literature - early Nabokov, Proust, some Joyce, Beckett. There is very little dialogue. It achieves its affect by a slow, drip of meditative prose craft. The narrator, Max Morden, is an almost post human entity, a ghostlike man, focusing his attention intently on the aesthetic details around him and his memories of the past at the Irish seaside town he revisits. Some of the details are conjoured up beautifully, a wet swimming costume, for instance 'lying where she had tossed it, limply wadded and stuck along one wet edge with a fringe of sand, like something thrown up drowned out of the sea.' Some of the details are beautifully evoked, but come across as rather strainingly artificial, try this: 'The steel milk churns looked like squat sentries in flat hats, and each one had an identical white rosette burning on its shoulder where the light from the doorway was reflected.' Does reflected light really shine like a rosette? It is, nevertheless, a beatifully crafted image. Some of the imagery I did find too false, especially Banville's over attatchment of the colour blue to things. Is mud really blue? Is smoke in a room really blue?<br /><br />Banville is also a stylist who deals with language, he loves the shape, the sound, the formation of words. Much of the vocabulary is arcane - 'cracaleured', 'ichor', 'cinereal' anyone? I referred to my OED frequently throughout. However this is not the pretentious thesaurus abusing of some other contemporary wannabe literary novelists. Banville really is an experienced master with his self proclaimed 'Hibo-English' and  readers who take the time to absorb the patterns and thoughts he evokes on the page will find it a treat.<br /><br />Many people will pick up this novel, fail to see what all the fuss is about, and return to their familiar slush piles of middle brow fiction. However the prestige attatched to 'The Sea' has deservedly raised Banville's profile, for so long underrated, in the literary world. The Sea is his best novel so far and he has reached the peak of his powers as a prose stylist. It is a shame that his next novels are apparently to be pulp detective fiction written under the pseudonym 'Benjamin Black'.red to my OED frequently throughout.

B00005ATQD|4.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a surreal movie directed by Stanley Kubrick (The Shining), and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Nicole Kidman (Batman Forever). This would be Kubrick's final movie completed before and released after his death in 1999. <br /> <br />Eyes Wide Shut follows an upper class New York couple called the Harfords, played by then real life couple Cruise and Kidman. One night following some pot smoking, Alice Harford opens up and tells her husband about a near sex affair she once had with a naval officer. Even though Bill Harford had insisted that he never would feel jealous for her because of the trust she had earned in him, the thought and image of his wife having sex with another man boggles his mind. Over the course of the night, we accompany Bill on his trip of madness in the sensual underground world of New York. He meets his old med school dropout turned pianist buddy at a party early on the film who tells him about a mysterious orgy party that Bill eventually sneaks into wearing a cape and mask. What Bill is about to experience is the wildest and freakiest sexcapade any married man on the brink of insanity can undergo. He finds himself stuck in a web of mystery, confusion, erotica, and danger as a result. <br /> <br />Kubrick's directing style never falls short. His use of long takes and dreamlike sequences that reminded me a lot of The Shining are elusive and powerful. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is an album that takes repeated listens but stays with you much longer than the current Britney Spears/N SYNC/Lindsey Lohan albums.     The album starts with \\" I am trying to Break your heart\\", a six minute confession at a bar perhaps? Wilco sounds as if its stumbling drunk and it feels as if the song could fall apart at any second. However, it works because the song is about communication .    Wilco throws in sound effects that are grating and at the same time intriguing. Instruments are thrown in the mix as well as the code Yankee Hotel Foxtrot which is repeated over and over at the end of poor places.    The sonic landscape of YHF is rich and varied and deserves a listen on headphones. For me, this is the best headphone album since Dark Side of the Moon.    \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" sounds like a pop hit and its a shame that radio (except college radio) ignored it. It speaks to a time when the music mattered and people could \\"play Kiss records, beautiful and stoned\\".    \\"Radio Cure\\" sounds like a cry for help with static thrown in. A crackle here, Jeff Tweedy's voice sounds distant in a way . As the lyrics \\"distance has no way to make love understandable\\".  A lament about long distant relationships? Perhaps.    \\"I'm the man who loves you\\" has horns that remind one of the Stax sound of the Memphis Horns of the 1960's. A guitar pulses a morse code rhythm throughout the song and gets louder at the end.    \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" has been misunderstood by some as a post 9-11 lament, but the problem of this is that this song was recorded months before the tragedy. However, it's mood does fit in with post 9-11 sentiment. It is the centerpiece of the album.    \\"Kamera\\" ,\\" Jesus Etc\\",\\"poor places\\",and \\"pot kettle black\\" are great songs in their own right. They complement the framework of the album held down by \\"I am trying to break your heart\\", \\"ashes of american flags\\" and the final song \\"reservations\\".    \\"Reservations\\" starts as a soft melody and gradually deteriorates into a noise filled coda which lasts for over 5 minutes.     This is the essence of the album. The album may take a few listens but it grabs you and the light comes on and \\"you get it\\".    Why it got overlooked at the 2003 Grammy awards is beyond me. Although I think that the academy didn't want to further embarass Warner Brothers by giving an award to a band whose label (Resprise which is owned by WB) refused to release the album citing it as uncommercial.    I saw Wilco live 3 years ago in Detroit and they blew me away. Not only did they play songs from YHF , but the songs came alive and sounded great. They also played 3 oncores. I recommend their new live album Kicking Television for you to hear them live, then check their website and see if they are appearing at a town near you. Hurray, since tickets usually sell out.
B000002WPI|5.0|even though the 36 chambers are 13 years old, it's still alot better than anything you hear today. They were years ahead of their time in '93, and so far, no one has been able to touch them.  <br />The RZA's beats are genious, and all of the rappers are unique and  when they blaze up the mic, you know what's on.  <br />Today, most of the Wu members have a great solo carrer, especially Meth, ODB (R.I.P.), RZA, Ghostface, Masta Killa, GZA.... $hit, they all have!... <br />There could never be any doubt; Enter The Wu-Tang 36 Chambers are by far the best hip hop album of all time, and in my oppinion, maybe the best album of all time, along with  <br />Gang Starr's \\"Moment Of Truth\\"  <br />Outkast's \\"Aquemini\\"  <br />Looptroop's \\"The Struggle Continues\\" (I guess you don't know them?...) <br />Common's \\"Be\\"  <br />KanYe West's \\"The College Dropout\\" (HELL YEAH!)....  <br /> <br />The best songs on the album are: <br />1)Shame On A N**** <br />2)Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin' Ta F' Wit <br />3)Bring Da Ruckus <br />4)Da Mystery Of Chessboxin' <br />5)C.R.E.A.M. <br />-of course it's difficul to pick out the best, as they all being amazing
0553801503|5.0|I began reading the Song of Ice and Fire series because I had been reading Robert Jordan, and all of the negative reviews seemed to recommend Martin if you are tired of traditional fnatasy.  <br /> <br />I was tired of traditional fantasy. <br /> <br />So, I picked up the three books that were out at that time, and read them in the space of a month, which is a really short time considering how busy my schedule can be. These books are a joy to read, but at the same time, leave me with a sense of forboding, because George R. R. Martin ruined the fantasy genre for me. Not becasue I didn't like his stories, but because I believe that these stories are even better than the lord of the rings.  <br /> <br />I know, that's a shocking statement, but I'm afraid that I'll never be able to find a fantasy novel or series that lives up to what Martin has done here. I am desperately awaitng the follow up the A Feast for Crows, and am, now and forever, a fan of GRRM. <br /> <br />Now for the actual review: <br /> <br />This book is amazing, and picks up where A Storm of Swords leaves off. Renly and Robb are dead and Stannis is all but defeated, and it seems Joffrey will remain king of the Seven Kingdoms. But, at Joff's wedding feast he is poisoned and dies, leaving his youger brother Tommer to be king in his place.  <br /> <br />Suprisingly, (not) Cersei royally screws up and ends up in a prison cell. Jaimie tries to regain some measure of honor by sending Brienne to find Sansa who lives with Littlefinger, now Lord Protector of the Vale, after pushing Lysa out of the Moon Door. Euron Crow's Eye is King of the ironmen and pushes his fleet up into the Arbor. Beric Dondarrion is dead after givng Catlyn the gift of life when they find her corpse after the Red Wedding, Arya goes to Bravos and begins her training at the temple of the Many-Faced God, and Sam travels to Oldtown to be a maester.  <br /> <br />All of this and I haven't hit every point, but you get the picture, and somehow, it all twines together.
1400031087|5.0|I thought this book was original and interesting.  It was a good read and really puts the life of a drug addict into perspective.  I find it really interesting that so many people thought this was a wonderful book until they realized that parts of it may or may not be embellished.  A book is good when it stands on its own two feet as a good read and I think A Million Little Pieces did that.  People are so outraged about the alleged lies that it contains, but what about the impact it had on so many people?  What about the addicts who were inspired to make a change and get clean because of this book?  What about the families and friends of addicts who were pushed, by this book, to demand change and force their loved ones into rehab?  How can such a positive impact be cast aside by the fact that some reporters believe parts of the story to be false?   <br /> <br />Addiction, and fighting of it, involves so much more than being wanted in three states or criminal activity.  I think the most important part of this book was his internal psychological battle, which non-addicts will never understand.  I give 5 stars and loads of praise to James Frey for being able to depict this in such an open and liberating way.  Does anyone really believe that \\"true\\" stories are 100% true every time anyway?
B000002KFJ|5.0|Some Black Sabbath fans think Ozzy and the gang hit their creative peak with their fifth album, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" thus their sixth album (\\"Sabotage\\") was the start of the group's decline. But other fans loved \\"Sabotage\\" and believe that it showed that the band were evolving and maybe even maturing. This reviewer is in the latter camp. Granted, when compared to Sabbath's first five records (especially \\"Master of Reality\\"), this album is not very dark or gloomy, and it actually kind of sounds \\"uplifting.\\" (This brighter sound was made possible because of guitarist Tony Iommi, who brought in \\"orchestral\\"-like instruments, including keyboards and even a choir in the song \\"Supertzar.\\") But this is still Black Sabbath; \\"Sabotage\\" is still a heavy metal album, so the guitars are still very much involved. After all, the chug and churn guitar lick on \\"Symptom Of The Universe\\" is quite possibly thrash's first ever riff! The first track, \\"Hole In The Sky,\\" is super catchy and has a memorable main riff. \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" is about fifty seconds long, and it's thought of by some people as a filler track, but I think Tony's acoustic string arrangement is very pretty in this song. Track four, \\"Megalomania,\\" is ten minutes long. It begins as a slow, depressing ballad, but it becomes heavy by the end. The next song, \\"The Thrill of It All,\\" is highlighted by a bluesy guitar solo, and track six, \\"Supertzar,\\" is an instrumental with an ominous use of the aforementioned choir. \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" has a catchy sing along (\\"tell me people...am I going insane?\\") and some creepy, maniacal laughter too boot. Finally, \\"The Writ\\" is another long song (eight and a half minutes in length), but, unlike \\"Megalomania,\\" this song features some great singing by Ozzy, as well as guitar work which wouldn't be out of place on an early Rush record. So, \\"Sabotage\\" is (yet) another classic album from a band who were seemingly incapable of making anything else. This is essential listening for all Black Sabbath/Ozzy fans and heavy metal fans in general.ing for all Black Sabbath/Ozzy fans and heavy metal fans in general.

0894803123|5.0|I have given this as a gift to several friends who have bought ice cream makers and then let them sit on a shelf. Once they see how good and simple ice cream can be, they are back to making it often. I have been making the recipes for many years and have never gotten sick from using raw eggs. It isn't the inconvenience of cooking the eggs that I don't like, I don't like the cooked custardy taste of custard-based ice cream. I know most of the recipes by heart and can whip up ice cream in no time without even consulting the book by now.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I never saw the TV show, but i never much liked Whedon's Buffy either, and this movie (and the tv show too i presume) had the same level of humor. The whole Western/Sci-fi theme, while fairly unique, just didn't work for me.  And the little skinny girl going ballistic on Reavers was completely ridiculous, not to mention Reavers being able to pilot sophisticated starships when they're supposed to be some kind of irrational madmen!<br /><br />This was just a silly TV movie somehow - SOMEHOW - elevated to feature film status. It wasn't bad per say, but i really don't want to see it again. At least Phantom Menace had some cool lightsaber fights...
0307276902|5.0|When I read this book a year ago, I found some aspects either ridiculous or too vague, and I assumed he exaggerated but accepted that as artistic license.  I felt sorry for the guy and admired his strength to recover.  Now America feels duped.  He was a frat boy!  He goes around making the Oprah scene and further embellishing on the details in his speaking appearances, and it looks like his parents are in on the joke.  Enabling parents... drug user.... hmmm I see a pattern here.  If only he had presented it as fiction.  I give it five stars because it's a damn entertaining book.  But James Frey gets one star for integrity.

When I was a kid, my father used to say that are greatest hopes & worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears were realized tonight. They have said that there were 11 hostages. 2 killed in their rooms this mor- yesterday morning. 9 killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone.\\"<br /><br />With this tragic & senseless loss, the country of Isreal secretly retaliates with Prime Minister, Golda Meare recruiting a young field operative who Meare has known in the past, named Avril, to put together a five man operation consisting of ex-Mousad soldiers to avenge the deaths of the fallen atheletes of Munich & killing the 11 conspirators that were responsible for their deaths.<br /><br />Avril accepts the mission with unflinching trust in his country & patriotic pride. Working undercover (he signs a contract stating that he doesn't exist), & with the help of his secret ops. commander, Ephraim, Avril is given bank accounts with unlimited financial resources to recruit the best agents for the job & do whatever it takes to get the job done. Traveling to & around Europe, the group slowly starts to gain notice with each death, in the dark confines of the underworld. Avril's underground contact, Louis, is a perfect piece of 70's Euro-trash (even his father, known only as \\"Papa\\" would gladly trade him for Avril) & slowly becomes untrustworthy. Soon, the hunters become the hunted. When he slowly starts to lose members of his team, Avril starts to get paranoid, checking his hotel phone, his bed, & his T.V. for explosive devices. Adding to the stress is his family, who he misses dearly.<br /><br />When he does finally return home, he slowly realizes that the country he once believed in, never truly believed in him. Feeling used & betrayed, Avril returns to his family, but, still living the feeling of being trapped in the paranoid crosshairs of terrorism.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is one of the best films of 2005. Spielberg's direction is top notch (he just may get another Oscar for this). The flashback scenes are a bit gruesome, but, factually acurate.<br /><br />Using the ABC footage of the Olympics and incorporating into the filmed footage gave \\"Munich\\" a very spooky edge. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is very much in the style of  70's cinematography (this may get a well deserved Oscar, also).<br /><br />The cast is great. Eric Bana as Avril is his best role to date. Daniel Craig & Geoffrey Rush with the rest of the cast help elevate the film's greatness. I would expect Oscar nods for Bana for best actor & supporting role nods for Rush & Craig.<br /><br />Since I'm a die-hard fan of Spielberg's work I couldn't help, but, notice one drawback.<br /><br />The origin of \\"Indiana Jones\\" is legendary. In the late 70's Spielberg & George Lucas were discussing future film projects. Spielberg told Lucas he had always wanted to direct a Bond movie, but, Lucas led Spielberg down a different path with \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\". 24 years after the release of \\"Raiders\\", & as I watching \\"Munich\\" it finally hit me, Spielberg finally got to make his spy movie.<br /><br />Don't believe me?<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" has a small group of secret agents sent out to avenge the deaths of the Isreali Olympiads.

0440224764|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Not only could I not put it down, but I started to become tense and worried about Patrick.  I thought the ending was wonderful for this book.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I read up on the DVD release of the \\"original\\" trilogy before making my decision not to buy it. Specifically, I was looking to see if these were, in fact, the real movies or if they were the \\"special editions.\\"  <br /> <br />That alone would have influenced my decision to buy or not to buy. But what pushed me over the fence completely (and then several fences far away from wanting to part with hard-earned capital for these discs) was learning that even MORE had been changed in this release. Re-dubbing Fett's dialogue? Inserting actors from the new trilogy?  <br /> <br />No thank you. The new trilogy is crap, and the old trilogy has lost a little bit of the glimmer that it sustained all on its own for 25 years. I'm pained as I write this; heartbroken, even. I think a lot of people out there, children of the 70's and 80's, the offspring of the Baby Boomers, have had their faith betrayed by George Lucas' need to compensate for his inability to create anything new by going back and destroying the old.  <br /> <br />At least good storytelling and loyalty to the fans remains alive despite George Lucas' turn to the Dark Side... I'll buy Return of the King extended edition instead.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|There would seem to be quite a bit of ill-feeling directed at this film by both professional critics and Amazon viewers, and this negative response is based on some misconceptions as to what this film set out to accomplish. Firstly, one wonders why some of our fellow Amazon viewers watched it to begin with, only to vilify it for all of the elements that make it what it is. Yes, it is brutal, dark, and disturbing; it is a top-notch horror film after all, and not one of the current crop of PG-13 duds designed to make youngsters shriek and then giggle for 20 minutes. Was there some confusion as to the theme and tone of this movie? \\"Misogynistic\\" is the knee-jerk label of choice for almost all horror films today, yet 98% of the people being victimized here are men. They are being brutalized by men. Most of the people who work for this torture mill are men. Some bad gals do indeed serve as lures to bring in the victims, and some women work as prostitutes in the brothels of Amsterdam. Where does this rampant misogyny come in?  As to the other major point of contention, just how much onscreen brutality is utilized in this film? Of course there is some; this is a horror film about sick people who pay to torture people. Yet the onscreen sadism and violence pale in comparison to Passion of the Christ, whose scenes of sadism & brutal torture were 10 times as graphic and prolonged as anything found in Hostel. But Hostel is a nasty horror flick, while Passion was a devout and deeply moving film made for the most pious among us. [???]. As to the charges of the sex scenes approaching pornographic levels, this is indeed laughable. Nudity does not equal porn and there were no overtly graphic depictions of sex acts, though people did indeed have sex. See the distinction? Lastly, Mr Tarantino did not make this film, though he did have some editorial input as far as the script is concerned. He wished to lend support to relative newcomer Eli Roth, who both wrote and directed this movie.Again, one wonders how so many people who are offended by sex, violence, & horror happened to find themselves watching this flick. Did they wander into the wrong theatre or pick it from the rental shelves with eyes closed? Hostel is what it is and it does its job very well indeed. It is great horror creating an effective aura of dread while offering an interesting political subtext to anyone interested enough to examine it. What more was required?

One star less than max because of extensive use of photoshop :(
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Let me first say that to listen to, the score to The Pirates of the Caribbean is wonderful. While it is rather short, the music is constantly attention grabbing. The main theme itself lacks the lustre of a Williams score (Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones) but redeems itself mightily in the area of incidental music, which standing alone (that is, without the movie behind it) has a far more entertaining quality than that of any other composer I have yet heard. The principal issue that bothers me with this score is not the way that it sounds in and of itself, but that the score to the 2000 movie Gladiator, written by Hans Zimmer, uses periods of up to 16 measures in the songs The Battle and The Barbarian Horde which are rhythmically and harmonically identical to passages in Bedalt's music in Pirate's of the Caribbean. They are melodically different, but on occasions, they are the same melodies, simply inverted. In sum, I am not criticising the score for its quality (it is very good), just its originality (it borders on copyright infringement).
B000021XS0|5.0|This album represents all the reasons that people love Dream Theater.  It is also, in my opinion, their best album to listen to.  From beginning to end, it is an enjoyable and dynamic experience.  You won't get bored with this one.  If you only get one Dream Theater album, this is the one to have.  Amazing.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Okay firstly, I love dream theater, secondly, I've been anticipating new stuff from them.  However, that being said, I was let down by this album. <br /> <br />Mainly because I felt a couple of them weren't carrying their weight.  Me personally Labrie is a little much at times, but he definately sounds a lot better (as he should) on here then some lackluster live performances.  I just felt that Petrucci didn't have enough solo'ing and that Portnoy wasn't ripping off his best fills.  It felt like a less 'proggish' album until you of course listen to the final track, \\"Octavarium.\\"   <br /> <br />It's still head over heels better than anything out there you'll see on the pop charts, but it could've definately been atmospheric in quality if they wanted it to be.

I went from struggling with day to day operations and not able to get over a certain gross dollar amount per year to EXPLODING my business virtually overnight into a 7-million-dollar per year company (from barely getting $500,000 per year gross before).<br /><br />I look at the other reviews for this book and I shake my head.  One was from a guy who didn't even read the book all the way through!  His review should be deleted, as he doesn't even qualify to write a review.  I seem to remember the days of being in school where it was a requirement to read the entire book before writing a review (book report).<br /><br />I'm sick of reading reviews from losers and wannabes who never actually use the methods in this book (or any others) but yet have a load of opinions on whether the techniques work or not.  I've actually used these techniques for my company which has resulted in a multi-million dollar per year business.<br /><br />Like some of the most successful millionaires (and billionaires) say:  Don't listen to people unless they are making A LOT MORE than you are and they are in a position in life where you want to be.
0553584537|4.0|Police sniper Bobby Dodge makes a split second decision to shoot a man he sees threatening a woman and a child and that causes his life to spiral downhill. Questions arise whether Catherine Gagnon, the woman whose husband he killed, engineered the shooting. Her in-laws are mounting a campaign against her, saying she's deliberating making her child sick. More people start to die and Bobby is dragged into the mess.   Lisa Gardner is one of my favourite authors and she writes a tautly paced, engrossing thriller which fleshes out the characters and their motivations. She also cleverly balances the vulnerable and the calculating in Catherine so we're never quite sure where she stands. Bobby is an attractive character -- steadfast, troubled and yet terribly decent.     I really wanted to give this a five-star rating, but I couldn't because the story becomes predictable after a while and even though the story throws up an interesting motivation and nugget, the ending was reaching a bit. That was disappointing. Besides, what kind of a name for a hero is Bobby Dodge?
B00003CWRX|4.0|\\"The Insider\\" is one of the most incendiary movies of the 90's.  The movie is based on a magazine article, and for the most part the movie follows the article very accurately.  The acting is incredible, except for the fact that Pacino may have wanted to tone down his performance as Bergman.  The story itself is really a heroic story.  Both Wigand and Bergman desparately want to do the right thing, but are constantly foiled by corporate greed.  The companies in the movie (Brown & Williamson and CBS) also want to do the right thing but they do it under the purview of corporate responsibility.  However, we should not forget what this movie is really about.  It is about how the cigarette industry has manufactured a product that has lead to the death of millions of Americans.  What Wigand revealed was that the tobacco companies manipulated their product with a known carcinogen.  Director Michael Mann directs this movie with the serious intensity that it is due.  One of the scenes that sticks out in my mind is where Wigand is being driven to his deposition in Mississippi.  On one side of the motorcade is a graveyard, obviously representing death, and on the other side is the sea arguably representing life.  Thus, we should know that this movie is really about life and death, and the decisions that people make that influence the lives of millions of Americans.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's hard to comment about an album as loved, hated, respected, mocked, revered and belittled as this one without trampling over a few toes.  It's even harder when the album is made by one of the most imporant rock bands of the 20th century (in fact, A&E put the Beatles in the top 10 as one of the most important minds/innovations of the 20th century...NOW THAT'S HYPERBOLE FOR YA). <br /> <br />The truth of the matter is that this is a great album, made by a great rock band, produced by a great producer and manager, made even greater by the fact that it marked a change in the way popular music was CONCEIVED.  One can argue, and I won't disagree, that Bob Dylan was a greater lyricist and his move from folk to rock sensibilities made a huge impact in the world of music (both in terms of the commercial viability of \\"serious\\" rock and the artistic reach of rock writers and performers).  But even Dylan's reach was limited, as it is today, to a relatively small group of ardent followers and admirers, many within the rock fold.  His lyrical structure and no-holds-barred music tonality makes it difficult to \\"spread his message\\", if you will, to a broad spectrum of the music LISTENING audience (be that as it may, I am a huge fan of Dylan...he is, and will always be, in my mind the greatest rock/folk lyricist of our time and one of the greatest poets of our time...I truly believe this). <br /> <br />What the Beatles did with Sgt. Pepper was bring the artistic and lyrical qualities of Dylaneque folk/rock into the mass audience of pop rock without bastardizing it.  In fact, the Beatles brought new elements into the rock genre with this album.  I would say that whereas in Dylan you knew you were hearing rock art, with the Beatles, you didn't know this consciously, but it the rock/art themes took over your mind, soul and sensations.  You have to realize that only a few years earlier, the Beatles were singing \\"She loves you/yeah, yeah, yeah\\" using about 10 chord changes, drums, bass guitar, rhythm and lead guitar.  Now, they were using full orchestras, using innovative sound effects (without the use of digital synthesizers mind you), using fades and echo effects, overdubs, etc.  May be other bands were doing this too, but no other band put these together in a coherent, artistic vision.  But all the while, they did not let the art overwhelm what they were in the business of doing...making people love to listen to music. <br /> <br />Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, for example, as experimental a song that you are going to get (think about it, WOULD ANYONE IN TODAY'S MUSIC BUSINESS GET AWAY WITH LYRICS AND SOUNDS LIKE THIS ANYMORE????...WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE MUSIC BUSINESS TODAY????)  \\"Picture yourself on a boat on a river, with plasticine porters with looking glass ties.  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, the girl with kaleidoscope eyes.\\"  These lyrics are backed by a guitar simply plucking strings (I think it's a guitar) and a dreamy sitar overdub.  Now that's experimental and lyrically interesting, if not opaque.  It's Dylanesque it that it rises above the dreary \\"love you, hate you, miss you\\" lyrics common at that time, it's poetic by obtuse...but it's entirely different that Dylan...it's not meant to be social or personal commentary.  It evokes an emotion, as clear and as unclear as dreams can be (drug enhanced or not).  MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO.  How many songs can say that? <br /> <br />Compare this to Lovely Rita.  What would have been a throwaway song about a love interest from a meter maid, of all people, is made totally unique by by the rhythm and tone of the music....it's like he's running, heart racing (as it often does when you see the \\"love of your life\\" for the first time).  There are sounds like a kazoo with echo...it makes the song sound comical, like the situation the song is describing, but rises above that by the shear wit of its lyrics \\"Got the bill, and Rita paid it, took her home, Inearly made it (wink, wink), sitting on a sofa with a sister or two.\\"  Then the most extraordinary thing.  The last minute of the song is a combination of some of the most interesting sounds and rhythms I've heard on a song (again without the use of any synthesisers...these sounds had to be individually created by what they had in their studios, 90% of which is just there own voices and clapping speeded up, slowed down, stretched out, echoed and overdubbed).  These sounds also change the mood.  It becomes serious, in minor keys, like somebody running from, to or away from something.  It's almost like this love, like all loves, are not fun and games.  There's always something more going on underneath the surface (and I haven't even gotten to Day in the Life). <br /> <br />Anyway, my point is this.  For an album to come out like this, at all (considering today's corporate music world), is something special.  For it to come out in 1967 is extraordinary.  For the Beatles to have done this, and Revolver the year before, Rubber Soul a year before that, follow St. Pepper with the White Album and Abbey Road....that is an extraordinary of extraordinary.  You don't have to necessarily listen and like this album or the Beatles per se, but if you listen to the complexity of the songs on this album, how they mixed and matched sounds and themes, how they sought to speak of simple truths and mind-bending psychadelic dreams all in one album....you have to at least appreciate the boldness of this album and the 4 individuals, who for a short period of time, made music that still resonates today. <br /> <br />Whether you are a rap fan, pop fan, classical fan, hard rock fan...listen to the elements in this album and you will see how they have stretched out and evolved over time to what your favorite artists are doing now.  Listen to the opening riffs of St. Pepper and the closing riffs of the Reprise...those are hard rock riffs, listen to orchestra and the production elements, you canhear that from everything from Mariah Carey to Biggie.  Listen to the psychedelia of Lucy in the Sky, and you can hear that in any number of rock bands from Oasis to Kula Shakur, and I can't name all the pop bands that have gotten their riffs, songs and influence from this album. <br /> <br />Nowadays, you can recreate the sound of this album in 10 seconds using pre-programmed this, that, do-dads and do hickeys...digital, number crunched and mashed out.  But I think the music world is at a loss because of this.  To focus the mind on producing something from scratch with only your head, your hands, your voice, your guitar and drums, and some audio tape....scissors and tape.....now to me, you can only get better as a singer, songwriter and artist. <br /> <br />This is art, and the whole scene has been elevated because of this.
B000000OUE|4.0|Unlike Rob zombie's sole stuff white zombie is more gritty, has more guitar work going on and doesn't have as much of an industrial influence to it, but it's still there so don't worry. A lot of the songs are an adrenaline rush and will have up and doing something energenic. One thing about white zombie that I like but don't like about other bands is the use of soundbytes because it adds to the music and doesn't distract from it. So if you like Rob Zombie or metal then buy this cd you won't regret it.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I thought the original version of this movie was going to be hard to top so I didn't bother seeing it in the theater.  We watched this on cable several times, and enjoyed it so much we finally purchased the DVD!  We just love Lindsay Lohan in her role as both twins!  She does an AMAZING job for such a young star!  This is a must have for every family!  I like this modern version of THE PARENT TRAP much better than the older one!
0812975219|4.0|Every investor (and everybody who is intellectually curious) should read this book to gain a new perspective about events in life. <br /> <br />Taleb is a Wharton MBA and Univ. of Paris PhD but he works in the real world as an options trader in the NY area.  He is an intellectual at heart but realized at a young adult that he needed to earn money (as a trader) to fund his passion for learning.  He obviously is well read and a deep thinker.  He is a philosopher at heart.  An interesting article on him appeared in The New Yorker magazine. <br /> <br />The thesis of this book is that far more events in life are random than what the vast majority of people think.  This includes the financial markets.  Why random?  No one can prove those events had predictable direct causes (causation).  Taleb says he is often misquoted.  Many people believe that Taleb claims everything is random.  Not so.  He says far more events occur out of randomness that what we realize. <br /> <br />The author attributes the mistakes of failing to recognize randomness to the human brain.  Common human traits include overconfidence, ego, etc.  Many people claim they know how to predict the markets.  (Small cap stocks should go up because of XXX.)  They falsely attribute correlated events as causation (e.g., the markets went up yesterday [or last year] because of XXX).  Why false?  Those same factors do not explain things over longer periods.  So how can they have any predictive power?   <br /> <br />Many people are fooled into believing investment personalities are smarter and more gifted.   Or, worse: we are smarter and gifted and can predict the markets consistently.  Taleb asserts the markets are largely unpredictable (random walk).  He cites numerous Wall Street traders who did extremely well for several years, had high returns, made millions, and were presented by the media as smarter and more gifted than others.  Eventually, the vast majority of highly successful traders crashed and burned.  Why?  Taleb asserts the traders were not really gifted; they were in the right place at the right time (randomly) and then market conditions changed making their trading strategy wrong.   <br /> <br />The focus of this book is not entirely on the financial markets.  It applies to all life events.  Everyone who is intellectually curious can learn something - even if they do not believe Taleb's thesis 100%. <br /> <br />The book presents logical arguments and then goes on to present academic research in psychology and behavioral finance.  As previously mentioned, Taleb is well read.  He brings together many areas into one thesis.  The topics are far ranging.  They include discussions of the writings of philosophers such as Karl Popper, a 20th philosopher of science and professor at London School of Economics who advanced the thinking from logical induction to scientific proof.  The induction versus scientific proof is a central theme of Taleb.  The author points out that scientists in the natural sciences can prove a thesis through controlled experiments.  However, the social sciences, such as economics, do not allow controlled experiments.  Thus, the social sciences are not really sciences according to Taleb.  This leaves someone's theory based on conjecture and false logic that cannot be proven -- until proven wrong such as when the markets crash. <br /> <br />Taleb asserts that well-known financial theories do not work in the real world.  He specifically cites Nobel laureates Robert Merton and Myron Scholes who developed the famous Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.  Merton was part of Long Term Capital Management (a hedge fund) when it crashed and burned in the late 1990s.  Taleb asserts that not even a person who won the Nobel Prize in Economics can escape random events. <br /> <br />Taleb has a writing style that is different than most books of this nature.  His writing is wordy.  He admits that his editor made suggestions that he choose not to make.  Taleb tends to throw out a lot of references to academic research and writings of philosophers.  (This makes the book more authoritative rather than based solely on his opinions.) <br /> <br />I have one significant criticism of Taleb. He operates his own fund, Emperica Capital.  While he criticized other traders for failing to recognize randomness, he does not report (nor could I find anything through Google) the returns of his own fund based on his beliefs of randomness presented in this book.  He cites Popper on scientific proof but then fails to use the evidence from his own firm's returns to prove (or disprove) the thesis in this book.
B000005AYM|5.0|I'm lovin this CD!  This is one of her best ever!  Appletree, On & On, Rimshot are my favorites on this album!  This is definitely a \\"must have\\" CD if you love R&B and Soul...very classy and sexy combination of the two venues.  Badu has her own style, how can you help not falling in love with her music?
B00005JNX0|4.0|This is a wonderfully funny movie.  However, the plot just isn't that well developed, or maybe it is better to say that the ending just doesn't really tie the movie up.  Still, this movie is at the worst at least worth renting.  Madagascar 2 is already in the works and look for it to be another hit as well.  Great for all ages (I'm 26 and liked it).
B00004CZIZ|5.0|I loved this movie at first i didn't like pink floyd but when i went and saw the movie i had almost all their albums two weeks later now i have the dvd and i still love it i like how Gerald <br />Scarfe drew every thing to bad they left Hey You out of the movie <br />and they changend the song Mother also, i wish they would put that movie back in theaters for a 25th anniversery i think they should and i think it would be cool to see that movie on the big <br />screen again.
B000AP04FG|4.0|If you're looking for lots of action and attractive people in the middle of it all, then this movie is for you.  Angelina is, well, Angelina and definately overpowers Pitt and steals the show (not to mention looks good doing it).  While I don't see this movie even getting glanced at when it comes to writing or screenplay, the movie is still entertaining.  Plus there is that whole Brad-Angelina thing going on right now too.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|By now you've probably heard of the Abba Gimme, Gimme, Gimme sampling dance club monster hit Hung Up and probably wondering if the rest of the new Madonna album Confessions On A Dance Floor is any good. Well it's definitely good and has a string of very nicely produced tracks by the Les Rhytmes Digitales mastermind, Stuart Price, as well as a couple of other producers on the album. In Fact if you happen to have the Les Rhytmes Digitales Darkdancer album you'll notice some similarities. The similarities of the early 1980's sound that was present on Darkdancer and which is present on Confessions On A Dance Floor. <br /> <br />Of course the album gets right into the beats with Hung Up the best single off of the album. Hung Up has an infectious repetitive beat that makes you want to get up and dance. It's catchy and definitely the strongest single off of Confessions On A Dance Floor. The next big track is Sorry which is going to be the next single off of the album. Sorry is almost as good as Hung Up but lacks a little. I assume it's lacking the sample. Also the tracks Jump, Let It Will Be and Forbidden Love. The entire album is a continuous mix so as to have the feel of a DJ mix at a club. It is called Confessions On A Dance Floor after all. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album but not Madonna's best. I assume she's getting tired of recording and finding the next sound. Perhaps she should release a remix album of her past hits. Or another Immaculate Collection. Confessions On A Dance Floor has it's moments so it's still worth checking out. <br /> <br />SJ <br />[...]
B0000AGWRX|5.0|While some may argue that the other Die Hards were better and more action packed, I still have to give the original Die Hard the nod for best movie in this trilogy (though 2 & 3 and both good).  There is just something more real and believable about this one that the others don't have.  If you haven't seen this movie its because you've been living under a rock.  Not just a must see, this is a must own.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The outstanding quality and success of \\"Serenity\\" proves that cancelling \\"Firefly\\" was the worst decision FOX could have possibly made. Surely the karma of every FOX executive will suffer for it over multiple lifetimes.
B00005QIPH|5.0|to suggest that \\"Is This It\\" was/should've been the new decade's \\"Nevermind\\"?  <br /> <br />If this record isnt the pacesetter for new rock and roll, we deserve all crap we get slung at us. Five years have passed, and I do expect the Strokes to fade off into the sunset soon, perhaps without the drama of a Kurt Cobain to make it A Real Rock And Roll Story. No matter-this is easily the hippest, coolest record of the decade so far, regardless of what the pedantic nitwits blathering about hype and selling out are saying.  <br /> <br />Pretty much perfect from start to finish with universal appeal. Every fan of rock music old and young would do well to pick this up.
B00005R2IS|4.0|If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him.  This movie was a really good revenge movie.  The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said.  It is done in \\"Australian language\\" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said.  Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made.  I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue.  But, it is a movie well worth viewing.
0307276902|1.0|Would you also think it is ok for your child to commit plagiarism while writing a research paper for school, or to fabricate information on a resume because it sounds better, or claim deductions on your taxes that you should not claim? I know many people do these things but that doesn't make it acceptable. In an age of false wars, Enron accounting, and fake newspaper articles, has everyone in this country completely lost their scruples? How revolting! If Frey was going to 'embellish' or write from his fantasies, why not just call it fiction. To inject himself into other's drama and capitalize on their misery makes Frey nothing more than a bottom feeder. <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|This movie was voted best movie of the decade for a reason. De Niro is perfect. The supporting cast is perfect. The fight scenes are perfect. I didn't cringe during Goodfellas, but some of the fight scenes here are just brutal. <br /> <br />The picture on the DVD is perfect, as nothing is lost in the black and white. The only issue with the DVD is the fact that the sound drops alot between fights. De Niro sounds like he's mumbling occasionaly, but that can be fixed by turning up the sound on your TV a little bit louder than normal.
0553801503|4.0|The man has talent, no doubt about that.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, despite its shortcomings. <br /> <br />As always, Mr. Martin's work is incredibly readable, which is a good thing considering its wordiness.  I agree with some other reviewers that some of the book could have been edited out--or better yet, never written.  Perhaps that way he could have finished the damn thing in a timely fashion.  As it is, the chapters on Brienne and Arya were just a long tale of nothing in particular, followed by a cliffhanger.  Their stories could easily have been collapsed into a single chapter. <br /> <br />I think, though, that these are minor problems.  Some of the other criticisms I've read seem kind of silly.  \\"My favorite characters are missing\\"--do you realize how childish that sounds?  \\"It's too dark\\"--realistic would be a better adjective.  Medieval warfare was a cruel experience for everyone, and I think Mr. Martin has an amazing talent for capturing the brutality of pre-modern life, soldiering in particular. I don't find his character histories ponderous either--he has a talent for reviewing storylines without restating them. <br /> <br />The book was a feast, but the presence of too much gristle leaves the writer hungry for more.  Hopefully Dance of Dragons will deliver more meat, and soon, because I'm hungry and this metaphor has been stretched too thin to provide any nutrition... <br />
B0002BO0HG|5.0|A good friend turned us on to Antony and after spending many years in New York listening to great drag acts like Kiki and Herb, my friend's description recalled this genre.  But he was off in a big way.  There is NOTHING kitsch about Antony (and the Johnsons).<br /><br />Try to imagine a voice that is the complete merging of Little Jimmy Scott and Nina Simone.  Impossible, you say?  You would be wrong.<br /><br />A great jazz legend, I can't remember who, once said that if God had a voice, it would sound like Little Jimmy Scott.  She was wrong - God would sound exactly like Antony.  Vocals that evoke the most intimate hurts, nostalgic moments that ended epochs of your life, dreams that eluded you, desires that trickled off your fingertips before you could close your hand.  This is the voice of Antony.  And so much more.<br /><br />I am still discovering this brilliant artist.  After Elliott Smith died, I pretty much stopped listening to anything.  I was devastated - any Elliott Smith fan can understand that his death dealt a deep cut into us.  Until I found Antony I hadn't found anything as profoundly moving since.  I am so greatful for him and his lion-hearted voice.
B00005JOFO|5.0|While I wanted to see Brokeback Mountain for the Ledger/Gyllenhaal make-out sessions, I found so much more was in store for me. Brokeback Mountain is an amazing movie for many reasons - the amazing directing, soundtrack, and cinematography - but what sets it apart from so many other movies being made right now is the acting. I've never thought of Heath Ledger as a particularly talented actor, but I'll admit when I'm wrong. He brings such realism to his character; as someone who grew up in rural, alpine Colorado, I have seen his character a thousand times in lonely ranch-hands. His inner battle over his sexuality is far from the mainstream personification of gay men in Hollywood and mainstream TV. Gyllenhaal shows the vulnerability of his character - extroverted, in need of affection (physical and otherwise), and trying to accept himself in a way that Ennis (Ledger) can't. I hope that the acting will be a vehicle to show viewers that the \\"modern gay man\\" can be anyone, from any walk of life, from any corner of this country.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|The album is amazing.  John has a unique gift of taking the blues and integrating it with pop to create a sound that will leave you singing along until your mouth drops open wide wondering how he learned to play guitar.  John is a talented man as well as Pino and Steve.  If you don't think it's worth it now, just wait and in a few months you can jump on the bandwagon with everyone else who will finally realize how great it is, or you could buy it now.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Yes, it really is pretty much a Waters solo album in disguise; and yes, it doesn't not sound like Pink Floyd.  Which proves, among other things, that Waters was Pink Floyd and that David Gilmour was too.  Not that Gilmour's presence is much felt here, aside from a couple of typically scorching solos.  As for Richard Wright, his presence is in fact sorely missed.  And I might as well mention Nick Mason while I'm at it; he plays determinedly - - indeed, intrepidly considering the circumstances - - on.  Where ANIMALS was dark, THE FINAL CUT is a self-proclaimed black hole.  The only misstep is 'Not Now John', a redundant Waters screamer along the lines of 'The Nile Song' (and why do the backup singers go uncredited?).  Seekers of easy listening and melody need not apply.  Anyone else must.  Stark, skeletal, demanding and dynamic in the extreme, THE FINAL CUT works on many levels, but you gotta pay close attention to it.  From whispers to screams, au revoir Fletcher.
B000050XEI|5.0|You could say I was a virgin to Enya's music, I previously owned no albums by her until I bought this one for my birthday. I was in awe after listening to the sound of heaven, literally, that is how good this album is. \\"A Day Without Rain\\" was a huge success for Enya back in 2000, it won a GRAMMY and went to #2 in the USA and #6 in the UK. It's biggest hit was \\"Only Time\\" which earned a US #10. \\"Only Time\\" was also used extensively a year later as background music for many news reports on the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like every album it attracted some negative criticism for being too short, although only about 37 minutes in length \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is as good as any 'long' album.<br /><br />The title track, \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is basically a short intro with a lovely piano and string section accompanied by Enya's trademark humming. Beautiful melody line. \\"Wild Child\\" was another single to be released from this album, it went to #72 in the UK. The continuous plucking of the violins and sharp staccato bowing of the other stringed instruments give a nice syncopated feel to the song.<br /><br />\\"Only Time\\" is the best known track from the album, it continues in a slower vein to \\"Wild Child\\". The vocal harmonies are expressive and nicely arranged. The lyrics are quite solid as well. \\"Tempus Vernum\\" comes across to me as a Celtic inspired war-chant, the chant certainly does work wonders giving the song a very dark atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"Deora Ar Mo Choi\\" is a beautiful song, Enya's vocals may be soft but they are incredibly effective. It sort of sounds a little bit like her LOTR Soundtrack song, \\"May It Be\\". In the first couple of seconds of \\"Flora's Secret\\" I though I was listening to an alternate version of \\"Wild Child\\", while not an alternate version it does sound incredibly good and is surprisingly catchy.<br /><br />\\"Fallen Embers\\" is a sombre track that displays amazing emotion, depth and longing. Enya proves on this track that her vocal capabilities go beyond backing hums to superb soprano tones. \\"Silver Inches\\" is a nice little instrumental track, that provides some sort of structure to the overall album.<br /><br />\\"Pilgrim\\" starts off sounding like a hymn sung in any Irish church, it does continue the overall theme of the album well. I like how the lyrics fit perfectly with the music. \\"One By One\\" is a gem of a song, it has a catchiness and I love the \\"Adios\\" bits of this track. The simplicity of this song is amazing.<br /><br />\\"The First Of Autumn\\" may have no lyrics but its bass line and humming work surprisingly well, the imagery created is fantastic. \\"Lazy Days\\" is a lovely way to end such ab great album, with it's catchy beat and hook-line \\"Da da da da\\" it has a little bit of commercial appeal which is always needed on even the most underground of albums.<br /><br />Overall, \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is unlike anything I've heard before, it combines catchy rhythms with small doses of commerciality in an album which at times has no mainstream appeal. It's beautiful but accessible, enough to satisfy even grunge and heavy metal fans. I strongly recommend you to buy this album, tempt yourself, treat yourself to a piece of heaven.nes. \\"Silver Inches\\" is a nice little instrumental track, that provides some sort of structure to the overall album.    \\"Pilgrim\\" starts off sounding like a hymn sung in any Irish church, it does continue the overall theme of the album well.

B00005B4GU|5.0|'Pyramid Song', with it's ascending-descending piano motif and swirling orchestration, is alone worth the price of admission (not necessarily monetary, mind you).  And the plaintive 'Knives Out', with a deceptively straightforward melody and structure, pretty much gives the lie to the words 'love song'.  Yes, the album is of course all over the place musically, but as usual with Radiohead repeated listening is its own reward.  KID A outtakes or no, AMNESIAC stands on its own as an always intriguing listen.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I had some vague idea of who Sigur Ros were before I bought this album, now I don't care who they are, they just make amazing music. This album is something that words can't begin to explain, it's an epic masterpiece that has just blown me away. Upon first listen I thought I would be in for a long ride of just plain instrumental music. I was wrong, although they don't often sing in the most audible tone the instruments are fantastic and the vocals hover amongst the sonic instrumentation.<br /><br />Sigur Ros could possibly be called the Icelandic Radiohead, their work emulates Radiohead and for some reason their music reminds me of The Arcade Fire. Sigur Ros is one of those bands that you perhaps wouldn't have taken any notice in previously but upon listening to them you are immediately smitten.<br /><br />\\"Takk...\\" is by no means an album that will debut at #1 in the UK, US and all over the world. It's an album that is meant to speak to people and show talent, real talent. Sigur Ros are an awesome band and even though the only place this will go #1 is Iceland, this album still rivals and even betters the likes of Kanye West and Mariah Carey.<br /><br />This whole album requires extreme patience, it is a 'grower'. Don't expect to be immediately infatuated with it, good things take time. There are two real stand-out tracks, \\"Hoppipolla\\" and \\"Gong\\". \\"Hoppipolla\\" is my pick as the best single of 2005.<br /><br />These two tracks both contrast each other well, \\"Hoppipolla\\" seems less darker and gloomier than \\"Gong\\". \\"Gong\\" is also more experimental.<br /><br />Overall, this album starts off happy and vibrant and grows a little darker towards the end. The whole album flows well and is solid throughout. Whether it be the falsetto-esque vocals or amazing piano imagery this album has everything. It seems like Sigur Ros wanted to make a soundtrack to life. All I know is after listening to it you will feel up-lifted and mesmerised.
B000022TSH|5.0|This is one movie that time will never age. One of the few movies you can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the lastime as the 1st. Maybe even more because you know what scenes to focus on. Memorable scenes: Nicholson tells a joke to his co-workers while a female and her attorney are standing behind him which he doesn't notice. The Barber shop scene. My favorite is when he goes to the Mayor's office for the 2nd time and is waiting in the reception room fidgeting which is driving the receptionist up the wall. That scene is so well acted out you feel the tension. I believe this movie was Nicholson's finest hour and certainly one of the best movies ever made.
B0009PEYGM|5.0|Truls Mørk is a musician who seems comfortable in every era of music.  His performances of the major concerti for cello and orchestra range from the Baroque through the high Romantics to the Contemporary. And with every period of composition he sounds wondrously at ease.  He has superlative technique, an endless arm, a control of a vibrato range and tonal color that is matched by few.  And yet to everything he plays he brings passion, whether that be for works for solo instrument, chamber ensembles of the big concerti.<br /><br />To spend time with Bach's luminous suites for solo cello is like learning to breathe again.  The six suites BWV 1007 - 1012 are at once treacherously difficult, complex and intellectual, blending some of the finest motifs Bach ever created, and at the same time some of the most eloquently ethereal melodies ever composed.  Mørk plays these as if they were written for him, so much into the spirit of the works is he.  The sound is never less than gorgeous and the technical demands are met at every level with a sophistication and nimble fingering that makes this recording one of the very best available.<br /><br />Virgin Classics is to be commended for the quality of sound produced here - a silent atmosphere with just the right ambient resonance to allow Mørk and Bach to sing.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06
B00004VVNB|4.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the 1967 novel of the same name by William Nolan and George Johnson.  This movie inspired a short-lived 1970's television show.<br /><br />It begins with the printed word:<br /><br />\\"Sometime in the 23RD century, the survivors of war, overpopulation, and pollution are living in a great domed city sealed away from the forgotten world outside.  Here, in an ecologically balanced world, [human]kind lives only for pleasure, freed by the servo-mechanisms which provide everything.  There's only one catch: life must end at thirty years [of age] unless reborn [or 'renewed'] in the fiery ritual of carousel.\\"<br /><br />From here, we are introduced to two \\"sandmen.\\"  The first sandman's name is \\"Logan 5\\" (Michael York) and the second one, his partner, is named \\"Francis 7\\" (Richard Jordan).  Their job (which they love) is to put \\"runners\\" (those who decide not to go to carousel when they're thirty but run, or more accurately, try to escape from it) to sleep--forever (that is, they \\"terminate\\" or kill them.)  (It is interesting to note that both actors York and Jordan were over thirty in this movie but they don't look it.)<br /><br />The society of the domed city is run by a giant supercomputer and thus this society is very orderly & efficient.  In fact, each person in this enclosed society has a \\"life clock\\" from birth.  (Life clocks are crystals attached to the palm of a person's hand.  Amazon provides a picture, for the DVD released in 2004, of this movie's DVD case that has a picture of such a life clock-see above.)  Life clocks change color as the person ages.  (Sandmen also have life clocks.)  The color-coding scheme is as follows:<br /><br />(1) Birth: crystal is clear<br />(2) Age 8: crystal turns yellow<br />(3) Age 16: it turns green.<br />(4) Age 24: crystal turns red. (The picture mentioned above has a red crystal)<br />(5) Last few days before age 30: crystal is still red but blinking<br />(6) Age 30: crystal turns black.  (The thirtieth birthday is called \\"Last Day.\\"  It is time for these senior citizens to renew in carousel.)<br /><br />Also, everyone in this enclosed society wear clothes the same color as their life clock (except sandmen who wear black).<br /><br />At this point, I should mention that I picked up this movie's vocabulary by listening and watching carefully.  There are other terms introduced as the movie proceeds (especially in its first half).  I recommend perhaps turning on the English subtitles so you don't miss some of this vocabulary.<br /><br />The action really begins when the computer gives Logan a special assignment: to eliminate those involved with \\"sanctuary\\" (a place outside the domed city where runners can go without being killed).  To do so, he must become a runner (thus the movie's title) so the computer advances his life clock from red to blinking red.  He enlists the aid of a scantily clad female named \\"Jennifer 6\\" (Jenny Agutter who is really under age thirty in this movie) whom he suspects knows about sanctuary.<br /><br />Francis, who doesn't know Logan is under assignment is determined to kill him for running.  The movie at this point becomes a chase movie with Francis chasing Logan (and Jennifer) but with Logan trying to find sanctuary.<br /><br />One of the faults with this movie that can be frustrating is that it doesn't explain everything.  For example, we are not told why Logan is picked by the computer for this special assignment.  As well, at one point Logan goes from runner under special assignment to a genuine runner.  The viewer is not told the reason for Logan's change or even when it occurs.<br /><br />Farrah Fawcett (of \\"Charlie's Angels\\" fame) has a small role in this movie.  The late Sir Peter Ustinov as the \\"Old Man\\" appears in the last thirty minutes of this movie.<br /><br />All actors do decent jobs in their roles.  I think special kudos should go to Michael York, Richard Jordan, and Jenny Agutter for sustaining the energy of themovie (especially in its first half).<br /><br />The special effects were decent for its time (mid-1970s).  In fact, this movie won an Oscar for Best Special Effects.  The only thing that I felt was bad was the antiquated cyborg on wheels (played by Roscoe Lee Browne).  Fortunately this scene does not last very long.  Even the futuristic scenery (computers, domed city, etc.) I thought was decent.  Some may disagree with me on this, however.<br /><br />I did not completely understand the ending or why it even occurred the way it did.<br /><br />The DVD (the one released by Warner Home Video in 2004) has acceptable though not perfect picture and sound quality.  There are four extras, all of them interesting.<br /><br />Finally, this movie coincidentally is thirty years old (from the year of this review).  Time for renewal?  Perhaps.  There is talk of remaking this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, this may not be the best Sci-Fi movie of the 1970s but it's one you can't forget.  Especially as you approach your thirtieth birthday!!<br /><br />(1976;  2 hr;  widescreen)<br /><br />+++++movie (especially in its first half).<br /><br />The special effects were decent for its time (mid-1970s).

B00005JOFO|4.0|I would regard Brokeback Mountain as a solidly good movie but I won't called it great or excellent. This movie tells a story of two men, who happened to be in love with each other and spent their entire lives leading a double life. While this is a \\"gay movie\\", it more closer to a character study of these two men, trapped by custom, families, reputation and lack of understanding that make their lives so unhappy until they get reunited for their many \\"fishing trips\\" up to Brokeback Mountain. Both men, trapped by the conventions of their lives, endured the best they can, when they can to grabbed little happiness with each other. The entire movie centered around their relationship, their friendship and their love.<br /><br />The two male stars, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllanhall carried this movie. For me, Ledger was quite surprising since he was really good in this movie. I figured that since he's such a pathetic actor in the past, getting by on his looks rather then his skills, he simply looked far superior then he really is. He also took the Charlize Theron path by muddling up his looks. He doesn't look like he does in the past movies or even his current one, Casanova. Jake Gyllanhall proves to be the weak link. He still haven't captured the skills needed to ranged out his character in a very convincing way. Both of them were ably supported by their supporting cast. The production values proves to be high and the dialogue overall, proves to be excellent.<br /><br />There are several weaknesses in this film that many critics have overlooked. First one and a very important one is that there seem to be a definite lack of chemistry between the two male lovers. A certain lack of spark between them, that any two lovers may have, may they be hetrosexual or homosexual. This is important since it almost looked like Ledger and Gyllenhaal are forcing it instead of feeling it. While film looked closely at their friendship, it doesn't look close enough in their love. A major weakness by Ang Lee who otherwise directed a fine movie. Second, the make up needed some work. Ledgar aged pretty well since he was muddled up in the first place but Gyllenhaal's make-up looked pretty faked. Adding gray don't aged a man.<br /><br />In many ways, this movie reminded me strongly of a German movie that came out in several years ago titled Aimee & Jaguar, a movie about two German women during World War II, finding love and friendship with each other. The situation seem to be very familiar between the two movies outside of the sex of the main characters.<br /><br />In my opinion, the critics have grossly overhyped this movie for some unknown political correctness. Its a good solid film, remarkably high quality but its a type of film that most people will see it once and probably won't see it again. But you should see it at least once. Thanks to Aimee & Jaguar, it been done before so there's no originality issue but its an interesting character study. I wondered how many more gay men who lived back then, in that region, who also suffered so?akness by Ang Lee who otherwise directed a fine movie. Second, the make up needed some work.

B000E0OBK6|5.0|Having spent time in the Marines I can look at this movie in a different way than an actual \\"movie critic.\\"  To say that the movie's acting was bad and that the characters don't express their relationships with eachother very well is, to say the least, untrue.  When you have a relationship that marines have with very close battle brothers, you don't have to express the relationship and closeness, it's like tension in the air, you can feel it all the time.  You know how close you are to your buddy and you know how close he or she is to you.   <br />As for the film, at that time the situations that were presented like sitting in the desert and waiting, are things that actually happen.  To a civilian who's never experienced this it can be an eternity to us and that's what was trying to be conveyed in the film, waiting for something to happen.  Mairnes don't like to wait for something to happen, we like to go make something happen, that's our job.
0307276902|1.0|I am an alcoholic, sober for ten years.  I went through detox, rehab, AA, and all the rest.  When I read this book a couple of months ago, I thought, \\"This is just nothing like what I went through.\\"  I bought it and intended to pass it along to my AA friends to share, but after I finished it, I didn't want to give it to anyone.  It would scare anyone who was considering going into treatment, and that's a shame because treatment isn't like that.  If I had pulled any of the stunts he did, I would have been out on my bum.  I think the author is just needing attention badly--thus the rebellion and bad boy stunts that he tells about.  In my experience, alcoholics/addicts with his attitude end up drinking/using again, because they have such a case of terminal specialness--the 12 steps work for those other losers, but I'm better than that, stronger than that.  I don't need those crutches.  This book is just sensationalism of the worst kind.  I'm sorry I donated to James Frey by buying this book.  I threw it away so it wouldn't fall into anyone else's hands.
B000001FMX|5.0|I usually don't like punk albums (well, it's proto-punk), but this one, along with The Clash's \\"London Calling\\", is always fun to listen to. It actually sounds a lot like an early Rolling Stones album in most places to be honest with you (it's like a mix between rock & roll, hard rock and punk music). What's great about this album is not only how great all the songs are, but how accessible it is. This is definitely one of the few albums you should show people who don't usually think much of the genre. Singer David Johansen has a great voice which is eerily similar to Mick Jagger, but this only makes everything better (considering Mick's a good singer anyway)! Every song here is great, and the musicianship and lyrics are equally as good. The lyrics tend to be pretty funny and pointless, but you'll love listening to them anyway (they aren't deep necessarily, but they're fun). The musicianship is excellent and pretty unique for an album that came out in 1973 - you can tell why this is such a widely-acclaimed album. It's basically THE definitive proto-punk album. The only complaint I could make here is that it needs a really good remastering, but that's essentially a small-time issue. Chances are, if you like proto-punk, rock & roll or, I guess, rock in general, chances are that you'll love this! Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B0009MAO46|5.0|This is a must-see movie.  It's not your average kids' movie.  It is just great all around.  I have only been through a few of the extras but I have enjoyed them.
B00006JLX4|5.0|I'll admit that I'm not a big Pavement fan, but I can recognize how good this album is. When it came out in 1992, it was very new and thus very inspirational - most indie rock bands today take something from Pavement. The style admittedy isn't for everyone as it's slightly punkish in spots, but indie rock and punk fans will definitely love this album. Singer Stephen Malkmus is a great singer who I think everyone will like (though the shrieking parts I don't think some will like - see parts of \\"No Life Singed Her\\"). The lyrics, though they're sometimes hard to make out, are actually pretty good and worth paying attention to. Musically it seems like pretty standard lo-fi indie rock today, but back in 1992 it was revolutionary. Also, the instrumentation is very well done and the production holds up very well. All things considered, I think that indie rock and (to an extent) punk fans will love \\"Slanted & Enchanted\\" (and probably \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\\")! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00070DK5K|3.0|The critics have always been hard on this album, and no one more so than David Bowie himself.  \\"That album!  I've never played it! ... it must sound like a vampire's teeth coming down on you.  And that picture on the cover ... like I've just stepped out of the grave... that's actually how I felt at the time.\\"<br /><br />Clearly, Bowie was not at his best during this time, and when his manager informed the band at the last minute that they would be paid nothing extra for appearing on the album, they refused to go on stage.  Bowie defused the situation by paying the difference out of his own pocket, but the damage was done and the band turned in a mediocre performance.<br /><br />Still, these are very talented musicians, and their B-game is pretty darned good.  This new remaster (including the three extra tracks) is well worth the purchase for fans of the album.  I listened to this a lot on vinyl and no, it's not like being bitten by a vampire.  Some of the arrangements are strained and I don't care for some of the backing vocals, but Garson's piano is razor sharp, Earl Slick does some great guitar work, and while Bowie's voice is not at his best it gets the job done.<br /><br />I like this record because it features the best live treatments we have of the \\"Diamond Dogs\\" material.  It's not a must have for casual fans, who would probably prefer the 2-disc \\"Best of Bowie\\" greatest hits, but for real fans it's worth a listen.<br /><br />Bowie's artier fans prefer \\"Stage\\", which is a smoother album but features mostly instrumental tracks from \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" which differ very little from the studio versions.  \\"David Live\\" is in some ways a stronger record if only because he's playing hard rock, while perhaps staggering under the pressure of his fame.
B000002KY8|5.0|I'm going to make the claim that Prince's \\"1999\\" isn't as cool as \\"Purple Rain\\" (this one starts off worse, at least), but if you like Prince or pop music then you're going to love it anyway. Every song here is great straight-up pop music and everything about it is well done. Prince is still a great singer here, although I WOULD argue that he's more of a guilty pleasure here than he is on \\"Purple Rain\\". That's not too much of an issue, but it's something to keep in mind. I would argue that, if you're not into Prince or pop music all that much, then this isn't the Prince album to get. \\"1999\\" is the most accessible song here, I think - it's a relatively sweet dance track. Anyways - the musical style here is pretty similar to \\"Purple Rain\\", too, as it's essentially new wave, pop and a little hard rock thrown in to make one interesting sounding package - it's definitely 80's, though (it's a tad dated sounding). Its historical importance and style definitely add to its rating and worth. The lyrics are usually pretty interesting and catchy, so they're also worth paying attention to. Overall, I think that this is still an awesome and original Prince album, but I don't think non-Prince or pop music fans will like it necessarily. They might, but the chances of this are less so than on \\"Purple Rain\\". If you like the style, though, this is a great CD to own! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000AGTPUA|4.0|I was  a little concerned after reading some of the reviews about scary parts.  There is one scene where the kids are \\"tangled\\" in puppets, but other than that it was fine.  My three year old has asked to watch it everyday since we got it.  She loves the singing and dancing.
B000002LOE|4.0|\\"Out Of Time\\" is clearly one of R.E.M.'s worst early albums, but it's funny how good it is even with this in mind. There are a couple arguably \\"bad\\" songs on here, but the rest is either great or classic. \\"Radio Song\\", \\"Losing My Religion\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" are just amazing songs (which are admittedly cheesy but still manage to be accessible and fun). The lyrics may not be as deep as they were on previous albums, but they're always fun, memorable and interesting to listen to - you'll love singing along to these, too (sometimes it's even quotable - see \\"Losing My Religion\\"). Michael Stipe delivers another excellent performance, and although it isn't as emotional as on, say, \\"Automatic For The People\\", you aren't going to care either way. Musically it sounds like 90's college pop rock, and it's just very very well done. Basically folks, if you like R.E.M. or good pop rock, you are going to love this album even IF it's arguably one of their worst (at least it's their more commercial, produced and uninspired one). It's practically impossible to go wrong with any older R.E.M. album. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />the entire album!
B00005JKED|5.0|Wow, I was really blown away by this movie.  I heard that the movie was good and that Denzel was awesome, but I really had no idea.  When the movie was over, I just kinda sat there in awe.  If you can't take alot of profanity, you may want to avoid this one, but if it doesn't bother you, you should definitely see this movie.  There is just so much going on and you get so caught up in this character Alonzo.  Denzel is very strong and convincing in this film and I really felt Ethan Hawke.  I felt bad for him and all that he had to endure.  That is just how good the acting was.  It was just so real.  I enjoyed.  It will be awhile before I can watch it again because it kinda got to me.  I don't usually watch this type of movie, so it was really something, but I was glad that I did.  Explosive and unbelievable performances in this film.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Ok - you're basically reading a Clash review from a person who usually hates punk music (at least new punk music). Hearing The Clash, however, somewhat changes my perspective on the style. \\"Londong Calling\\" is essentially one of few punk albums I can proudly say that I not only like, but can listen to most of and love. Every song here is not only fun and different (for me) to listen to, but everything else about them is great, too. The lyrics, though they're hard to make out at times, are always interesting to pay attention to, and the musicianship and production is just extremely well done here. Singers Mick Jones and Joe Strummers do a very very good job (this is the point where I usually hate punk music, but these guys are great - I think most people will like them) as they not only have cool British punk accents, but also range and genuine emotion (sometimes). It may be more rock 'n' roll than punk, but the average listener will think it's punk music. While most people probably just know the classic song \\"London Calling\\", all the other songs here are fun and catchy, so I think that you'll be hardpressed not to like most of them (and there's a good number of them!). Basically, there's a high probability that you'll like this album, punk fan or not. All things considered, this is highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B0000027F8|5.0|There is no dought that George Michael is an excelent performer and songwriter. Although he continues to write wonderfull songs, I believe that his best period was from 1984 'till 1991. Through those years he wrote and performed uncountable major hits which at the same time were top quality pop songs (and I am not talking about Madonna style disguisting pop songs). The \\"Listen without Prejudice\\" album was released after the huge  success of the \\"FAITH\\" album which sold more than 20 million copies worldwide (and its still selling!!). For the \\"Listen without Prejudice\\" album that was a unfortunate fact. I mean that \\"FAITH\\" was definitely a much more mature album than the Wham ones but it sold tremendousely to the teen audience because of songs like \\"FAITH\\", \\"Father figure\\" and others. After that success the fans expected that the second solo album of Michael will follow the trails of \\"FAITH\\" (from the saling point of view that would've been a good move). But George Michael suprised them all by releasing \\"Listen without Prejudice\\" which can be easily characterized as an adult pop album. The maturity of the album is obvious in its entirity. The lyrics are in fact poems and the musical arrangements are in their majority acoustic. Songs like \\"Praying for time\\", \\"They wont when I go\\" and \\"Mothers Pride\\" are a critical statement against the leaders of this world which choose to spend money on wars instead of helping the poor. Songs like \\"Freedom\\", \\"Something to say\\",\\"Heal the pain\\", \\"Cowboys and Angels\\" , \\"Soul free\\" and \\"Waiting for that day\\" are probably inspired by Michaels own experiences. I believe that every song in this album is a diamond. This is not an easy task since 99% of the albums released  have the most two or three good songs. That is why I believe that \\"Listen without Prejudice\\" is the peak of George Michaels career. This album is a classic and definitely ahead of its time. A must have for everyone who listens pop/rock music.
B000002L68|5.0|Prince was definitely a strange character, and it definitely showed on \\"Purple Rain\\". This album sounds like nothing else you will ever hear as it's the strangest pop music I've ever heard. It's like a combination of hard rock, new wave, pop rock and other styles that all come together to make a truly unique experience. Prince is an awesome singer (and guitarist...and songwriter...and artist...) - I'm pretty sure everybody in the world will like him (he's extremely charismatic). Every song is great, and there's even several classics here - \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" (which is just a KILLER dance track - this has GOT to be the best party song EVER RECORDED (and I'm not exaggerating here, unless you hate pop music)!) and \\"When Doves Cry\\" being my most favorite. It comes SO CLOSE to being a guilty pleasure, and yet it remains amazing and universally appealing (sort of like Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\"). The lyrics are clever, funny and always interesting to listen to (and in some cases genuinely emotional) - you'll never get tired of hearing these songs. The production is also pretty fantastic for a mid-80's album. Basically, if you like Prince or pop music at all, there's no reason why you won't love this. I can't recommend this highly enough!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000002GVO|4.0|Fantastic album, with a bonus, Joe Walsh. Excellent music, title track, country punned New Kid In Town, Life In The Fast Lane, all the regulars from normal airplay. This is why we love The Eagles, straight to the point rock and roll.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Yes basically started the prog-rock genre, so it's also a good thing that they're the best of the genre, too. \\"Fragile\\" came out in 1972 to the world's amazement as it was the first of its kind. This is definitely an experimental prog-rock concept album, and even with this in mind it's VERY appealing (although its dated sound might turn some people off). Yes certainly doesn't sound like any other band I've heard before, although many definitely tried copying them (like Starcastle). It does, however, sound pretty fantastical (as in fantasy - I don't know the correct word to say that) and dreamy a lot of the time. Singer Jon Anderson's voice is perfect for the band's style as it definitely enriches the experience. The lyrics are also surprisingly interesting and fun to listen to. The production is reasonly good, but since I don't have the remastered version I could only imagine it sounds much better. Basically, if you're a Yes or prog-rock/art rock/experimental fan then it doesn't get any better than \\"Fragile\\" (or they're follow-up \\"Close To The Edge\\"). I would also argue that it's pretty appealing to other genre fans, too. All things aside, though, this is highly recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000002U9Y|4.0|Not as good as Pipers but worth making a note of.  The album has got its high points and lows, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. My favorite is the title track, but, it is a long song and is irritating at first, too much wasted noise at the beginning, but IF YOU GOT A STEREO THAT WILL LET YOU FAST FORWARD THRU TO ABOUT 8:16 of the song it is worth the rest of the time listening, almost like chamber music, or something from a funeral, interesting. Jugband Blue I think is the only one by Syd, pretty good, but you can definitely tell there is some serious problems here, good song though. Corporal Clegg, funny little number, good Water's song as well as Set The Controls For The Heart Of the Sun, excellent. Still got a while before they find their true sound from Dark Side, but you got to still remember, they are still trying to find themselves here and it shows. This album is worth a gander, worst case senerio, you won't like it cause it's still far fetch from later compilations, buy at own risk.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Though it's clear that \\"Hail To The Thief\\" isn't as creative and won't be as influential as \\"Ok Computer\\" or \\"The Bends\\", it's still an awesome album. Thom Yorke delivers another excellent and emotional vocal performance here which is pretty standard for Radiohead albums. The album is very creative and definitely does not sound like any other band today - Radiohead still sounds like Radiohead. They haven't lost their creative edge, either, as every song here is really good and some are even great (see \\"There There\\" and \\"A Punch Up At A Wedding\\")! The lyrics, as usual, are very interesting and fun to listen to. Musically it...well...sounds like Radiohead, so if you know what they sound like then I don't have to bother explaining it (ok, it's art rock). Basically, if you're a Radiohead fan then you're going to love this album, and chances are if you aren't then you'll still like it, too (mostly because of the hit \\"There There\\"). All in all this is highly recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />the entire album!
B000001EHS|2.0|Just never got into these guys, never will. I got this album a few years back to keep my wife quiet. Well it's been over 2 years now since I've been divorce, and I must say along with my divorce don't have either one of these, got rid of them both. The only highlights Bringing on The...., and Two Steps Behind, that's it my friends. Just too much airplay on radio and MTV. Can you say \\"COMMERCIALISM\\" I knew you could.
B000001FI7|5.0|Every now and then a cd comes along which is so original and compelling that a music lover can't help but compare all other music to it.  In Dummy, Portishead has created precisely that kind of cd.    Its music, as others have said, is sensual and rhythmic, as if Geoff Barrow and Beth Gibbons were presenting us the notes between the notes.  But more than that, its sound creates the unusual sensations of being both familiar and strange, attractive but alien, vastly erotic yet imminently danceable-that is, if one were to want to dance among icy breezes before plunging into passionate, heated embraces.    That the reviewers here each seem to have picked different songs which mean the most to them is testament to the allure and power of this wondrous performance.  From the erotic opening beat of Mysterons to the final wistful gasps of Glory Box, Dummy is a thrilling, hungry paeon to a world which never was but which nevertheless we each of us glimpse in our most pristinely private, human, and sensuous moments.    It's a profound, stunning accomplishment, as testified by the difficulty the duo has had in reproducing its appetite and drive.  But in its uniqueness, in its influence on other performers and on the listener, Dummy is physical and great.
B000669GAI|4.0|Good greatest hit compilation here. Most recomending for those who don't want the other albums by these guys, just get this, this is all you need to understand Pearl Jam. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with these guys when they first came out, just like the other million of us out there. But this album has all that there is to offer from the Pearl like my favorites in order on the album: <br />Jeremy <br />Corduroy <br />Not For You <br />Do The Evolution <br />Black <br />Daughter <br />Betterman <br />Nothing As It Seems <br />and Yellow Ledbetter <br />see what I mean, good selections, all on two discs. <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|The fact that this show is told from a dead neighbors perspective is pure genius! It gives the writers freedom to not have to link the different scenes or characters in any particular way because \\"Mary Alice\\" is viewing everything from heaven.  <br />Susan is my favorite character from the show...she is the typical lonely single mom lookin for love. And she has an amazing relationship with her daughter.  <br />Gabrielle is the kind of person you just want to slap because she is a spoiled brat who thinks her life sucks even though she has everything. <br />Edie is the group sleeze who craves on the attention of others...but honestly, aren't we all in need of attention sometimes?? <br />Lynette is the overstressed mother of four whose husband can't help when he's needed. She's in need of a serious weekend alone. <br />Bree is the stereotypical housewife who is in serious need of a bottle of liquor and a smoke. You can tell she's about ready to loose it.  <br />These woman have lives some of us dream about and I love tuning in every week to see what happens next!!
B000002UA5|3.0|Almost like the White Album by the Beatles as far as individualism goes. At least there was a live album included in this set. Truly, I would have only gave it 2 stars if this wasn't the case. The only songs on the studio side worth listening to is Roger's Granchester Meadows, good acoustic guitar on it, and good lyrics too. Now to Gilmore's set, Narrow Way, good guitar work but you can't understand his mumbleling on Part 3 of the song. The two other contributors Mason and Wright, this is why they don't write things on their own, it truly stinks. Now the live set, not bad, especially Careful With That Axe Eugene, pretty good stuff there, and Astronomy Domine is good here too. Buyers beware, this album set is probally better off with someone who has tolerance to sit thru crap to get to some good live songs, probally better if you're a true Floyd fan from the get-go.
B0006L16N8|2.0|...and not in a good way.  I really like the previous two Coldplay albums, but this one nearly bored me into a coma. <br /> <br />The good: Fix You - this song is mellow and beautiful, albeit in a very generic way.  When I got my wisdom teeth out, the oral surgeon let me listen to music on my headphones while he gassed me with nitrous and administered IV Valium.  This is the sort of music you would want to listen to while having a pharmaceutical grade drug experience in a doctors office.  Nothing that makes you trip out, just something that makes you feel like someone else understands you in your sedated delierium. <br /> <br />The bad: Twisted Logic - this song will literally put you to sleep.  Actually, the whole album will.  But this one, with its refrain of \\"You'll go backwards, again.  You'll go forwards again.\\" sounds like it's literally trying to rock you to sleep.  If Coldplay were trying to get on a \\"Rockers Sing Lullibies\\" album, this is the sample song they would submit. <br /> <br />The ugly: Speed of Sound - it sounds like Chris Martin is channeling new wave Bono a la Apple commercial.  I like this song and hate myself for it.  When I listen to it on my iPod, I have visions of myself turning into a shadow on a green background and have the irresistable urge to dance like a spazz.  I kick myself for even having the thought, then turn on Rush of Blood to the Head to remind myself that it wasn't always like this.
B000BNI99K|1.0|Sorry Rod, but I've heard this stuff, and I have to say this is pure garbage. It hurts me to say this too. What happen to you. Stick with the rock and roll you know like Maggie May, Stay With Me, Hot Legs, remember these, or are you getting senile. I loved you in The Jeff Beck Group, Faces, or even early you or 80's you, but swinger Rod, I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I first saw the movie version of Phantom of the Opera before seeing the play onstage and I was not very impressed.   <br />However, I was then lucky enough to see the play onstage live, which was spectacular.  The difference was unbelieveable.  The live play was incredible.  I loved it.   <br />So now when I look at the movie, I like it a little better, but only because it reminds me of the play.  They should have at least used the same actors from the play. <br />Regardless, I'm still going to buy the DVD only because I love the play onstage so much. <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|Probally the most interesting Floyd album out there. If you're just use to Gilmore, you might not like this album too much, your lost. But to those who like variety listen closely: Astronomy Domine, awesome, Interstellar Overdrive, eerie, Bike, a clown craziest dream, if you've heard this song you know what I mean. This album is definitely a Floyd fan keeper, if you like The Beatles during Sgt. Pepper's era you'll love this album. If you weren't into those acid trippy days BEWARE!!!!! Open your mind folks, Floyd in its early groove, a birth of a new thorn.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack after seeing the movie and the soundtrack just floods you with the images and words and the longing of Jack and Ennis.They truly loved each other.You will be moved to tears,especially track 14...The Wings
B000002MP2|3.0|It was a cute album when it first came out. Got too much airplay just like everything else that was on that album. I can't believe these guys are still jamming. But I'll be honest with you, I'm very tired of the lead singers views on the worlds problems or politics, or our involvement overseas, shutup and play that guitar, you'll never run for office, and you'll never get drafted. Probally my biggest problem with this band right now, them being hippy-wannabees. Overall just another waste of a band I would have to say.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|<br />It's true-- the sound quality isn't the best.  The packaging was thrown together quickly.  Too many songs lip-synched.  And I'm dying to see something from the Bad Tour put onto DVD.  But there are so many amazing moments on the Bucharest concert.  It's worth buying for \\"Billie Jean\\" alone.  This may be the only full MJ concert we get to see for awhile.  I'd do anything to see Michael get back in shape, do a little rehearsing, and get back on tour.
B000003TA4|5.0|Still one of my favorite albums on my list. This guy is poetic to the far left field, yes, that's what makes it good. Hard to believe this album came out 15 years ago, seems like just yesterday I had this on cassette. My favorites on this is Lithium, Polly, Territorial Pissings, On A Plain, vertialy everything on this album is great except for Smells Like Teen Spirit, I agree with Kurt, it sucks but this is what got them noticed. Well worth getting folks, especially if you like Seattle bands and the 70's rock bands that jammed. Reminisce this gem, high school all over again.
B0000560X0|5.0|I simply can not understand some other reviewers that rated this DVD with less than 5 stars.<br /><br />If you like Big Bands you will see an excellent one (BBC big band) playing. Also, Benson is a great guitarrist and singer and in addition the songs were well chosen.<br /><br />Listen the first song (All of Me), listen to the BIG BAND and say if I am wrong.<br /><br />WARNING: For you to really appreciate this DVD employ some good audio equipment. Dont use only the loudspeakers of your TV or that cheap hometheater set. I used an amplifier connected with a monitor quality headphone (AKG K-66) and thought I was in the show live.<br /><br />As a pianist and can guarantee this DVD is great.
0399208534|5.0|The Hungry Caterpillar was an excellent children's book. The book is filled with numerous colorful illustrations. The book is not only enjoyable to read, but children will learn the stages of a butterfly. I would recommend that this book be in every house and classroom. There are so many activities that you could use after you read this book. Even though the subject matter being presented can become complex, the author does it in such a simplistic way that all children would understand the stages of a butterfly.
B000002LQR|5.0|For those who think that the 90's was a vaccuous time in<br />pop / rock music history, I present to you B.S.S.M!!<br />This was a glorious breath of fresh air at a time<br />when I really needed it and it's now a bonifide classic!<br />I got turned on to the Red Hot Chili Peppers on<br />\\"Mother's Milk\\", another classic by them and have<br />followed ever since.<br />\\"Give It Away\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and the timeless<br />\\"Under The Bridge\\" were all on this set along<br />with some other great tracks!<br />I always felt like they had the vibe of a white<br />latter day Funkadelic with their trippy lyrics,<br />wild stage abandon and free-your-mind-and-your-azz-<br />will-follow philosophy!<br />Then, when I found out that they were P-Funk Headz<br />like me, that sealed it in blood!<br /><br />At the time this album was released, it sold<br />upwards of 8 million copies and since has sold<br />close to 20 million worldwide!<br />This album would be the album that I would put in<br />a time capsule for future generations to know<br />what The Red Hot Chili Peppers were about!<br />(This one and \\"Mother's Milk\\"!!)<br /><br />(Also check out \\"Freaky Styley\\" which was produced<br />by none other than funk master George Clinton himself!)
0156027321|5.0|This is a story of survival. As is any life; yours or mine. Our lives are filled with undulating waves of joy and pain and we simply cope, but never give up, we just keep swimming. We try to make sense of whatever we're dealing with by comparing it to something else we think we actually understand.<br /><br />A little kid shipwrecked tries to survive in the middle of the Pacific ocean...with a wild murderous tiger...alone in a boat. What metaphor can this little boy possibly draw upon to survive such a problem? Or is it a solution?
B000AM6OKS|5.0|Seems like the same (great), but albeit same albums with a different cover.
B00003CY6M|5.0|A diehard fan of movies like Sabrina (Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond) and Love Affair (Warren Beatty, Annette Bening), I somehow missed this entirely until I saw it the other day on a long haul flight.     A beautiful story (just dont over analyze the scenes...) and superb performances by Kate Beckinsale (she is nothing short of gorgeous, her performance seems as genuine and heartfelt as can be, and that accent.... oh my!!!) and John Cusack (the simple charming witty guy next door appeal) will have you fall in love with love all over again.     The soundtrack offers an exceptional melody in \\"Moonlight Kiss\\" Other tunes from \\"Waiting In Vain\\" and \\"January Rain\\" are equally apt and bound to have you humming them the second and third times around you watch the movie... oh you will! :)
B00005JOFO|5.0|It takes your breath away. The film is so powerful and so beautiful. After reading all the reviews I should say I'm surprised the gay population is so narrow-minded to see it as  a gay movie. It is a devastating love story between two human beings. I think everybody should see it just to see how somebody can love, because that's why we all live, not everybody is that lucky though to find it.  <br /> <br />I will be buying it on DVD and probably watching it several times a year. <br /> <br />The acting is superb! Good job everybody...
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young has a nasal, sometimes annoying voice. His saving grace is that he writes great songs. This album has several, centred firmly on the Canadian prairie. The style is country rock - tending to the softer end of the spectrum but the lyrics are perceptive, sometimes whimsical and longing, often biting. For example, he describes the joyous scene of a wedding in a church he's previously described as \\"the fallen soldier bell\\". There are elements of nostalgia and undercurrents of bitterness (\\"Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair ... He takes his money just like all the rest.\\"). There's sweetness and love for both people present and those past. There are many lovely pictures in words. <br /> <br />The more I've played this, the more I like it. I have a few albums that I simply can't put away. This is one.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've debated weeks over this review. But someone has to say it. I bought this album first in May of 1970, graduating from high school. Naked is better, with reservations, than the Spectorized Wall O' Sound I had then. I had Abbey Road, too, and, being a musician and a trained vocalist, I could hear the comparative roughness of \\"Let it Be\\" then as I hear it now. But all the folks who eschew the seeming looseness here, or the poor quality of the live studio sound, do you ever apply the same criticisms to, say, Exile on Main Street? How about the new Faces compilation, Good Boys...When They're Asleep? It seems as though we're able to let roughness or looseness slide, when we think it's part of the band's persona. But I suppose the Beatles have to sound perfect always.<br /><br />The Beatles, here, were trying to produce their own roots music something similar to the progression the Stones had started to make in Beggar's Banquet. I don't know if they were quite a s successful as Mick and the Stones, because the Beatles had always worked for a slicker and more commercial sound than the Stones. But don't let the absence of George Martin's seamless production values and the presence of several takes with variations in some of the riffs and piano and organ lines fool ya. Any musician will tell you the same: if you were standing in the same room (or on the roof) with these blokes, playing this way, you'd have no complaints. I still marvel at the way they can toss off these takes and their musicianship stays on this incredible level, apparently take after take. I will love \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" and \\"Get Back\\" and \\"I Dig A Pony\\" til the day I die, and probably for a while after. This is a worthy album, with eleven tunes that are definitely worth listening to...again. I only wish these Apple people would clear up their problems with itunes so we could cut and splice a comprehensive album from 1969 and 1970 together, as someone else has suggested. Old Brown Shoe, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Hey Jude would fit in nicely here, now that Phil Spector's band's packed up and left the studio.John and Yoko, and Hey Jude would fit in nicely here, now that Phil Spector's band's packed up and left the studio.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Folks, for those who can get past the strokes' image and sometimes hipster audience, and you know who you are, here is a letter concerning their latest album I wrote to a magazine reviewer who gave their effort 2.5 stars and gave a scott stapp album 3.5 stars.  Enjoy: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Dear reviewer- you sure know your music history.  but where'es your music appreciation?  The strokes never claim to be fresh and new- they were just initially perceived as that.  What they actually are is a group that proudly embraces rock of ages past and puts their own spin on it. There are lots of resemblances to other music on the new album- but what an album!  This is their most musically mature effort yet and is catchy as hell, fun, lighthearted whilst being mildly profound (at least more so than scott stapp...)  But then again i guess the strokes are among the bands that never get the credit they deserve- all of the hype you claim exists never really materializes, then gives way to disappointment from music know-it-alls like you.  Even though the strokes arrived during the era of the white stripes and hives etc. that doesnt make them a fad. In fact, the recent popularity of obscure but great bands like the black keys, kills, soledad brothers, fiery furnaces (to name a few) is proof people can like good music. The reason the strokes and other good bands became popular is because of the crap that reviewers like you give credit to, like good charlotte, yellow card, the used.  That's pop. And bad pop.  Some of us realized this and were forced to unearth underground bands WE liked. This is rock.  And for the sake of those few of us that still get it- stop reviewing music you have no appreciation for, you only hurt other listeners' chances of being turned on to good music.  'Till then, enjoy your Scott Stapp albums! <br /> <br />Read my follow up above
0803730470|5.0|I picked this up on a trip to the UK - our 2-year old loved it. Next trip I picked up The Gruffalo's Child which is equally good (read The Gruffalo first as The Gruffalo's Child is a sequel).
B0009UC810|5.0|its rare that hollywood makes a movie that lasts from generation to generation. the blues brothers originated from \\"saturday night live\\" and became motion picture history. the movie is filled to capacity with legendary singers such as ray charles, aretha franklin, and james brown (just to name a few)....the comedy antics of john belushi and the laid-back style of dan aykroyd make them a perfectly matched team. the DVD edition includes added scenes that never made it into the VHS edition. try and find chaka kahn (one hit wonder singer \\"i feel for you\\") and an eagle eyed observer can find pee-wee-herman in this flick ....yes boys and girls....pee-wee-herman is in this movie (paul reubens)
B0007GAERG|5.0|Welcome back, Mariah Carey!  \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" marks the metaphorical liberation of the singer - and it shows in the no-holds barred music on this CD.  Her voice, especially when collaborating with other stars, has a remarkably comfortable sound, as though she has finally realized what it means to not hold back.  \\"It's Like That\\" is a assertive hip hop opening that demonstrates from the start that \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" refuses to settle for the past.  \\"Shake it Off\\" has the sultry, seductive sound of soul, punctuated surprisingly effectively by the repeated \\"shake, shake, shake it off.\\"  Her \\"One and Only\\" with Twista is a cool combination of Mariah-pop and Twista-rap. \\"Get Your Number\\" (with Jermaine Dupri) has the thump and drive of club music.  Carey's gorgeous voice weaves in and out of the music at will, swelling to vocal heights when necessary and, at other times,  letting others such as Nellie and Kanye West take over.<br /><br />These songs have the rawness of real emotion coupled with artistic maturity.  Especially those who became disenchanted with Mariah Carey's last efforts will find her new musical confidence and style something to celebrate. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
0783225733|2.0|Apollo 13 has been so overpraised as a film even the evil Newt Gingrich would like it's hard to buck the trend, but here goes:  As  one of the Apollo moon mission junkies I saw this one on its release and was disappointed. Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, \\"Mommy, you're squishing me\\", and family scenes so schmaltzy they are practically unwatchable.<br /><br />  The film should be considered well done except for these family scenes which dumb it down so much.<br /><br />  To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience.  I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war.  I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, \\"Moonwalk One\\" that's shown sometimes on NASA TV.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's X&Y is the kind of CD you need to listen to more than once before passing judgment.  Tracks such as the lead-off \\"Square One\\" can seem monotonous at first because of the synthesized strains and the low, almost-whining sound of Chris Martin's first notes, but as the song gets going (and as listeners return), the song builds to real power.  The strongest songs are \\"White Shadows\\" with its great beat and vocals; \\"Talk,\\" with its smooth tones;  the haunting \\"Fix You,\\" the pop-leaning (though not sell-out) \\"Square One,\\" and the mournful \\"Twisted Logic.\\" \\"What If\\" sounds as though the band planned this as a gravy track, with heavy play on the radio, but real fans of Coldplay will tire of it long before the other tracks, simply because of its uncharacteristic sappiness.  In contrast, the tribute to Johnny Cash, \\"Kingdom Come,\\" evokes real emotion through its simplicity.  Martin's heartfelt voice carries even the weakest tracks and, while he might not have the vocals of a great singer, his musical instincts are impeccable.<br /><br />The melancholy tone of this album might disappoint those seeking a more boisterous sound, but for Coldplay and alternative rock fans, this album should make a wonderful addition to the music library. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
0385507755|1.0|I've read the book and now seen the allegations that James Frey's drug and alcohol memoir \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is filled with lies and half-truths, and am besides myself that this fraud has taken place. Whatever happened to the editorial standards at Random House that they could release a book and not check the validity of the material first? And how could Oprah Winfrey and her producers not check the same before she goes on national TV and extols the values of the accounts. What a sham...and a shame!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Prior to the release of her breakthrough album \\"Tapestry\\" in 1971, Carole King had already made a huge contribution to the pop/rock scene by writing for other stars such as Aretha Franklin (\\"Feel Like a Natural Woman\\");  Little Eva (\\"The Locomotion\\"), and The Shirelles (\\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\").  Other tunes such \\"You've Got a Friend\\" were popularized by other singers - in this case, James Taylor - so that her name was more of a footnote than one belonging to a widely recognized singer.  \\"Tapestry\\" changed all that.  Featuring her own songs that were popularized by other musicians as well as some new ones, King allowed her gutsy, honest style full reign.  The public responded by keeping the album on the charts for a full six years.<br /><br />For those who lived through the 70s, it is astonishing to find the number of chart-topping tracks on this CD.  Besides \\"You're Got a Friend,\\" \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" and \\"Feel Like a Natural Woman,\\" this CD contains \\"I Feel the Earth Move,\\" \\"So Far Away,\\"  \\"It's Too Late,\\" \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Smackwater Jack,\\" and, of course, \\"Tapestry.\\"  Surprisingly, these songs have endured decades, unlike much of the pop music of the era.  King's forthright expression of emotion transcends the 70s sound and context.<br /><br />Women of a certain age and the guys who loved them should find memories embedded in every track, as this album was the unofficial dorm must-have from the mid-70s to the early 80s.  Men looking for a romantic gift for women who grew up during that time (and have not replaced their vinyl records) could not make a better choice. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00004RF9B|4.0|I admit I had never heard of this movie before. I did recignise the robot from it's cameo appearences since (Well, Gremlins, anyway) <br /> <br />I usualy sit down and look at these old films and laugh at how bad they are, or how there ideas of the future are so laughable, or the really s####y SFX they had. But I actualy can not do that to this movie! I was actualy impressed at how they did some of the effects for this. Even tho I can tell they where drawn is as a cartoon, they are done exceptionly well for a 1956 film.  <br /> <br />The only thing I laughed at was Leslie Nielson looking so young! It was weird watchign him do strait acting, but after a while I got into it. I can see why it's a classic easily. I could even instantly see that Lost In Space ripped it off quite a bit.  <br /> <br />It wont suprise me to see this movie being re-made in the near future. It starts well, continues well, and ends well. All 3 elements of making a good film. With some respectable SFX thrown in for extra enjoyment. Campy, but enjoyable.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a response to a review that was posted on Jan-7-2006. <br />  <br />[Accually, my rating is 0; January 7, 2006: <br />This movie was so boring. I do have to agree with some of the other people who reviewed this movie, the beginning was good, but the rest was terrible. I watched the first hour and fifteen minutes, and then i shut it off because I was about to cry on how dumb this movie was. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because there are millions of better movies out there. My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made. LISTEN DIRECTORS: THIS MOVIE WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, AND IF FOR SOME LUDACRIS REASON U DID MAKE SEQUALS, THEY WOULD BE JUST AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THIS ONE!. I would much rather stick my finger through my eye, and swirl my brain around than have to sit through the first hour of this movie. SKIP THIS MOVIE, EXTREMELY BORING!] <br /> <br />My reply: Shut up. This was the single greatest movie of 2005, I would like to say of all time but I haven't seen enough movies to justify it and I'm still very loyal to High Noon. Go ahead with that finger swirl, maybe it'll uncover the part of your brain that affects your taste so that you'll be able to judge things better. If you don't have the capacity to appreciate quality work, that's your loss. I believe I speak for Browncoats everywhere when I say, to you and to other people with your opinions(I hope for the sake of all humanity that there are very few like you): Just keep your mouth shut for the next few years so that those of us who actually have good taste can put it to good use watching more and equally spectacular installments of the Fireflyverse that will hopefully be created and released soon. We can't all be slaves to the trash that keeps popping up and sweeping the true gems into the bin. Don't ruin it for the rest of us.  <br /> <br />That said, I want to caution anyone who read the review to which I am replying. Don't pay any attention to it, that person isnuts. This movie was awesome. I'm not going to go into too much detail because I could go on for hours and I don't think anyone would really want to read it, plus you shouldn't really believe every review you read because it's just some random person's opinion, but it was truly magnificent. I would recommend Serenity to anyone who enjoys action, science fiction, or any other kinds of movies that are out there. This movie was beautiful, the best I've seen in years; it was exciting, suspenseful, creative, inspiring, and there's a thousand other words that can be used to describe it but I'd never be able to write them all. My advice: watch this movie. Don't judge something based on the reviews of a few random pricks. How many movies have you seen that were wonderful but other people hated? How many have you seen that were praised but then you saw them and they sucked? Don't believe everything people tell you. See Serenity and decide for yourself whether you like it. People in this world need to learn how to think for themselves instead of listening to everyone else's opinions.

B0007PAMR4|2.0|If this is the same version that has been available in Australia for at least a two years and released about two or three times under different companies, you may, nay, WILL be disappointed. <br />It is quite obviously taken from a TV screening. It has a bodgy narration over the movie explaining the story line. It contains several paintings which would have served as possible production concepts. Being from a TV broadcast, it also has fade outs to what would have been commercials in the middle of key scenes. It was also cut of a lot of its violence. <br />If this is indeed the same version, then the only thing it has going for it is that it is in 2:35 and digital sound. Question is, is the 2:35 just a cropped 4:3 image. Was the DVD also endorsed by David Lynch himself. Judging by the information I have found on the net this would not seem to be the case. David's participation, according to DigitalBits My Two Cents dated 3/31/05 <br />[...] <br />it is not a done deal. I would have thought that it would have been a major selling point for universal had he been invloved. <br />CAVEAT EMPTOR

There is a deep hunger in all of us to have companions (Latin: people you eat bread with) in Life. The title strikes a chord in us all.  <br />  You were attracted to this book. You were right. Buy it and use it to build a more deeply satisfying life.
0140277447|5.0|Many people flinch at the mention of this book or hesitate to read it because they know it contains extremely gruesome pictures and many gory descriptions.  This is all true.  Iris Chang presents a factual depiction of what took place in Nanking, China.  She does not mince words or sugarcoat anything.  If you can not deal with frightening images of what one human being can do to another, then maybe you should not read this book.  After all, ignorance is bliss.  However, I am of the stance that books like this are important for documenting the very atrocities that make us question the goodness of humanity.      Forget for a moment that it is the Japanese oppressing the Chinese in this book and consider the question:  How can an army of men (mostly young men) commit such vile crimes of rape, torture, killing contests, medical experimentation and brutalization against other human beings?  The fact that these events took place are as shocking and bewildering to me as the existence of the Holocaust.  It is also proof that pure hatred and evil can overcome men during their delusions of superiority.        I was disappointed to read about the reticence and complacency of the Chinese residents of Nanking while the Japanese began to pillage and destroy their city.  This was not some rural village, this city was the capital of China!!  Aside from the plundering that is described, Chang also tells the inspiration story of the German Nazi John Rabe.  Rabe was a businessman who set up a Safety Zone at the risk of his own life and reputation.  He and a handful of other foreigners were ultimately responsible for saving thousands of Chinese lives.    People can argue all they want about the exact death toll, but even if the number of murders was actually smaller, does that make it any less of a crime?  Any massacre is unforgiveable, but the torture and dehumanization of the Chinese people at Nanking was absolutely abominable.      *As a side note, the author Iris Chang committed suicide in 2004.  There is speculation that she was depressed and haunted by the very stories and images that she wrote so adamantly about.      I guess you could add another victim to the tally...
0143034901|5.0|A great read, plain and simple. Took it all in in two days, just could not put it down. The writer is very talented and I was very disappointed that he did not venture out his talent beyond this book, in English. Highly recommended: you will laugh and you will cry but most of all you will savor every sentence until the very end.
0307276902|1.0|I guess that this book just proves that people will believe anything they read.The fact that he fooled Oprah and her mindless zombie fans is hysterical! I guess the guy better sell his 'summer' home and his New York condo because his writing career is going to go down the tubes after all of this.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|For the record, I'm a huge rock fan. My favorite bands are mostly hard rock, classic rock, and some metal too. Lyrics and emotion are of the most importance to me when I choose what to listen to, and I guess one could say that I am very selective when it comes to my tastes. People are often surprised to see how, among the Rage Against the Machine, Soundgarden and Mars Volta albums in my collection, there are several Shakira albums. The thing is- they really shouldn't be surprised. <br /> <br />As it's probably been established to most of the US by now, Shakira is something different. She came to us as a blonde, which made a lot of people emit nonsense like \\"She's just a bad Britney knockoff\\" based on her image. She is, however, a full-blown lyricist and vocalist who is absolutely insistant upon taking creative control over her work. She does what she wants to do, not what any producer or label wants her to do, and that alone makes her stand out. Her vocals and her personally-penned, very original lyrics are also very impressive, and whatever she releases to us is always refreshingly... well, different. She's pop, she's dance, but wait- no, she's rock. She's all of those. She's also multilingual. She certainly is talented. She really is somethin' else.   <br /> <br />From this album, the second volume of her Fijacion/Fixation set, I was not expecting a return to her days of \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\", but rather musical experimentation. Shakira seems to have been wanting to branch off into other directions with her last works, instead of repeating what she's well known for over and over. She's \\"almost to the third floor\\", as she's said, and she is no doubt an evolving being. Thus, this time she delivers just that-- plenty of experimentation. She's clearly playing around with styles and sounds, so this disc is quite varied, but still essentially the Shakira that we've grown to know and love. Her English lyrics are more refined than on \\"Laundry Service\\", and the musicis much more rich and fulfilling as well.  <br /> <br />With \\"How Do You Do\\", a song that seems to be a letter to God, Shakira lets us know right from the start that her songs are not anything run-of-the-mill by any means. Choir chanting in Hebrew and Arabic, the \\"Our Father\\" prayer, synth beats and rock guitars! This is definitely a highlight of the album-- a very beautiful song. It transitions well into track two, \\"Don't Bother\\"- another guitar-tinged song. It happens to be the first single from the disc. It could stand to rock a little harder, but it's alright. \\"Illegal\\" is very mellow and heartfelt, with guitar from Carlos Santana helping out. The melody needed something, but it worked in the end. \\"The Day and The Time\\" is the lesser of the two tracks translated from \\"Fijacion\\"- it goes on and on a little bit without much structure, but is still ultimately listenable. \\"Animal City\\" and \\"Hey You\\" are creative, upbeat tunes, while \\"Dreams for Plans\\" and \\"Your Embrace\\" are creative downbeat tunes. \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" is another highlight of the disc- it's a good solid rock song with gusto and feeling. \\"Something\\" is another of my favorites- very somber and beautiful. It translated well from its equally beautiful Spanish counterpart, which is a relief. \\"Timor\\" is quite a note on which to end things. You wouldn't expect that if you listen closely, you'll hear that she is taking a stab at America, Democracy and that which is corrupt about society -- in such a peppy disco song. (Leave it to Shakira to put out a track like this- wow.) It takes a spin or two, but it really grew on me. As with the entirety of the collection, I suppose.    <br /> <br />I felt just a little let down with it. While she's trying out new things, she's not quite on target. Give her all the credit in the world for being so ambitious with territory unfamiliar to most, certainly, but something's slightly off-kilter. Personally, I wanted it to rock a little harder-- several tracks could havepacked a harder punch. There could also stand to be a couple more songs on this, as with its Spanish-language predecessor. It is not a perfect record. Shakira still has so much potential. She has the ability to do much better than this- however, it's still a very, very good album. I recommend this to those who want a break from whatever else we've been hearing and also to her fans-- although not as highly as the first volume-- and eagerly await whatever else we may see from Shakira in the future. <br /> <br />
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom strays far from the ordinary in his spiritual novel Tuesdays With Morrie, reencountering true events. In the story, Mitch (the narrator) tells of interactions with his great friend and ex-college professor Morrie. The only twist is that Morrie has been diagnosed with an uncommon neurological disorder and deemed no more than two more years to live. While Mitch and Morrie were very close in earlier years, meeting on Tuesdays to discuss many scholastic issues as well as life, they had lost touch throughout the years. Mitch's graduation day promise to his old friend to keep in touch had been unsuccessful; after seeing his old professor on Nightline Mitch leaves his unsatisfying journalism role in Detroit to have a meeting with Morrie. This meeting turns into the rebirth of Tuesdays with Morrie, just like college days. Throughout the novel are many heartwarming and insightful conversations held between the young lost soul and the sure dying old man. Morrie shares his insight, and philosophies to the youngster, successfully changing Mitch's life even while nearing the end of his own. This showing of unselfishness, intellect, and courage gains Morrie the name as one of the most influential characters ever. While his ideas are projected towards Mitch, the reader receives wise words as well. From Tuesdays With Morrie, well thought-out philosophies of life, death, and many other important reflective topics are discussed thoroughly. The novel acts as a life guide, sending a stern message, while adding fun through various flashbacks. After reading Tuesdays With Morrie, you will be left with a message, as Mitch does. The 5-star rating shows my positive feelings towards it, as well as the insight I have gained through it's wisdom. -Sean Bradley, PA
B000AU9UYW|5.0|This is a brilliant recovery from the lousy parts 3 and 4 from the previous film series. Christian Bale was perfectly cast as Batman and it was a real relief not to see those silly characters Robin or Batgirl anymore. I am already looking forward to the next Batman movie. This one is fun to watch! (SARR) <br />
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is like a seedless watermellon.It's really good.What more can you say about The Strokes, except that they are the best band out there.With Julians smooth vocals, fabs expert drumming,Nick and Alberts guitar solos and Nikolai on bass supporting the songs from behind,\\"Is This It\\" is the best CD evre made.If you don't have it, make sure to pick it up. <br />
B000002KET|4.0|Black Sabbath's 5th record titled Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is much lighter in comparison to Paranoid and Master of Reality.  They began to really experiment with this album.  They started using keyboards and had a few pop songs.  Despite the dark and demonic cover, this album is actually pretty friendly.  The opening title track is the heaviest song on the album, but that song alone is worth the purchase of this album and it probably my favorite Sabbath song.  However, don't buy this album expecting the rest of the songs to go along the same lines as that one.  Other than this killer opener, we have things like a strange acoustic and keyboard instrumental called Fluff, bizarre outer space keyboards in Who Are You? and weird pop-like songs like Looking For Today and A Nation Acrobat (the last of which features an awesome solo).  And let's not forget the second best song on the album Killing Yourself to Live, a song that is obviously about drugs.  These songs are good, but had there been more songs like Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath this album would have been an easy 5 stars.  After hearing that song, the rest of the album seems to fall flat unless you skip that song and save it for the end.  Not the greatest Sabbath album but still classic.  Hoped this helped.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I think to classify Firefly/Serenity as sci-fi does a great dis-service to this creation.  Not that I don't enjoy or respect sci-fi because I do.  However this series/movie presents timeless themes and characters in an interesting, dynamic, engaging and thought provoking way. They could just as easily be cruising around in a beat up old wagon train pulled by ornery horses and one bad ass donkey or for that matter in a rusted out old Winnebago with sticky valves and the story and values would play EXACTLY the same.  These characters are so well written, acted and directed that we feel an almost instant bond with them.  One of the best and most even ensemble pieces ever.  SOMEBODY should take note and bring this back. Thankyou and Good Night.
B00009V7T2|5.0|there is absolutely nothing i can say to describe this band or this album. without a doubt this is the best album i own. \\"desert island\\" for sure. frances the mute is close behind, but definately didn't hit me the way that de-loused did the first time i heard it. the drumming on this is out of this world. cedric's voice is beautiful, in fact it was this album that made me decide that he's probally the second best rock singer i've ever heard (freddy mercury is #1 and mike patton is a very very close third, but that crap he's been doing lately is just starting to get annoying). omar's tone and playing is just GORGEOUS!! without a doubt the best band around right now and definately in my top 5 fav's of all time. <br /> <br />if you've never seen them live you're really only hurting yourself. i've seen them twice and on the tour for de-loused they blew me away. best live show i've ever seen in my life. imagine saul williams doing his thing and then the volta playing de-loused in it's intirity. absolutely mind bending!!

0393327655|1.0|The book is written with such anger, vehemence and emotion. It seems to me to be almost, but not quite, a hate piece against anyone of faith. All religions are slammed, and although I find myself in agreement with him about moral relativism (and for that matter pacifism, which Harris also finds immoral) he then turns around and commits the same immorality, while paying a small lip service that not all religions are equal. <br /> <br />Harris then blames Christianity as a whole without distinction although Protestantism and Catholicism have very different views about human nature and thus world views. There is also a complete misunderstanding or no understanding about what Christians believe about grace. Further there is no understanding about man's role in interpreting the Bible which is distinctly different than man's role in interpreting the Qu'ran, for example. Worse yet, blaming Christians for the Holocaust is patently absurd, and quoting people like Goldhagen, who along with Cornwell have already been debunked in such other books as The Myth of Hitler's Pope, is a mark of very poor scholarship.  <br /> <br />The book winds up suggesting a philosophy of happiness and misery that seems to me could very well wind up as a sort of hedonism, and then delves into Eastern mysticism/spirituality as a sort of \\"rational\\" faith substitute.  <br /> <br />Of course, Western contemplatives such as St. Theresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross WERE contemplatives/mystics in every sense of the word, but they get no mention. To write as Harris does that one can live eons as a Christian without encountering teachings on this is riciculous, as they already exist and have for centuries. Further, Harris confuses meditation (meditatio) with contemplation (contemplatio), something which anyone who professes to know even the slightest bit about Christianity should have grasped.  <br /> <br />Sam Harris is clearly not a theologian or a historian. He is a lightweight and is clearly outof his depth.

I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE STORY'S FINAL QUARTER ENDED UP BEING A \\"CHICK-FLICK-BOOK\\" I WAS INTRIGUED AT LOOKING AT MARIAS WORLD THROUGH HER SOMBER EYES.

B00005JMCW|5.0|I Love Lindsay Lohan and this is by far one of her best movies, a fantastic film for the entire family. Keep it up Lindsay.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is one of the most wonderful movies ever made and this DVD is wonderful. I bought my DVD straight from Amazon.com and it has been everything I wanted. It has great features and the wonderful film itself in as great a quality as ever. My only suggestion is that you should buy a little plastic DVD case you can get from any store to put your movie in. This DVD comes in a cardboard front-covered DVD case (you know the kind) and this movie is too good for that. Treat it well and enjoy it time and again. \\"Goonies Never Say Die!\\"
1400032717|5.0|This is a mystery written from the point of view of a teenaged autistic Sherlock Holmes.  The first person perspective forces the reader to see things from the narrator's perspectives, which sets up interesting scenarios where the information the reader gets from the narrator sometimes allows the reader to see how Christopher's perspective and conclusions are very different from a nonautistic person's and sometimes forces the reader to see the illogic in everyday life. The sections on why Christopher doesn't like things of a certain color and his musings on Stephen Hawkings/science/creationism are hilarious, as are some of his observations on life.<br /><br />I found this book sweetly ironic and compelling. I also liked the fact that this book was definitely NOT SAPPY and the narrators POV was something that was handled naturally and did not seem gimmicky. This book gets five red cars (read the book and you will understand)!
0393035158|1.0|This is a weak and naive apologia for atheism as a cure for war and other social ills, which Harris accuses Christianity, Islam, and other religions of inflicting on humanity. While condemning theists for supposedly attempting to impose their beliefs on society, thereby fomenting conflict, he attempts to impose his own ideas on society with sledgehammer rhetoric. Catholics, Protestants, Muslims-they are all ignorant, troublemaking malcontents. To explain why the 20th Century's most bellicose societies-Nazi Germany, for example-rejected God but failed to prosper, he maintains that they were imitating the tactics used by religions. Yeah, right, Hitler and Stalin prayed the rosary and took in lepers. The heat of provocative rhetoric does not a good book make; only cool, dispassionate reason leads to truth.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!  If you are going to make a come back, this is the way to do it!  This CD is worth your money...BUY IT!
B000AADYYO|5.0|this is the best album that i bought in 2005...it was simply amazing....the 10 minute songs can feel like forever but they are well worth listening to....i would suggest this cd to everyone who listens to metal....it is simply amazing
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I saw this at Pantages Theater in Toronto when I was a Senior in high School. It was wonderful. I want  to see and buy this dvd.
B0002UOK04|4.0|Wow. What a record. I had heard of this band on the internet somewhere, and I saw the album in Tower Records soon after, so I decided to pick it up. To say this album is \\"overlooked\\" is merely an understatement. From what I have seen, it has been almost completely ignored. Such a shame that is, because this is an incredible showcase of not only fantastic musicianship, but fantastic songwriting as well. Jari is extremely talented - he played every instrument on this recording, save for the drums (which are flawless by the way). The riffs are air tight and the solos fly and flow with crystal clear quality. The keyboards don't take a standout role so much here, but they certainly add depth and color to the sound. The main vocals are sharp and harsh, while the singing is of true Viking metal tradition, full of epicness and glory. Everything is mixed near-perfectly. The only drawback with this album is that many of the songs are in the same key, and while that isn't always a bad thing, it causes certain songs to somewhat bleed together here. In addition, as good as it is, it definitely sounds very much like a lot of other Finnish bands. Because of this, it is easy to see how Wintersun could be written off as a Bodom or Norther knock-off. However, while Children of Bodom are starting to compromise their own musical abilities, Wintersun pushes them to the fullest extent possible. I would hope that they continue raising the bar for themselves for their next album, (which hopefully will include a full band by then) so they can come tour America!  <br />Highlights of this album include \\"Beyond the Dark Sun\\", \\"Battle Against Time\\", and \\"Death and the Healing\\".
B00006JL1Z|5.0|what an amazing double disc cd collection from this super group.one of my favorite bands,one of my parents favorite bands.every song shines like a diamond on this great cd.a definite must have.this cd deserves 10 stars easily.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Great movie. Great cast. Great acting. Horrible ending. Cruise in his most powerful role. Phillip Seymore Hoffman shines.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Death Cab For Cutie (certainly one of the best bandnames) first came into my view with the excellent 'Transantlanticism' and now there is this great album called Plans, this time on major label Atlantic <br /> <br />From the get go the lightness of the music, mostly because of the singer's voice, strikes you. But it's a lightness that is mysterious. There is progression in the songs, some (like the opening song) build up in a way similar bands like Interpol and the Arcade Fire. These bands sound somewhat the same, but DCFC does not have the wildness. And sometimes that works against them. What makes the Arcade Fire fascinating is what is lacking here, maybe the production is indeed a little too slick. <br /> <br />Besides these early 2000 bands there is also a taste of 80's pop. Sometimes I was reminded of World Party and Tears for Fears. DCFC has once recorded a Smiths cover and that's not without reason. Big Star is also mentioned often as an influence and that can be heard. Big Star's \\"Holocaust\\" wouldnt have been an odd track on this album.  <br /> <br />They have to be careful though. If they want to keep their indie/underground status they have to stop recording songs like \\"Different Names For The Same Things\\", I had too many thought of James Blunt and Howie Day and those awful MOR bands and artists. Luckily after 2:30 the song gets interesting. <br /> <br />What is still good about them is the addition of some techno stuff, much like the Postal Service, which is of course Ben Gibbards other band. <br /> <br />It's as I said a light album, maybe a little too slow sometimes, a little too singer/songwritery. Gibbard is no Alex Chilton yet but he might get there. But he and the rest of DCFC have to be careful not to wander too much into the middle of the musical road. His voice in some of the songs is just that way. I think that if E from eels had recorded a song like \\"I Follow You Into The Dark\\" it would have sounded better.
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\", written by John Steinbeck is an intriguing book which leads readers through a vast variety of emotions.  The story includes two main characters, George and Lennie.  George is a very small man with defined features whereas Lenny is the exact opposite.  He is huge, almost colossal in fact and is mentally retarded.  Because of this, George has to care for Lennie and put forth a lot of extra effort.  However, he does not mind doing so because Lennie provides the kind of friendly companionship he desires.  The differences between the two characters only serve to bond them closer together.  Despite this, they also have one prominent commonality: they both share the dream of eventually acquiring a piece of land to farm and raising rabbits on it, the rabbits being mainly Lennie's idea.  Lennie has an obsession with petting soft things which ends up just causing trouble for the two. For example, they were kicked out of their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman's dress and was accused of rape. <br /> <br />The book is based at a ranch in California were the two managed to get a job while lying that they were cousins.  While there, they slowly plot to achieve their goal of starting their own farm and join a fellow worker who they plan to achieve this with.  What happens at the end WILL shock you but is a very satisfying conclusion to the story. <br /> <br />Overall, it was an awesome book.  Although these kind of stories are not usually my style, I found myself deeply  caught up in every page.  I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a good book and an easy read.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I'm not an American and I've just been in America for a year as an exchange student. I went to see RENT just because I heard the \\"FINALE B\\" song on TV. I had no idea what the story was about, I didn't even know the cast, especially Rosario Dawson who has become one of my favourite actresses right now! I didn't even know that RENT was a musical movie( see how blind I was?!) I figured it out when MARK was riding his bike and singing \\"RENT\\", all I felt was I was gonna love this movie so much!! I've always loved (international)music, especially with the American-Point-Of-View lyrics. I feel that the music of RENT is the best I've ever heard in my life!(no kidding!) The lyrics are so beautiful, though it's sometimes hard for me to understand(well, I'm working on my English skills!) I went to see the movie twice and I'm looking forward to see the broadway show too, soon.  I've got the CD and I'm going to get the DVD for sure. When I go back to my country, I can share this movie to my family and friends! And this movie is going to remind me of the great times in America, especially in New York City....This is the good movie with the great music indeed!!!
0385507755|1.0|I read this book about 6 months ago and could not believe that it was chosen by Oprah and raved about by so many people.  The writing style is an foolish attempt to create a unique style, but instead is just Annoying.  The story is so unrealistic you don't need The Smoking Gun to prove that to you.  The story regarding the dentist is just absurd and so unbelievable you just have to talk to any dentist to realize that they would be medicated.  The last straw for me was the Lilly scene at the end *puke*, talk about melodramatic.  While Oprah does pick a quality book now and then , this is a joke.  His arrogance is also dangerous for those that are seriously trying to overcome addiction.  Maybe in a few years he'll write a book about how he overcame his compulsive lying disorder, at least that could really be fiction... <br />
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I have no idea if this movie is any good. I watched the whole thing and all I can tell you is that Jessica Alba is in a bikini a good part of the time and swimming. If they would have made a movie with 99% of it her swimming under water in that bikini, which the bottoms seemed about 2 sizes too small) I would rave about it too.<br /><br />Alba... bikini... wet... swim...
B000001OAA|5.0|Never an album did precisely what this one did to me. It has a sad and depressing mood that never sounded so well. Shirley Manson is a genius; her lyrics are simply mesmerizing. And what about the three boys, they literally hit you with a raw, threatening and unpolished guitars riff! The mix of both gives you a brainwash. For those of you who like a grunge feeling which interfere with alternative rock at his best, you'll be at heaven with Garbage. <br /> <br />The whole thing begins with \\"Supervixen\\" Great opener, not the best but still a great choice. You'll be very well introducing to the lyrics of Manson: \\"I'll be you're religion, this thing you'll never doubt\\"... Right after this \\"Queer\\" comes - WOW, this is what I meant when I said something haunting... Her voice; incredible, a tremendous depth and the lyrics are ghastly, one of the best song they ever produced... Others highlight include \\"Only happy when it rains\\", \\"Vow\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\" and \\"Dog New Tricks\\". There are tracks that seem to be hidden jewel like \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\", this track is rarely cited and I think it's one of the best songs. The album has its weak points \\"Fix me now\\" just did not gives me the effect that others tracks did but it's still superior from many things who could heard. <br /> <br />But my favorites has to be those two; \\"A stroke of luck\\" and especially \\"Milk\\", it's the last songs (generally the best track on a Garbage's album) is a ballad which is far more cruel, sad and ironic than is name represent. <br /> <br />Hands down the best from Garbage resides in this album. I mean you could easily do a \\"Greatest Hits\\" only with the twelve tracks; the music, the lyrics, the style and atmosphere are simply the best. I can't ask for more when I got this ground breaking masterpiece
B00004SA8A|5.0|There are a number of classical pianists who perform Schubert's piano sonatas extremely well (Brendel, Uchida, Schiff, and Richter come immediately to mind), all of whom bring their own individual brilliance to this music.  Given that it is probably impossible to render the \\"best\\" performance of each of these pieces, the question arises as to why anyone would want to invest in one musician's complete recordings of these sonatas. <br /> <br />My analysis of this question takes into account several factors.  The first of these is economic.  The Kempff set is budget price and a significant savings over the acquisition of the sonatas by other artists.  Even if economics are not a factor, it may be valuable to compare Kempff's way with these pieces with other pianists and this set will allow the collector to at least have one complete set for comparison purposes. <br /> <br />The basis for investing in these recordings is, however, far from solely economic.  There seem to be two components a successful Schubertian must bring to the sonatas: an ability to properly convey the various dynamic markings found in each piece and the ability to understand and convey the complete architecture of each piece, instead of being caught up in the various eddies that so many of the movements contain with them.  Kempff is able to satisfy both of these components brilliantly.  These albums contain what may be the most beautiful pianissimo I have ever heard. Kempff also seems to have a sure conception of each complete work and does not lose the listener in various musical cul de sacs. <br /> <br />In short, performances this beautiful are bargains at any cost.
B00008IHN1|5.0|To the person who was droning on about how predictable and unrealistic the movie is: obviously, you've never had any fun. I understand that you have experience with music, and what do you know, so do I. This is a fictional movie. Not an instruction video. You sound like the kind of person that wouldn't like Spider man because nobody can really shoot a web out of their hand or wouldn't like any kind of fictional movie. LIGTEN UP.  <br /> <br />With that out of the way. This movie can be typical in some parts, yes he is a troubled person who nobody understands blah blah blah as is cliched in so many other movies, however, those kind of movie are fun to watch.  <br /> <br />The drumming was amazing. Absolutely amazing. Wonderful performance by Nick Cannon.
B000687M48|3.0|I don't own this thing but i've seen it. As much as I personally enjoy this band, this overly produced, hour long MTV video, gave me vertigo so bad I felt like puking. Fortunately, I had the music and the vision of Amy Lee to keep the chunks at bay and swallowed back. Now my question is does the band know about this and know it sucks really bad..or was it even THEIR IDEA!??!

B0002F1CO6|5.0|On the recommendation of a fellow metal-lover, i picked this up, and i am speechless. <br />The first disc is the progressive rock side, and its flowing, spacey tunes coupled with the equally cosmic theme gives off the distinctive air of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. While i love Pink Floyd and was amazed by disc one, i was itching to get to disc 2, which, in all honesty, was a tad weaker. <br />Despite this, disc 2 was still captivating, starting off strong, continuting a general metal feel in the middle, though nothing my jaded ears hadn't herd before. But If one is truly absorbed by the music at this point, the 50 seconds before the booming finale are legitimately terrifying. I don't wish to spoil it, but suffice to say that little in the world is scarier than a digitized voice breaking one's calm, announcing one's quickly oncoming demise. <br />Overall, this album is a powerful, moving experience.
B00003CWPL|1.0|this is probably the worst movie ever made...if you are at a poker game and you don't know who the sucker is, it's you.  this is how you feel after walking out of this movie (or viewing it in the comfort of your home.)  save your time and money, or better yet go for a nice walk in the country.
B000002UJQ|5.0|For those who not fortunate enough to experience this album when it came out, i weep for you. This is easily the best album made it the 90's. It's an opus. The album starts somewhat meakly with airbag, but then moves on to Paranoid Android, the second best track on the album. Radiohead really shows it's ambition on paranoid android, it starts conventionally enough but once it gets to the second act of the song its clear that its a classic. Coming in with the bronze medal is karma police, a song that is astonishingly beautiful. Last and in my opinion the best radiohead song, is Let Down. Let Down builds and builds and when they finally give you what you hope for it feels like a relevation. Please Buy this album it is absolutely incredible.
B00005RHGL|4.0|Dodge City 's recent clean up is the last solved conflict by Earp brothers, but as you know the marauding never rests, and sooner than you imagine on, they will have to put their guns back on.<br /><br />The admirable action sequences, the formidable edition and the presence of Val Kilmer playing his best performance 's lifetime until this date as Doc Holiday, will make of this film the last superior Western made until now. Cosmatos made undoubtedly his masterpiece, although the occupied place by My Darling Clementine still remains unmatchable.

B00005A46T|1.0|this cd is absolute crap... if you want to hear slipknot, buy the self-titled because it is the basis for iowa. iowa... what to say? it's a knock-off of the self-titled. the lyrics, don't get me started. the self-titled had some of the most kick ass lyrics i've ever heard (at least until I got into Tool and Deftones and Radiohead and some of those other godsend acts). iowa's lyrics are a bunch of big words crammed into bad context and screamed with a burnt out throat. corey needs to break all his pens, put down the dictionary (i never thought, until this particular case, that a singer should leave the dictionary alone), and just stop. it's not spooky or shocking anymore cuz it sounds like a dumb person with too large a vocabulary for his own good. screw this cd, screw it right in it's stinking hole. the self-titled is where it's at for slipknot. nuff said.
0790729350|2.0|I will add more to this later as I force myself to watch it <br /> <br />A shame they use a double sided disk for all the music and not use 2 disks, put both in the player and enjoy, no I am not lazy. <br /> <br />how in the world can a mistake be made on what song is being played as listed on the box and in the online description? <br /> <br />Canned Heat   <br />now that sure is not  \\"going up the country\\" !! <br />the name of that song is \\"A change is going to come\\" <br /> <br />Quality is not too good, I have a friend who was there and I think his description (even today) is of better quality.

0307276902|1.0|I began reading this book with an open mind.  I really wanted to like it, but the further I got into the story the more annoyed I became.  I kept waiting for it to get better and for the plot to develop, but was disappointed on both accounts.  All of the characters are too extreme and stereotypical.  Because the stories are so unbelievable the author has no credibility.  Even though I tried, I did not care for James and can't imagine how others could relate to him.  He seems like a self-centered spoiled kid.  I definitely do not recommend this book; reading it was a waste of time.

B000BVD460|5.0|Rumors seem to spread quickly around Eminem's Curtain call: The Hits (Apparently his last CD, Or rumors says. ) It is said, that this is his last CD. Which some claim is an honorable way of retiring by releasing the best of his music. But others seem to be against the idea that it is the end. <br />   So as the message boards are flooded, with propaganda.  Forums littered with hate mail, or other hateful things about the end of Eminem'. The young rapper, age 33, hasn't declared he is finished, he has been known to leave for extended amounts of time, and re-appear randomly through out his long career.  <br />   So I would like to clear up this rumor. No there is no official release that Eminem has ended his career despite the random reviews, or boards crowding up the internet <br />    All is known currently, is the new CD has been receiving both false and positive reviews. The CD contains literally the best of his music. Some of which he was nominated for 3 Grammy awards, for best rap solo performance\\" Mocking bird. Best rap performance \\"encore\\" with Dr.dre & 50 cent, and the best rap album (encore).  <br />    But there is two new added tracks, \\"Fack,\\" \\"Shake That\\"(featuring Nate dogg) and \\"when I'm gone\\".  <br />    Reaching both top ten, with \\"when I'm gone\\" all over the world. Such as Canada and UK. Top 25 with \\"Shake that\\" <br /> Even though it is unknown whether this is Eminem's final album but enough said this CD was another success, in Eminem's record breaking carrier. As over 441,000 copies are sold the first week of release in the US. Highly recommended through out most internet sites, or CD Sites.  <br />   Highly recommended to any of Eminem's fans, so for an easy 14 (Average) Dollars, you can receive the best of Eminem and two new added tracks. Given A 5 out of 5. <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is certainly on my top 10 movies of the year, and it's soundtrack is a must-have for me. I was so taken by the original scores by Gustavo Santaolalla. I mean it's his music that made the love scenes between Jack and Ennis more emoitionally powerful. This soundtrack also feature ten various Country Western singers including my favorite Steve Earle whom I loved so much since I heard him sang Pilgrim in You Can Count On Me, but his song The Devil's Right Hand here is not as catchy or touching as Willie Nelson's He Was A Friend of Mine. I also enjoyed listening to Mary McBride's No One's Gonna Love You Like Me. So if you loved the film, and can't wait to get a copy of the DVD later this year, then this soundtrack will satisfy you in terms of getting the flashbacks of the film going.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|Honestly, I liked Buffy and Angel and was disappointed with Firefly when it aired, giving up after two episodes.  It wasn't until much later, when a co-worker was on a high about this movie, that I was told about the stupidity of Fox waiting to air the pilot for the series 'til the last few episodes.  Ah... now I understand why I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a war with all these people who made no sense.  So, having been given the DVD Series by my Browncoat friend for Xmas, I watched it in the order that it was meant to be seen and became a believer.<br /><br />The reason why I don't give this a 5 star rating is purely visceral.  Perhaps it's because I got to know the characters and story in less than a week, then ordered this DVD to find out about all the hanging issues and questions.  Not to give spoilers, let's just say that I hate it when Whedon does what he does - makes you love believable characters, then has believable things happen to them that you don't like.  I'm in mourning for a group of characters I fell in love with, then had the proverbial air kicked out of me in regards to one of my favorite married couple dynamics ever, and the great mystery behind a man that will never be known now.  I was not prepared to have these things happen to people who I'd only met in a marathon session a week earlier.<br /><br />I can't say how this movie will play to those who haven't watched the TV series.  The action, choreography, acting, writing, humor, horror, and so on were all there.  Whedon's slick translation of the idea of who each character is and the universe in general without making those who saw the series feel like, \\"Yeah, yeah, already know that, get to the good part,\\" was handled well.  Still, somebody not having seen the series probably won't feel the true depths of the pain and turmoil of the characters.  Had I not seen the series, I doubt I would have ended up as upset as I was.  What's more, those who are inspired to buy or rent the DVD series after having seen Serenity will likely have the ultimate fate of some characters hanging heavy over their heads, which would likely take away from enjoying the myriad character dynamics.  Catch-22, what can you do?DVD series after having seen Serenity will likely have the ultimate fate of some characters hanging heavy over their heads, which would likely take away from enjoying the myriad character dynamics.

B00002Z88D|4.0|I do wish they had more of their old stuff but this live 2 disc isn't that bad. Master of Puppets,One, and The thing that should not be are probably the best one on here. No leaf clover is a pretty good track from Metallica. But I prefer minus human instead it's more heavier.They have more stuff from the load and reload albums. I have nothing against those albums but come on I prefer Fade to Black than devils dance. That's probably the only song on here I don't care for on here. I heard when they tried out Fade to black that it didn't sound right with an orchestra,so they left it out. Oh well. If your a big fan of all Metallicas work than I get this one, but if you only like stuff before the black album than I'd skip it. But overall I kinda like it. Metal with a symphony hey that's not too bad. Only Metallica can do something like this.
0307276902|1.0|Thank god I didn't actually pay for this book! I read a few pages of a friend's copy and I found myself laughing out loud several times during the first passage. Think about it: how many airlines would allow a passenger on to their flight reeking of puke and urine, drunk to the point of being comatose, missing their front teeth, with a hole in their cheek and blood flowing down their chin on to their chest? Anybody that could get passed this and believe any of this tripe would probably believe anything. Please, do yourself a favor before paying for this mediocre work of fiction, and go to Smoking Gun website to read more about Frey's lies.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I want to respond to a few of the comments by other reviewers.  First, let me say that Brokeback Mountain is a powerful movie and a work of art.  I am a gay man and have seen hundreds of gay movies, including \\"gay cowboy\\" movies.  None have moved me as much as this movie.  All the actors, the writing, directing, etc. are phenominal.  Heath Ledger is remarkable.  How a twenty-six year old straight male can have such understanding, compassion and depth of emotion is almost incomprehensible to me. <br /> <br />Now to my remarks.  One writer wishes Ennis had spoken more and was unmoved by the shirt scene towards the end.  This scene just blows me away and brings me to tears even after seeing it 5 times.  Ennis doesn't speak much because that is the way Annie Proulx wrote the character.  Ang Lee and the screenwriters are being true to the story.   <br /> <br />Second, several writers commented that they did not see the reason for the relationship between Jack and Ennis.  This actually is perhaps too subtley revealed in a brief flashback Jack has near the end of the movie when Ennis, as a young man, walks up to him from behind and holds him very tenderly.  To those who have not seen the movie this scene is depicted in a lot of posters and such you may have seen.  This scene is a reference to a few lines in the original story.  Both men came from very emotionally impoverished lives.  We know that Jack was never really loved or emotionally supported by his father. The view of his childroom bedroom reveals a total bareness of emotion, love or beauty in his upbringing.  In the short story it is stated that the memory of this one embrace and all the feeling that came with it, the emotions it freed, twenty years earlier, and not sex, is what kept Jack coming back to Ennis for twenty years of \\"infrequent high altitude f...ks\\".  I can understand this completely.  Jack, in that embrace, experiences all the emotional closeness and warmth he never had from any man growing up.  It must be a tremendous release to a man, born gay, but having no understanding of warmth between men.  Jack returns again and again to Ennis because of the power of this early embrace.  Would they make it as a couple if they actually lived together twenty years?  Who knows?  Who cares?  See the movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am new to this whole phenomenon as of this last month when I got the movie through net flix. after watching the film with no back ground about the series or the characters,  I have to say I loved the movie.  I proceeded to pick up the series on DVD and thought it was on the level of the movie...  this is a great story altogether.  If you haven't given firefly/serinity a chance now is the time to get on board.  allthough I would suggest watching the 12 episodes from fire fly 1st.  Good luck,  I know you will enjoy this!!!

0307276902|1.0|I was a patient at Hazeldon in 1996.  No way half the stuff Frey describes happened.  No way.  Anyone who has been a patient there could tell you that, anyone who has been in any rehab clinic could tell you that.   <br /> <br />I feel duped into buying the book, but I do feel vindicated now that Frey has been discovered as a fraud.  See, most of us addicts are mostly addicted with one thing - ourselves.  Just as Frey makes himself out to be some big tough guy to make himself feel big, I can feel big about myself for smelling his BS a page into his book. <br /> <br />The difference is I didn't con people out of their money to feed my narcissm.  Frey did.  He owes an apology to everyone who spent time and money on his book.  I would expect a memoir about time in treatment to take some license with actual events - no way you can remember every day, every conversation, etc.  But to completely sell yourself as something you're not is not being a good writer, it's being a good con-man.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Well, I'd never seen any telling of this story previously until this one and I have to say...  I guess what I have to say is the story itself isn't nearly as interesting as I'd hoped because of the necessary belief on the audience's part that Kong must have deep feelings.  But that's about the Kong story in general, as opposed to the film itself. <br /> <br />Regarding the film, the first thing that struck me was how good the special effects were, since Kong seemed so real.  (Ahh... cgi, you've done it again.)  The grandeur of the scenes, from NY to Skull Island and back again, were just amazing.  Additionally, this let Peter Jackson (director) include many quasi-chase scenes which I feel were shot very well, although when it comes to plot value I have to say the scenes probably could've been shortened a lot, quite a lot. <br /> <br />Still though, I guess overall, the combined special effects with basic story still ranked together as an average, decently entertaining film.  I do not fault Jackson as story goes, and anyway at least I did not start snoring half-way through like one guy in the theatre did.  Then again, I wasn't whisked away with the film either, but who would want to go to Skull Island?
B000AGTPUA|5.0|As a child, it was family tradition in my home that my mother would read The Polar Express to my sister and I while we drank hot chocolate.  The sweetness of the timeless story and the fantastic pictures captivated us year after year.  So, clearly the short story by Chris Van Allsburg holds a very special place in my heart.  Naturally, I was very excited when I heard they were going to produce a fully computer-animated movie based on this classic.<br /><br />We open the film with a young boy who is having trouble falling asleep on Christmas Eve.  As he gets out of his bed and rummages through various magazine ads with various depictions of Santa Claus, we quickly see that he is skeptical about the idea of Santa's existence.  Shortly after he goes back to bed and falls asleep, he awakens to a thundering sound and he sees a large train stopped in front of his home.  He is rightfully bewildered since there aren't any train tracks in front of his home.....<br /><br />He goes outside and is met by a conductor who invites him to get on the train, which is headed for the North Pole.  After turning down the offer, he struggles with himself and finally decides to get on the train as it is moving away from the house.  The rest of the story is filled with lots of suspense and action (as most of the film is set on the train), friendship, hope, and faith.  Will the boy regain his faith in the spirit of Christmas?  I will allow you to discover this answer for yourself and I'm sure that you won't be dissappointed if you do.<br /><br />In seeing the movie, I was truly amazed with the careful job they did in translating the story to the silver screen.  Being such a short story, they had to add so much to make it into a full length movie.  Much of what they added were suspenseful action scenes - which are very welcome and not too intense for younger viewers.  There is also a lot of added humor and relationship established between several of the children on the train.  The interaction between the children is truly where the heart of the movie is and it truly shines a light into the viewer's heart.<br /><br />The visuals in this film are breathtaking!  The computer generated snow-capped mountains, icy lakes, birds, wolves, and caribou are truly a joy to look at.  Also, the author's inventive vision of the North Pole is beautifully realized and is truly amazing to witness.  The score is equally fantastic, subtly complimenting the visuals and adding greatly to each scene.  One theme in particular is present throughout that is particularly beautiful and effective.<br /><br />Altogther, this adaptation is very well done.  Every picture from the book is used in the film (as there were only a dozen or so) and they gave me a sense of nostalgia.  Most importantly, the gentle, mysterious spirit of Christmas and the power of faith - both so evident the book - are captured perfectly here.  The result is a truly fine film for all ages that will surely become a Christmas classic for many generations to come.is truly where the heart of the movie is and it truly shines a light into the viewer's heart.

0800141660|5.0|This stands in my mind the most well-done movie adaptation of certainly any Jane Austen novel, but also any book I have personally ever seen.  In a time where all entertainment has to be filtered through our modern lenses, and stories tampered with and mistreated because of a directors political views, it is amazing to have a movie which so transperantly reveals the intentions of the author.  And yet it is in no way made prudish for staying so close to the book, probably because the book isn't prudish either, only to some modern readers it appears so next to our rather lax forms of novel-writing.  Jane Austen was wonderful at being honest, straight-forward, and sensible in all of her books, not gushing all over the page like a jelly donut.  The story is shown equal respect in this movie, Emma Thompson in particular delivering a very impressive depiction of Eleanor, the only member of her family with any kind of sense, who is considered to be the less passionate of her sisters because she does not display her feelings with as little reserve and discretion as her younger sister does.<br /><br />  The cinematography, the casting, the screen-play and soundtrack are all exemplary, and this is in short, the best of movies.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I usually dont offer my opinion on an album until I have memorized every riff and nuance of every song, but my local paper The Jacksonville Times Union blasted The Strokes and dared to compare them with Nickleback (or Nickelback, whatever- whitetrash rock!) I live a television/magazine sheltered life. I dont hear hype on bands or watch the latest entertainment news. Its all fluff anyway. My opinion of the Strokes came from one song 6 years ago. That song was Hard to Explain, literally.. That song blew me away because at the time rock was heading in a direction that was stagnate at best.. You had all these wanna-be Nirvanas, Pearl Jams mixed with rap-rock bands that have obviously not lasted too long.. I got into some of them, but to a level where I would never travel a great distance to watch them play.. The Strokes snapped me out of my daze and got me interested in Rock again.. Then along came Jet, Franz, The White Stripes and a few others.. This created an awesome time for Rock.. They were revitalizing Rock and doing so with a sound that resembled ours and our parents Rock music, but with a modern sound.. Doesnt this sound like what automakers are doing with the cars? Bringing back the older looking models with modern twists! Its cleverly perfect and gets the old 4-chambered muscle pumping again! To me this all started with The Strokes.. I have the unfortunate luck of living in a Redneck Big City where unfortunately groups like Nickleback get more airplay than these retro-modern groups so of course the reviewers are going to slam anything different.. When it comes to musical taste Jacksonville is still riding at the back of the bus (hush that fuss)! At least one person in this hick-swamp has some good taste and here is my opinion of First Impressions... I would rate (and should do a review) the first CD a 5 just for standoutishness (yes I make up my own words here).. The 2nd CD would get a 4, but a weak 4 just because they didnt do anything special other than theneat electroguitar sounds and fell victim to that Sophmore album curse that everyone (including The Beatles) has fell in to... This CD is a strong 4.. It is different, exploratory, and fun to listen to. The songs grow on you and its not torture to try out. Razorblade is pretty pop sounding and I foresee it being the next single and it rightly deserves to be. Its a good made-for-radio song.. My favorite is the IZE one.. The lyrics are awesome and the tempo changes are so sweet that you will anticipate them every time with glee! There are 2 songs on the CD that I need more time to appreciate, but thats not bad at all. A CD surpasses my expectations when there are at least 3 songs better than the first single and I count 5 that are better for sure and 5 more that are right behind it. You should pick this CD up just for the craftsmanship of the music as the boys are really getting their stuff together and producing some fine melodies. Where I knock points is for Jules... I like how he is experimenting and im actually a fan of his voice, but I dont think he gave it his all with some of the songs and there are some drops in fascination. I do however love his song about how hates everyone.. I think we have all hated everyone at some point or another and drinking just makes it worse in the end.. Anyhow I can only hope that Jacksonville will be the city to get Vapori-

B0000AUHPK|5.0|This is a story about two people that cannot live without eachother, but really cannot be said to love eachother, save in the very loosest sense of the word.  Each love in a passionate, wilful, and selfish way, perfectly willing to let the other suffer any measure of pain as it fits into their plans of advancement (on Cathy's part) or revenge (on Heathcliffe's part, and eventually Cathy's part as well.).<br /><br /> Each of these parts is played well, Ralph Fiennes of course does an exceptional job of Heathcliffe, while Cathy is very annoying, but all in a true-to-the-book way.<br /><br />  Into the story comes Edgar Linton, the docile, lamb-like rival lover of Cathy Earnshaw, who is really such an honourable sort you can't dislike him, but so timid and retiring you can't respect him either.  He is the perfect counter to Heathcliffe, who is passionate where Linton is incapable of very strong feelings at all, savage where Linton is refined, poor where Linton is brought up in luxury, and immoral where Linton is principled.  Linton is played as he should be, with an embarrassingly weak personality, which shrinks from violence even in protecting himself or his loved ones.<br /><br />  The story for the most part consists of the various ways in which these three principle characters make each other completely miserable, especially Heathcliffe, whose goal in life after Cathy dies is to bring as much misery on Linton, who was the chosen rival, as is possible, which he does by convincing Linton and Cathy's daughter that she is in love with his son (her cousin), a carbon copy of Linton without the refinements and gentleness, a selfish, sickly sort of vermin.  In the end, the younger Cathy is forced to marry him, soon after he dies, leaving her to the care of Heathcliffe, whose chief aim is to use her as a means of fulfilling his revenge.

B000FC1MOQ|1.0|I've read the five-star reviews and while I sympathize with the people who didn't know this story was pure baloney, I am disturbed at the people who say in effect, &#34;He lied. So what?&#34; Well, that is the point.Frey sold the public a bill of goods, and exploited the emotions of good people to make a fast buck. He claimed this had really happened, because he was unable to sell this novel as fiction. If it had been presented as fiction, it would have sunk to the bottom without a ripple, and no one would know Frey's name today.<br /><br />I guess I should have known this was fiction. Dental work without anasthesia? Doesn't happen in the US, and even AA wouldn't expect anyone to suffer needless pain. Nitrous oxide and novocaine are aren't addictive and they wear off quickly.<br />Counsellors at rehabs don't drive patients to crack houses.<br /><br />And aside from thr unbelievable stuff, Frey's character does a disservice to people who are still addicted and think they can quit on their own because they are such special little snowflakes and/or they are ashamed, or the thought of seeking help scares them. If you can quit on your own, your problem was not that advanced to begin with. Thank your lucky stars it wasn't. But Frey presents white-knuckling it as the principled, &#34;manly&#34; way to get sober. Some people need help. If they are desperate and humbled enough they will accept it.<br /><br />The most offensive scene for me was when James gets out of rehab and heads straight for a bar just to prove to himself that he is stronger than alcohol. He never had a drinking problem to begin with! When I first quit drinking,  I would often want to have a drink. I didn't start craving heroin! I had never done street drugs and had no inclination to start.<br /><br />Every recovering addict or alcoholic with serious sober time knows that stopping is not that hard. Most of us have done it many times! The trickier part is staying stopped.
0688170528|3.0|Overall, the book held my attention, but I was disappointed with the ending.  (I was disappointed with the ending of My Sister's Keeper also.)  Jodi Picoult's books seem to capture my interest in the beginning, but the conclusions aren't very well developed or realistic.
B00005R23Z|1.0|I'm sorry, this review is not for the movie itself (an excellent 5-star movie) but this particular version of it. The end of the movie, I believe, it the most powerfull part of it: a list of the people who would not be born if these were our ways, and the message \\"the other birth that certainly would not have taken place, is your own\\". This is the entire point of the movie, and for some rediculous reason, has been removed from this version. Don't tell me they couldn't fit the last 20 seconds onto a DVD.
B00000K0E5|5.0|The best Brosnan Bond movie and the best video game for N64. Goldeneye arguably saved the series which had been dormant for 6 years. Brosnan looked as if he had been playing Bond his whole life. Sean Bean did a good job as a villain and Famke Jansen played an awesomely evil Bond girl. The scene where Bond drives a tank through a Russian city is a classic. Sadly, I feel each Brosnan movie got progressively worst, ending with the horrible Die another Day.
0307276902|1.0|What's the biggest disgrace?  That this author has been revealed as a fraud or the public is still buying the book.  Oprah, you should demand to have your name taken off it!!  It's horrible that this is number one on Amazon.  If you are considering buying it please don't!!!  Pick a nonfiction book by someone who tells the truth.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is undoubtedly a classic from Pink Floyd but it's not an easy listening. Dark Side is an easy listening and is easy to digest. It's just that The Wall is so intense for a 1st listener of PF that he/she may be turned off of The Wall and Pink Floyd in general. I suggest starting with Dark Side, Wish, or animals when 1st getting into Floyd. Anyway, about the album. It's a great album and there's a great concept to it, you can listen to most of the songs in general without once thinking about the plot. May I suggest Mother, ABITW pt2, Waiting For The Worms, The Trial, Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb, Bring The Boys Back Home, Goodbye Blue Sky, Hey You, and Young Lust(No particular order).<br /><br /> The only things I don't like about this album is that the keyboard playing from Rick doesn't really stand out(Like On Wish You Were Here), and half of the drumming on The Wall, for whatever reason, isn't done by Nick(like the chilling drums on Bring The Boys Back Home). Nonetheless, it's a great album for Pink Floyd fans, and like I said, new Pink Floyd fans should start out with Dark Side. The album is pretty expensive(My copy was $40) but it's totally worth it.
0140185232|5.0|This book was well suited for someone of my age (23 when I read it in '05) who is looking and trying to understand \\"what really is there to life\\" and how do we discover it. <br /> <br />The protagonist would be considered fortunate with what he has under most social parameters. But it is his want to break out and examine the 'self' that makes him, and thereby this book unique. <br /> <br />Maugham also sets this story up and contrasts it with various people in society - those we would deem conventional and those we wouldn't. <br /> <br />I think his point is to illustrate individualism in its various states (absolute individualism vs. a socially determined one) and directions (betterment of self vs. detriment of self). <br /> <br />Ultimately, this individualism, can be a magnificently powerfuly thrust that can result in a state of absolute emotional calm (possibly what salvation is thought to be) or can precipitate a downfall where body and spirit just rots. There is only the razor's edge separating the two states. <br /> <br />In between this you have various levels of how one acquiesces to social constraints and demands. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book as it probed me to examine my own personal beliefs between the individual and society. It is also a very well written and colorful story.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|It took me a few listens for this cd to grow on me, but after carefully listening to each song and reading the lyrics, I realized it was genius! It's by far more in depth and shows off their talent more than their previous 2 albums. Not comparing it to any of their earlier work, and just looking at it as a piece of music, it is amazing. Better than anything else out there today. Good work Strokes I love you

Finally after two years of college he finds out how.  In finding out how he made the worst mistake in the history of mankind.<br /><br /> Once he figured out how to put life into something he was dying to try it.  He stole body parts from cemeteries and created a creature.  The creature was a monstrous wretched creature.  Right when it came alive it ran away.  When people saw it they gasped.  Now the creature hated Victor for ever creating him.  Frankenstein's creature goes to kill everybody in Victor's family and his friends.  Victor's life will never be the same.<br /><br /> This is a great book for ages nine and up.  It is a classical fiction book but will never bore minds.  I definitely recommend for action fans.  An action packed and compelling story!  A must read.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|There is no doubt that Shakira is a major force in both the Latino and Anglo music industries, and her latest album \\"Oral Fixaton, Vol. 2\\" helps continue her ascent to legendary status. Still, listeners expecting an album full of soaring vocals and syrupy romance as showcased on last summer's magnificent \\"Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1\\" will be surprised by an album characterized by many different themes and styles.<br /><br />The oddity is that \\"Vol. 1,\\" which was a completely Spanish disc, debuted even higher on the Billboard chart, scoring the best sales week for any non-English album. Also, lead single \\"La Tortura,\\" the slick, sexy party record featuring Alejandro Sanz that was unstoppable through the fall and became the most successful Spanish single ever released, peaked far higher on the Billboard Hot 100 than \\"Don't Bother,\\" the lead single from \\"Vol. 2,\\" which fizzled at #42 despite an impassioned performance, catchy hook and lingual advantage. Still, the English disc is a rarity among pop music; it is experimental and interesting.<br /><br />The ball starts rolling with the hair-rising \\"How Do You Do?,\\" a track that has been cut from the album in the Far East do to its outrightly calling God to task.<br /><br />\\"How do you do?/How does it feel to be so high?/Are you happy? Do you ever cry?/You've made mistakes, well that's okay `cause we all have/But if I forgive yours, will you forgive mine?\\"<br /><br />She also breathes new life into \\"Dia Especial\\" from \\"Vol. 1\\" with \\"The Day and the Time,\\" which tells the tale of a stormy relationship that triumphs over obstacles. She perfectly recaptures the mood of the original incarnation and sings like her very life depends on it, much like she does on the heartrending ballad \\"Your Embrace.\\"<br /><br />\\"Hope it isn't too late to say I love you/Hope it isn't too late to say/That without you this place looks like London, it rains everyday/Don't you know it babe, I'm only half a body/Without your embrace.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, the melancholy \\"Dreams For Plans\\" shimmers beneath sparkling production, while \\"Hey You\\" is a slinky piece of flirtatious fun ensconced in mariachi horns that brings levity to the album. She also sings out for those oppressed by war in the courageous \\"Timor\\" and provides her best chance at a hit single with \\"Illegal,\\" a refreshingly understated piece that derives an awesome punch from Carlos Santana's playing and belittles those who play games with others' hearts.<br /><br />Despite a few tracks that would have been better left off the record in favor of others, especially \\"Something,\\" a dissapointing translation of the unbelievable \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" from \\"Vol. 1,\\" one fact cannot be denied: Shakira does not rest on her laurels, but instead consistently challenges herself as a writer and prompts her audience to think, feel and care.

0307276902|5.0|I was lucky enough to have found and finished this book before Oprah mentioned it.  This story is so disturbing that you can't put the book down.  I went a little crazy with the writing style, but it couldn't have been done any other way.  I have passed this onto all my friends and everyone has said the same thing.  I look forward to reading his next book.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This one I have to say is one of those movies that can seem to be a bit long, but once it grabs you, you do not want to end it.  This movie had everything, love, despair, and the constant hunting of who was behind the mastermind of deceit. I found this film to be very interesting, beautifully shot (in Kenya) and an all around good story.  This movie is not for everyone...only those that can appreciate fine cinematic arts such as these!
B00005JOFO|5.0|BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has already generated enough buzz--and enough controversy--to muddle one's critical faculties for, I dunno, maybe the next five years.  And much of the commentary seems to amount to so much posturing.  From what I've been reading, the most sophisticated response (arguably) is something along the lines of \\"It's pretty good.   Beautifully photographed. And very well acted.  But it's really just a love story--in cowboy drag.\\"  Yikes!  I'd rather listen to the gushing praise or even the indignant blanket condemnations.    Not that the movie is perfect.  There were moments when I thought that it had fallen in love with its own arty sketchiness.  Short scene after short scene to be telegraphing the message: you're just getting the outlines of what you need to know and no more.  I guess I have more of a literary sensibility than a purely cinematic one.  I wanted to get to know all the characters better.  And though I understand that the movie only had a couple of hours to lay out the events of 20 years, I would have appreciated more than just a glimpse at the events of a given year, more of a sense of the flow of time.  Not just \\"Oh look, the toddlers are teenagers now.  I guess we're in a new decade.\\"    But a fluid representation of time is always hard when a story arcs over a lengthy period: doesn't matter whether the source story was a lengthy novel or, as it was in this case, a short story.  (Or for that matter, if it's from an original screen play.)    So maybe that's quibbling.  I will give them credit though: they certainly have come up with better age make-up (or is is the aging technique done digitally these days?).  Twenty-somethings Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger really do look fortyish by the end of the movie.  Only the buoyantly youthful Anne Hathaway seems not to have aged at all (only tarted up a bit by bleaching her hair).    But I digress. The reason a viewer might want more from the story is because what IS there is handled so well.This is the story of circumscribed, hardscrabble lives made all the more difficult because the characters find themselves dealing with feelings and issues that they can only begin to fathom.  They don't talk much, which is what the  Big Sky culture they were raised in seems to demand of men--and women--of the time.  But the movie gives the lie to the myth of the strong silent type.  Of course, this is years before \\"Oprah-speak\\" entered into the culture--and in this particular neck of the woods, that kind of \\"sharing\\" probably has (for good and for ill) yet to make much of a foothold.  In the case of Jack and Ennis, it would seem to be pretty much FOR ILL.  These are people who cannot risk opening those emotional floodgates.    And that's not just true of the men.  On one level, this is the story of two men are struggling with their feelings for each other (in a world where such feelings are unacceptable).  But as many have noted, it is also the story of the women that they marry and the children that they father.  In fact, the one performance that I would say is close to being a shoo-in come awards time is likely Michelle Williams subtle performance as Ennis's (Heath Ledger's character)long-suffering (but not a forever suffering)wife.  Her performance has been described as heartbreaking, and it is.  But it is precisely her character's verbal inarticulateness in the face of an overwhelming realization that lends meaning to her every expression and gesture.     Watching the movie, I was reminded that one of the few other things I have seen Michelle Williams in was HBO's lesbian themed IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  In one of that film's episodes, she played a proudly defiant young lesbian student in the 1970s.  That TV movie was much more schematic than BROKEBACK, but the two films, when considered together, actually do suggest something of the difference between the pre- and post-Stonewall mentality.  And of the significance of geography and social class as factors that may allow gays and lesbians options in how to lead their lives.   1970s middle class students from the East had more options than rural poor kids from the Far West had in the early 1960s.    But of course, there are strong social and political forces even today who would have it otherwise.  Before the film began, I heard a man a few rows ahead of me complaining to his (female) companion that \\"Born agains don't have a clue.  They say it's all about behavior.  It's about identity.\\"  Well, he would have little argument from me.  But life--and this film--are still even more complex than that.  I can readily imagine that if fundamentalist Christians (or Jews or Muslims) actually might be willing to view this film, they might well come to a conclusion that would only confirm their beliefs.  They might say, \\"See, these men are fully capable of having a relationship with the opposite sex, of siring children, and establishing a family.  It's only out of selfish lust that they refuse to do so.  And that leads to their downfall.\\"    That IS a possible interpretation, I suppose.  The film's more liberal target audience (myself included) would likely come up with an alternate analysis, namely that if these two people who loved each other lived in a world that accepted their difference, they never would have been forced into marriages that they did not want and could never find fulfilling.    But ultimately that's not quite it either.  Good art like BROKEBACK is less about getting across a moral or socio-political message than it is about portraying life as it is lived.  That's another difference between this and, say, IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  This is less of a tract and more of a portrait of some people's lives.  And it rings true.    Which is about all you can demand from a work of art.
1400031087|1.0|Looks like we've been had....again.   Lying leaders and false prophets- packaged by corporations and served up to us as saviors.  Shame on all of us for not looking deeper for true merit and integrity.  When did the honest struggle to recover from addiction become just another riveting screenplay?  There are people who read this book, suffering as prisoners to addiction, who might now think they can do it alone, if they can \\"hold on\\" and tough it out.  My concern is for them and their well-being.  James Frey will be just fine....

By pure accident, I thought I pushed the button for Enya cd, actually there came this amazing male singing voice. God, I was totally blew away. And it's been a week, I've been watching the DVD whenever I got the chance. Not only can he sing (one of the best male singer nowadays), Buble is such a natual performer. How I wish I were at his concert!!!
B0000AUHPB|4.0|This movie was great.  It is different then the remake, storywise.  The one thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending-it wasn't resolved and I don't enjoy movies that end that way.  If you can handle an unresolved ending, then the rest of the movie is well worth seeing...it really holds your attention.
0393317552|5.0|This is a great book! Jared Diamond has a nice writing style, and perhaps he wasn't the first one to think about this hypothesis, but he does a great job presenting his arguments in a clear-yet-non-scientific manner.  <br /> <br />I think some people take offense with his position, because in the end, one of his main arguments is that there is no genetic reason why the European cultures have arisen to such power while other cultures haven't.  In the end, despite culture, skin color, etc., there really isn't that much physically separating a Blackfeet Indian to a white Wall Street banker to a hunter in Africa.   <br /> <br />Geography obviously plays a significant role in human society. If you are isolated from others (like the Americas and various islands), you are at more a disadvantage when other societies come visit you, bearing knowledge/technologies/bacteria/viruses that have never been encountered by the indigenous peoples. Obviously many societies all over the world have domesticated animals/plants for their own uses.  Yet some animals can't be domesticated despite years of human interaction (elephants still kill/harm their trainers and elephants have been used by humans for many centuries) whereas when was the last time you heard a cow killing it's rancher? And remember there are millions of cows vs. thousands of elephants. And cows can do more things reliably than just die for our consumption, pulling plows, carrying heavy goods, etc. <br /> <br />Cultures that had easy access to ideas/technologies to improve their own lives, to free up time that would otherwise be spent stalking game, digging roots, or tending/harvesting crops.  Would Shakespeare have written (allegedly?) so many plays when he had to repeatedly go out to hunt? And hunting/planting/harvesting crops each have their own dangers, from broken bones, accidental injury from tools/weapons, etc. And back in the old days, even minor injuries by today's standards may result in death back then. <br /><br />But anyway, I highly recommend that y'all not only buy, but also read this book!  Jared does a much better job than me in laying out his arguments and a clear, logical, and not-so-eye-glazing way that most people should understand!
B00000GBHA|5.0|First released in 1970 and almost entirely forgotten (at least in North America) over the three and a half decades since, COLD FACT is the first of two albums by Jesus \\"Sixto\\" Rodriguez, a gifted singer/songwriter from Detroit whose reputation has apparently fared far better in the southern hemisphere than in his homeland. A latterday Australian compilation, AT HIS BEST (six of whose eleven tracks are taken from this album), is the only other Rodriguez CD currently available; so anyone who owns and likes either of these discs is strongly encouraged to pick up the other, repetitions notwithstanding. <br />   And indeed, withstand they don't, as COLD FACT manages to fit no less than a dozen neat, clever, poignant and musically diverse nuggets into its regrettably brief 31:45 running time. Opening with the bizarre \\"Sugar Man,\\" a whining ode to a drug dealer which makes surprisingly effective use of an oddball arrangement of bass clarinet, theramined guitar and various sound effects; then segueing into the misogynistic pre-heavy metal of \\"Only Good for Conversation\\" and the pretty, lightly orchestrated neo-Biblical folk of \\"Crucify Your Mind,\\" COLD FACT shows Rodriguez employing a different approach on nearly every track, with consistently strong and intelligent lyrics riding atop the results. Other highlights include \\"Establishment Blues,\\" with its sly laundry-list of urban woes capped off by the stinging \\"...and you tell me that this is where it's at\\"; a tearjerking two-minute ballad, \\"Forget It\\"; the lopingly infectious \\"Inner-City Blues\\" (no relation to the Marvin Gaye tune of the same title); \\"Rich Folks Hoax,\\" with its dour and self-explanatory message; and \\"Like Janis,\\" which closes the album on possibly its strongest note with a beautiful arrangement backing some equally beautiful poetry (\\"Don't try to impress me; you're just pins and paint. And don't try to charm me with things that you ain't.\\"). Each song is a gem in its own right, even the rare flawed one(\\"Gomorrah,\\" an appealing straight blues for the most part, has a rather silly chorus with the singer backed by what sounds like a group of children), and the result is a sadly underappreciated collection by a tragically underappreciated talent which holds its own against almost any of its contemporaries - and that's saying a lot. Open your ears for this one, folks; it's more than worth the 31:45 investment.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|<br /> This album has two really good songs that sound like they could be on the radio or something that is the \\"stand my ground\\" which has quickly become one of my favorite songs and the other one \\"angel\\". The album is good, but if you are a big fan of say Nightwish, Therion, or Epica you will notice this has a very pop-like sound to it. It simply sounds like something you'd hear on the mainstream radio, though probably a little better. The songs themselves are all good but the album itself gets a little boring because all of the songs are basically the same beat, same chords, and same singing. Not all of them, but mostly there's not a lot of variety in the album, which again sound very similiar to most mainstream radio bands. The vocalist is very angelic and good. I bought this album because it was supposed to be similiar to Therion and Nightwish, basically an opera type of metal. Well its not. The singer sounds similiar to opera perhaps in some parts, but basically sings like a pop singer (though she has a very beautiful soft voice). The music itself has a few heavy points but is not metal at all, its more or less a mellow rock music. probably the thing I liked most about the album were the lyrics. they were very poetic and positive, uplifting. A little too much on the subject of love though.(which again reminds you of a radio band).  <br /> <br /> the album is worth the money just for the two really good songs (stand my ground comes with a bonus video which is very good as well) but the other songs are pretty good too.
1400032717|4.0|A funny and smart book, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" will have you laugh out loud, but will also break your heart for the main character.  I truly enjoyed the way Mr. Haddon would set up scenes, putting the reader right there with the character.  I hope I get to be even close to the caliber that he displays with this book.  A definite must-read!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is not only one of the best sci-fi movies in recent years, it is one of the best all round movies I have ever seen.  What makes this movie so good is everyone will like it.

1400032717|4.0|In the novel \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" Mark Haddon describes the adventures of an autistic boy, living his life. Christopher has discovered a murdered dog--his neighbor's dog--and begins to write a mystery about his detections, not long after which he is forced to stop investigating. Never-the-less Christopher continues to write in his book until it leads him to an even bigger mystery of his past and what could be his present and future. Being someone who is only comfortable with logic, and logic to it's fullest, he often has trouble dealing with strangers. He doesn't understand expressions, or other points of view, and is not ok with letting other people touch him-even his parents. This makes his journeys even more worth reading about as you can feel his pain and bravery throughout the novel. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read but propelled me into a whole new level of thinking about things. I found Christopher's corks intriguing with a bewildering humor and it just goes to show you, you've never heard everyone's view on the way the world runs. I would recommend this book to almost anyone, because although it's an easy read, in the boy's mindset, but it's a real eye opener. I was surprised how involved I got in the book, for such a straightforward novel, there were so many twists and turns that left me in awe and complete sympathy for the characters, and I'm certain I will remember this story for a long time.

B0000024K1|5.0|This is a phenomenal hip hop album - from the sound to the lyrical content, the humor, catchy beats and everything in between. This is my second favourite hip hop album of all-time, which is no small statement, as I am, and have been a huge hip hop fan.

B000BJS4OY|1.0|Remastering this album did nothing to help the sound quality of this \\"production\\" of \\"producer\\" John Landau. Who knows what, if anything, was going through Springsteen's head when he approved the sound of this mix. On the outs with his original producer who would not suck up to him enough, this is when Springsteen fell under Landau's spell, from which he has, sadly, never escaped.<br /><br />Today, these songs sound dated and not a little embarrassing.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I suggest you run out and rent/buy ERASERHEAD now available in a new edition on DVD. Lynch is a genius and none of his films, save perhaps ELEPHANT MAN, are straightforward narratives easy to watch or discuss afterwards. That's what makes him a great artist. DUNE is flawed, but the opinions about the \\"cheap effects\\" (not for the time, fanboy) and overwrought scenes (hey, it's high opera, kiddo) are based on simplistic armchair criticism and total lack of film knowledge per se. I have made movies and written screenplays and appreciate art when I see it on celluloid (digital movies will never achieve the heights of beauty of real film - yes, happily a purist). DUNE may be one of the last great epics actually shot on FILM. Internet pixel jockeys can buy all the $5000 camera packages and student Avid software they want, but to make the movies Lynch has made requires actual vision and talent, something digital moguls like George Lucas left for dead long ago. DUNE has everything the first book has (the other books mainly cash in, although some of the scenes with Alia as a goddess and Leto as Worm Emperor are very interesting) in scope, imagination and milieu. Peter Jackson proved with LOTR that you can dice and slice and even improve on the original (for the most part). I defy anyone to watch this science fiction epic and believe you are anywhere else than a beautiful, bewitching, dark and dangerous desert planet in a far more interesting galaxy far, far away. And Lynch didn't have to rip off anyone else to do it!
0385336942|5.0|I saw this book at the library and thought the title rang a bell; probably a confusion with the other Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell. What a beautiful, touching book! It is one of those too-rare novels that succeeds in creating a world I don't know and probably never will: small-town Alaska. It's not the Alaska of polar bears and igloos, or the Alaska of high mountain adventure, it's a very believable place, populated with interesting and unusual characters: the town drunk who is also a shaman, an aging priest who was once a bomb disposal expert, a beautiful half-Yup'ik woman who seems to have mysterious powers. The ideas of Christian and Yup'ik spirituality weave together, and the question of what is real and what is imaginary or faked floats through the story the way the balloons float across the barren landscape.  <br /> <br />A wonderful first novel. Here's hoping Liam Callanan gives us another story as good as this one.
0553801503|1.0|This book was terribly disappointing.  It doesn't really follow any particular narrative thread of interest (focusing mostly on the least favorite characters of the series), and not a lot seems to happen.  In a word, he's Jordanizing -- he's adding characters, slowing everything down, and has basically lost the page-turning qualities of his previous books.   <br /> <br />The character hopping format (10-30 pages per character, then switch to a different character) that Martin uses was fine in his previous books, but somehow it just didn't work here.  This may be beacuse the characters are less interesting, or it may be because after a certain number of threads, you can't keep interest. <br /> <br />Additionally, while his world has always been dark, and that is something that makes his work distinct, a dark world isn't very fun without some good guys to root for.  This book pretty much doesn't really have a good guy to root for (unlike the previous books again!) -- it's a book about rape, mutilation and death, usually for no particular story reason.  As a result, its dreary and depressing, and a grind to read through. <br /> <br />I do not recommend this book.  It has the worst qualities of George RR Martin's work combined with the over-detailed grindingly-slow narrative style that Jordan seems to have \\"mastered\\".
B000A59PMO|5.0|Prior to seeing this DVD collection nonstop at every store I went to I wasn't at all familiar with it. By the cover I simply dismissed it as another teen drama next to the other countless drones on TV today. But with each new glance at the box I got more curious as to why it was popular so I read a few reviews. Each one said nothing but good things and the basic plot was pretty intriguing. I eventually bought it and I must say that next to Scrubs, this is my new favorite show on TV now. Sure a teen detective sounds a bit corny but when you add that she is simply helping her dad, who is a P.I., it doesn't sound quite so far out. I was extremely happy to see that they casted Enrico Colantoni of Just Shoot Me fame. I always thought he'd be good in a serious part with comedic touches, and he delivers ten fold as Keith Mars, Veronica's dad. I might add that the chemistry between the two of them is as if they're actually related. As for the rest of the cast, aside from rather emotionless Teddy Dunn, the casting was flawless. Percy Daggs III is perfect as the newbie Wallace, Jason Dohring has that smart alleck air to him as Logan, and Francis Capra as the biker gang leader Weevil is pretty funny. The standout in the cast is without a doubt Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars. Her acting is spot on for each and every scene and passes off as a detective very well.<br /><br />What I really like about this show is that there's two long running mysteries with tons of side projects in each episode. The death of Veronica's friend Lilly being the main focus of the two main mysteries. What's admirable is that they never give up too much information about either case in any episode, it keeps you guessing about what might happen next.<br /><br />Overall I can't complain a bit about this set or show. The extras are up to par with other TV DVDs but the main focus will always be on the show itself. The acting is a major reason this show is good, but the dialogue is what sets it apart from most other shows. You'll be going along fairly serious and then there'll be a part that just makes you laugh. Take the scene in which Veronica is acting like a girl who just discovered she's pregnant in order to see who charged a room to a credit card all while her dad is throwing some big over the top fit about finding out who got his daughter pregnant, that is gold right there. Basically this show has a bit of everything, romance, mystery, comedy, drama, it's all there. So I'm sure everyone will find one quality to like about it.ou'll be going along fairly serious and then there'll be a part that just makes you laugh.

0385493800|5.0|Have you ever been astounded by the shallow behavior of someone?  This Grisham masterpiece delivers the justice that those people deserve.  Although the protagonist is by no means an angel, his children are the epitome of greed, corruption and privilege and he teaches them a lesson that is richly deserved. <br /> <br />The other half of this novel is a warm story about the other side of life, where personal growth, charity and compassion are highlighted, restoring the reader's faith in the good of life.   <br /> <br />I think Grisham does a masterful job telling this story where greed and gluttony are punished and sincerity is rightly rewarded.  You can't help but feel good after reading this book, which you will probably do within hours of cracking the cover.  I've read it three times already and will probably do so at least another three.  Great novel.

Now, after having read it several times, it is one of my favorite books that brings the civil rights movement in a different light than one learns about in history classes or other books.  The separate point of view, through the eyes of a little girl (although the language would make you think otherwise), demonstrates how unnecessary many of these stereotypes and predjudices were at the time the book was written (or at the present day).  Now, years later, the book is still an important one for poeple to read--the themes are universal, and it is simply good literature that is interesting and a wonderful book all around.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|I have been reading with interest many of these reviews and I have to say I disagree strongly with alot of them. <br /> <br />Clearly this is not Korns heaviest effort and obviously they miss Head, but to say the band is finished is ridiculous. And to the person who wrote 'Korn R.I.P', you should really take another listen. I think you are the sort that if they had done a standard heavy album you'd be complaining that they sound too samey. <br /> <br />The facts are 1) They are down a guitarist; 2)They are an older more experinced bunch of guys many of whom are either married, have kids or both; and 3) This their SEVENTH album. SEVEN!!!! If a band cant at least experiment with their sound after this long then they might as well hang up their instruments.  <br /> <br />Korn are doing what all great bands do, they change. In a changing world with changing tastes, I think that 'See you on the other side' is a stroke of musical brilliance. It keeps things alive. And if you arent alive, you're dead.

B00005JOFO|1.0|Every year the world gets at least one controversial film that is hailed by critics, and usually wins a lot of awards. \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" has been labled as \\"the gay cowboy movie,\\" which sounds about right to me. It may be me, but I'm more likely to side with the hecklers in this case then with the critics. When \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" came out the critics hailed it as a \\"revolutionary film,\\" one that apparently was so good that it was said that \\"it [didn't] matter whether you were left or right, [\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\"] is a great film.\\" Of course, we all know these statements to be complete lies barely two years later.<br /><br />But maybe the critics are right in this case. Maybe \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" IS a movie that can change the way we think about gay lovers?! I went into the movie with an open mind, ready to have my beliefs challenged. Strangely enough, I can sum up what \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" is in brief, simple summery: \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" is a glorified affair. As you all know, \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" revolves around two sheep herders (Ennis and Jack) who get drunk, have sex, and (supposingly) fall in love. Then they get back to the real world, they both get married, they have kids, but they still remember the nights they shared on Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Then one day, Ennis receives a letter from Jack, suggesting that they go back to Brokeback Moutain for another fling (although he doesn't say it like that per se). They both know that they can never be together, but they do make a choice to keep seeing each other at Brokeback Mountain every few months. Through the years Ennis and Jack spend continue with their real lives, with those few days a year they can see each other when they are in total bliss. All the while they hurt their wives, they neglect their kids to a certain extent, and they hurt friends.<br /><br />Some people see this movie as a great tradgedy because these two men love each other but can't be together. I, on the other hand, saw two men who lusted for each other, and ended up being complete jerks who did nothing but cheat on their wives and have no problem with this. Ok, time for the sarcasm to end and it's time to get serious. Despite all the praise this film gets, despite all the things that are being said about this series, at the end of the day this is about two men having an affair and hurting the people they are married to. This fact seems to have went over almost everyone's head. The fact that these two characters are hurting their loved one's doesn't seem to matter much to the people praising this film.<br /><br />I have to wonder, if the coupld had been a man and a woman, would all this deception and cheating be as overlooked as it is here? It's also hard to believe in the romance itself, seeing as how it was birthed from a night where the characters had one too many drinks, not because they actually fall in love. They just have a hard night of sex and before you know it they're a couple. Sorry, but I'm not convinced. Throughout this whole film there was only one believable character in the whole movie, and that character is the Michelle Williams character. When Williams character discovers that her husbend is cheating on her, we truly feel sorry for her as her marriage falls apart.<br /><br />The scene where she finally confronts her husbend about his affair with another man, I almost started to cry for her, as she was outright lied to, and her life was, more or less, greatly damaged. For some reason, some of the people I saw the film with sided with Ennis during this scene, because the Williams character \\"didn't understand what Ennis was going through.\\" I couldn't help but wonder what any of the other characters had to do to get sympathy. The boys boss (played by Randy Quade) has been said to be a biggot, when in reality he couldn't care less about the two boys sexuality, he's just mad that they let his sheep get eaten while they were keeping themselves busy.<br /><br />I will admit that the actingis good, and the cinatography is beautiful, but I can't in all honesty recommend a movie where the main characters seem to okay with hurting people they care about, with very few consequences. I've never cared about movies that are about glorified affairs, and this one is no different.the acting is good, and the cinatography is beautiful, but I can't in all honesty recommend a movie where the main characters seem to okay with hurting people they care about, with very few consequences.

But he wants to be more like his wealthy Uncle Nasar.  Uncle gives him a start by offering him a job to manage a Laundromat.   But this Laundromat is a dump and there is a string attached, Omar must date his cousin.  <br /> <br />To make some extra money, Omar delivers drugs for another cousin. Omar decides to spruce the Laundromat up and enlists his friend Johnny (DDL).  Johnny comes up with an idea of skimming some of the drugs to fund the upgrades.  They reopen the luxury Laundromat and it is a hit.   <br /> <br />The problem with dating his cousin is that Omar is in love with someone else, Johnny.  This is deftly handled and it hits you from the blindside. <br /> <br />This film is great from many different directions.

B00005JOT1|3.0|Despite my reservations, I'm glad this film will finally be released next month in US theaters, as I already saw it on a United Airlines flight in November. There is much that is worthwhile about director Mike Barker's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic play of manners, \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\". With his trademark cleverness and sophisticated characters, Wilde wrote a shrewdly observant and trenchantly funny story of jealousy, hypocrisy and social acceptance in Victorian London. First-time screenwriter Howard Himelstein updates the story to the 1930's placing most of the action on the glamorous Amalfi Coast in Italy, and it certainly makes for a great excuse for a beautiful setting and period-authentic fashions.<br /><br />The film sticks with the basic outline of Wilde's play, as the plot focuses on Mrs. Stella Erlynne, a scandalous socialite who has been run out of New York for using wealthy, married men to allow her to live the high life to which she has become accustomed. In Italy, she latches onto young Robert Windermere, a successful American businessman who is still a blissful newlywed with his demure wife Meg in tow. About to celebrate her 21st birthday, Meg herself attracts the not entirely unwanted attentions of notorious playboy Lord Darlington, who discovers that Robert has been paying Mrs. Erlynne a generous allowance. Complications ensue until a surprise ending (at least a surprise for anyone who doesn't know the play) uncovers the true facts behind the payments. The brittle wit of Wilde's words remains intact, but the zestful spirit seems missing given the lack of an appropriate emotional context for Wilde's shrewd observations to resonate. Ultimately it all feels very civilized but too tepid to make the story relevant to a modern viewer.<br /><br />Casting is part of the problem. As Mrs. Erlynne, a skeletal Helen Hunt seems miscast despite her best efforts at being scintillating. Her appeal comes from her contemporary, down-to-earth sensibilities, so her portrayal of a predatory bon-vivant feels off-kilter, especially as her character shows moments of vulnerability. The omnipresent Scarlett Johansson looks right as Meg, but she also seems at sea with Wilde's dialogue and the character's evolution. Even so, Mark Umbers is comparatively lackluster as Robert. Faring better are Stephen Campbell Moore as Darlington (spewing my favorite Wilde line as he describes America as a society \\"that's gone from barbarism to depravity without bothering to develop civilization in between\\") and, in particular, Tom Wilkinson, who plays Mrs. Erlynne's not-so-love-blind suitor, Tuppy, with the panache that the rest of the cast seems missing. All the externals are fine - Ben Seresin's sun-dappled cinematography, John Bloomfield's fanciful costumes, Ben Scott's Mediterranean-feeling production design. However, it all comes down to Wilde's incisive wit, and the movie is worth seeing just to listen to that., so her portrayal of a predatory bon-vivant feels off-kilter, especially as her character shows moments of vulnerability.

B00005JNQA|4.0|Director Sydney Pollack has pulled together a movie that teeters precariously between brisk, complex thriller and serious-minded political drama. The 2005 result has several effective scenes though a sometimes muddled storyline that strains credibility toward the end. Despite a few pyrotechnics, there is no pumped-up music or over-extended special effects, and I am grateful that Pollack keeps the tension at a human-sized level. In fact, there is a pervasive old-fashioned feeling about the whole venture perhaps because Pollack has done a similar-feeling thriller back in 1975 called \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" where the protagonist gradually unravels a major conspiracy.<br /><br />In this film, the mystery focuses on the protagonist herself, Silvia Broome, a native of a fictitious African country called Matobo. Working as an interpreter at the United Nations, she accidentally overhears what might be a plot to assassinate Matobo's bloody tyrant, President Edmund Zuwanie, when he is scheduled to address the General Assembly to respond to charges of genocide. Of course, she becomes endangered and is placed in the care of no-nonsense federal agent Tobin Keller, who himself is grieving over the auto accident of his wife two weeks earlier. There are two warring factions wanting to overthrow Zuwanie, and the subplots multiply until the tense and somewhat contrived finale. In his accompanying making-of featurette, Pollack says he was working without a final script in hand with no less than five writers working on the screenplay including Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian. It shows in some of the convolutions of the story that don't hang well together, in particular, the growing attraction between Silvia and Tobin after their convincingly antagonistic battle of principles.<br /><br />With an especially clipped, Afrikaan-sounding accent, Nicole Kidman portrays Silvia effectively as both mystery woman and naïve idealist even when she has to spout some patronizing lines about the value of the UN. She conveys her character's cryptic motivations fluidly as each revelation about her background comes to the fore. However, Roger Ebert and I had the same thought - how much more texturally interesting it could be to have a black actress play Silvia and how Angela Bassett comes to mind. Like a Method-version Bogie, Sean Penn plays Keller in a world-weary manner with moments of teary-eyed vulnerability as he thinks of his wife. It's a good turn by Penn though I feel the role is definitely below his skills, and there is an odd lack of chemistry between him and Kidman that actually works in the movie's favor until the mutual attraction becomes pronounced.<br /><br />The rest of the serviceable cast is given short shrift by the story, including Catherine Keener, who still shows shades of her dry wit and quirky manner as Keller's sympathetic partner, Dot Woods. The real UN locations help considerably in lending authenticity to the story, and other scenes garner the right amount of suspense, such as the what-does-that-mean opening in the soccer stadium and the Brooklyn bus incident where several plot strands come together. Even the fictitious language sounds real even though it was apparently made up as a blend between Swahili and a native language of Mozambique. The ending comes up a bit empty, but the movie does pop and crackle when required.<br /><br />Along with the making-of featurette which is as much about Pollack as it is about the movie, the DVD has several good extras. He is the sole voice on the commentary track and consequently, his informative contributions are separated by many unfortunate dead pauses. There is an alternate ending which is a more pointedly sentimental variation on the one used, and I agree with its excision since it is far more contrived. Three deleted scenes are included of which only one is of interest as it provides an interaction Dot has with Silvia and a predictable revelation. There is also an eight-minute short on theUN and how filming was handled there. Two other shorts offer genuinely interesting insight - the first is a fascinating presentation by Pollack in which he explains the difference between widescreen (which he uses here) and pan-and-scan formats, the second is about how real interpreters work at the UN.ere.

1563899426|5.0|Reading it once based on word of mouth praise assured my place as a Fables fan. The gist is this: all of the characters from fairy tales - Snow White, Jack (of beanstalk fame), the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, Old King Cole, etc. - are real. Their fairyland realm was invaded, though, and 200 years ago they fled to our world. Set in the modern day, all of these characters live in secret in an apartment building in New York City. The first volume has Snow White and the Big Bad Wolf trying to solve a murder case. <br /> <br />How cool is that? <br /> <br />The first volume is set up with Jack (of the beanstalk) coming to the Big Bad Wolf with a case. It seems Rose Red may have been murdered. So the Big Bad Wolf gets Snow White (who essentially runs the fairy characters' apartment building) to help with the investigation, since Rose Red is her sister. <br /> <br />All it took was the first volume for me to be hooked. It was fun trying to pick out the characters from various fairy tales, the art was strong and the writing very good, and the story was fun to follow. It served well as a standalone trade paperback, while also hinting at bigger things going on in the wide world of fairly tale characters in exile. What's really find are the slight twists on the characters; Prince Charming is a real kick, and one of the three pigs is hilarious. One of the opening scenes features Beauty and the Beast in Snow White's office seeking marital advice, and it's a real kick. It's an 'adult' book, though, which makes it extra fun. I give a hearty thumbs up.

0307276902|1.0|I was given a copy of this book by a friend back in November because, after all, it was THE book du jour and she was appalled I hadn't heard of it, much less read it cover to cover multiple times. I picked it up one night and made it through about 10 pages before I threw it to the floor in disgust. The author's style of capitalizing nouns randomly, repeating things over and over, and writing in stilted sentences drove me nuts. Plus, there was a general undertone of self-aggrandizement I didn't care for. The book got kicked under the bed and I didn't think about it again until the stories broke this week about how the author had fabricated almost everything in the book. I hauled my copy back out, brushed off the dust bunnies, and thumbed through it some more (I still couldn't read it all the way through, the style was literally giving me a headache), and thought: the real question is, why did Oprah or anyone else ever think this crap was true?<br /><br />Even as fiction the book beggars belief, but as non-fiction it seems laughable to me that anyone would find Frey's anecdotes even somewhat credible. Have you ever seen anyone who was covered in biohazardous bodily fluids and bleeding freely from an active wound be allowed to board a plane? How many people do you think could be arrested for a list of crimes as long as your arm, including crack possession, and get off with a three-month sentence in a county jail? It just seemed beyond believability for me. Everything seemed hyperdramatized, and I also couldn't figure out how this guy had managed to do such a 180 turnaround on his life in such a short amount of time. That alone would have made me suspect the author's veracity.<br /><br />Even as a work of fiction, I think this book is submediocre. Granted, I am not an addict (although I have known real-life addicts), but I really did fail to see how the story was uplifting or empowering in any way. It may sound strange, but in many ways I was reminded of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho, which was infinitely better written stylistically but the same kind of book - here are some overdramatized, brutally written anecdotes that will totally shock you! Oh, wait, here's some more! Look, here's some REALLY bad stuff! See how disgusting and shocking I can be? Aren't I cool? The main difference being, of course, that Ellis' book was a work of fiction and billed as such, and Frey's wasn't.<br /><br />I don't really have a sense of moral outrage that Frey got away with passing this stuff off as real life. As P.T. Barnum said, there's a sucker born every minute, and I have to give Frey props for convincing his publishers (and Oprah) that this stuff was all real. As I said, that anyone ever thought these anecdotes were even based in reality is the real thing to puzzle over. I think in the case of the Oprah staffers who started frothing at the mouth over the book, there was probably a fair amount of naivete about what real addiction is like, and they probably got sucked into the melodrama so fast they forgot to turn their thinking caps on. But the book should have been billed as nonfiction, all the same. (Although now reports are coming out that Frey shopped the book to many publishers as fiction and only had success getting it published when he started passing it off as a memoir, so I guess maybe he wouldn't have sold as many copies if he had billed the book appropriately.)<br /><br />In any case, if someone read the book, liked it, got some kind of positive message out of it, they shouldn't feel bad about it being fabricated. I have gotten many uplifting messages out of fiction books and the fact that the books were fiction didn't make much difference, it was the difference the books made in my life that really mattered. If you haven't read the book, and want to just for curiosity's sake, do it, but don't expect any kind of revelatory experience.
0307276902|1.0|I finished this book last week, and even before all of this smoking gun talk came on the scene I had a hard time swallowing a lot of this story.  <br /> <br />I have a brother who was an addict so I could relate to a lot of Frey's descriptions of what it's like to be an addict. I also appreciated that there was no denial that he was a drug addict. My problem was the arrogance! This guy portrayed himself as always right. It NEVER stopped. He also portrayed himself as the toughest guy that ever existed. It's like he is still a 23 year old kid who just likes to brag to everyone how tough he was and how no one would ever dare mess with him. You can tell thats how he still demands respect. When he wrote this book it was like he was thinking of who would be playing him in the movie. Whoever the lucky actor is better make sure to say in his Academy Award speech that James Frey is a true inspiration to us all or else Frey will make sure to be there to kick his ass and once again prove how tough of a guy he really is.  <br /> <br />I wanted to go through this journey w/ James Frey and I just realized I could not because he was so closed minded. Great he got through it and I am happy for him, but I found him to be very closed minded and insulting to others, like my brother, who got through his addictions by AA and a higher power. How dare he say that is just replacing another addiction for another?? How dare he judge what has worked for so many others? <br /> <br />Then how ridiculous it is to be on a plane w/ 4 front teeth missing, a huge gash in his cheek, piss, blood, vomit all over himself, how is that possibly allowed no matter what?? Also, root canal and caps in one sitting and no type of medication? Skipping meeting, playing cards in lecture, etc.?? I mean please!  <br /> <br />Addressing Frey's writing style - I was able to get use to that after about 20 pages and really did not have a problem with that. The repition got a little boring boring boring after awhile. <br/> <br />Finally, I was very excited to read this book but was just plain dissappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, I was a fairly devoted fan of Joss Whedon's other well-known shows, both \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\". Yet, I never even knew this fantastic show, \\"Firefly\\", even existed. After taking a leap and purchasing this DVD set (after watching the movie \\"Serenity\\"), I will unabashedly admit that, in my opinion, this show blows Joss' other two completely out of the water. A fantastic theme song (that I just spent time trying to figure out on the acoustic) leads into possibly the greatest sci-fi TV show ever made (apologies to Trek and Galactica fans). Very funny how many actors turned up on this show that were on Joss' other shows. At least he is loyal! Great writing, phenomenal acting, very good special effects for a TV show budget, I will be loaning this DVD set out to everyone I know in the hopes of sharing how great this series is (was). A shame that it lasted only one season, but I am thankful it was released on DVD. Now I own it forever. \\"You can't take the skies from me.\\"
0375751513|4.0|I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.<br /><br />  This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.<br /><br />  If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting,  and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book.eryone should read this book.
B0009O9LWK|3.0|I read Jane Eyre as a child and saw the version on TV--with George C Scott.  There was a pssage in the book that confused me, and I was a little surprised that it was used almost word for word in the movie.  However, it in not in this edition.  I very distinctly remember George C Scott asking Jane if she thought him handsome and when she says no, he stands up and puts a hand on the fireplace and is in profile, then he faces forward still standing---this is where this version of the movie starts that scene and it is very poorly edited at that.  I timed the movie and it lasted the 110 minutes promised.  This (are there others?) missing part was only 15 ---30 seconds.  <br /> <br />However George C Scott is a perfect Mr. Ro..  and the scenes after the non-wedding and before Jane leaves are heartwrenching.  The scenery and Thornefield Hall must have been absolutly gorgeous when shot, because sometimes they are breathtaking even in this poorly restored version.  The music track is awful, but the voices are clear.  The film is too dark.  It almost adds to the despondancy in the orphanage scenes, but it too often where the faces cannot be seen. <br /> <br />It was, and hopefully will be again, an excellent depiction of the classic.
B000002UB6|5.0|OK, I suppose it's not a great as Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, or Rubber Soul.  But I personally think it's more \\"fun\\" to listen to. I wont go through each track, many other reviewers have done that very well already and it ultimately boils down to personal taste.  For example, some people hate Long and Winding Road; others love it.  Additionally, most folks say this is the least-good Beatle Album.  I don't agree - I'd award that to the White Album which would have been a great single disc album, as George Martin wanted.   <br /> <br />If Let It Be is not as good as the first four listed above, why 5 stars?  Well, after all it is the Beatles and this album is better than anything our current artists can muster at all.  If you gave stars on a REAL relative worth scale, the the above-named albums would (from me) get 5 stars and all the other Beatle Albums would get 4.  I wouldn't give a 5 star ratings to any other rock-era albums by ANYBODY.  Remember - we're talking albums here, not individual songs.  The Beatles were, and remain, the only artists who could produce an entire album of worthwhile songs. <br /> <br />On that scale I might generously give 3 stars to a few current artists' but that would be based on individual songs.  Based on entire albums...well, that's why I use Itunes to get the one good song off of current releases. <br /> <br />So, buy this CD and enjoy the Beatles in a more \\"relaxed\\" production mode (even though this session was anything but that career-wise)
B000BYA4JM|5.0|YAY!!!!! From the opening cartoon segment until the last frame, this MADONNA film is a HOOT!!!  The release will again give the 'haters' the opportunity to bash Her Madgesty...but after 20 years the only thing i can come up with is jealousy.  Madonna has nothing to prove....to ANYONE!!!  If you haven't seen this film...avoid the reviews and just watch it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  The 'Girl' has great comic timing.  She LOOKS FAAABulous.  The story's cute and the Madonna songs, for those of you who didn't know her material prior to the 90's critically acclaimed stuff, will find it quite enjoyable and maybe seek out OTHER early stuff...to find out first hand what all the fuss, BEYOND THE HEADLINES, was all about. <br />There's a lot of garbage thrown at us, hidden behind the guise of 'SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER'.  'Who's That Girl' isn't Citizen Kane, Fargo or even The 40 Year Old Virgin...but it IS funny, charming and a GREAT reminder, once seen, that MADONNA isn't bashed for anything in particular that she's done...but for just the mere fact that she's MADONNA.  There are clearly better ways to spend your time...but if you have any free...spend it with Nicki Finn...unless you're interested in jumping the 'Malign Madonna' bandwagon, you'll be glad you did.  'WHO'S THAT GIRL?, INDEED!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this CD!  It's an interesting & unique blend of rock and classical-like music.  I love the locals- her voice is emotional & soulful.
B000BMSU68|5.0|The 5 stars is only in direct relation to what's ON this 'Bueller...Bueller...\\" edition and the film ITSELF.  Would it have been soooooo difficult to transfer the old commentary from the bare bones edition of the film from 1999?  It's a good thing i noticed before i sold it back to my local FYE for credit on the future purchase of what....maybe the THIRD release of FERRIS?  Now i have to find a way to put the old dvd in the case with the new edition taking care not to scratch either.  Too much time and energy on my part.  THAT'S YOUR JOB, PARAMOUNT!!!!!!  Where's the notoriously cut scene with the bong hit???  No out-takes??  I find that hard to believe.  A great feel good film with some good bonus features leaves me hoping i don't get hit by a bus before they release the 25th anniversary edition in 2011.  When PARAMOUNT will 'ONE UP' their usual DOUBLE DIPPING into fans' pockets with the DOUBLE DISC version this film originally deserved....  Okay...if you're a fan...just buy the damn thing because it's a must have for your film library and what IS included is pretty darn good...but there should've been more...and i KNOW there IS more...  C'mon...someone with brains at Paramount...SAVE FARRIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000003TAL|5.0|I'll admit---for most of my adolescence I avoided Sonic Youth's albums---I thought that the music was so unaccessible I wouldn't be able to appreciate it. Now that I'm older (twenty-eight) and I understand that there's more to rock and roll than addictive riffs and guitar-smashing, I decided to give myself a chance. I chose Daydream Nation because it's the band's most well-known recording, at the top of all the critics' lists. Well, that's not the best reason to buy a record, but who cares? <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"Daydream\\" is a darn good album, and one of the best I have in my collection. Rather than have fourteen hard-rocking joints that stand apart separately, all the tracks fit together as a nonlinear whole. Every aspect of the music---from the lyrics to the walls of sound generated by guitar feedback---references key historical moments in popular culture. Listeners of this album will realize the immense influence that SY has had on popular music; we can recognize countless DIY punk and mainstream \\"grunge\\" bands' riffs in songs like \\"'Cross the Breeze\\" and \\"Hey Joni.\\" <br /> <br />In their twenty-plus year career, SY has offered a major challenge to both musicians and audiences when it comes to expression over form. Their songs may lack the \\"verse-chorus-verse\\" (to paraprase Mr. Kurt D. Cobain) structure required for mainstream popularity, but I think that SY triumphs in expressing the deepest thoughts and emotions that human beings have. \\"Kissability\\" (sung by Kim Gordon) is a perfect example of this; although it sounds like an ironically happy indie song, its sharp critique of the exploitation and cynicism in the movie business comes across loud and clear. <br /> <br />More experienced listeners of SY may recommend other records as better Sonic Youth first albums, but I'll go ahead here and say that Daydream Nation is an excellent place to start.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble outshines all the original song performers. This album is awesome.
B0002Y4TM4|1.0|WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO THESE GUYS.ONE WORD DESCRIBES THIS.SUCK!!!!!!SLOW AND REPETITIVE..BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT..
B00005U122|5.0|This is Roger Waters and team at their best.  I absolutely love this video.  I am have been attending the concerts of both Waters and Gilmour (and Pink Floyd) since the mid-70s.  These guys are true professionals and I have never been let down. <br /> <br />The team he assembled for this concert is, without doubt, one of the best I have ever seen.  The editing is wonderful, the music is great and quality is high.  I recommend this to anyone who is a Pink Floyd and/or Roger Waters fan.  Don't hesitate, do yourself a favor and just buy it.
B000005DSN|4.0|Yep indeed, a concerted head bang from all around. This album won so many converts to the Stratovarius cause it's just not funny. Polished lyrically and production wise with more grunt under the bonnet than most of this bands product. Stuff like Kiss of Judas and Black Diamond - this stuff is just quality with even Classic Rock mag calling the latter track 'Teeth Rattling'. And that's not a mag that is a fan of Stratovarius style music.<br /><br />This is the album to get in order to be acquainted with this fine band from finland.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Gilmour is great and the team delivers a great show.  The DVD is well done and has many great features.  If you like Pink Floyd and/or David Gilmour, get this one.  I won't go into details on the DVD, others have. <br /> <br />I am an aspiring Pink Floyd style guitarist.  This DVD is loaded with close ups of Gilmour and his supporting members playing.  I have been able to figure out much from his excellent accoustic renderings - both of classic material and newer songs.
B000BJS4TO|3.0|Problem for us is not so much the quality of Williams's score or the playing of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzahk Perleman. <br /> <br />The actual film uses lots of Japanese music and even the Andrews Sisters. None of these appears on this album. Too bad the film isn't a bigger hit, or we might have seen a \\"volume two\\" with those pieces included.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I began listening to Neil Young when I was a teenager, some thirty years ago.  Back then people would say, \\"I guess that David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash are giving Young a break.\\"  They would then go on to muse about his \\"weird\\" or \\"mediocre\\" voice while praising his abilities as a songwriter.  Then as now, there is one fact that must be taken into consideration here: Neil Young is great, not only because the words make so much sense, but because he brings a unique sound to the table as well.<br /><br />With PRAIRE WIND, the argument seemingly continues. When I have shared it with my friends the usual comment is, \\"Wow! Why does he sound like that?\\" And the astonishing answer is, inevitably, because he is an artist and has determined his medium of expression and sticks with it.<br /><br />Think of it in these terms.  What if everyone painted like Norman Rockwell or Rembrandt or Winslow Homer?  I think that we might agree that it would be a pretty drab world.  But then here comes Vincent Van Gogh and people begin to wonder why he draws and paints the way he does.  Some might say, \\"Brilliant subjects poorly executed!\\"  and they would be wrong.<br /><br />The same holds true for Neil Young and his splendid offering in PRAIRIE WIND.  The classic Young sound is there with songs like \\"Painter,\\" \\"This Old Guitar,\\" and, my album favorite, \\"No Wonder.\\"  Spectacular guitar work here with the voice like none other.<br /><br />Of course variety is the spice of life and there is absolutely no end to what you can find in the world of music.  So, if Neil Young is not your bag...well...leave Neil Young to those of us who love and understand his music and kindly move along and try the next guy.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B0007GAEGC|5.0|These women are incredible.  I had never heard of them before my boyfriend got me tickets for our anniversery to see them in concert.  He had seen the show on PBS and was blown away. I went to the concert unsure of what to expect.  I had no words to describe how I felt when I came out. They met my expectations and far exceeded them.  I am a complete fan.  I got the CD and was equally blown away.  The only thing that was disappointing to me is that this is the only one from them as a group.  I believe each of the women have a CD out but I have yet to hear them.  Those are my next purchases. I am certain that I will be equally impressed.
B000007MVM|5.0|The Madcap Laughs, the amazing solo album of the true genius and patriarch of Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett, is an astounding mix of sheer genius on the part of Barrett. I don't care what some of the novice listeners of this album may say, Barrett's mix of, at times, surrealist psychadelica and times of straight ahead folk rock merely show the range and breadth of this maddened genius' poetic expanse. I highly recommend this album to anyone wishing to deepen their music collection and their knowledge and love for this amazing musician and outright overlooked genius of the early days of rock music.  <br /> <br />BE SURE TO LISTEN TO THE TRACKS: <br />OCTOPUS <br />LONG GONE <br />DARK GLOBE and <br />NO MAN'S LAND
1400031087|1.0|* The author has a, let's say, \\"unique\\" writing style. I'd suggest finding a passage, or three, and reading them. Who knows, you might find his style sufficiently engaging, creative, or novel enough to  enjoy. As you can likely guess, I was not a fan.<br /><br />* Speaking of \\"novel,\\" your knowledge of a single critical thing about this book will forever color your perception of it: It is almost entirely false. A number of websites have touched on this issue far better than I could hope to, but just bear in mind that this book is a novel, not a memoir.<br /><br />* This book was written, it would appear, in an effort to make the reader cry as much as possible. Relentless attempts to make me like a character only to kill him off didn't suit my tastes, but you may find it enjoyable.
B00005OCMR|4.0|In 1982, we were given a glimpse into the soul of the computer, a view into cyberspace that was known only to a small handful of pioneering programmers. Twenty-three years later, Tron was clearly a brilliant film, far ahead of its time and showing a world that makes only more sense as technology progresses further.<br /><br />Tron is a story of independence in the world of the computer. Two primary characters struggle for freedom in the world of electrons. The first is Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who works from inside the system, developing a program called Tron-a security program to monitor contact between systems and to put a stop to unauthorized connections. The second is Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a brilliant programmer whose work-a series of video games that became a big hit when brought to market-was stolen by a greedy insider called Ed Dillinger (David Warner). Dillinger's program, a system-wide command-and-control program called the Master Control Program (MCP) operated as did Dillinger, by annexing others' work that would be useful and destroying everything else. Designed to run independently, Tron would stand in the way of the MCP's unauthorized intrusions and annexations.<br /><br />When Flynn crosses the MCP in an effort to reconstruct the evidence to show that Dillinger stole his work, the MCP uses a molecular transportation system to bring Flynn out of the real world and into the world on the other side of the screen. Working in cyberspace, Flynn works with Tron and a small cast of supporters to bring down the MCP and return freedom to the system.<br /><br />Being only nine years old when it was released, I didn't first see the movie in the theater. Four years later, I was somehow familiar with the movie and had some idea that it was one that I wanted to see-though I cannot remember whether it was for the first time. My parents were invited to a card party on the evening it was to be broadcast on local television and somehow or other, my siblings and I were also expected to go. To ensure that I would not miss the movie, I procured a videocassette tape and programmed the family's VCR to record the movie in my absence. When we arrived at the party, my siblings and I followed our parents through the process of making greetings. As the host tried to convince my father to remove his necktie (apparently having some objection to a man dressing properly for a social event), we children were directed to a separate part of the home where we'd not be likely to interfere with the heavy-duty card playing that would be taking place on the main floor. Finding an obliging television that would allow me to watch the movie even as it was being recorded at home, I really had no objection to being temporarily sequestered downstairs. I still have the videotape, complete with stupid commercials, and it is not in good condition.<br /><br />Tron shows computers and their programs as being far more than cold, simple tools configured to improve efficiency in various business functions. It shows the world of computing from inside of the machine, where programs bear critical characteristics to their creators and interact with each other in a complex electronic world in an attempt to carry out the wishes of their users.<br /><br />The film reflects a vision of computing that has been described by such pioneering programmers as Alan Kay-for whom the movie's Alan character is named, who saw the world as full of small computing devices that people would have all around them, and whose programs would work as agents that would be sure that people had access to the information that mattered to them whenever they wanted it. These were radical ideas in 1982 and it was by no means clear that people would ever understand this vision of the future. Now firmly into the twenty-first century, we can see that this is indeed just what computer technology is all about. Others were more focused on immediate problems of data processing, estimating the total worldwide market for computers would be something like six, asking why in the world anyone would ever want a computer at home, or otherwise failing to see computing beyond the set of stuff that could be made, marketed, and sold in the immediate future. In a late-evening argument between Dillinger and Dr. Walter Gibbs, the technologist who founded the company that employs them all, these competing philosophies of computing were presented.<br /><br />  Dillinger: I can't worry about every user request that comes in here.<br /><br />  Gibbs: User requests are what computers are for!<br /><br />  Dillinger: Doing our business is what computers are for!<br /><br />Central to telling the story was the characters and their dealings with one another. Tron is a no-nonsense program, dedicated to the commission he was given by his user, Alan, himself a quiet, slightly awkward, analytical professional programmer. Flynn is brilliant and jovial (\\"Now how are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems?\\" Flynn asks the MCP). Flynn continues his work with or without sanction, unafraid of those who would call him a renegade. When brought into the world of the computer, he uses his insights and power to do what must be done-and that which cannot be seen or executed by the programs incapable of seeing beyond the options handed to them by another. (\\"I hate to disappoint you, but that's the way it is most of the time for users, too,\\" he tells Tron and Laura's program Yori.)<br /><br />Laura (Cindy Morgan) is another programmer at Encom. Her life's work is the laser that they're using to digitize matter, suspend it, and reassemble it at will. It's her work and her laser that the MCP uses to bring Flynn into the world of digits. She's smart and prizes intelligence in others around her; she's loyal to her friends and she can assert herself when the need arises. Yori reflects all of these traits, aligning herself and her work Tron just as Laura aligns herself and her work with Alan.<br /><br />Walter is the gray-bearded sage who founded the company but rather than spending time in the executive suite, he spends his time in the laboratory, building things. His counterpart in the world of the computer is Dumat, the guardian of the I/O (Input/Output) Tower that the system needs to communicate with the world of users.<br /><br />Dillinger is greedy and unprincipled, doing whatever he believes necessary to achieve his objectives without regard to his impact on others. He originally created the Master Control Program, which came to mirror his personality and began its process of acquisition that made it smarter and more powerful still. His counterpart in the machine is not the MCP itself but Sark, a program that the MCP uses to oversee all of the functions of other programs in the computer. As the story unfolds, we see that Dillinger is not as powerful as he is believed; like Sark, he has become an agent of the MCP. (\\"You wouldn't want me to read up Flynn's file on a VDT at the Times, now, would you?\\" threatens the MCP when Dillinger tries to assert some authority over it.)<br /><br />What I was able to see through the characters of Flynn, Alan, Laura, and Walter is that there are people who need to think up the things that computers can do and then figure out how to do it. A year or so later, I would come across Steven Levy's Hackers and learn about some of the real people represented through the characters shown on-screen. By this time, I was already a programmer and often found myself far ahead of most of my classmates when it came to making the machines do interesting things.<br /><br />As my final year of high school drew to a close, I spent some time thinking about operating systems and decided that if I really wanted to know how they worked, I was going to need to do more than use operating system made by others. I had already done quite a lot with getting Apple Computer's ProDOS 8 and ProDOS 16 to behave accordingto my wishes instead of their usual specifications. I decided that I wanted to understand how to make multiuser systems like those mysterious Unix systems that I was learning about. After high school graduation, I set about building my own operating system. Using a strange Apple DOS 3.3 implementation modified for use on my Apple IIGS 800kB 3.5-inch floppy disks called AmDOS as my filesystem and interface to hardware, I wrote a shell program that allowed the user to enter commands for the computer and to launch programs. Once the shell was working, I created a new program that would prompt the user for a username and password; a successful combination would cause a specified program-in practice, the shell I wrote, but could really be anything-to be executed and failure would simply begin the authentication procedure anew, tersely displaying LOGON: before waiting for input from the user. I called my shell the Master Control Program and designed the user interface to appear like screens that appeared in the movie.<br /><br />My high school vocational training in data processing on IBM System/36 systems to write programs in OCL, BASIC, RPG II, and COBOL showed little regard for the human side of computing. It was all business and about as boring as can be. Fortunately, by then I had discovered The Network, such as it was at the time, and came to be acquainted with people who were then wired. That was the group that had vision, that was making something because of a higher calling, the sort of imperative that would drive creation-the same sort of calling that was heard by Newton, Leonardo, and Archimedes. The mundane matter of how to get paid was, at most, a secondary consideration. In that world, imagination was prized, as was technical skill. Those who would succeed would need to have plenty of both. In this meritocracy, degrees, certifications, and institutional affiliation were irrelevant. What mattered was the work.<br /><br />Tron was far ahead of its time; released fifteen years later it might well have become a blockbuster, though by then, much of what was being presented was becoming the obvious conclusion to the adoption of all of the technology around us. It's unlikely that I would have gone in some other direction but for the film; I had already written some simple computer programs by the time I was nine and did independently find many other avenues into the world where creativity and technology intersected. Even so, the film was prescient at the time of its release and helped to influence my ideas about computing and what was possible. If you want to understand what's happening inside of your computer, my advice is to begin by watching Tron.ra aligns herself and her work with Alan. <br /> <br />Walter is the gray-bearded sage who founded the company but rather than spending time in the executive suite, he spends his time in the laboratory, building things.

That was the group that had vision, that was making something because of a higher calling, the sort of imperative that would drive creation-the same sort of calling that was heard by Newton, Leonardo, and Archimedes. The mundane matter of how to get paid was, at most, a secondary consideration. In that world, imagination was prized, as was technical skill. Those who would succeed would need to have plenty of both. In this meritocracy, degrees, certifications, and institutional affiliation were irrelevant. What mattered was the work. <br /> <br />Tron was farahead of its time; released fifteen years later it might well have become a blockbuster, though by then, much of what was being presented was becoming the obvious conclusion to the adoption of all of the technology around us. It's unlikely that I would have gone in some other direction but for the film; I had already written some simple computer programs by the time I was nine and did independently find many other avenues into the world where creativity and technology intersected. Even so, the film was prescient at the time of its release and helped to influence my ideas about computing and what was possible. If you want to understand what's happening inside of your computer, my advice is to begin by watching Tron.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano star in this sexy thriller about the workings of the Chicago mafia.  Jennifer Tilly stars as Violet, a mob girlfriend desperate for a new life. Joe Pantoliano stars as Caesar, a money launderer for the mob, and he's also Violet's boyfriend.  Gina Gershon stars as Corky, a tough lesbian ex-con who moves into the apartment next door to Violet and Caesar.   <br /> <br />Corky, Violet, and Caesar meet on the elevator to their building, and the sparks fly between Corky and Violet.  Determined to act on her impulses, Violet hatches a plan to seduce Corky.  Unsure about Violet's motives at first, Corky soon finds herself in bed with Violet.  Soon afterward, Violet tells Corky about Caesar and his mob dealings.  She also tells her how she wants to get out of mob life and live \\"happily ever after\\" (presumably with Corky). <br /> <br />Corky listens intently and soon finds out that a $2 million shipment in mob money is scheduled to arrive at Violet and Caesar's apartment.  The two women decide to steal the money for themselves, but make it look like Caesar somehow lost the money while forcing him to run away from the other members of the mob. <br /> <br />Their plan stars off exactly as planned, but along the way, many things go wrong, and in the end, Corky and Violet must fight for their very survival.  Will their plan succeed?  Will they be together in the end? <br /> <br />This is an excellent film.  The performances by Gershon and Tilly are very good, but Joe Pantoliano's performance as the small-time thug and money launderer Caesar is superb.  Tilly's and Gershon's love scenes together are very provocative as well.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story is well-conceived, and the plot twists will keep you guessing throughout.  If you're a fan of great mafia movies that have beautiful and sexy women to look at, then this movie is definitely one you don't want to miss.

B0009MAP90|1.0|Dylan is great, Sony is not . . . DO NOT BUY THIS CD if you intend to play it on your computer. It's one more example of global corporate hurbis gone amok. I love Dylan, love this album (his first). But Sony's Columbia Records division decided in their \\"blind wisdom\\" to illegally embed code in some of their digital recordings so that they could not be duplicated.<br /><br />I bought this CD to upload into iTunes to play on my iPod, but Sony's illegal code prevented my computer (PowerBook 12\\" laptop) from even recognizing the disc. These days, I listen to music almost exclusively via iTunes or my iPod. So this CD is useless to me.<br /><br />Amazon's customer service has been good. They replaced my first copy of this CD (in case it was just a lemon) within a couple of days, but the replacement CD fared no better.<br /><br />I understand that Sony (under pressure, and sensitivity to bad PR) have stopped embedding the hidden code. But they have not recalled all their corrupted CDs. Amazon should work with Sony/Columbia to identify which CDs have the illegal code, and remove them from sale-or, at the very least, in the product description identify which CDs have the Sony code.

0307276902|1.0|It's true. If anyone didn't catch the article in the NY times today, then check out thesmokinggun.com for a summary of the lies in this book. Here's a real bed-wetter to start you off.  <br /> <br />The big part in the book, the arrest for running over a cop and a bunch of other charges is complete bull. First off, two of the charges he says he was slammed with, \\"malicious mayhem\\" and something having to do with driving under the influence DIDN'T EXIST WHEN THIS GUY SAYS HE WAS ARRESTED! Plus, I find it a little suspicious that the author had all court records relating to his cases destroyed. Convenient coincidence? I THINK NOT! Read this article and prepare to have your confidence in this guy shot full of holes.  <br /> <br />And, oh, by the way. AT LEAST HAVE A DISCLAIMER SAYING THAT YOU EXXAGERATED ELEMENTS OF YOUR LIFE! I hate liars who get rich when they hit the jackpot. <br /> <br />Update- 1-28-06 <br />On last thursday's show of Oprah, Oprah actually kicked \\"A million little pieces\\" off of her book club. And, for the icing on the cake, even got Jamesy to admit the extent of his lies. From now on, the book will be published with a disclaimer. <br />Kudos to Oprah and the smoking gun for exposing and disgracing this liar.
074325144X|5.0|One reviewer describes herself as a casual runner and says she feels this book is only for serious runners, but I disagree. I'm also a casual runner (a few runs of 3-5 miles each per week), and I have some minor issues with my back and hips. I've found the book very helpful in keeping my hips, pelvis, and back more steady and stable when I run. I was usually at the chiropractor every few months or so when something would slip a little out of whack, but after just a cursory read of this book and applying a few of the principles, I didn't go back to the doctor for several months. (Of course, consult with your own doctor.) I was also experiencing some burn-out, but this book has given me new focus, and now I'm considering trying a half-marathon just to see if I could finish.<br /><br />I think most runners, serious or not, will find new ways to think about posture and form in this book. The author is an ultra-marathoner and claims to have been injury-free for several years, so I had to see what that was about. I haven't been disappointed. Anyone participating in any sport should be thinking about correct form, and this book offers an excellent approach. I remain a casual runner (despite my flirtation with the upcoming half-marathon), but now I'm a more confident casual runner.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first heard of \\"Firefly\\" when I got the series on DVD for Christmas last month. It is FANTASTIC!<br /><br />I don't watch TV a whole lot, and totally missed this show when it aired. I saw the movie Serenity which piqued my interest, and when I watched this series I was BLOWN AWAY. The casting is phenomenal, the writing is great and the acting is top notch! These characters & actors have endeared themselves to me in a way that no other series has. When I started watching, I couldn't stop until the series was done.<br /><br />Get this series for yourself, and get a few extras for a friend or family member. You will not regret it!
B000002AP1|5.0|I've had this one on CD for about a year and a half, and on vinyl for about a half-year, and they both just never get old. the sound is so intoxicating and filled with energy. Every song is awesome, especially \\"Search and Destroy.\\" I've listened to that one about two hundred times and shivers always go down my spine at Iggys climactic scream at the end. Though that is my favorite, every other song on this album is a close second. The guitar is so unique, fuzzed out and dirty sounding. And nobody comes close to mimicking Iggy Pops raw and energetic vocal style. For some reason, I always love to listen to this album when I'm really tired. The first side gets my mind in to action and sharpens my senses, and when I'm about to crash from exhaustion, the haunting five minute \\"I Need Somebody\\" hypnotizes me into a coma. But its not over yet, because the last two songs come at me like a slap in the face telling me to wake up and hear the carnage.  <br /> <br />The CD and the vinyl are both good, but some people might like one or the other better. Though some think the remaster on CD is crap, I think it adds some extra distortion for a thicker sound, which is always good in my book. The lead guitar does fade back a bit, but its definitely not overpowered. The vinyl has a thinner rhythm sound, which brings out the lead guitar and vocals. In my opinion, you should own both if you really want to make an educated decision on what you like, but I personally could have survived without the vinyl, even though it is decent. I guarantee you one thing, that if you like punk or raw and energetic rock of any kind, you'll love this album, and all the rest of The Stooges albums for that matter.
0452282152|4.0|I picked this book up at a library book sale and what a bargain. I lost two nights sleep to finish it. The story is of the girl in the famous 17th century painting \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" by Johannes Vermeer.  We meet Griet when she goes to work in Vermeer's home at the age of 16, resulting from hardship in her own family. She works through unimaginable heartache for two years, all while struggling to maintain order in her newly complicated life.<br /><br />I noted elements of Jane Eyre, Rebecca & other coming-of-age Victorian heroin novels - hints at insanity in the house, an older master to a sensual young girl, evil lurking in every corner, etc. - and all very well done.<br /><br />Chevalier has managed to reproduce the mysterious ambiance of the painting - its depth, rich colors and haunting glow of the girls' face, all while weaving a fascinating story. Like Griet, the reader is innocently ensnared by Vermeer and his extended family.  It is as if you are studying the actual portrait. I was bewitched by Griet's complexity and timeless beauty, but also Vermeer's grey eyes. The overall effect is mesmerizing!  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't like the ending that much; otherwise, the book is absolutely PERFECT.<br /><br />I will now look for more of Chevalier's books. As for the bad reviews below, I honestly don't get it. This is not a trite distraction. Buy the book and give it your full attention! Enjoy!
1591396190|1.0|This book is mostly \\"fluff\\". Its basic argument is that companies who find themselves in hotly contested markets (\\"red oceans\\") should look for uncontested markets (\\"blue oceans\\"). They should do it in such a way as to ensure revenues (so go for mass), and profit (so watch the cost). Wow. I guess if the authors said: go for high-cost-small-markets, at least it will be original! The problem with this book is that it is a mishmash of old ideas, and its mortal sin is that it is trivial. It looks at successful products and service offerings, and in retrospect identifies the characteristics that made them succeed (at least revenue wise, there is no real financial analysis in this book). Naturally, finding those characteristics is the real issue, and it is the realm of entrepreneurial vision. Beyond some trivial labels placed on common sense planning activities, Blue Ocean does not help one iota in finding uncontested markets with large profit potential. Anyone who seriously tries to apply the ideas in the book will find they are either trivial or fluff.<br /><br />The lack of originality is everywhere. Let's look closer: The book main point is that companies must do different things than competitors to be in uncontested markets. Fans of Michael Porter will immediately recognize this as the theme of his seminal 1996 article \\"What is Strategy\\" (go to [...] to buy this article).  Interestingly enough, Kim and Mauborgne published their first work on value innovation in...yes, 1997. Porter identified three bases for successful strategies: need-based, variety-based, and access-based. Unlike the authors of Blue Ocean, he did not pretend to have an a priori formula for finding success. All he did was to show what makes a superior strategy, and why superior strategies are sustainable over a long period of time. Kim and Mauborge wrote a \\"formula\\" type prescription to finding quick success (by avoiding competition), but they neither truly give any tools to do so, nor prove that the companies they feature have created a sustainable profitable advantage. What the authors say is: focus, diverge and have a great marketing tagline. In other words - you want to be different? Be different. And how do you know which different to be? Ahhh, that's simple. Look at what customers and noncustomers need but do not get from the existing offering of the incumbents in the industry. Wow. Who would have thought about that?<br /><br />The main tool of this book, the strategy canvas, is nothing more than an after the fact simplified two dimension graphical presentation of product or services' characteristics that make some products better than others. Do you remember the Quality Deployment Function, a product/service design matrix that came out of Japan, developed in the 80s by the Japanese consultant Yoji Akao? The QFD framework has been used by Japanese companies for decades now to translate \\"true\\" (and often unmet and unstated) customer needs into actions and designs to build and deliver a quality product. QDF also came with a little graphic help, but more sophisticated than the one in this book. Finding which characteristics will be the wining ones is an old market research goal, and it is much easier in retrospect.<br /><br />The authors are not beyond copying any once popular simple concept. In chapter 4 they introduce with a big fanfare a revolutionary new concept, classifying businesses as Pioneers, Migrators, or Settlers. Anyone recognizing Boston Consulting Group's portfolio matrix of cash cow, question mark and star companies is not wrong. This simplistic labeling is what made BCG so popular (and destroyed many companies and made Wall Street discount conglomerates in the US) and probably why this book has attracted people desperately looking for simple solutions in complicated contested markets. But anyone actually responsible for charting strategy and managing competition in real contestable markets (i.e., business managers and executives) will quickly realize this book has no practical substance. It is all fluff. And if you are lucky to create a less contested market, this book will tell you nothing about how to KEEP it that way!<br /><br />Finally, as a strategy professional, I realized quickly that this book is not really about strategy, which as Porter shows is a whole chain of operational activities geared toward the different positioning. This book is better titled \\"a book of lists of some successful products and services in the past 20 years, plus some trivial labels of where they were unique\\" because once you see beyond the superficial façade of the \\"value innovation process\\", this is what the book is all about: a list of some successful new products, created by companies and entrepreneurs who had the insight of how to be different. An insight as enigmatic after reading the book as it is before...<br /><br />To apply the book's measure of \\"blue ocean innovation\\", it is not divergent from past books, nor focused on the real issues to justify its price. It does have a catchy tagline though, and like all quick fads, tagline is everything... I feel sorry for my hassled executive friends who are under severe pressure to compete and are hoping this book will help. It will not.ll quickly realize this book has no practical substance.

0385507755|1.0|I suppose the manuscript was checked by facts people in the publisher's office, because the story just doesn't sound true to me, it's just way over the top.  Having been a part of the the world Frey describes (although not anywhere the degree he \\"says\\" he was in), I don't see it happening and he has taken wild liberties with the \\"truth\\" if any of it is the truth.  Such as it is, read as a piece of fiction, it is pretty bad and comes off as really horrible Hemingway stuff.
B000056JYC|3.0|While this is a fairly good record, I just don't get why it receives all of the praise it gets.  \\"The Allman Brothers Live At The Fillmore East\\", \\"One More From the Road\\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and \\"The Who Live at Leeds\\" are three of the live records that are better.  Even the live Humble Pie record that Frampton was on leaves this in the dust.  I've had this recording in some form (LP, CD) since it was released and it seldom finds it's way to my play list.  As I said earlier this is a fairly good record but the best live record ever, PLEASE!

I really hope they make a sequel to this, because there are lots other things that could be done.  Like making the T-1 able not just travel through time, but actually control it.

B00005JOIF|4.0|In \\"Munich\\", Steven Spielberg has given us a very good film.  One that is both a gripping action thriller as well as a provocative examination of the morality of violence and vengeance.<br /><br />The setting is Munich, 1972 in the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes.  But the topic is as timely as yesterday's news: How do free societies respond to terrorist attacks without regressing to the type of values and tactics they are supposedly fighting against.<br /><br />The film begins with a graphic re-creation of the kidnapping of the Israeli athletes.  The scenes of the athletes' initial struggle against their captors are gripping.  And archival TV news reports are intertwined in the action to make it all seem very realistic.  When it's over, we feel the horror and outrage that Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir must have felt that day.  So when she reluctantly approves a secret mission to hunt down and kill those who had a hand in planning the terrorist attack, we understand.<br /><br />The movie follows the team of Israeli agents brought together for this task as they go about the business of finding and killing the people whose names they've been given.  At first, they are driven by a strong sense of righteousness, and they equate their acts of vengeance with justice.  But with each successful assassination, we see the Israelis grow more uncomfortable with their actions as they begin to question their assignment.<br /><br />Spielberg has taken great pains to humanize the Israeli agents.  They are portrayed not as the cold-blooded, efficient killers we might expect from Israel's elite Mossad, but rather a rag-tag collection of what seem like ordinary men conscripted into their nation's service.  Killing does not come easily to them, and their initial actions seem tentative and sometimes humorously amateurish.  In this way, viewers will relate to them as they struggle with the moral dimensions of their assignment and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />In true Hitchkock-like style, the killings are not easy.  Fate often intervenes with the assassination plans, causing difficulty for the agents and suspense for the audience.  To make matters more unsettling, the Palestinian targets are also humanized, and, one could claim,  sentimentalized.  When we first meet target #1, we see a kindly old man reading poetry.  When the Israelis catch up to him, he has just purchased some milk and exchanged pleasantries with the store owner.  Killing him seems so far removed from the horrors of Munich, and so unnecessary.  Other targets seem similarly unworthy of the fate in store for them.<br /><br />In short, Munich is not a Charles Bronson film.  While it is entertaining in its action and suspense, we feel no satisfaction in the vengeance and neither do most of the Israelis in the film.  Spielberg wants us to feel the seeming futility and emptiness of the retribution, just as the Israeli's do.  And yet, their actions remain necessary.  For those who are tempted to conclude that violence is not the answer, as some of the younger Israelis in the film start to believe, there are older Israelis to remind them- and us- that Israel's creation and continued existence relies on their willingness to fight for it, and against an enemy that has no hesitation about using violence.<br /><br />Some have criticized Munich for portraying a moral equivalence between Israeli and Palestinian violence.  I don't think this is so.  In fact, the film is about the interaction between three distinct moral approaches to violence.  The first, represented by the Palestinian terrorists, sees violence as a strategy toward an end.  For them, the more heinous and barbaric the act, the more likely they believe it will help them achieve their goal.  The Israelis, on the other hand, represent Judeo-Christian values of respecting life and avoiding harm to innocents.  In fact, the film shows us how the Israeli agents go to great lengths to avoid killing anyone not on their list.  One of the agents complains about the futility of this, since for every person they have carefully targeted and killed, the Palestinians respond by wantonly killing dozens more.  And there is a third approach, the mercenary, represented in the film by various European characters, mostly a strange family of French informants, who seem to care little about who is killing whom or why, as long as they can profit from it.<br /><br />Munich succeeds in unsettling us and making us think, but in the end, the film reflects what we already know: that there are no easy answers.  That the things we hold dear must sometimes be fought for and defended against, but that in our actions, we must take care that we neither lose to the enemy nor lose ourselves.i agents go to great lengths to avoid killing anyone not on their list.

B0000844MR|1.0|I grew up watching Labyrinth, and wanted to be the character of Sarah, which is why I felt such a loyalty to it whenever my boyfriend suggested we watch this. There was something that never really seemed to appeal to me. I honestly don't know what it was, but it just seemed like one of those totally weird movies. (Maybe I would say that NOW about Labyrinth if I hadn't seen it from a very young age?)<br /><br />One of the reasons I felt about the film, was there was absolutely no human interest in it. There was no Jennifer Connolly or David Bowie, it was just really strange looking characters, and some really scary characters. Would it have been better if there was more human interest? Well, my boyfriend loves this movie, so there must be something good about it I'm not getting.<br /><br />I switched it off after nearly 20 minutes, simply because something just wasn't right. It took quite a bit to actually press the off button, I felt so bad about it, because it had taken me a couple of years to actually get round to watching it. And then I was disappointed. But as soon as it started, I had this feeling I wasn't going to like it? Why? Because the narrator had the most irritating voice ever!!! He was so monotone, and literally gave me the chills. And then the crystal wasn't actually dark, it was more purply in colour. But the characters were hideous. They weren't that bad in Labyrinth, but there was something about them that gave me a serious case of the heebie jeebies. I have to say, what little I saw of the skeksis, I found them very scary, and the lead guy dying ... Brrrrrrrr! Something I won't forget in a hurry.<br /><br />I'm still holding onto the fact I might have enjoyed it more if I'd seen it when I was younger. And of course, it looks like I'm gonna be the only person to say this film wasn't that great. I apologise now for not liking it, and hope I'll be forgiven at some point. :) Now can I have an adult version of Labyrinth?
B0000CABBW|5.0|I stumbled onto this movie and was very suprised it was such a touching story.  The classic story of the old ways clashing with the new.  The leader that trys to fight the decline of hte old ways and fails to see that his granddaughter is special.<br /><br />The move is shot in the village that is the home of the legond of Paikea.  Beautiful scenery and great shots of the Southern Right Whales.<br /><br />The soundtrack is very good and really adds to the movie.<br /><br />I have to mention that I am always impressed by people that have no acting experience and take you through a great story.  Keisha Castle-Hughes does a excellent job in her role.  What is also interesting is the fact that she is a decendent of Paikea.<br /><br />The extras are intresting.  There are deleted scenes to which I am sorry they were cut.  They are worth a watch.<br /><br />Overall this is a movie that you will not get tired of watching.  I might add it peeked my curiosity to learn about the Maori.
B00000JRTX|3.0|After the death of Charlotte Coleman, who played the wonderfully eccentric Scarlett in this movie, it seems appropriate to watch this movie purely for her. She did a lot of different TV stuff, this was really one of her only films, and she steals the show from bigger stars such as Hugh Grant.<br /><br />You know there's going to be a sad moment in this film, when there's \\"funeral\\" in the title, and it's the best moment in the entire film, it works, and it's so sad at the same time. John Hannah is also excellent in this film, and is not overly camp, despite what other reviewers may think.<br /><br />I really don't like many of the characters in this, but seem to enjoy the film for some strange reason. I mainly hate Hugh Grant's & Kristin Scott Thomas's characters, and Andie McDowell's character is just a pain in the neck. This woman cannot act, even in those Loreal adverts that she does. Her lines are delivered in a monotone voice, with no emotion whatsoever. Rowan Atkinson as the nervous first time priest, is an absolute hoot, complete with messing up his lines (\\"awful wedded wife\\", or \\"holy goat\\" for \\"holy ghost\\"), being unable to say the bride & groom's name, and generally just being his funny self.<br /><br />One of the best scenes in the whole movie, is when Hugh's character is at a table at a wedding - surrounded by 3 or 4 of his exes. This scene is set up for utter humiliation, and it's hilarious to watch it unfold.<br /><br />If you hate typically stereotyped English characters, complete with plummy irritating accents, then don't watch this film. If you're easily irritated by Hugh Grant (yes, I normally am, until I saw Bridget Jones Diary), then this is not the film. It's not a film you watch too many times however. And there is a region 2 special edition.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The amazing thing about Serenity is how seamlessly Joss Whedon manages to move from the television series to the movie. While a few minor (and easily explainable) changes have taken place since the end of Firefly, fans of the canceled-before-its-time TV series will not miss a beat. There is no long-winded opening or introduction to the 'Verse. The movie just starts as though it were a natural continuation of the TV series. <br /> <br />At the same time, there is just enough of an introduction for newcomers to understand what is going on. In a few quick minutes, all the background needed to enjoy the movieis revealed. The combination of old west and space opera fits smoothly and the adventure is off and running before you know it. <br /> <br />The movie has everything you need in a science fiction action adventure. It has some terrific action sequences, character development that benefits from the actors knowing each other and their characters for an entire TV season, and some insight into the human situation as well. I will warn fans of the TV series that some of your favorite characters will be killed. I won't say who, but do realize this: no one is safe. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the TV series, this is a must have movie. If you're a newcomer, this is the sci-fi action movie that all the other theatrical releases of 2005 such as Star Wars and War of the Worlds failed to be. Buy the DVD, and there might just be more. <br /> <br />Hey, it worked for Firefly...
B000088E6D|5.0|Ok folks, you know what you are getting on the cd when you order it...there is a list of all the songs on the cd, so if you are like some reviewers and have some sort of moral objection to new singers singing classic songs, don't get this cd.  Duh.  That said, Michael Buble has an incredible voice and breathes new life into these pieces.  Classics like these were made to be SUNG, and just because someone new comes along to perform it does not mean that they are trying to hitch a ride on someone else's success or talent; just that they recognize good music.  Fortunately or unfortunately, great songs are sung by everyone, good and bad (haven't you ever been to a middle school choir pop concert...oh god) but that is the PURPOSE of these songs, to be enjoyed.  Not only does Buble do a wonderful interpretation of these pieces; in doing so he is introducing a whole new generation to them.
B0009353IW|4.0|I am not a die hard Ry Cooder fan, am young, and \\"discovered\\" him due to Buena Vista Social Club. I was doing a research on Mexican-American music and came across information for this album. I am very glad I purchased it.  <br /> <br />I think Cooder has done a wonderful job at representing the realtively unknown musical diversity that existed in the Mexican-American community during this period. I read another review from a Cuban who commented that Mexico had the least interesting musical history of Latin America, and that he didn't understand why Cooder/anyone would be interested in it. I almost wanted to laugh at the ignorance and the arrogance of such a comment.  <br /> <br />During the 1950s era- Mexico was the artistic mecca of Latin America, attracting immigrants from all over who brought their music and acting, but especially from Cuba and Argentina. Mambo pretty much developed in Mexico with the presence of Beny More and Perez Prado. Danzon was and is a hugely popular dance in Mexico as well, especially in the coastal region of Veracruz. In combination with Mexico's rich folkloric tradition of corridos, rancheras, son jarocho and dozens of other types of music, the musical heritage is a rich mixture of sounds that was brought to the U.S by Mexican immigrants. Mixing with the sounds of the time in Los Angeles and the United States, you have a hodge podge of Mexican, Cuban, Afro-American, American, amd Mexican-American sounds expressed by a growing community with a unique identity.  <br /> <br />Cooder is one of few who has taken into account this presence with this album, in my opinion. He combines this musical diversity of sounds with the cultural, lingusitic, and political landscape of the Chavez Ravine Mexican-American community. He incorporates Chicano idioms and views into the music to recreate the scene that once existed in this community of Los Angeles.  <br /> <br />This is a much needed and appreciated creation for the history of Los Angeles and especially for the Mexican-American community, who continues to have to dig deep to recuperate its history.
B00000DG1R|3.0|This is a great selection of songs but it still misses because of the horribly butchered single versions of 'Save a Prayer' and 'Rio'. And as important is the fact that a single compilation like this leaves out songs that are just as beautiful as the ones on it or surpasses them.<br /><br />Anybody lucky enough to see Duran's recent concerts will be aware of this when they played many songs from the first two albums that are not on the Greatest album. Here's some of what's missing.<br /><br />Careless Memories (Duran Duran)<br />To the shore (Duran Duran)<br />Sound of Thunder (Duran Duran)<br />Friends of mine (Duran Duran)<br />Tel Aviv (Duran Duran)<br />The Chauffeur (Rio)<br />Lonely in your Nightmare  (Rio)<br />New Religion  (Rio)<br />Hold Back the Rain  (Rio)<br /><br />Then there's the songs from the other albums that are nothing less than essential.<br /><br />Of Crime and Passion (Seven & the Ragged Tiger)<br />Shadows On Your Side (Seven & the Ragged Tiger)<br />The Seventh Stranger (Seven & the Ragged Tiger)<br />Winter Marches On (Notorious)<br />A Matter of Feeling (Notorious)<br />Hold Me (Notorious)<br />American Science (Notorious)<br />Do you Believe in Shame? (Big Thing)<br />Land  (Big Thing)<br />Palomino  (Big Thing)<br />Too Late Marlene (Big Thing)<br />My Antartica (Liberty)<br />Breath after Breath (The Wedding Album)<br />Sin of the City (The Wedding Album)<br />Midnight Sun (Medazzaland)<br />Out of My Mind  (Medazzaland)<br />So Long Suicide (Medazzaland)<br />Michael (Medazzaland)<br />Buried in the Sand (Medazzaland)<br />Starting to Remember (Pop Trash)<br />Someone Else Not Me (Pop Trash)<br />Last Day on Earth (Pop Trash)<br />Still Breathing (Astronaut)<br /><br />Then you listen to some of the b-sides which you realize are easily better than their MTV singles.<br /><br />Like an Angel (Rio re-issue)<br />Khanada (Duran Duran re-issue)<br />I Believe (All I Need to Know) (Big Thing re-issue)<br />Secret Oktober (live House of Blues 2000) (youtube)<br />A Matter of Fact (youtube)<br /><br />The thing is Duran Duran are simply not a singles band, and with every album having something different to offer, it's worthwhile to listen to all of them (the ones after Pop Trash in 2000, not really). Duran Duran (the first album), Rio, Notorious, Medazzaland and Big Thing are all amazing.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|I got so excited when I saw this on the new release shelf at my local target. It clearly states on the back of the box that it contains all 3 CLASSIC movies. I have been waiting for the original theatrical versions of the films to be released on DVD for years now and was furious when I sat down to watch the original star wars and Greedo shot first! Nowhere on the box did it say anything about these being the special edition releases. I already have the special edition with the bonus disc and now I am stuck with an open box of the same movies.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Just so everyone knows right off, I can't compare this to the original because I have not heard it. I am a somewhat newer fan. They don't sell the original albums in stores anymore (and no one is selling their original ones to the used stores) so i just pick up the remasters. Anyway... what we are looking at here is the birth of Megadeth. The whole album, excluding a few songs to break up the pattern, is a big solo. That fast. Most of the time you don't really hear whats going on you just know it sounds good. All the songs on here get at least a 4 out of 5 star rating, not to mention Last Rites/Loved to Deth and Rattlehead which both get 6 out of 5 star ratings. Very good clasic Megadeth. Any fan needs this, its worth your money to buy it for the 2 songs mentioned above, pick up KIMB right after you read my review.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I started listening to Bat Country from another source and I got the album. It was amazing, all of their songs are unique and they perfectly mix in different styles of music. <br /> <br />Would recommend to anyone, even people who don't like rock.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|Demigod illustrates Behemoths' strengh as musicians and as a conceptionists. I think Negral is a genius, and one of my favorite Cookie monster VoKillist in all of Black/Deathdom! The musicianship and the production make Demigod, Thelema6, Apostasy, and anything Behemoth all recommended Blackened Death Metal I bought their DVD, which is sick!  The lyrical content and the cover are OK, which consists of invocations to bloodthirsty demons and a bastardized image of Thoth Hermes Trimegustus, a very important historical figure.  I personally have read the works of Crowley and the like, and simply find all but a few quotes significant, like much of Black Magick and Satanism. Come on folks! I can see something deep in the Luciferian archetype of individuality and revolution, however I take great inspiration from the Yeshuan archetype as well, like conquering through self-sacrifice, as Alchemy dictates. I can think better sources of wisdom than Crowley's self absorbed hedonistic rants, actually. There are more suitable arkane texts to vererate and utilize, but noone is singing about them yet.<br /><br />Besides that, this record is unbelievably brutal without sacrificing melody, unlike some of the Death Metal I've heard.  Excellent work!

B000084T18|5.0|Despite the small change name, the good Dr. Dre and Eminem saw large capital gains in their futures when they signed controversial Queens, New York rapper 50 Cent to their Shady and Aftermath Records imprints. Coming with more beef than your cities meatpacking district, the conflicted rapper's `debut' release Get Rich or Die Tryin' is a journey through street tales, gun clapping and all the gratuitous sex and comedic shenanigans that come in between.<br /><br />From his debut single \\"How to Rob,\\" to the mix-tapes he littered the streets with, to his latest opus, 50 Cent's blistering rhymes have always been buttressed by impeccable beats. Dr. Dre pulls out all the stops and blesses his latest prodigy with addictive, steady keys on the Ja Rule & Company skewering \\"Back Down\\" and the braggadocios \\"If I Can't\\" as well as muffled drums on scorcher \\"In the Club\\". But having a few Dre joints does not make an album. He receives gems from other reliable sources including Rockwilder who literally supplies the usual bells and whistles on future club anthem \\"Like My Style\\" and Reef Tewlow who brings bare bone drums on the chest pounder, \\"What Up Gangsta\\".<br /><br />Rhyme wise, 50 wears his emotions on his sleeves. From the misogyny of \\"P.I.M.P,\\" to the skewering he gives Ja Rule & Company on \\"Back Down\\" to contemplating why drama is his shadow on \\"Many Men,\\" no topic is off limits. He even goes so far as to-dare I say-show his soft side on \\"21 Questions\\" a gentle interrogation in rhyme intended for the ladies where he asks couplets like, \\"We only rumors girls we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take, I love you like a fat kid love cake, you know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile...\\" But thankfully he spares us by not getting too sappy and leaving the crooning on the hook to Nate Dogg.<br /><br />Truth be told, 50 Cent is not the one of rap's elite emcees when it comes to lyrical skill. But, his ability to write catchy hooks and deliver wasp-like, stinging punch lines carries him when complex lyricism is absent. The gift of being able to please such a diverse range of ears, from street corner commandos to white girls fighting to stay on beat, is a rare one and 50 has been blessed with it. If you don't believe the latter, see what happens when \\"In the Club\\" explodes from the speakers at your local White Anglo Saxon Protestant hang out.<br /><br />The streets done raised 50 and his album is an ode to the work he's put in on them. Does he deliver an album on par with the deafening buzz of its impending release? Of course not-yes he took nine bullets and lived but he isn't Superman. \\"Blood Hound\\" could have been put together better and \\"High All the Time\\" isn't the most creative of songs. But overall, he delivers the same energy that he packed into the music he flooded the streets with, so what more can you ask for? In drugs terms Get Rich or Die Tryin' is like weed, a gateway drug that may lead to stronger substances after prolonged use or in 50's case, heavy rotation in your stereo and even higher expectations from future releases (Pitty that hasnt.ke, stinging punch lines carries him when complex lyricism is absent.

B0007O38F8|1.0|A few reviews ago someone wrote \\"50 Cent is the greatist rapper of all time\\" Hmmm....sure sure...He has accomplished so much, such like 2 freggin albums, a video game, and a piece of junk movie. Well his albums are also pieces of junk, and not because the his lyrics and ryhmes are weak, but he is a creation of a record company and thats it! He is a total sell out who claims of getting shot numerous times, being a hood and a ganster, and all sorts of other nonsense that I dont believe. WHy?? Because he hangs out with hollywoods finest and goes to lush Spa's in Beverly Hills....Hey if you want to change you lifestyle and make it better, thats fine, but when you do one thing and say another (like all of his ganster nonsence on this CD) then you are a total sellout. Most of the old school rappersproved that they could put feel into thier albums and werent a creation of money hungry record companies. Even though some of them are doing TV, Films, and living a posh life know, they put there dues in and when they were rappin back in the day, they put all the feel and took the Streets to the Mike..>50 Cent, go back to your alias and keep trying!!...
B00005KHJV|1.0|A Comparative Analysis:<br /><br />For the last week or two, I've been checking out various horror movies.  I've never really been a big horror fan, but it all started when I recently watched John Carpenter's The Thing.  I found the movie to be suprisingly good and decided to seek out some of his other movies.  At the same time, I've been researching Ed Gein, so I've also been watching quite a number of other movies. That said, when I stumbled onto Halloween, I was severely disappointed. I found this movie to be quite boring.  Halloween struck me as dull, much like the Friday the 13th series.  For movies of a similar era, I would recommend The Thing, The Shining or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre (note: TCM 2 is a travesty of a movie... like a Troma movie to me, and I thought the remake of the first was slightly better than the original... so maybe check it out if the original appeals to you).  Going back a little further, I also watched the original Psycho the other day and it was a little slow, but decent if you want to watch a slasher flick (Hitchcock should have cut out the psychiatrist bit in the end, though). If you're still itching to check out the Halloween series, try 7 (H20). In the last few days, I've watched Halloween 1, 2, 7 & 8 (I saw 3 as a kid and I remember it as lame and unscary) and of the bunch, 7 stuck out as the best... so if you don't like it, you're probably not going to like the rest (8 was probably the worst, I think). Also, if you're interested in John Carpenter's movies... well, there's The Thing. In addition to it and Halloween, I've recently watched The Fog (dreafully boring) and I rewatched In the Mouth of Madness (not nearly as good as I remember), and it looks like The Thing is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review will actually provide some insight, as you can use my views on these other movies as a barometer of sorts instead of reading yet another an unhelpful \\"OMG this movie roxors!!1!\\" review.<br /><br />Oh and, to get more specific on the first movie itself, it was just so cheesy and simple.  There is some realllllly poor acting (take the conversation between the nurse and the Doc before the breakout) and the character development doesn't really get you caring about the characters.  The cinematography made it seem like they were trying way too hard to be groundbreakingly different, but I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I'm not saying I can do better, since I'm no moviemaker, but compared to modern movie cinematography, it stands out as poor. The plot mirrored the kind of lame fiction plots I wrote when I was in junior high: mind-numbingly similar to Friday the 13th.<br /><br />The whole series makes the Nightmare on Elm Street series seem like a deep-plotted epic.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|Duran Duran...I might be the only person in the world who thinks this is a very powerful CD. If we forget for a minute that this a a glam-pop new wave band that was a quick flash in the pan, we might think Rio was put out by another band. Funny as it is, this makes my top 25 list as one of the best CD's of all time. Why?? Its really moving and powerful believe it or not, and the last 3 songs on the CD, really blow me away. Maybe its the vocal or the fact that the bass drum kicks you in your chest on \\"The chauffeur\\" , but this is a really moving muscial album. Forget Hungry like a wolf, which sucks and really doesnt fit into the album for some reason, but the rest of the CD is excellent. Listen to it a few times, and really crank it, cause the bass lines are fantasic, and maybe you will see what I mean...ENJOY
1400031087|1.0|I have bought a lot of books that I subsequently didn't really enjoy: that's the risk you take, right? But not once, ever, have I felt this cheated out of the money I paid for a book. I remember thinking at the beginning 'it's a real shame that memoirs are sometimes written by terrible writers, because it doesn't matter how stunning their story, it sometimes read like crap.' Oh, right. It is crap. I didn't buy the book direct from Random House so I won't be elligible for a refund. I might send it back to them all the same. It's stinking up my bookshelf.
B000088E77|4.0|I am going through some of my old CD's that have been collecting dust, and when I found my Men at Work CD, I decided to give it a long overdue play in the Stereo. What still fasicnates me is how well this record is done, for being a flash in the pan 80's one hit wonder band. Believe it or not, this is a really good album, with almost every song (with the exception of 2) being really solid. The last 3 songs on the CD are fantastic. Touching the Untouchables, Catch a Star, and Down by the Sea are worth getting the CD alone. This is a classic from a band who only released 3 CD's (in a period of 2yrs) so Enjoy this...If you are a fan of the Police (even though not as talented) this will be right up your alley.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I'm not gonna say this compares with classics like van halen or Megadeth. What I'm here to say is that anything this new that is played on the radio and has a solo (a frikken solo!) has to be at least 3 stars. There are some songs on this cd that get a bit lengthy (Trashed and Scattered) but it's still pretty solid. When Avenged Sevenfold made this album they weren't trying to make a classic album you morons. They tried to make something of their own. And they did a good job. I was reading reviews waaaaaay down there written a few months ago and i couldnt believe what some of them said. One of the reviewers actually complained about the awesome guitars. He said he wished the vocals were better and that they wasted too much time on the guitars. Poeple like that are the ones that dont know what theyre talking about. SOLID ALBUM, WORTH 10 OR 15 BUCKS.

1400031087|1.0|James Frey, admitted drug fiend. This is not a man that should be put up on a pedestal as Oprah has seen fit to do. The true unsung heroes in our world are the people who stay clean from day one; the people who fulfill their responsibilities and live decent lives because it's the right thing to do. Period.  <br /> <br />Doing the right thing, however, doesn't sell. It's boring, it's every day. Scandal sells, and Oprah Winfrey knows this more than anyone else. James Frey is means to an end for Ms. Winfrey. That's it.  <br /> <br />Trust me, I grew up with Jimmy. Hell, I knew him when he was a privileged little puddle jumper living in a nice cushy house on the east side of Cleveland (talk about a wise-guy, yeesh). He's another rich, white, suburban kid who had every opportunity to do great things with his life. Instead, he pissed it all away and he won't get any kudos from me. People who wreck their lives don't deserve to be held up as heroes.   <br /> <br />Perhaps Oprah wants us to see past the stereotype of the drug-addled ghetto junky. Let's take that bad rap and put it on the people who helped to perpetuate it: moneyed white folks!    <br />

The plot has been aptly summarized by other reviewers here, so I'll focus on the central subject: how a terrible mistake committed during childhood can lead to a life of repentance and to the search for coming to terms with guilt and trying to look for redemption or atonement. Deep inside young Briony Tallis is a feeling of reaching the end of childhood and the beginning of something new, what we now call adolescence. This implies the sensing of changes in one's body, but also the first glimpses of adult life: worries about sex, love, money and power. Left behind, for her, are the idealizations of marriage and happiness; in front of her are the always equivocal relationships betweeen the sexes. When Briony finds her sister having sex in the library with Robbie, the family's protege, she jumps to the conclusion that he is forcing her. The older cousin adds gas to the fire by explaining he might be a sexual maniac. All this accumulates in the young mind of Briony and shapes a conviction that will be confirmed by further events, which are not worth disclosing in a review. Those tragic events completely alter the lives of everyone involved, even those whe were just witnesses to them. For Robbie, they will mean prison, war, suffering, and the destruction of a dream and a love, at least for a long time. For Cecilia, Briony's sister, it will bitter her for ever and distance her from her beloved family. But for Briony, it will mean a change in the course of her life, forcing her to sacrifice herself and look for ways to amend her mistake. <br /> <br />I take one star away from the book because I would have liked more elaboration on the success or failure of the efforts for atonement, on the future life of Cecilia and Robbie, and on the way Briony finally deals with her feelings.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is a good novel, well written and constructed, which deserves the wide readership and praise it hasachieved.
B000024ALA|1.0|This album is terrible. A true horror to my ears, but perhaps I am simply jaded by good metal, from Black to Death to Doom to Gothic, and even some metalcore hybrids and certain grindcore releases. I think it's the fact that I adored their earlier release \\"Gothic\\", which might be one of the best and most brutal pieces of dark music in metal. It is completely exeptable to cover new ground in music, but at least allow those new grounds to be in the same universe, or just change the band name all together, because this is false advertizing at it's most disgusting. It angers me how artists can lose their nerve this severely, comparable only to Katatonia, Anathema, and Theatre of Tragedy in their genius at first listen and overall abandonment  to commercialist foregrounds later. I suppose Samael isn't much better either. Even if you don't enjoy extreme music like I do, and I am tame compared to some, explore other avenues of listening, or don't say you like metal at all.<br /><br />If, God forbid, you do enjoy this piece of s@3!, check out the later works of the above listed bands as well.  They are sure to amuse! If not, give \\"Gothic\\", \\"Ceremony of Opposites\\", and \\"Brave Murder Day\\", a chance. These releases are superior, and will be more palatable to a true metal enthusiast.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I think I love the soundtrack to this moving film as much as the film its self.   Who ever chose the songs for this cd really did an excellent  job of capturing the essence of Annie Proulx's story of enduring  love and loss.   I think the best songs on this cd are \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\". sung by Emmylou Harris. And you can't help but shed a tear when you hear Willie Nelson's \\"He Was A Friend of Mine\\".  But the most haunting song of all, is The Maker Makes. Rufus Waninwright (son of folk singer Loudon Wainwright III.)brings an erie ghostlike feel to the song.   It sounds like something you might hear wailing on a cold  and lonesome night on a Wyoming range.   All of it held together by the fantastic guitar melodies of  Gustavo Santaollalla.   Unfortunetly Brokeback Mountain won't be out on dvd for awhile.  But this beautiful soundtrack will keep the memory of this great love story alive for you until then.    PS. It would've been an even better cd, if liner notes with lyrics to the songs, had been included.
0688002307|5.0|I first read this book in 1976... it has occupied a prime spot on my bookcase ever since. This current version has a more agreeable font and is easier to read.
1400049628|4.0|I love this book, I would give it five stars if not for the poor drawings.  I know it's a humor book, but the kindergarden level art is a let down.
B0002J4ZWS|3.0|This a movie about Andy and Red two inmates at Shawshank Prison. <br />Andy is busy plotting his escape and Red is busy getting little treats for the other convicts like a pick ax, a poster, a Big Mac, a tube of Ben Gay... the movie never does explain how Red is able to come up with that stuff.
B00005JOQB|5.0|This movie was sooooo good.  It wasn't that scary but it was very entertaining.  There wasn't a minute that I was not entertained.  And I felt horrible for the main charters when the were being torutred.  When this comes out on dvd I'm going to buy it.  This movie was really good.  Hope this helps someone.
B00005JOIF|3.0|Steven Spielberg is foremost a great storyteller. More to the point, a great visual storyteller. I doubt he was preoccupied with politics when he shot Artificial Intelligence. I doubt he worried about offending one side or the other is Schindler's List. Watching Munich, I got the sense that Mr. Spielberg strived to offend neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis(a noble goal . . . why offend anybody?), but while succeeding in this goal, he failed in another area . . . to tell a convincing narrative. Yes, the metaphorical scene involving the Arab and Jewish `hit teams' slumbering in the same safe house achieved a political goal(ie. We are all homo sapiens and we're all in this together on the big blue marble), but did it advance the story? This brings up a larger flaw in this movie; was the editor drunk? I've never seen so many superfluous scenes in a movie. I got the sense if you could have cut out like 50 minutes of film . . . this might have been a very good film. Much has been written on the politics of Munich vis-&agrave;-vis Spielberg. Perhaps the same questions should be asked of the screenwriters as well. For full disclosure, I don't see the moral equivalency between killing Jewish Athletes and Palestinian terrorists. However, the brilliant One Day In September does suggest this very argument. This brilliant documentary of the events of Munich show the lives of the Israeli athletes as well as the sojourn of the Palestinian terrorists . . . not just their actions but what motivated them(successfully showing their human dimension). One Day In September shows you can have a political axe to grind, but the story can still be brilliant. Before  you make your political arguments, your moral view of how people should live, your thematic and societal revelations, you have to tell a good story, and this is precisely where Mr. Spielberg does not measure up compared to his previous work. Then again, nobody bats one-hundred percent.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I like Voyageur. I am generally a symphonic music listener; but I came to Enigma from a mix program called Music From the Hearts of Space, at [...] I first heard MXMXC AD, and I was hooked. I bought that CD and the next three. I collected all of the lyrics off the internet. But, in spite of this, I never quite knew what was going on in these \\"threaded\\" or related discs. <br /> <br />I really like Voyageur because M Cretu seems to have dispensed with lyrics to the greatest extent, and what we have left is the propulsive \\"EuroDisco dance beats\\" as described by Stephen Hill of HOS. <br />
B00005JO04|4.0|Ebert refers to the hyperlink form of storytelling as the method used in Syriana. We never quite understand all components of the story, yet this very point adds mystery to the audience experience. The acting is solid. The plot line a bit predictable vis-&agrave;-vis Hollywood . . . terrorists are motivated by poverty(not religion), the bad guys are not the terrorists . . . but the Texas oil men(not an unpopular opinion today) and so on. I sort of chuckled when the head of Hizbullah in Lebanon said to Clooney's character, \\"I miss America . . . I like her.\\" I half expected him to wax nostalgically about that corned beef sandwich from Katz' deli(but I digress). Syriana entertains. A good story well told is what we're after; isn't it? In this context, Syriana delivers.
0143034901|5.0|Absolutely stunning achievement.  Probably the best piece of fiction I have ever read.
6305181772|3.0|I grew up watching the original Mission Impossible series on TV with Peter Graves as Jim Phelps and Leonard Nimoy as a member of the cast.  A generation later, this movie has a decidedly different flavor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  With Tom Cruise leading the cast as Ethan Hunt, and supported by the likes of Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno, and Emilio Estevez (with too small a role, in my opinion), this one has plenty of star power.<br /><br />I don't want to get into an exposition of the plotline, since it's more than a little twisted -- but in a good, suspenseful way.  There's plenty high-tech superspy gadgetry, although the portrayal of various routine technologies like email was a little goofy.  The action scenes are sporadic but generally well done, with the exception of some obviously physics-defying liberties in the special effects for the final chase scene.  Overall, though, the effect is modestly credible and, more importantly, immensely entertaining.  Yes, I've seen better work from Tom Cruise, but so what.  This is a decent movie that's worth the investment of a few bucks and a couple hours.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Some people have said that Joss Whedon is a god.  I have to agree.  With almost 600 reviews at the time of my posting, I will not repeat what others have said except to say that this movie goes far beyond the superficial markings of movieland and reaches a depth of singular and spectacular quality.<br /><br />Super congrats to Joss and everyone involved.<br /><br />Now bring back the series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|what can i say? i thought music was a good album. then came american life, the much-maligned but much better album than music. then to everybody's surprise, \\"confessions\\" seemed destined to become classic.  the best collaboration of madonna, mirwais and stuart price - in the material form of a cd!<br /><br />as madonna returns to her roots, the album may be dissected as a retrospect to her craft but at the same time looks forward to the future. for madonna, who's been ahead of our own time, the future is vast and there's no stopping her.<br /><br />this album bears no clinker. believe when i say that.  why i call this \\"the immaculate confessions\\" is for the simple reason that the tracks, while all new (future) looks back at the past (her classic albums). i placed in parentheses the albums in which the new track may actually belong to or sounds akin to. i hope you agree with me!<br /><br />1. hung up: with a sample from abba's 1979 song \\"gimme gimme gimme (a man after midnight)\\" madonna takes the intro and makes it her own.  the most popular and danceable of all tracks, madonna brings back the glorious days of disco - in definitive form.  (madonna, 1983)<br /><br />2. get together: this track is so 90's because it sounded like \\"music sound better with you\\" and yet, madonna gave this song her own trademark.  simple yet beautiful (ray of light, 1998).<br /><br />3. like it or not: a retro feel in the tradition of \\"fever\\" (1992) and bye bye baby (1993) both from erotica and those dick tracy-inspired tunes from i'm breathless (1990).  this is not just a song. this is a statement: she will continue to make great music, like it or not. (i'm breathless, 1990)<br /><br />4. sorry: this is my second favorite track. i know this would instantly become a big hit. the lyrics and music is very madonna-esque and 80's. thanks to the reworking of pet shop boys. the track became an even greater song with their remixing! (like a virgin, 1984).<br /><br />5. let it will be: inspired by the violins of papa dont preach but with futuristic arrangements.  ther emix version simply rocks. (true blue, 1986).<br /><br />6. Isaac: with a chant worth remixing, this Jewish-inspired dance tune, despite the minor controversy is a good song. it also sounded like \\"secret\\" in some respects but totally different songs. (like a prayer, 1989)<br /><br />7. how high: one of her best songs from COAD. another infectious dance tune. it sounds like a crossover between i'm breathless (1990) and bedtime stories (1994) with the futuristic sound of bedstime story.<br /><br />8. fighting spirit: a bonus track running around 3 minutes, this track features retro drums and lyrics that reflect madonna's fighting stance.  too bad this is not available in the regular album release. (madonna, 1983/immaculate collection, 1990)<br /><br />9. jump: an introduction that easily grooves and moves you, jump is a dance song reflective of her 80's song with a millennial twist. it also carries a strong madonna point of view (about waiting and wasting time, typical restless madonna). (true blue, 1986)<br /><br />10. push: easily a danceable r&b, \\"push\\" contains a repetitive refrain that keeps you wodnering why it was only repeated twice, but nonetheless, it kept the song intact. (like a prayer, 1989)<br /><br />11. super pop: an exclusive track for icon subsribers, if this was included in the album, this would become a hit! why? it's a real-life retrospection of our icon, singing if she was an actor she would be marlon brando, if she was an animal, she'll be a lion, if she was a song, she would be super pop (which is true) and if she was president, she would be different. i hope madonna release this track as a single (with remixes). it's just that - a super pop song. (ghv2, 2001)<br /><br />i entitled this the \\"immaculate confessions\\" since the songs do reflect her old songs/style while at the same time, giving them a breath of new life.<br /><br />long live the queen!ngements.  ther emix version simply rocks.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I will not repeat what other awesome reviewers have said.  Just like to say that I bought the series after seeing the movie Serenity, and I have never been so hooked on anything in my life.  The depth of character and quality of writing is spectacular.

0307276902|1.0|Go to [...] and see for yourself.  I had no choice but to throw it away when I was finished.  The author made it all up, and is a complete fraud.  Is it a good story of redemption... you bet it is.  But the sad truth is, it's a story completely made up...
0553573403|5.0|It has been many years since a book grabbed me so thoroughly as GRRM's A GAME OF THRONES.  The book is ripe with well-drawn, in-depth characterizations and rich, well thought-out plotting.  Any person who has never thought that the so-called \\"fantasy\\" genre was for them will find this THE book to settle down with for a long winter's night of reading.  After finishing the first book, I plan on catapulting myself through the other three books in the series, A CLASH OF KINGS, A STORM OF SWORDS, and A FEAST FOR CROWS.<br /><br />The writing itself is tight, solid and well above average. George R.R. Martin's prose and pacing, for this kind of book, is as good as it gets.

B00005JNQA|5.0|Silvia Broome (Kidman) is a woman with a past...a large past.  She's an interpreter who overhears an assasination attempt.  Tobin (Penn) is a man with a past.  He's a police officer/detective trying to figure out if Silvia is telling the truth.  Is she involved?  Is she making the whole thing up?  Is she in danger?  Is he in love?  The film is tragic and dramatic and on the edge of your seat exciting.  Kidman is amazing here, brilliant performance proving she is one of our greatest living actresses.  Penn does well, but it's no oscar winner thats for sure.  The thrills don't quit as Silvia is harrased by the men wanting to assasinate the president of some african country.  Questions keep getting raised and you think you know the answer but then you know you don't so you just have to keep watching and expect the unexpected.  As Silvia's past unravels new questions come up that question her intentions and makes it hard for Tobin to trust her fully.  The problem is that Silvia is not willing to explain.  Does she want Zuwani (the african president)dead?  Is she in on it?  Is it really happening?  What exactly did she hear?  Keep asking them but you will have to wait until the gripping conclusion to know the full truth.  Great entertainment!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The first time I watched this movie was about a year ago, my brother was a big fan of it, and recommended it to me. Now, after about 4 other times of watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. As has been said before on hundreds of reviews Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, I cannot imagine anyone playing Donnie any better than him. This movie has great dialogue, very realistic in how awkward some of the conversations are, and hilarious at times, while just weird at other times. It makes me mad at the reviews who get on here just to bash it, and say stuff about how it will be for kids who wear black clothes and get their parents to drive them to the hot topic, yeah well if that's true than how come the biggest audience this has is probably college students? Just because you did not understand it, and think you're smart does not mean you have to bash the movie.  <br /> <br />Anyway, great movie, watch it if you get a chance.  <br />
0393035158|4.0|A book like this needed to be written in our world today.  Unfortunately, this isn't the book that needed to be written.    Harris touches on many of the reasons why we need a book like this, including broad issues (not just faith based terror, there's also faith driven violence and intense social coercion inside the U.S.) and some of the roots for that (the way comments about faith end conversations, so beliefs remain unexamined; and how we are expected to treat all beliefs with equal tolerance and credibility).    As it is, it stops being useful in advancing the conversation because of the absolute insistence on \\"reason\\" as he defines it as the only test, and the underlying axe that Harris seems extremely intent about grinding.  Maybe Harris' reasoning leads him to the inescapable conclusion that there's no place for religion in the modern world, but it would help to avoid acting omniscient, and be willing to do a more even handed job of looking at various perspectives.      Dismissing religion as the misguided consolation of idiots and madmen just isn't going to advance the conversation.  Equally importantly, an overemphasis on logic shows a rather one dimensional approach to the discussion.    There are lots of things we have theories about, for which the theories are not currently testable by science (like super string theory).  There's room for philosophy in our world - but it does need to be discussed and examined.  Also, recognize that most of us believe several impossible things before breakfast each day.    Also, it would help to separate out which things are really being done for the sake of religion and which are being done for power and money - whether we're discussing the Crusades or Supreme Court nominees.    Harris should have set aside his absolutist views, and put more emphasis on how to get society to have conversations about what works, in building a life and a culture, and what doesn't work (those unexamined things that we can't seem to discusstoday, like how Islamic societies have failed their people).
B000000ZGO|5.0|When I first got this I remember the girl I was with at the time looking at the track list on the back of the CD case and saying, \\"Four songs? You got ripped off.\\" Man, was she wrong. (Then again, she was wrong about a lot of things.) This disc contains four jams that are some of the smoothest soul music I've ever heard. Isaac Hayes knew how to take a song and build it into an extended masterpiece. \\"Walk On By\\" is twelve minutes of Isaac layin' it down, and it doesn't drag for a second. His vocals on this song and throughout the album are sublime. The horn and orchestral arrangements are also noteworthy, opening the album in majestic fashion. \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic\\" is a real groove, and the piano solo in the second half of the song is one of my favorites, building to an exhilarating crescendo at the end of the song. (Public Enemy sampled part of this solo on their classic track \\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\".) I have put this song on at many parties and it never fails. The eighteen and a half minute \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" has attained legendary status since being recorded. Isaac Hayes really put it together on this album, and it should be regarded as a classic of soul music. This is a CD that I can put on anytime and it always moves me. If you are into R&B or soul music and haven't heard this, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
B000C65Z20|4.0|Critically lauded as a return to the intelligent spy movies of the seventies, THE CONSTANT GARDENER is extraordinarily well done.  Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are superb in their roles as a professor and his politically energetic wife.  She finds out some nasty details about a pharmaceutical coverup in Kenya and is murdered.  Via flashbacks, we see the relationship between Fiennes and Weisz, and in the present time, Fiennes is compelled to finish his wife's work.  With fine support from Danny Huston as their friend AND enemy; Bill Nighy as the seedy politician Pellegrin and Pete Postelthwaite as an involved medic, the movie painfully presents the horrors of pharmaceutical manipulation.  It's a dark film and in spite of its technical elegance, left me feeling just a little empty inside.
0307276902|1.0|...does not make it so! I read this book weeks ago and did not like it then--but now?  Well, I just finished watching the Larry King interview with the author and am appalled at Ms. Winfrey's call in support of the author. Apparantly, she has not read the intensive report (smokinggun.com) that these investigative journalists put together on many aspects of Frey's memoir. Especially the part about the horrific train crash. Eerie and unbelievable to hear the author say he knew this girl when clearly it has been documented that the parents never knew of him or his so- called take on what happened that horrible night.  But what gets me is Winfrey calling in and minimizing these facts--saying he has helped so many people.  <br /> <br />This is Oprah's fantasy.  <br /> <br />She really believes she's changing people and this is what she was defending--the fact that she had all these people on her show stating such. She's obviously thinking of her own hide. And I have lost respect for her. She is so ignorant about real recovery about the efficacy and wisdom of the 12 Steps and that, actually, Frey's swagger and macho tough- guy attitude toward the recovery center's staff is DANGEROUS for anyone who is in the vulnerable position in seeking real help. Oprah is defending her high perch that she took and minimizing the very credible work these journalists put out. In the Smokinggun article, it is implied that their work is not quite done. We have not heard from Hazeldon--and they explain why: it's a process of getting individuals who have worked there or even remember Frey to sign consent forms in order to come forward. I say it is a matter of time. Because throughout Larry King's show tonight, Frey kept insisting that what really mattered was the recovery process at the facility. Well, much of that is highly questionable and some professionals have written here at amazon that none of those incidents would have ever gone on there.  So we shall see about this aspect of his so-called memoir. I do agree that, ultimately, it is the publisher who is responsbile. And his editor.  <br /> <br />I was not impressed by Winfrey's position. It made me think less of her because it really is all about her believeing that this garbage is actually saving addicts and alcoholics. As someone in recovery for 16 years, all I can say is HUMILITY and SPIRITUALITY and the 12 STEPS are the tried and true  way to stay EFFECTIVELY sober. BUT if Frey came off as a humble person in this book, with a sincere message about staying clean on your own, then that would have been fine, too. No one is saying this is impossible. But he doesn't do this in his book. (in person, he's very nice) But his book almost seems like an opposite personality is at play <br /> <br />Every other word is an expletive. His attitude is horrid. His stance arrogant and condescending.  <br /> <br />Winfrey should be ashamed of herself. And she has no damned business thinking she's now some authority or spokesperson on the subject because she was taken in by this lousy book!  <br /> <br />Will we see the day when it is announced:  he never even went through a 28 day re-hab program??
0790734850|5.0|This stunning 1998 film got sunk by a certain vessel called TITANIC.  Curtis Hanson's brilliant adaptation of the James Ellroy novel did win two Oscars:  it's script by Hanson and Brian Helgeland and supporting actress for Kim Basinger.  But since TITANIC was such a \\"titanic\\" hit, LA CONFIDENTIAL lost the Best Picture Oscar, and it should have won.  There's nothing to find wrong in this blistering study of corruption, murder, prostitution and betrayal.  The male performers are simply outstanding:  Guy Pearce is mesmerizing as the idealistic cop who undergoes a metamorphosis; Russell Crowe is the \\"tough\\" cop whose fierce loyalty and brutality form his core; James Cromwell as the captain who takes Pearce under his wing; Kevin Spacey as the police consultant for the tv show, \\"Badge of Honor\\" and who suddenly sees the light when a male hooker is murdered; David Straithairn as the slimy founder of an elite hooker service; Danny DeVito as the magazine editor always chasing the big scoop; and of course Ms. Basinger who gives new meaning to the \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\" cliche.  She's the soft focus in this otherwise brutal film.  Although compared to CHINATOWN, I find LA CONFIDENTIAL an overall more engrossing film; it's rich in period detail, and has a brilliant cast.  Truly a classic film noir!
B00070Q7VO|3.0|Very Nice recording.  But that's what happens when you sing the standards and have a good voice.  It just doesn't sparkle.  The voice is competent but a bit flat.  Did these songs need to be covered again? Rather than buy this CD, one might do better to buy the originals.
B000056NX5|1.0|I held out high hopes for this most recent new film version of the musical. <br /> <br />I hoped the singers would be at least as good as those in the 1973 movie, and that the quality of the soundtrack mix would be 100% - that being the only area which let down Jewison's otherwise wonderful film in 1973 and the album which was released from it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this 2001 version is one BIG lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Jerome Pradon as Judas, the acting is embarrasingly wooden and unconvincing. Vocally, almost ALL those in the lead roles are soul-less, over-trained singers who come across like they've spent too long playing in Cats and Les Miserables. Glen Carter - as both an actor and singer - is truly weak compared to Ted Neely, who played the role in the 1973 movie. Even Rik Mayall - one of my comic heroes - playing Herod, seems half-hearted about the whole affair and about one-tenth as amusing as he should be. The result? One of the great rock operas sounds more like just another musical.... and a wooden one at that. <br /> <br />Sonically, it's also a disaster. The vocals are way too up front in the mix. And why on earth there are so many unneccessary changes to some of the lyrics is beyond me. Additionally, many of the song tempos seem to have been slowed down to half that of earlier recordings of the show, thus bringing the energy level of the show down considerably. <br /> <br />This SHOULD have been great. Some of the visuals, lighting, sets, editing and camerawork really is excellent. But sadly none of it is enough to rescue this dead duck. <br /> <br />Norman Jewison's original 1973 movie with Carl Anderson and Ted Neely remains far, FAR superior in almost every respect. If they ever re-release THAT version with a digitally remixed and remastered 5.1 soundtrack, I'll be first in line.

B0000DZTIW|5.0|Finally get to have it as my own. Yeaye. :) The best movie soundtrack that was ever been made. I just couldn't believe they didn't give Hans Zimmer any award for this. The second, or the third track alone could've win over any competitors. The movie is beautifully done, but without this soundtrack movie would've never been this popular. Unbelievably nicely done.<br /><br />I don't Mr. Zimmer would read this, but THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, Mr. Zimmer. God bless you, and good luck.
0439679958|1.0|I have read several of Anthony Horowitz's books and have generaly thought they were well writen and exiting; not so with his most recent novel \\"Ravens Gate.   In his recent series (Alex rider adventures) Horowitz showed good rythm and voice coupled with a mature sounding writing style. In the series before (The Dimond Brothers Mysteries) he had a very childish and annoying voice and the descriptors went to that end as well. I had thought Horowitz was improving... aperently not.   This book went back to the Dimond Brother era with a thin plot that isn't supported from benieth. The result is a shallow bit of writing where the reader is left bored by the repetitive pace.     Nearly everything was weak in this book from the characters to the settings to the beliveability.  I think if you liked Horowitz in the past to try it but otherwise don't bother... it wasn't worth the calories burned turning the pages.   I will however continue to read Horowitz because I have faith that he is indead a good writer.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Ok everyone. Listen up. I need you to do something. Forget about Halloween. Next, forget about When a Stranger Calls, and, forget Friday the 13th. Heck! Just forget all other slasher movies! You won't want them anymore, not after BLACK CHRISTMAS. Want a horror movie that will scare you even as an adult? Black Christmas will! After I saw this movie the first time, It kept me looking over my shoulder the rest of the night. <br /> <br />It is hard to believe that the producer who created \\"A Christmas Story\\", \\"Porky's\\", and \\"Baby Geniuses\\" could create such a masterpiece, it being a horror film. Yes, the producer Bob Clark truly must be a genius himself.  <br /> <br />What can I say about this movie? Everything was done perfectly. A great cast, a great producer, and terrific screen writer. This movie is not something you should rent, especially with the prices for renting anyway. JUST BUY IT! You will not be disappointed.  <br />              Sincerely <br />                   \\"Chucky\\"
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|I think that if Judy Garlan was still living she would have said this is just too much, for the true movie The Wizard of OZ, is a classic, this is one of those movies that should have been left alone, for the true movie was the best und the actress to whom stared in the first and only Wizard of Oz Judy Garlan the return to oz should have never been made. For let the classics stay calssics dont remake the movies because you can, for this is a shame that the return of oz was ever made or thought about being remade.  for I know that Judy Galans family must be in an uproar on this whole matter, ... there mother Judy Garlan plaid the most important roll of her life in the Wizard of Oz, for me too even think that people too have watch the return of oz said it too be good, great, the best and hated the ture Wizard of Oz should rethink what the true meaning of the Wizard of Oz was all about, thank you guys for taking the time in reading this review, and ps I have not seen nor do I wish too ever see the remake of return to oz, tks.   <br />From a true Judy Garlan Fan and all ways will be a true fan of the Wizard of Oz
B000003TA4|3.0|Okay, we all heard how ground breaking and important this album was.  We all liked to hear \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" when it came over the radio back in 91 and 92.  Since then, people (including musicians) can't stop talkin about this freakin album.  I don't know, but it may be possible that people automatically think of Cobain as a legend just due to the fact he killed himself.  In all reality, this is just a normal rock album.  Let's not over do it, people!
B0006L16N8|2.0|First of all, this album is very, very, very, U2. The more you listen to the album the more you can identify the songs with some piece or the other of U2's music. From the Bono like vocals (singing/crooning/sighing/all other sounds), The Edge like guitars, the bass lines, the drum beats, why, even the organ/keys and chorus singing feel very much like the typical U2 sound (my song for song comparisons later). You  could actually fool someone saying this was a U2 album. Many of the songs actually remind you of more than one U2 song. Having written that, I don't want to say that this album is all crap. A decent effort has indeed gone into production, music and songwriting. To make a U2 like album does call for some hard work after all. Some songs do grow on you after repeated listens. These are \\"Low\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"A Message\\", \\"Fix You\\", \\"Square One\\",  \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"What If\\". <br /> <br />There's also another band that Coldplay took inspiration from (well, I think I can say \\"music\\") - Kraftwerk.  <br /> <br />And now for the analysis, keep your U2 and Kraftwerk collection beside you. <br /> <br />1. Square One - The song begins with the keyboard and the vocals, \\"You're in control.....\\". Then the beat starts. Listen to the drum beat. It's the same beat that Kraftwerk used on \\"Computer World 2\\" (Album:Computer World). The only difference, kraftwerk used synthesized ones. Just after the first lines of singing concentrate on the music. The music (bass, guitars, durms) is identical to the music of U2's \\"Lemon\\" (Album:Zooropa) and conincidentally just after the first lines are sung. Other U2 songs that come to mind are when you hear this song are \\"Exit\\",(Album:Joshua Tree) and \\"End of the World\\" (Album:Achtung Baby)  <br /> <br />2. What If - Chorus sounds like the one on U2's \\"Lemon\\", (Album:Zooropa) <br /> <br />3. White Shadows - Guitars sound like the one on \\"I will follow\\" (guitars played slow); \\"Lemon\\"  for chorus singing, organ/keys sound like the ones on\\"Lemon\\", \\"Where the streets have no name\\".  <br /> <br />4. Fix You - U2's \\"Lemon\\", like chorus, also reminds you of \\"Exit\\". <br /> <br />5. Talk - Opening guitar tune, a lift off of Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\" main tune (Album:Computer World). You need to be a genius to make a cover out of a Kraftwerk single. I've heard one before and that was truly a great one but not this one from Coldplay although this one wasn't mean to be a cover exactly. Kraftwerk's original song \\"Computer Love\\" is a sonic marvel. Made in 1981 I listen to it even to this day and admire its acoustics.  <br /> <br />6. X and Y - sounds like a rhyme recital, some school kid would like to sing. <br /> <br />7. Speed of Sound - Signature piano tune very much like U2's \\"New Year's Day\\", vocals very much like Bono; keys sound like \\"Lemon\\"/\\"Where the streets have no name\\" and the part where you hear just the drums and bass, it sounds like \\"With or without you\\". The video is just painful to watch and certainly bad for your eyes. <br /> <br />8. A Message - organ/keys very much like the U2 sound, guitar sounds like the way it is heard in the \\"End of the world\\"; vocals, again Bono like <br /> <br />9. Low - Amazing closeness to U2's \\"New Year's Day\\". The words \\"Black and White\\" sound very similar to the words \\"..A crowd has gathered Black and White\\" in U2's song. The words \\"sky could fall..\\" reminds you of the words \\"...Under a blood red sky...\\" again in the same song. Very Bono like vocals. <br />  <br />10. Hardest Part - forget this one. <br /> <br />11. Swallowed by the sea - like x and y another rhyme recital <br /> <br />12. Twisted Logic - Lousy song just tiring and boring. Problems of making a long album like U2 did shows up now. <br /> <br />13. Kingdom come -  This is a truly amazing lift-off. A song sung to the tune of the music of one of U2's songs? Check out the tune of the opening music of \\"Mother's of the disappeared\\" (Album:The Joshua Tree) <br /> <br />Two stars for the U2 like sound and the few OK tunes.

0385507755|4.0|[...] I was immersed in James Frey's portrayal of self-destructive rage. The archetypal Leonard, Lilly and Miles help reconcile the single mindedness of his addiction ridden \\"self\\" character.  I really feel this is a great read [...].
B000002JOH|3.0|For years I have been reading reviews that point to this album as one of the greatest ever.  I finally decided to go buy it.  I gave it a number of listens and have come to a final conclusion:  What in the hell is everyone talking about?!  It's just a typical metal album, nothing really that original, nothing that exiting.  I mean it's still a good listen, don't get me wrong, but it sure in the hell doesn't rank on my list as the greatest.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne releases her debut album at just the age of 17, with her first single, \\"Complicated\\", on it, and I must say, I really enjoyed listening to the debut of a very talented female artist who not only writes her own songs, but also sings each song with as much emotion as possible!  <br /> <br />AVRIL LAVIGNE - \\"LET GO\\" <br /> <br />[01]: \\"Losing Grip\\" [3:53] - This song is the first track on this album, and there couldn't have been a better song to open up this album with! The sound of this song has a major rock feel to it, and I really like how Avril sings her entire heart out on this one! It's absolutely and totally amazing! <br /> <br />[02]: \\"Complicated\\" [4:05] - The first single ever to be heard by anyone at all on the radio and seen on TV! I'm really happy that this song was released as the first single for this album, because the sound of it is so simple and cool! It's so very Avril Lavigne! <br /> <br />[03]: \\"Sk8er Boi\\" [3:23] - I really like, \\"Sk8er Boi\\", because it's a very fast-beat song with a lot of rock to it and it's sure to make everyone want to dance or go wild!  <br /> <br />[04]: \\"I'm With You\\" [3:44] - A slow, but yet, very good song that Avril wrote, and it's very cool that it's on this debut album of hers! Good job, Avril! <br /> <br />[05]: \\"Mobile\\" [3:31] - A fast, but not too fast song (unlike, \\"Sk8er Boi\\"), that sounds really awesome and very cool in a way that almost anyone would enjoy! <br /> <br />[06]: \\"Unwanted\\" [3:40] - A song that's not very much of a rock song, but still has a good feel to it as Avril sings her heart out with this one!  <br /> <br />[07]: \\"Tomorrow\\" [3:48] - A very sad but good song about looking forward to tomorrow, and it almost makes you want to cry when you listen to it. <br /> <br />[08]: \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" [4:12] - This song sounds so simple and fun with it's great upbeat sound!  <br /> <br />[09]: \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" [3:44] - I really like this one, and I'd probably have to say that this song is one of my favorites on this album, because it has a very nice beat to it, and I'm glad that Avril wrote this song for the album, and it sound so fantastic! <br /> <br />[10]: \\"My World\\" [3:27] - This songs sounds as if it's actually talking about Avril, herself, and if so, then cool!  <br /> <br />[11]: \\"Nobody's Fool\\" [3:57] - Almost anyone can relate to this song! It's a song that talks about not wanting to be made up into something that other wants you to be and that it makes you uncomfortable!  <br /> <br />[12]: \\"Too Much To Ask\\" [3:46] - A great song with a great beat! <br /> <br />[13]: \\"Naked\\" [3:27] - This song is another song on this album that's one of my favorites! It's totally awesome, and it's a great song to end the album! <br />
B000021YQV|5.0|I have all of these guy's C.D.'s, and this one has to be the absolute best.  System of a Down is an original ground breaking band, and if you want the best from these guys, get this one.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002JSH|5.0|Badco's debut album was nothing short of excellent, and the second album (straight shooter) revealed not only the confirmation of the talent and energy they owned, but it also had a lot to say about each member's creativity and desire to express themselves musically. \\"Weep no more\\" and \\"Anna\\", both penned by drummer Simon Kirke, are to this day a piece of this singer's daily humming repitoire. If you are a singer and own this album you know what i'm talking about.  \\"Good lovin' gone bad\\", penned by Mick Ralphs, was another mainstay of a continuing strand of rock anthems that Mick never seemed to run out of.  Being the obvious success that drove this band, Paul Rodgers (aka \\"The Voice\\") not only proved himself worthy of top 3 best male singers ever, but he also proved himself worthy of top 3 best songwriters ever.  \\"Feel like makin' love\\" and \\"Shooting Star\\", both penned by Rodgers, will forever come to mind for every rightminded musician who just found a good enough and willing singer to deliver these songs as close to Paul as possible.  There simply isn't enough to say about Paul.  I met him behind the Wiltern Theatre during Mark and Brian's X-Mas show in 99' and he was very polite and sincere. He also seemed a bit suprised to see a 17 year old in shock of his presence.  Although our meeting was cut short due to his flight schedule, I will never forget it. While Boz had no writing credits on the album, he delivered a very unique stylistic set of riffs on both rockers as well as ballads on this album.  Boz is one of the only bassists I have ever heard who intensifies the ballads twice as much as the guitar and drums do.  He understood exactly where he needed to be every step of the way and his sound was very evident.  From the moment I heard Badco when I was 15 I have never found a more raw and straight forward energized sounding band.  Simplicity in their music is why they are so appealing.  This album has met my approval almost every day for over 8 years and i'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B00005A46T|5.0|This release from Slipknot is a great piece of musical art.  I think people try to hard to compare and analyze when it comes to music.  In reality, music is meant to be felt.  People tend to point to the fact that the band uses their image to boost sales and popularity.  Who gives a s***!  Just listen, dont look.  It's great.  The end.
B000AARKOO|1.0|I wanted to like this movie going in. I saw the previews for it and it looked good, then I rented it and with-in 30 min. I wanted to return it and get my money back. This film is horribly boring. ...Pass!!
B000BGH22W|3.0|I was disappointed to learn that John Williams would not be scoring this movie, as many Harry Potter fans were.  I tried to keep an open mind when listening to Patrick Doyle's work on this film, but it was impossible to avoid comparisons.  Doyle had an especially tough act to follow in my book, since the score for \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban\\" has become my favorite John Williams score to date because of the variety of musical styles used.    For \\"Prisoner of Askaban,\\" Williams only used one theme from his previous two Harry Potter scores, \\"Hedwig's Theme,\\" which has doubled for Harry's theme throughout; the rest of the score was entirely new, so I wasn't too surprised to see the same thing done with \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  Doyle borrowed only \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" from Williams, choosing to play it in a slightly more minor key (it was minor already).  It works for the darkness of this story.    What makes Williams' scores so interesting to listen to is that he writes a theme for every major character and situation.  The themes are then played in many variations to convey different moods.  Doyle also does this, but not to the same extent as Williams.    One very positive thing I can say is that the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" music is chronological on the CD, with the exception of the three Weird Sisters tracks at the end.  This is one thing about John Williams' soundtracks that drives me nuts.  You can shuffle tracks around of course, but with Williams, the music often jumps from one place in the story to another within the same track.  For one who pays attention to where in the story the music belongs, this is extremely frustrating.      I will digress from the symphonic portions of the CD for a moment and say that I like the Weird Sisters tracks.  They are different tempos and interesting, especially the last two.  \\"This Is the Night\\" has a cool triplet thing at the end.  \\"Magic Works\\" has great lyrics that remind us all that even in a dangerous world, one of the bravestthings you can do is to open yourself up to the one you love.  These two songs work in the Muggle world, unlike \\"Do the Hippogriff,\\" which sounds like Billy Idol using every wizard clich in the book.  Still, it has grown on me.  It worked perfectly for the fun party atmosphere at the ball.    This CD has high points throughout, with several beautifully written pieces, but this is not consistent.  For the darker scenes, and of course there were many, Doyle mainly used one short \\"riff\\" for lack of a better word.  The melody is no more than two measures long.  It is effective in setting a dark and dangerous mood, but it is not very interesting.  There is also a sort of \\"triumph\\" theme, which is basically a major version of the \\"dark and dangerous\\" music.  In spite of this, the triumphant music is much more effective, in part because it is not used as much.    Fortunately, even with the chronological order, the dark and dangerous parts are broken up with some delightful themes.  Highlights include \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive,\\" which has the airy theme for the Beauxbatons carriage and the majestic theme for Durmstrang's ship (which reminds me a bit of \\"Finlandia\\" in reverse).  Also \\"Rita Skeeter,\\" whose theme is more for her quick quill than for Skeeter herself, is fun.  \\"Neville's Waltz\\" and \\"Potter Waltz\\" are both well written and interesting, but I got bored with \\"Harry in Winter,\\" which was too simple and repetitive.  \\"Underwater Secrets\\" was great.  Doyle didn't use \\"Moaning Myrtle's Theme,\\" but the music he wrote is perfect for the fun and slightly naughty Myrtle.  The egg's clue is a simple melody and just right.  \\"Hogwarts' March\\" is also well written.  I find it running through my head after listening to it, which I don't mind at all.    There is a theme that is used early in the soundtrack, which I thought was Voldemort's theme, but I heard it where Voldemort and his followers were absent, and I didn't hear it much in the \\"Voldemort\\" sequence at all.  Too bad, because that track goes on for nearly ten minutes, most of which is spent on the same boring two-measure riff that has already been overused throughout.  This is Doyle's biggest mistake with this score because Voldemort, of all people, is worthy of his own theme.   He also would have done well to write different themes for the three tasks to give each a unique feel.      The ending of the \\"Voldemort\\" track and the three tracks that follow do much to redeem this CD.  The music that scores the Priori Incantatem effectively gives that  moment the proper mixture of triumph and tragedy.  Harry's grief is conveyed perfectly in \\"Death of Cedric.\\"  \\"Another Year Ends\\" plays as Harry watches the students from the three schools saying their goodbyes.  The track ends with the exit of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons.  \\"Hogwarts' Hymn,\\" with it's hopeful but subdued mood, is the perfect ending to this CD (Even though it's a jolt to do so, I prefer to play the Weird Sisters where they would fall in the story - between \\"Potter Waltz\\" and \\"Underwater Secrets.\\").    Although, I'm glad I bought this CD and Patrick Doyle's score is effective, I do hope that John Williams will return to score the next movie.
0307276902|4.0|Hey, Oprah says it is still a good book, so isn't that enough.  Sure it is sold as non-fiction, which means it is true.  And sure it is proven that he made up stories, even put himself in the center of a story involving the tragic loss of a real person.  But why should that matter?  The guy has to make some money selling books, and if he didn't embellish the truth would it have sold?   <br /> <br />Listen to Oprah folks, she knows books.
B000784WMW|4.0|I received this version of Jane Eyre for Christmas, having never seen it before.  My first time through, I was disappointed in the cinematography and felt at times that I was watching a play rather than a movie.  (Having been a HUGE fan of A&E's Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, my standards were set pretty high and this version of Jane Eyre could not compare.)  BUT, I have watched this movie several more times and find that I like it better each time.  This is by far the best version available.      The acting is VERY GOOD.  Timothy Dalton plays a great Rochester.  True he is handsome, but in a rugged sort of way.  I thought he played the many sides of Rochester's character very well.  Zelah Clarke was a pretty good Jane, (although I would have liked to see her show a little more emotion during some of the scenes).    The others in the cast were very good too.  Many of the characters were just as I imagined them to be.  In particular, I thought the actor who played ST John Rivers looked and played the part perfectly.      I enjoyed watching many of the scenes from the book that tend to get cut in the other versions (the gypsy scene and Jane begging in Whitcross for example) and much of the dialogue comes straight from the book.       Despite the poor (or dated) cinematography, everything else about the movie was really very good and I highly recommend it.
0064409422|5.0|Last year I read The Magician's Nephew, the first in the sequel, which I enjoyed immensely.  Although I knew the storyline for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I had never read it before.  I found C.S. Lewis' style of writing descriptive and creative which really held my interest throughout the story.  Narnia and its whimsical characters were vividly illustrated in my mind through his colorful and expressive words.  The \\"good vs. evil\\" theme is apparant throughout the story which increased my emotional involvement. I encourage others to read this book and travel to the magical world of Narnia with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy!

B00027JZ3E|4.0|The Lost Boys is a cool teen horror flick directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever) and starring the Coreys, Haim and Feldman (License To Drive), Keifer Sutherland (Young Guns), Dianne Weist (Bullets Over Broadway), and Jason Patric (Sleepers). <br /> <br />Weist plays a single mother who arrives with her two boys, Michael and Sam, played by Patric and Haim, to California to start a new life. Immediately upon arrival, Michael is initiated by a group of young vampires to become one of them on the account of his admiration of one of the girls in their cult, played by Jami Gertz. Sutherland plays the leader of the vampires, David, who is as creepy as the best of them. Sam discovers his brother is turning into a vampire after getting tips on how to identify a vampire from the Frog brothers, played hilariously by Feldman and Jamison Newlander, who work as vampire killers, and he struggles to fight the bloodsuckers who are targetting his whole family. <br /> <br />The movie is funny, dark, slick, and scary. It's also one of the more famous movies that paired the Coreys, and one of their best. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B <br />
1400043662|2.0|I tried to like this book i honestly did. I had heard great things and thought this would be for me, but ultimately it drove me nuts. I have no problems with complicated and surreal narratives, but with this book the whole thing just seemed pointless. It's not that i didn't GET the point, i just didn't see the need for the journey to wander so aimlessly along to get there (and with so much repetition and mundane characters) <br />I only finished this book to finish it. I shant be reading anymore Murakami - enough said.
B00005YUPO|1.0|I purchased Vol. 1 which is a series of 6 Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, World Animals, Neighborhood Animals)for my baby when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months old, and she has never cared for any of them EXCEPT for the Neighborhood Animals DVD which depicts scenes of familiar animals like cows, horses, cats, dogs, etc. She really loves the part when they sing \\"Old MacDonald\\". The other titles, including Baby Bach, are downright boring. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is over-rated. I could put on a better puppet show myself using the toys in my living room. I think a lot of folks, including myself, were intrigued by the catchy \\"Baby Einstein\\" name, because we all want to raise little Einsteins. I'm sure the folks at Baby Einstein are laughing all the way to the bank! I haven't seen some of the other titles like Van Gogh, Numbers Nursery, Shakespeare, etc., so I don't know if these are any better, but with all the money i'm out on Vol.1, I won't be giving Baby Einstein another chance. We much prefer the Brainy Baby and Baby's First Impressions (predecessor of the Brainy Baby series) series of products. But, to each his own. <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|\\"Illinois\\" is a kind of album that in more than one way or another has to pass the test of time in order to be considered a masterwork.....sadly that is the way history of rock and roll and the estimation of its most significant albums are judged by. i can only name about a couple of albums in the history of rock that were called masterpieces about the sametime of its realease and they both came from the beatles. \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" \\"Revolver\\" and pink floyd's \\"dark side of the moon\\", even \\"Pet Sounds\\". other than those albums, all others had to wait a significant period to enter that \\"club\\". i imagine that every artist's intention on music is to make a timeless record that could stand the test of time in music itself and well \\"illinois\\" is on that path even though it is still a young cub and the support of the album hasn't yet to reach a wider audience. but music is like that, sometimes what's popular isn't always artistic, sometimes what's artistic isn't always popular. i figure that \\"illinois\\" still has to wait less than ten years for it's significance to grow along with Sufjan's proceeding work that has yet to exist. but for those who believe this record is a masterpiece as of lately, all we can say and think is that to live at a time when artistical music isn't as popular as it used to be has to be a blessing not only to appreciate this kind of music but to grow along with music like this. there are other artists who's talents will grow cause of \\"ILLINOIS\\" and that has to be another big intention of any artist out there. i only hope this album isn't forgotten and that with passing time, like all hopeful music and artists, can unleash its greatest idea.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|If you are considering buying/renting/watching \\"The Straight Story\\", you should know that people are not lying when they tell you that it is nothing but an old guy (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to make a 300+ mile trip on his small riding lawnmower. He meets a lot of nice ordinary people, he dispenses a little sage advice, he reflects a little on his life, and nothing much happens to him. It is closely based on a real event that was newsworthy not because of what happened to Alvin Straight on his journey, but because of the human-interest angle of a guy making a journey in such a unique way.    David Lynch does a nice job of directing this Disney production, but do not expect a lot of wild expressionistic developments.    A lot of people really like this film and a lot of other people are asking, \\"why do people like this movie so much\\"? And they are the polite ones. Less polite ones are branding the film \\"manipulative\\" which seems like a strange criticism for a film. Aren't they supposed to be manipulative? Don't people watch films to be manipulated? If you insist on viewing \\"The Straight Story\\" and if you generally know what you are getting into, you should enjoy it. If you are looking for its deeper meanings I suggest that you watch it along with Monte Hellman's \\"Two Lane Blacktop\\". Both are road pictures and Alvin Straight's orientation as a young man was probably not much different than the driver (James Taylor) in that film. The difference is the stage of life in which the journey is being taken. Both have an intended destination. But for the driver in \\"Two Lane Blacktop\\" it is just a excuse to keep on the move, the highway stretches out endlessly before him and life is a journey not a destination. For Straight it is a single-minded trip that he views as his last chance to mend fences with his brother who has just had a serious stroke. It is very likely the last trip he will ever make but he does not savor the journey, he does not take satisfactionin overcoming obstacles, or even find much pleasure in his positive encounters with strangers. For him the destination is all important.    This was Farnsworth's last picture, in declining health he committed suicide by gunshot a few months after the film's release. One can't help but speculate on whether he was aware during filming that \\"The Straight Story\\" would be the final act in his long career, and how much of that realization was incorporated into his performance.    Straight's journey is a lot like that of Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) in \\"The Swimmer\\". Merrill got it into his head that he could restore things to how they were in his idyllic past if he could just swim home one afternoon through the backyards of his wealthy Connecticut suburb, using his neighbors' pools. Straight is not that delusional but he has come to believe that his brother will remain alive and be waiting for him as long as he stubbornly sticks to his original idea of traveling by mower.    His other motivation for insisting on this means of travel (he won't take a bus and he turns down a ride for the last 60 miles) is to demonstrate how sincerely he wants to reconcile. If you give someone a horse it will be a lot more impressive if it is your only horse and it means that now you will have to walk. To walk is part of the gift.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
0064409422|5.0|What begins as a small game of hide-and-seek turns into an adventure when Lucy hides in a wardrobe that takes her into the land of Narnia. As Lucy enters the land of Narnia she sees a lamppost and walking next to that was a faun named Mr. Tumnus. When Lucy tells Mr. Tumnus that she has to go, she goes back through the wardrobe and tells her sister and two brothers Peter, Susan, and Edmund. When Lucy tells Peter, Susan, and Edmund about her trip to Narnia and meeting a faun named Mr. Tumnus Peter tells Lucy to stop her pretending. Lucy tries to tell them that she is not lying, but they didn't believe her. When Lucy re-enters the wardrobe to see Mr. Tumnus, Edmund follows and meets the Evil White Witch.  Then when Lucy sees Edmund in Narnia she asks why he is in Narnia he doesn't answer and just say lets just get out of here and both leave together.  <br />     When Lucy tells the others that Edmund saw the land Narnia Edmund lies and says that he didn't go. Then finally Lucy takes the others in the land Narnia to meet Mr. Tumnus, but Mr. Tumnus was not there. Some beavers tell Lucy where he was and had to hide from the White Witch and wait for Aslan, the great lion. When they meet Aslan he tells the kids that they have to defeat the White Witch in war. When Edmund disappears to see the White Witch she keeps him hostage and wont let him go. Will Peter, Susan, and Lucy be able to get Edmund from the White Witch? Will Aslan the great lion help the kids defeat the evil White Witch? What will happen to Aslan and Mr. Tumnus? <br />     I loved the book and thought it was great. I encourage anyone to read the book and the rest of the enchanted world The Chronicles of Narnia. There seven books in all: <br />The Magician's Nephew <br />The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe <br />The Horse and His Boy <br />Prince Caspian <br />The Voyage of the Dawn Treader <br />The Silver Chair <br />The Last Battle <br />

B000AP04FG|2.0|Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met \\"on the job\\", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same \\"job\\" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film.
0307276902|1.0|As someone who read A Million Little Pieces 2 years ago and loved it (and recommended it to others), I'm quite angry.  What made the book beautiful was that Frey took his truth and told it in a way that made it beautiful.  Frankly, it's easy to make a beautiful fictional moment--change a detail, add an image.  Any bad poet can tell you that.  Frey's writing style is sub-par--too chock full of errors to be taken seriously, too tame to be considered \\"experimental.\\"  In short, Frey's a fraud.  As a work of fiction, his \\"novel\\" isn't worth the hype. <br /> <br />Instead of buying this book, try Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried, a work about the Vietnam War full of death, beauty, violence, and horror.  O'Brien talks about the difference between Reality and Story Truth and makes the case that Story Truth can tell the truth more accurately than mere facts.  Unlike Frey, O'Brien explores this contradiction and the ramifications it has for the writer.  It makes his story, his truth, all the more significant.   <br /> <br />
B000003TAB|5.0|I thought Incesticide showed a much more raw side of Nirvana that I prefer.  The Molly's Lips cover and Anerurysm are awesome.  It is also cool because it contains some of their late 80s stuff as well as some more recent stuff w/ Grohl @ the drums. <br /> <br />Good stuff...well worth it.
1591396190|5.0|It moves away from military strategy of winning the war against the competition and introduces a whole different way of thinking into mainstream business strategy and practice. Most successful companies in the last 100 years have used the blue ocean strategy successfully to their advantage, but it has been regarded more as a deviation, a fluke, than an actual business stratey that belongs to mainstream and can be used by every business in every industry. In its core it is also in line with a more spiritual way of living and doing business that will have to prevail if we intend to live on this planet past the year 2100.
B0000025F7|5.0|Don't get it twisted, Thriller is a better album than Off the Wall. But Off the Wall is his most passionate, consistent and effortless work. Mike came alive when he got the opportunity to do it for dolo. The whole album is a Pop and R & B standard. My favorites are Rock with you(The Shiznit), Off the Wall(The Shiznit), Cant Help It(Classic), Burn this disco out, Get on the Floor, Dont stop till you get enough(Untouchable), Working day and night, It's the falling in love, and Girlfriend. Musically and artistically no one comes close to Mike. Even Biggie said it, \\"Some nights I perform like Mike - anyone Tyson, Jordan, Jackson, Action\\". Hopefully, Mike and Quincy Jones will wise up and give the world one more classic.
0316172324|3.0|The premise presented in Blink is interesting, and Gladwell certainly spins the research to support his position that the \\"gut\\" decisions we make are often the most important. However, Gladwell does little to make his point through the examples he uses, as he uses illustrations of individuals making decisions in their respective fields who have years and years of experience. OF COURSE these people will tend to make better/on-the-fly decisions than someone with little or no experience.<br /><br />This book read like a lengthy case study, supported by chapters of research and examples; not to mention, repetition - to drive his point home. The concept of Blink may have been better presented a'la three-part article series in Time Magazine or another consumer-facing publication. As a book, it seems to drag on unnecessarily.
0553328255|5.0|I have known about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson through T.V. and movies but I have never read the stories so one day I decided to buy a book with all of their stories. I saw a few different ones some were big or fancy or they were hardcover which made them a little expensive and I was only interested in the stories and not the book itself. Then I came across this cheap 2 book edition which comes in a thin case. The cases that Sherlock Holmes try to solve are usually intersting or odd and very few of them deal with murder. Sometimes it gets confusing with all the clues and information but that's not too big of a problem for me because I just get caught up in the story. Most of the stories are told from Dr. Watson's standpoint who unlike his T.V. counterpart isn't overweight and he doesn't get in the way of things but instead he is thin and quite the ladies man. Sherlock Holmes is also a very interesting character and is very intelligent but lacks simple knowledge in things that don't concern his profession, he takes cocaine and is at times full of himself.       So if you're interested in reading all of Sherlock Holmes's stories at a cheap price then you should get this 2 volume edition.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris is in usual form in this great collection of  short stories that loosely assembled tell the tale of his life from adolesence to adulthood. \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" hit so close to home, I couldn't decide if I was more shocked or amused by his rendition. Sedaris' self-deprecating writing style is so sardonic, yet so amusing; it's almost scary to think of someone with that low-self esteem level might be capable of if he used his power for evil instead channeling it all into a creative writing outlet. At any rate, he is capable of spinning an entertaining tale - even in situations where most of us would not see the humor.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is awsome.  A great mix of sci-fi and the wild west, which gives a great frontier and mystery to each episode as you try and guess what trouble they run into next.  This show rocks.
1400031087|5.0|I did not buy this book because I am an addict, or because I know an addict; nor did I buy it because it was a \\"true\\" story.  If anything, the subject matter normally would have turned me off.  But I picked the book up, scanned a few pages and found a totally new way of writing.  Absent of fluff, the dialogue pulls the reader in, and as with magical realism, takes the reader on a trip they never expected.    Frey's unconventional method of writing has been called short and choppy, a morris code of literature, but he uses words and ideas that allow the reader to \\"be there\\" and that is the point of telling a story.  The reason so many have said that they couldn't put it down is precisely for this reason.  The reader enters Frey's world, his brain, perceives as he perceives, and  regardless of his message, they find themselves understanding, relating.  Long after the book has been set aside, the words are haunting, remaining with the reader in the short, staccato rhythm in which it was written.    [...] Frey's experience in rehab, his battles with the past and his addiction, are real and enlightening.

B00005ASHM|3.0|People that were not around in 1966 have been sold a bill of goods about this so-called masterpiece.  Rather than foreseeing \\"Sgt Peppers,\\" Brian Wilson was just trying to keep up with \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver.\\"  Not that anybody could.  But \\"Pet Sounds\\" would have had a hard time among the top-10 of that year.  How about \\"Revolver\\" \\"Aftermath\\" \\"Fresh Cream\\" \\"Freak Out\\" \\"Byrds 5D\\" \\"Velvet Undergound & Nico\\" \\"Love\\" Van Morrison's Bang album, \\"Face to Face\\" by the Kinks...and a regional masterpiece \\"Psychedelic Sounds\\" by the 13th Floor Elevators, all of which made the Boys sound pretty tame.  And it hasn't improved with new-generation hype...    If you've never heard of some of these and you think \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a masterpiece, you might want to give em a listen...    and some of the early 60's Boys albums, when they were still a hot-car, beach-bunny-hunting bunch, are definitely worth a listen for the innocence and great harmony (and hot cars and beach bunnies.)  I had a stack of BB 45s in the day, so I was certainly a fan but they were passe for me by 1966, I've always hated Good Vibrations in particular.)  jimi99
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi, cowboys, humor, or action.  This movie has everything and then some!  I didn't find this little jewel until after it was out on DVD, but I am so glad I found it.  I have bought the Firefly DVD set and Serenity, and wearing out my DVD player watching them over and over.
068987474X|5.0|My sister first recommended this book to me and I dismissed her and it by thinking I didn't need it.  A few months through two separate incidences (I kept running into it), I finally picked it up and read it on a plane.  The bells started ringing immediately for me and I will personally recommend this to anyone who is dating (male or female).  It answers a lot of questions (WHY doesn't he call?) and never leaves you wondering where a guy stands.  This book made perfect sense to me and even better, there is nothing condescending about it; the super smart authors know people are smart and don't make any bones about it. I never thought I'd read a book that spoke to me in such a wonderful practical way.  I truly recommend this!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of or watched Firefly while it was on TV.  When the movie was released I was compelled to get on-line and read about the show.  We received the DVD set for Christmas and watched the entire set in just a few days.  This is a quality show with adventure and good stories.  Its a shame that the show was cancelled when there was much left to learn about the characters.  I have yet to see the movie, but I will order it next.  I think the numbers Amazon has seen regarding this series should send a message to the creators that people would snatch up more episodes or movies!!
0307276902|5.0|[...] This is an excellent book and well worth reading [...].  Whether you have been involved in drugs or alcohol, had a stint in rehab or not, it truly strikes a cord, you can really feel the pain that all of the characters are going through and how they all help each other to try and become the person that they want to be.  I have recommended this to many people and will continue to do so.  I could not put it down and it left me thinking about it long after I was done.
0307276902|4.0|[...] This book was excellent, though recieves only four stars because of the unecessarily excessive use of the \\"F\\" word. It is a great tale of winning the impossible struggle of man vs. himself.  What is important to remember is that memoirs are not classified as non-fiction works for one very good reason: no one remembers every word or detail exactly as it was. This was a fantastic, inspiring memoir, and can be enjoyed by any adult reader (I would not recommend this to anyone who is offended by the content generally found in R rated movies).
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This is one of my favourite \\"cheesy\\" movies of the 1980s, and it hasn't lost its humour or entertainment value in the years since it was in theatres.  The only problem I had with this was that there is no captioning available.  This isn't a problem for most of the population, but if you have trouble hearing movies and need captions, don't by this version.  For everyone else: this is a great price on a delightful, though lightweight, movie.
B000000OU0|5.0|Eagles has the sound, charisma, and personalites to kick<br /><br />other group`s in the \\"same area\\" way out there, when it come`s to pure, let`s called it \\"eargasm\\". It realy get you goin` into the right mood with Track 1 Get over It. A fast, good rockin\\" light fuzz guitar driven rock & roll tune with a Don Henley voice just right there where you want it. But the best one on this  CD, is Track 2: Love will keep us alive, with Timothy B Schmidt on vocal. It`s honest, well krafted, and something to think about for each of us. Simple and say so much: Love will keep us alive. A very suprising effort \\"should have been a great hit\\" this one up there with the others oldies and goodies you find on this CD. Track 3 The Girl from Yesterday  and Track 4 Learn to be Still, is ok tracks. And after that the rest of the bunch is goodies and oldies from the Eagles catalouge. Quality all over, not too much more to say in that department. But the<br /><br />overall sound on this CD is very well produced, and should even kick life into the cheapest stereo sorround players which are around all over the world. Eagles at his best. This is it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac is one of the greatest rappers there has been and probably ever will be. Unlike many rappers today 2pac has substance in his music. This is a classic album and if you like rap/hip-hop music then I highly reccomend this album to you.
B000001FA4|5.0|What a great CD! The songs that appeal to most listeners may well be Pride and Bad, but the pure emotion Bono rings out of \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" can't be denied. It is one of my favorite U2 tracks of all time. The Edge and Adam sound amazingly in sync with Larry throughout the cd, yet it sounds more like a comfortable jam session rather than a cd of take after take.
B000002J03|5.0|I fell in love with this album in high school, 17 years ago, a lot of us were Led fans but for only their famous fourth untitled album. Well, I'm here to tell you that is not my favorite Zeppelin album, this one is and I'll tell you why, pure bluesy rock and roll at its very best, with the tendency to sound a lot like heavy metal, because it's the birth of it, and it shows. From Whole Lotta Love, to Bring It On Home, and the in betweens like my favorite Zeppelin tune Lemon Song, just pure brilliant guitar work on this track. Heartbreaker is good number too, just wild and crazy guitar playing 101 stuff here. I think if Jimmy Page was not ever born, there would not be Metallica or Megadeath, both bands I like too. But then again you do have other good guitarist out there, he's not the only one, but pretty close to the top 5 indeed. But if you want to grip onto some good rock and roll and get blown away, get this album it is very much worth it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't normally write reviews on these things, and i believe that, in most cases, people's opinions on subjects like music should not be given unless solicited.  However, I saw some reviews that were totally rediculous, and being a musician (i play mostly jazz, so if you think i am a mindless radiohead deciple, then you are dumb) i feel obligated to put these hacks in their place.    Ok Computer is a subtle statement of virtuosity. From purely a technical standpoint, its not all that incredible.  The feel of the album is another story. The level of personality that the band, Thom Yorke in particular, provides the kind of loose, dreary feeling that is charistic of the album.  One reviewer I saw claimed that he didn't like the album because of their ability to \\"function without anti-depresants\\". Looking past the BLATENT insult to those suffering from depression (a low blow that surely no educated person would use) the nature of the lyrics isnt depressing. They aren't even sad. They are insightful and briliant.     There was a review by a user named MTV supporter, saying that the songs had no choruses(!). Anyone who supports MTV as a musical force is an IGNORAMUS!!! That aside, almost all of the songs have EASILY recognizable choruses, calling into question both the intelligance of this \\"reviewer\\", and his first grade education. Also, I read his other reviews,  and he gave Avril Lavine, Good Charlotte, an 50 cent 5 stars (how embarising) while dismising Jimi Hendrix as the worst guitarist ever, citing a friend who can play his stuff easily. Well, this moron conviently ignores the fact that virtually ALL post Hendrix musicians (not just guitar players) are obviously influenced by him. More on Hendrix later. Also, the fact that Thom doesnt articulate like that bogus fake Britany Spears doesnt make him a bad singer. He's different. Deal with it.     I can understand people giving Ok Computer a 4. Thats fair. Giving it a 1 because you cant understand it is unfair to the artist. Great album. 5 stars.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Never was a big fan of Elvis, but this album is the exception. Thirty hits from the king with an extra bonus song A Little Less Conversation. I liked his older stuff, but started getting sick of him after the Burning Love era, after that he just got too Las Vegas for me. His older stuff like Heartbreak Hotel and Hound Dog, or even Love Me Tender, pretty good right there. He was there when rock and roll started indeed. My favorite by him is Suspicious Minds, good track right there. Yes this is the perfect album for you moderate listeners of Elvis, but I still think that Chuck Berry should have been the king of rock and roll, and he's still alive, as a matter of fact, I think he turns 80 this year.
0920668372|5.0|This is truly a classic tale of unconditional love between mother and child.  The first time I heard this story , it was read aloud  at a workshop I attended about 13 years ago,when my oldest child was about a year old. I immediatly ran out and purchased the book.  I'll never forget my husband and I reading it together, both crying, and my husband does not cry easily!  I also bought a copy of it for my mother and my mother in law and presented it to them on Mother's Day.  \\"I'll love you forver, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\" are words which will soon be a part of your vocabulary after you own this book.  A must have for all new parents and their growing children!
B000002KOO|5.0|I heard about recently that BB King put this man before Clapton as far as guitar playing goes, well I still like Clapton, he's one of my favorites, but I also have to say he had a run for the money as far as this album goes the reason, Peter Green, awesome guitar playing here. Love every song on this album from the beginning to the very end with Before The Beginning. The song that sticks out on this set for me is Show Biz Blues, love that southern pickin' blues there, almost like fresh from the depression. Oh Well but ofcourse, unfortionately the radio station only plays the first few minutes of the song, and totally skips that classical guitar feel near the end of the song. Coming Your Way almost sounds as though it came from Santana during their Abraxas album session. The effort in this album really shows, they put a lot of ephasis here. So if you're looking for a different feel of Fleetwood Mac, well here it is, six years before Lindsay Buchingham and Stevie Nicks were even thought of or before Mick Fleetwood decided to move his Mac from England to LA, this is the 1969 Fleetwood Mac, ENJOY.
1565117700|5.0|Besides being a great classic, (I wont review the book because most people have done that here), Gary Sinese's reading is flawless!  He's on top of my list for Audiobook readers.  He does all of the different character voices masterfully! You wont be disapointed.<br /><br />Bottomline: if you haven't got the time to read the book, Gary will engage you.
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton is blues to his very Robert Johnson soul. There is a reason this album got 5 grammy's, it was pure and true, straight to the heart Eric Clapton singing and playing the blues music. He just touches ground on the roots of blues with Nobody Knows you... classic done by many but done best by Clapton. Layla, this version I would have to respect better than the original, I think he really poured his heart into this number this time. Running On Faith, awesome, Lonely Stranger has got to be my favorite on this album set, he really got into this number, as well as he did with the rest. This album is a keeper and a must, definitely for Clapton fans out there. Let your mind ease a little for some pure BLUES POWER.
0307276902|3.0|I'm honestly not surprised by this outcome.  Its sad that he felt the need to \\"embellish\\" to the extent of complete fabrication.  It was originally written as a work of fiction and one cannot help but wonder, how much of that remains as such. Its also too bad he felt the need to use a the death of a \\"friend\\" for dramatic effect.  For those of you who deem his misdeeds as minor or irrelevant to the overall point of his story (supposedly recovery) OPRAH...I say lie in what is small, lie likewise in big.  He flat out and repeatedly attempts to portray himself as \\"a criminal\\" which is a large portion of the overall tone of the book.  Subjective memory.  It was a good read, however I will not be spending my money on any of his future books, should there be any.
B000002UAR|5.0|Love it love it love it. My favorite Lennon songs are on here, the UK version of this album Revolver, I'm Only Sleeping, love the backward guitar. Tomorrow Never Knows best all time song by the Beatles, the looping, the insanity, everything, elements are definitely here. George becoming Indian here Love You To, love sitars. Paul's Eleanor Rigby, weird, perfect. Pure psychedellic options all over this album. Including a children song Yellow Submarine, sung by Ringo. My all time favorite Beatle album, and will always LOVE IT.
B0006399FS|2.0|I bought U2's \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" along with the latest from Deep Purple, called \\"Rapture of the Deep\\". Two of my all time favorites with new releases...YES!!! I had high hopes for U2, but not really for DP. As it turned out, I was kind of disappointed with \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" but loved, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\". The bands best work since the reunion.<br /><br />U2 just doesn't sound very inspired this time around. They frankly sound too complacent. But Deep Purple sound hungry, powerful, a very inspired album! Both discs have good enough sound quality and production, but listening to these two bands, Deep Purple clearly have something special going on right now. U2's songwriting seems weaker than their last album for example, but a few bright spots shine through. On the other hand, all eleven songs on \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" are top notch and have much more meat on the bone than U2's latest. It's just my opinion, but the new Purple shows me that these old rockers still have a lot to offer.<br /><br />U2/How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb: 2 1/2 stars<br />Deep Purple/Rapture of the Deep: 5 stars
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The soundtrack is perfect for this movie.  It reflects the lonesome beauty of the Wyoming wildnerness and the emotion of the two main characters.  Really really good.  This is Oscar material.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have to respectfully disagree with the first reviewer. <br /> <br />While the comparison is inevitable, I fear the wrong conclusion has been drawn. While the 1995 version is groundbreaking, the modern update is breathtaking. The scenery, the costumes, the dialouge, the casting all work cohesively with only another. <br /> <br />Keira Knightly's potrayl of perhaps the most poignant fictional heroine in \\"romantic\\" literature is flawless. I like, many other people, was not impressed by Matthew MacFadyen when I saw the preview; however, he was the perfect Fitzwilliam Darcy. Dark, mysterious and brooding in a more love struck fashion than Mr. Firth plays him. (Though, let it be said, I will ALWAYS love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy). <br /> <br />This film felt more like a continual thought than nthe 1995 version which, after all, is meant as a mini series. I loved every minute of it, and have seen it in the theater 3 times. As a lover of Jane Austen and the beauty of Pride & Prejudice this is a must own film.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|John le Carr&eacute;'s novel THE CONSTANT GARDENER is one of his finer suspense/spy/thriller stories and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine kept the story and the technique of telling it intact in this successful film.  Director Fernando Meirelles was an excellent choice for director, bringing a fresh new look to Hollywood actions movies, a look that involves camera work, atmosphere, mirrors to society, and use of actors and vistas of Africa to drive the message behind this story home.<br /><br />Proper High Commissioner Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) serves his British government with the same diligence with which he tends his garden of potted plants.  He is a constant diplomat and a constant gardener, never veering from his mission - until he meets mouthy smart rebellious Tessa (Rachel Weisz) in a classroom where he has literally 'read' a lecture for an absentee professor.  Her rage at the Establishment is calmed by Justin's quiet manner and in no time they have bedded, courted  and are on their way to an assignment in Kenya.  Once in Africa Tessa's forthright manner embarrasses everyone connected with government, but the couple are happy and trusting, and the now- pregnant Tessa discovers a secret plot for the unmonitored testing of an anti-tuberculosis drug (a threat of a mutant form of TB that will annihilate much of the world's population is the justification) on unknowing people of Kenya.  Tessa rails against the concept of human guinea pigs, finds a colleague in a Kenyan doctor Arnold (Hubert Kound&eacute;) and together they, undercover, investigate the connection between the drug company manufacturing the drug and the governments of England and Kenya. While proper Justin is keeping the peace with his confr&egrave;res Sandy (Danny Huston) and Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) and nurturing Tessa after they lose their pregnancy. Tessa's rage is inflamed and while off on an assignment with Arnold she is brutally murdered (and Arnold is likewise brutally tortured and crucified).  Justin's world is shaken and his constancy is reversed in taking up where Tessa left off - working to uncover the truth about the scandalous coups. From here the story speeds along with twists and turns and the ending is unexpected.<br /><br />Meirelles captures both the suffocating stifle of British politics and the breathtaking majesty and poverty of Kenya with uncanny skill.  His lighting is all natural and the camera work is basically hand held, intensifying the credibility of the story of a few people against enormous odds - medically, socially, and in the seething corruption of the governments.  He balances the tension by the use of flashbacks to moments when Justin and Tessa were courting and making love and living  and laughing, and these non-linear techniques offer breathing space for the story's propulsive drive.  The actors are superb: this is his finest role for Fiennes in years and for once Weisz is given a character into whom she can breathe all of her expertise as an actress.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws in the story and some holes of information that could use patching, but in the final result this is a movie of power, of message, and of technical finesse that makes it one of the finer of the year.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06shaken and his constancy is reversed in taking up where Tessa left off - working to uncover the truth about the scandalous coups.

He balances the tension by the use of flashbacks to moments when Justin and Tessa were courting and making love and living  and laughing, and these non-linear techniques offer breathing space for the story's propulsive drive.  The actors are superb: this is his finest role for Fiennes in years and for once Weisz is given a character into whom she can breathe all of her expertise as an actress.    Yes, there are flaws in the story and some holes of information that could use patching, but in the final result this is a movie of power, of message, and of technical finesse that makes it one of the finer of the year.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06
B00005JOII|2.0|This was by far one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Most of the audience began walking out before the movie was over and the remaining audience stood up as soon as the credits began to roll - it was as if they could not wait until it was over. I kept trying to convince my companion that the good part was coming - but it never arrived.<br /><br />While it was not necessarily predictable, it wasn't that complex either - there was either option A or option B and there was nothing about the character that made you care one way or another.  I would not recommend this movie.  Wait until it shows up on cable!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Das Boot is an epic film that is very well done. I loved the suspense and terrific character moments. The thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a Nazi U-boat in the midst of the Atlantic during 1941 WWII. Going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean. The three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film.<br /><br />This movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me.<br /><br />In viewing the DVD, I chose to turn on English Subtitles while also selecting the English 2.0 spoken language. What is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements. I'm talking about the line that, in German, reads something like \\"I can't wait to get back home and f**k the h*ll out of a few wild wh**es!\\" is rewritten and dubbed as \\"When I get home I'm going to shower and sleep until December!\\" Quite a drastic change. But of course, sailors in the German Navy use language that I suppose is unacceptable - even in an \\"R\\" rated movie - for English audiences...<br /><br />There are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into English subtitles from the German language spoken in the original dub of the film, while the English dub is totally different. Later in the film, there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the English dub. Very interesting and fun to watch.<br /><br />Even with the subtitles on, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours. This one clocks in at a good four and a half hours! It draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion...<br /><br />One of the best war movies I have ever seen!<br /><br />One of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the Nazi U-boat and we get to see and feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat. The irony occurs when the Allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation. Very intense and dramatic.nd feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat.

B000020617|2.0|My wife and I are avid music afficionados, with over 2,000 rock CD's alone.  I heard so much about the Foo Fighters over the years, that I finally decided to play my wife's CD with an open mind.  My conclusion: this stuff is far from groundbreaking, and sounds like any other predictable cheesy, no-talent garage band that loves to scream and play the same 10 chords over and over.  I like rock that challenges and engages the mind and displays unmistakable song writing craft.  Something this CD does not do in any obvious way.  My feeling is that the kiddies that listen to them are starstruck by Dave Grohl's 'flash-in-the-pan 15 minute' past with Nirvana, and they automatically think his new band is going to be just as great.  Don't waste your money on this formulaic predictable mediocre schlock rock.  Even my wife admitted that she listened to this CD only once, and that she hasn't touched it since!  I wouldn't even use it as a coaster for fear that my drink may sprout legs and 'run away'!!!
B000002UZ1|5.0|I've always been a fan to the later Beatles. The Beatles are a great band, but my favorite song of all their songs is Hey Jude. <br />It is a Beatles epic, and it is one of the best epic songs of all time. The NA-Na repeat makes the song really great with cool screams in it too. Also, I like the other songs like Back in the USSR, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Get Back, Ballad of John and Yoko, & Come Together. Let It Be isn't bad at all. But why didn't they include Birthday? It would have been complete if that song was included. Anyway great product.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I can't believe these guys act like they have something important to say nearly fifteen years after they made it big with the sophomoric one-note fart joke that was Dookie. Why'd Green Day wait so long to release a \\"political\\" album? Because it was convenient. And safe. It's now popular opinion that George W. Bush and his cronies are corrupt bastards. If Green Day were sincerely against a war with Iraq and cared about the world of politics, then they would have come out with this album (or at least voiced their supposed anti-war stance) before the Iraq invasion, while the decision of whether to go into Iraq was being hotly debated in Washington. These debates, discussions, and press conferences from politicians, senators, and even the president himself were all highly televised, but I guess Billie Joe wasn't smart enough to change the channel from Nickelodeon to CSPAN or the evening news back in 2002 when the Iraq war was about to happen. These guys are so uneducated and unaware of the world around them that it's pathetic. Billie Joe can't even creatively express his newly found dissonance. With lines like \\"Bombs away is your punishment/ Pulverize the Eiffel towers/ Bang bang goes the broken glass man\\" so stupid and nonsensical, you'd think they were written by a middle school dropout, which Billie actually is. And even at that, most middle schoolers know there's only one freakin' Eiffel tower, so I wonder what Billie's excuse is. Bottom line: Green Day plays the same 3 chords seen on other Green Day albums, only with \\"political\\" lyrics that manage to be even more braindead than their ones about toking up and masturbating.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|What makes it great??? This movie doesn't rely on special effects to move the story. In other words, the acting is fantastic and intense.

0316096199|3.0|<br />1) Lucky/ Alice Seabold <br />2) Little, Brown & Company, 2002, 272 pages  <br />3) Fiction  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Lucky is a fictional book with a strong message behind it. The book is set in present time in the city of Syracuse at Syracuse University. Alice, the main character, and the one who tells the story in first person, is finishing her first year of college. On her last day there she is coming home from a friend's house and walks through the park, alone, then is raped. After being brutally raped she returns to her dorm where she is then taken to the hospital and then reported her raped. Then the book takes her through her summer getting over the rape and then returning to Syracuse. After she returns she has another encounter with her rapist. He is then taken in, where the book goes through the whole trial.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting as it started. It starts off really well it kept my attention; until the trials started then the book took a downfall. The same thing kept happing over and over and over again. I pushed myself to get through the whole book and I was very satisfied with it. If I was to tell a person one thing about this book it would be it gets slow through the middle but read through it, because in the end you will be satisfied with it.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|2.0|i bought this album because a bunch of old dads have it. <br />the cover is haunting!!!! but why weren't the beatles wearing any shoes? while listening to this album, i kept staring at their feet on the cover. does john lennon have a foot fetish? <br /> <br />what did the beatles have against mr. mustard? why was he sooo mean? did he gun down mr. lennon?  <br /> <br />another question: why didn't ringo ever play the drums in front of the band? why was he always in the back? everyone knows he was the best, he was the only thing that kept the band together. he bought the pot, he wrote the songs, he drummed, he stabbed a baby. why did the beatles hate babies? why did they take a picture of themselves stabbing babies, and then throw it away? why go through all that trouble? did george write a book of dead baby jokes? <br /> <br />why don't you listen to some grown-up albums, like Europop by Eiffel 65. blue (da ba dee)....my fav song ever, next to chocolate starfish and the hotdog flavored water <br /> <br />WHAT A BUNCH OF CRACKHEADS

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Okay, I am a rabid Frith and BBC fan of the miniseries, but I was very impressed with this adaption and found it refershing in it's grounded, youthful take on the story.<br /><br />For starters, there is a very grounded nature to the presentation of the story. Some Austenites got their knickers into a twist because they thought it made the family and their circumstances too drab looking. But I loved it! The Meryton Assembly basically sets the stage for this grounded approach-the dancing looks a little heavy footed, the girls look sweaty, and you can't help but think that someone needs to open a window cause it looks awfully sweaty! But at the same time,it made the story come alive, like you were a fly on the wall, peeking in on Lizzy and Darcy and the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Lastly, I loved the youthful take on the story. I LOVE Firth and Ehle as the '95 leads. They had this chemistry and sensual tension that was electric! But their take was definitely from a mature standpoint-like the way I'd act now as a 33 year old woman. Whereas Macfadyen and Knightley? Theirs is a more youthful, innocent, first love take that I just took to. Great chemistry, Lizzy's a little less cocksure, Darcy's a bit more unbalanced by this attraction, and it felt right in terms of age and stage of development with the actual characters in the book.<br /><br />Great adaption, brisk storytelling, and a wonderfully irreverent tone by a fun director who knew it was a good idea to knock the pedestal off from under our Lizzy and Darcy, and let them be seen in a more grounded light. And ps-I thought Macfadyen, even though he doesn't have that big of a part, was a great Darcy!
0307276902|5.0|HOLD ON James...this too shall pass! I am not an addict and I absolutly loved this/your book!! I loved your writing style. I loved how you took responsibility for your actions. I loved how you didn't play the victim card...how you trusted your own instincts enough to stand up and do what is right for you (not what society or the powers that be say is the only way to recover or the only correct way to write). Your writing style came thru straight from the heart. Keep up the good work...there will always be those who try to tear down someone who bucks the tide of the tradtional thinking man. <br /> <br />Go out and buy this book today if you haven't already! Oprah stands by her pick and I do too.   <br />

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I did not want to see this movie, thinking it was going to be a stupid love time warp thing. A friend recommended it on the strenghth of how good it was. Skeptical I reluctantly decided to watch it. I can only say I was pleasantly surprised. Basic premise is a Evan, a young boy, blacks out during traumatic events in his childhood. As an adult he realizes that he can actually change the horrors that happened but with a terrible consequence for each change. With any change comes infinite outcomes, as Evan experiences. The cast was awesomely fabulous. The story was quickly paced. I really am embarassed that I let my prejudice keep me from such a great movie. If you liked Donnie Darko this is a great film to see.
B000BTJDGC|1.0|This is a religious propaganda masquerading as horror film. The courtroom scenes were interesting but ridiculous, mostly because the filmmakers try to convince us by any means that this possession really happened. The exorcism sequence is scary (sort of) and thrilling yet too long in my opinion. Jennifer Carpenter does an okay job screaming and making idot funny faces, while Laura Linney's talent is once again waste in a movie that doesn't do her justice.
B000002K9N|5.0|A landmark album by sinatra with a very young Quincy Jones as his arranger/conductor. Most of the arrangements are the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle.The Basie band gives them new life but does not outshine them.  There is a terrible monologue by Sinatra halfway through the album that we really could have done without. However, sitting in my flat in London in the late sixties/early seventies we were very impressed by his humor. The humor or the monologue did not hold up. There are two great tracks by the band on this album but there is a lot of background noise. It is Sinatra's show all the way and a great one it is. He sings a very impressive theme song from the sandpiper. This is an Andy Williams type song but as usual, Sinatra gives it new depth and meaning. One of the highlights of this album is when Sinatra say's \\" I frankly believe that this next song is one of the great american standards\\" and he dives into 'don't worry about me ' without much of a lead in note. Fabulous record. If you don't own it the buy it, if you do then listen to it again.

B00005JNTX|1.0|I've been a Frank Miller fan since I read \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" for a composition seminar at UCLA, so I imagine I was expecting a lot from this film. I was truly disappointed, finding the characters one-dimensional, uninteresting, and completely disagreeable. Add to that a script which did not go anywhere, along with terrible dialogue, and you have that unique sort of creature: the completely myopic, pedestrian action thriller which puts you to sleep.<br /><br />Forget it.
B00005K9QP|4.0|Like I've read in other reviews of this album, this should be titled \\"Eric Clapton Plays the Blues\\".  This album, along with the first 1978 Van Halen album, are the two truly revolutionary rock/blues electric guitar albums.  It set the stage for Hendrix and Jimmy Page.  In early 1966, no one had heard the guitar played in such an aggressive, biting overdriven (mean) style as Clapton plays here.  It knocked everyone's socks off, as did hearing Van Halen play \\"Eruption\\" for the first time in 1978. <br /> <br />I read some people complaining that Clapton hasn't played in this manner since he left Cream - switching from Gibsons to mostly Fender Strats.  I've read that by the time Cream was finished in 1968, Clapton had become tired of playing blasting blues licks at overwhelming volume and wanted to refine his style to a mellower, more subtle country tone.  He had been heavily influenced by Dylan and The Band. <br /> <br />I give this album 4 stars because Mayall and the rest of the band are just average.  The songs are all 12-bar blues, which can get repetitive.  Buy this album for the outstanding guitar work. <br />

B000BVQ9JO|2.0|his week, The Strokes will release their third album, First Impressions of Earth, in hopes of stimulating the electricity they sparked in 2002. Sadly, after a first impression listen through, it seems the Strokes aren't feeling the smoothness of originality. I never heard a \\"single\\" from the 53 minutes of now recognizable distortion vocals and driving beats. I want to like the album. It's just that I've heard these songs before through some amalgamation of other's guitar sounds and downtrodden pop lyrics. The album opens with \\"You Only Live Once\\", a probable take off of the Bond movie opener by Nancy Sinatra, \\"You Only Live Twice\\". I'll admit, it gets the foot tapping soon after the play button is pressed. But, shortly thereafter, my attention is lost. Adderall or none, the second song, \\"Juicebox\\", opens with a dead-on Weezer (\\"Hash Pipe\\") bass drive enveloped in Audioslave background effects (\\"Set It Off\\"). The track soon leads in to a vocal Goth/Pop drone that bears little semblance to the earlier Strokes sound that got them on the cover of SPIN magazine. Other tracks also include hints of various bands. \\"Vision of Division\\" has an appealing free-fall chorus but a recognizable \\"Van halen\\" finger tap lick that does little for a new song on a new album. Overall, the new Stroke's release bears little semblance to a fresh sound needed to want to actually go out and purchase the CD.<br /><br />[...]
B000C65Z1G|5.0|THE CONSTANT GARDNER is one of those films that sneaks up on you and bites you in the butt. Mislabeled as a \\"thriller\\", this movie packs a wallop of a punch, leading into the lives of a man tortured by the murder of his wife, yet showing us an intimate love story that unfolds after her death.<br /><br />The setting is present day Africa and the man is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes, THE ENGLISH PATIENT), a British diplomat who struggles with a strong-willed wife (Rachel Weisz, THE MUMMY) named Tessa. Tessa is throwing a wrench into the works of the multimillion dollar operations of the pharmaceutical industry that use African men and women as test subjects for new drugs. And one of these new medicines (which is poised to make billions of dollars) may be killing people.<br /><br />With too much money at stake, the drug company - that happens to be backed by the British government - takes its own action and kills Tessa.<br /><br />Now Justin is on the case, trying to uncover what it was his wife had discovered and who was behind her murder. As he travels this road, though, he battles within himself the thoughts that Tessa may have been unfaithful ...only to learn that her love for him knew no bounds.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The direction of THE CONSTANT GARDNER by Fernando Meirelles is fascinating. His unorthodox use of scattered events and time allowed for some interesting aspects, most notably a character flow that grew backwards from the story ...for a while. About halfway through the movie the continual forward motion of time starts up, with no flashbacks, and allows the viewer to see a pleasant (if somewhat fatalistic) ending.<br /><br />There's no heavy-handed message that forces itself upon the viewer, either. Like immersing yourself in a steaming hot-tub, this film also gently lowers you into its waters, giving you a feel for what might lay ahead.<br /><br />It was also nice to see characters that were so multifaceted. Friends became enemies, enemies became friends, and acquaintances could very well help or kill any one of the movie's main characters.<br /><br />This is definitely a film that'll get a few Oscar nods in my estimation.so nice to see characters that were so multifaceted.

B00003CXE7|4.0|This is probably Ridley Scott's best since the original \\"Alien,\\" though some would probably argue that this is an even better film. Joaquin Phoenix plays a passable Commodius, but the real highlight of the film is watching Russell Crowe literally command the screen. Yes, Ebert, we've seen \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Ben-Hur,\\" but this is far better, especially the final scene in the Coliseum, an appropriate climax to such a grand film.<br /><br />Good job Ridley!
0131479415|5.0|I am sure Mike Cohn's 'Agile Estimating and Planning' will become a standard Agile reference for many organizations, especially large corporations who need to support enterprise projects.  I am immediately incorporating many of the techniques presented to improve our estimating and planning capabilities. The book is easy to read and refreshingly engaging:  Clearly written from direct experience, this has relevance for anyone involved in software delivery.  Throughout this book are great tips that can add value right away.  For example, the simple column width recommendation for a task board to help reduce context switching (p.229) is brilliant!  Finally, we are starting a book study group with this book and will certainly appreciate the study questions at the end of each chapter.
0345357116|5.0|I know, because I read them, there are a few out there who say this book is for fans-of-the-scholarly-type of Tolkien, and that it can be a bit boring. But let me tell you, I doesn't!!!! <br />I'm glad I didn't listen to them:) <br />Having read de trilogy of LotR, The Hobbit, and Silmarillion, this is the next book to read. It has very good stories, stories that in the Silmarillion , for example, don't get too much insight or detail, well, here's detail for you. <br />A lot, and I mean a lot of foot notes, very iteresting for the Tolkien fan, with clues to understand things that you may not get yet, by reading the previous books. <br />I read it with enthusiasm, and it has open for me the possibility of reading the rest of them, namely Lost Tales, etc. <br />Since I have realized you don't have to be a scholar to enjoy them, you just have to love Tolkien, and Middle Earth. Is there another reason to buy and read these books??? <br />So please, enjoy, just as I have. <br />by the way, you do get to know much more about Gandalf, Bilbo, the dwarfs, the first age, Isildur and the ring, but I didn't want to spoil the fun by telling.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|After two great movies done by Tim Burton, i really couldn't picture someone else directing. Tim Burton does have a producers role in this movie, however, the director is now Joel Schumacher, who is pretty good on his first attempt. <br /> <br />This chapter in the series, goes through a whole bunch of things. It goes through Robin's story, The Riddlers story, Two-faces story, etc. I think that is the main problem with this movie, is that it tries to fit all of these elements, which makes this film seemed over-crowded in few ways. <br /> <br />Val Kilmer takes over as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Does a wonderful job on Bruce Wayne, but is a stinker on Batman. Tommy Lee Jones is very enjoyable, but he plays too much of a comedic role, i feel his character should have been more serious. Like the Joker in the first Batman in 1989, where he is funny, but he has scenes that are very serious. Jim Carrey is very funny, and he plays the character that really allows him to use all his comedic skills, The Riddler. Chris O' Donnell, i think is very impressive but in a way, is not used enough, compared to the other characters. Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian plays a very sleazy character in my view. I liked Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale in the first one because she wasn't all about sex or things like that. Nicole Kidman's character is basically a very sexual character, that i think weakens her performance. <br /> <br />I was a little skeptical on Gotham City in this movie. I like Tim Burton's because he gave Gotham City a realistic look, in Batman Forever (and Batman & Robin), it looks too computerized and i hate that. I did like some of the story of this film though, i felt Robin's character was told very well. I also like the story on how him and Batman become partners. I didnt't like the tone of this movie, not really dark enough for the characters, the tone seems too playful at times. <br /> <br />Overall on the movie, very enjoyable, a step below Tim Burton's work but still very well done. Joel Schumacher does a better job  on this movie then what people give him credit for.  <br /> <br />DVD Extras, a making of the movie, more info on the Batman Character and now the Robin character. Also they show the making of the Riddler and Two-Face. Much like the rest of the DVD set, it's worth watching, it's always nice to see the making of movies like this and the history of the characters.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My husband and I are avid gamers, especially the recent trend toward family games, or German games, like Settlers, Carcasonne, Lost Cities, Elfquest (and a good cut-throat game of Wiz War). We got together with our nephews over the holidays and completely fell in love with this game - we're going to buy it for ourselves as soon as we can, and will probably also get the travel version to play together on airplanes.    The game is a nice change from cards and dice. I really enjoyed the spatial nature of the game. Over time you'll learn that some of the shapes are better for offense and some for defense, and there are tricks to moving around the board and keeping yourself from getting trapped in a corner.    The rules are extremely simple and can be learned in under 5 minutes. My 8-year-old nephew and I were pretty well balanced and took turns winning (maybe I'll have better luck next year when I've had more practice *grin*). My 6-year-old nephew did just fine in the game, and my 4-year-old nephew was happy to just take his turn putting pieces in his corner without keeping score. I also think this is a game that a child might pull out occasionally by themselves just to make shapes and patterns with the pieces (the board is very pretty when filled in).    It is true that the game is sensitive to lost pieces, since the challenge of the game is based on having a few too many pieces to fit on the board. However, I think you can easily recover from lost pieces by balancing the sets, and then making certain areas of the board off-limits. You could color certain squares with a marker or cover them with tape or cardboard to make the available space smaller. I've often thought that would be a great variation on the two-player game. Instead of playing two colors at once, you could each play one color but make the board smaller. You could make different shape overlays to turn the board into a rectangle, or a cross, or an hourglass, and then part of the challenge of the game wouldbe working inside the new shape. (Do you hear me, Sekkoia? This would be a great expansion for the game.)    The board has ridges for holding the pieces in place. While I found these ridges sufficient for adults and older children, younger children will still accidentally knock the pieces out of place. For us, this happened in small enough doses that we were always able to reconstruct the original position of the pieces.

But to lie and say that you spent three months in jail after getting out and driving straight to your girlfriend's house to find she'd committed suicide is a complete joke. Can we believe any of this book, seriously? Yes, he was in rehab. No doubt. But I'm even questioning the dental work he got at this point. And it's despicable to insert himself into a starring role in the train wreck tragedy of those girls. One caveat: He's a great writer with a GREAT imagination. I feel conned by this book
B000002UA5|5.0|Ummagumma is a most unconventional recording. There's not an ounce of the \\"classic\\" rock Pink Floyd later became known for. This album contains a much greater treasure; four musicians unafraid to experiment beyond the confines of a traditional rock structure. Some call it pretentious, but I call it inspired.<br /><br />The first disc is comprised of four live recordings, and it is a gem. Each song is superior to its studio version. The second disc is divided into four parts; one for each of the band members. This disc finds Pink Floyd at their most psychedelic, and contains some of the strangest music ever recorded by a \\"mainstream\\" band.<br /><br />Of course, when this album was cut, Pink Floyd wasn't yet a multiplatinum selling band, and they were still finding their way out from under the influence of the great Syd Barrett. In Ummagumma you'll hear each individual member stretching out to find new sounds. Many seeds of things to come were first sowed here.<br /><br />I recommend this cd for anyone who enjoys adventurous music and is willing to have his/her ears challenged. When approached in that spirit, Ummagumma won't disappoint.

There are many wonderful, compelling autobiographical fiction, from PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT to HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK.     [...]     Only he knows why.  Personally, I don't think his reasons matter.  He could have written this as fiction.  But he told his publisher that these things happened to him, and his publisher believed him, and Oprah believed him and his readers believed him.  He signed a contract with his publisher which warranted that he was acting in good faith and that he was not misrepresenting the truth (this is standard in all publishing contracts).      It turns out he was lying.  The book itself is still wonderful. The author, however, is pathetic, and contemptible.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.<br /><br />This stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man.  I mean, what is with this sub-genre?  Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s:<br /><br />2 Days in the Valley (1996)  Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.<br /><br />Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.<br /><br />The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).<br /><br />La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.<br /><br />Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.<br /><br />And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.<br /><br />I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides \\"on the lam\\" movies and mafia glorifications.  I also think this sub-genre has something in common with \\"the whore with the heart of gold\\" flick.  It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute.  Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend.  Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.<br /><br />But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction.  The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.<br /><br />Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.he fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.   <br /> <br />Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
0307276902|1.0|Memoirs are not a new medium. They have been around as long as Autobiography, Novel, Biography and the myriad categories of books since the invention of the Guttenberg (sp?) Press (1400's). A very basic premise of a memoir, though, is always that one is recalling true events. Things that really happened. That is the point of a memoir. Much has been founded to the contrary here in Frey's book and plausably so.(the data is extensive and real)         But many seem to be missing the point: HONESTY is what recovery IS all about.     Of what do I speak?     My own experience ( I am a recovering alcoholic since 1987). And this is what has become so offensive about this book. It's an insult to the whole process of getting well from the vicious cycle of addiction. TELLING THE TRUTH is the basics of living a TRUE, clean & sober life. Ms. Winfrey is wrong to say it's this man's exprience that counts for even that is now under suspicion.     My feeling is that professionals in the field will be coming forward to claim to truth about what really is allowed in their treatment settings and Frey's so called events are patently false. Through and through. How do I know? I have been a counselor at one of the best treament facilities in the Midwest for the last 15 years. If anything-- Frey's tall tale is dangerous for anyone seeking help. And only time will prove this.    One excellent memoir that also deals with the issue of \\"recovery\\" is the well-written, dry-humored: ANOTHER BS (word is spelled out in title)  NIGHT IN SUCK CITY. A superlative work next to this.

James Frey lied with his claim that this book is the true story of his battle with addiction.  He lied in order to get this book published.  Now he is lying in an attempt to minimize the inevitable ridicule and bad press that the uncovering of his previous lies have caused him.  Lies, lies, and more lies.  When James Frey needs something, he lies, and when he needs to get out of something, he lies.  Oh what a tangled web we weave...

Hey, if he was quite good working with John Lennon in the Beatles era, a real Rock phenomenon with the 'classic' Wings grouping (Linda, McCullough, Laine), and even an extraordinary soloist (Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie) I cannot understand how he could fall to make such a piece of crappy record like \\"Chaos and Creation..\\".<br /><br />This is not you, Mr. McCartney! Nigel Godrich can work as a good producer for 'modern' bands, but it is not your case! This album is a real \\"Chaos\\" of the worst class!
0307276902|1.0|Mr. Frey does have a talent and it is being a really good con artist. He has pulled millions of people in with a ridiculous fiction story, much of which even common sense would tell you is unreal, to say nothing of the Smoking Gun investigation. He attempted to have it published as fiction because that's what it is. When one publisher would publish, but only under non-fiction, all of a sudden it became true and he stated it was true many times---such an obvious lie that it baffles me that people can still be sucked in. Not only that, but the book could actually HURT drug addicts who decide that maybe they can 'do it all on their own' too. It has highly annoyed me to have been ripped off and conned by this 'bad guy wannabe'. He has no integrity and no character. He IS a bad guy, but not in the way that he's trying to portray in that book.   Also, for whatever reason, a lot of people can not handle the truth of what this man really is and they are living in an absolute state of denial. They can't handle that their hero is nothing but a fraud and will never believe it regardless of any proof they get. And while all the people are defending him I'm sure that secretly, in his mind, he is thinking 'Ha! Sucked that one right in' as he laughs all the way to the bank and enjoys the worship. THAT is sad---that so many people are SO gullible. Think people. Think. You have been HAD! FACE IT!!
0689865384|1.0|...if it weren't completely apparent that this book rips off its premise from two classic \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes: \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" and \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You.\\"  I think Rod Serling's 40+ year-old versions of this little morality tale will probably have far more resonance for me (being that they were first).  Did the authors really think no one would notice?
0553801503|2.0|Let's go over the characters we all got involved with (and liked) that he killed off. <br /> <br />1) Eddard Stark <br />2) Robb Stark <br />3) Catelyn Stark (she's dead... just a zombie now, barely a shell of who she was before) <br />4) Brianna Tarly <br /> <br />I'm sure there are and will be more, but those are just the ones that I am really irritated with.  The first book should have been called \\"The book of Stark\\" with how much he got involved with those characters and he has largely destroyed almost all of them except Jon Snow and Arya.  We saw almost nothing of Jon, zero of anything with Bran, little of Sansa and almost as much of Arya (though I do admit that her story is becoming interesting... the surest sign that he's going to kill her off soon). <br /> <br />His plotlines are becoming predictable (I guess that goes with the nearly glacial progress) and anybody who thinks that the supposed plotline with Sansa is going to involve anything other than her reluctantly (and tearfully) giving up her maidenhead to Littlefinger is only deluding themselves.  It seems that his goal is to bring your hopes up to only dash them over and over and over again.  You think that maybe Robb is going to build a strong alliance the Freys and forge out a Northern Kingdom, but nope, that falls apart.  I find myself hoping that Jaime will let his sister die and spend the rest of his time redeeming himself, but with the predictability of a Batman TV show episode, he's going to run back and die, though possibly saving his sister, as the Mountain won, but still died. <br /> <br />If the next book isn't much better (giving us more than a small shred of something to hope for before killing off the characters we have hope in/for), then I'm done with it.  He's a great storyteller, but he doesn't seem to be understanding the difference between suprising his readers and just disappointing them time and time again because we spend 200+ pages reading about a single character's story only towatch that character die for little (or no) purpose. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, he is a great storyteller, but no matter how good the storytelling, getting people involved with characters that you plan on just killing off gets old really quick.  Not advancing the major plotlines other than a group that you *know* is going to die (the Lannisters) and not the ones that half of the people actually like (Tyrion) just makes for poor story advancement in the long run. <br /> <br />In short: Advance the plotlines that actually matter, stop spending 100+ pages getting us involved in characters that you just plan on killing off and stop building up people's hopes just to drop them off a cliff to splat unceremoniously like a jello filled baloon.

If you followed radiohead from their start till now each album has been distinct and well orchestrated to an extent like no other band. I will admit it would take a certain person to like radiohead. Unfortunately those people seem to be far and few between. But for us who love radiohead they are seen as a gift to music and an inspiration that will never die.

B0009Q0F5U|4.0|This CD was very well put together, staying true to all the music heard on Battlestar Galactica from the mini series through the beginning os season 2. The songs have good variation, and you can see some influence from Riverdance and Hans Zimmer's work.
B000002513|5.0|I was 14-15 when I first heard this album.  I remember that I pestered my local DJ for several days to play \\"NYC Serenade,\\" and after ignoring me for days, he finally played it.  He then played it the next night and the night after that and then used it as his sign off song for several nights after that.  I like a lot of Bruce's later stuff, but none of it ever had quite the same atmosphere as this album - it just captures a certain early 1970s beach resort and NYC atmosphere that is now historic.

0307276902|5.0|\\"let the haters hate and the doubters doubt\\"!  I read this book before there was any mention of it on Oprah's book club and long before people doubted his honesty.  James stands by his book and his life and I have to say, SO DO I!  From the very second I finished those last few riveting words, I have done nothing but give him praise and suggest his book to everyone I know.  It was a New York Times bestseller for a reason!!!!!  I completely believe in his accounts and feel that even if you dont, it is still a great read!  His unique style of writing is like no other. A Million Little Pieces is honest, honorable, and mesmerizing. READ IT! and when you're done, pick up My Friend Leonard.
0307276902|1.0|This is all Oprah's fault.  Poor James Frey he didn't want Oprah to support his book and for 3 gazillion people to read it and look into some of his stories.

B0002I831S|4.0|I've always been a big Star Trek fan, but being too young, I didn't see it in its original order. I realize now that most of the episodes aren't really shown in syndication--the T.V. stations only like to show a handful of them, over and over. And how many times do we really need to see Shore Leave? <br /> <br />That's one of the things that makes this collection a nice addition to the library--it's great to be able to see all of the episodes, and in their original broadcast order, no less. The order is interesting because it allows an insight as to how the show was modified over time. <br /> <br />Some things I learned from watching these shows in order: <br /> <br />* That McCoy wasn't originally slated to be as crucial (one of the big three) as he eventually became. (He wasn't even the first doctor). <br />* That Vulcans were originally called \\"Vulcanians\\"; also, they had a form of mind-control (not simply the \\"mind meld\\"--much more powerful than this). <br />* That Sulu was originally supposed to be a botanist/biologist, not a helmsman. <br />* That the symbol they wear on their uniforms didn't originally stand for StarFleet, but for the Enterprise; other ships had different logos. <br />* That phaser blasts were originally bullet-like pulses, not streams; and at first there were no photon torpedoes. <br /> <br />Also, what I've found interesting is that the show was really an anthology series at first. Things like the Klingons, Romulans, etc., were created, not in order to develop the Star Trek Universe as it eventually became, but to tell simple one-shot stories, usually with a message. Originally, Star Trek was a series like the Twilight Zone, only with a group of recurring characters. It is a series with a different feeling than any of the shows to come later, such as Next Gen or Voyager, because they were interested in telling long-term stories within a consistent universe; Classic Trek was not. <br /> <br />What remains true of this series, even in its early, formative years, are the great characters. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and the rest are all lovable, and all well-acted (even Shatner, who is really quite good). The stories are hit and miss, some great and some lousy, depending on the writer and director for that episode. Standouts include The Menagerie, Court Martial, Balance of Terror and City on the Edge of Forever. <br /> <br />In all, I learned a lot and had a good time watching these episodes. I recommend it to Trekkies/Trekkers and even just the curious. I found this season, as Spock would say, fascinating.

B00005JOQ9|4.0|A lot of people keep calling this a Quentin Tarantino film.  He did not direct or write it.  It is written and directed by Eli Roth of Cabin Fever fame.  Quentin is his friend and encouraged him to make the movie, and signed on as a producer to help promote the film, but it is not a Tarantino film.  The film itself is an ultra violent film with tons of disturbing images.  If you are a 70's horror film fan, such as Last House on the Left, this is the modern day equivalent to it.  You have lots of sex and nudity, then some sick torture, and by the end, a nice revenge film.  For those who saw Cabin Fever, this film is even more extreme, and the humor of Cabin is left behind.  I really enjoyed the film, but I would not recommend it to anyone by a diehard horror film fan, or someone who wants to gross out a squeamish girlfriend.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this album actually changed my life and the way i view music forever. the album should be listened to all the way through at first, just like a movie, and then you can skip to your favourite parts afterwards.  <br /> <br />i have heard some people say this album has too many dead spots in between songs and doesnt flow, but the soft instrumentals and breaks all serve a purpose, as the mars volta write their music based on real life events. <br /> <br />the sheer brilliance of the musicianship blows me away, some of the time signitures are unrecognisable, but yet it fits and flows beautifully. <br /> <br />i have also heard people saying that flea plays bass on this album, this isnt true, flea actually plays the trumpet which is flea's original instrument. <br /> <br />the electricity of songs such as inertiatic esp and roulette dares (the haunt of) mix very well with the amazing ballad Televators. <br /> <br />cedric's voice on this album compared to ATDI is awesome. who knew he had such a huge range and could sound so clean compared to the rough edgy punk vocals in ATDI. <br /> <br />i would give this album a 6 out of 5 if i could...
0553208845|5.0|It may be possible to read Siddhartha quickly. Certainly, the book is short, and the writing, simple. It is a small story about an truth-seeker's life and travels during the time of Buddha, as he explores both asceticism and the pleasures of the world. In fact, a person so intending could finish this book within the space of an afternoon.<br /><br />But, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Siddhartha is a thoughtful and deep work. Every section is charged with meaning and reflection. To treat it with the attention it really deserves takes time--to truly appreciate it, a person should read a little, think a little. Read a little, think a little. The best kinds of works are those that demand some thought, and Siddhartha is one of those.<br /><br />What C.S. Lewis is to Christianity, Herman Hesse seems to me to be to Eastern thought. He is a master at communicating these ideas, and making them seem natural to even the skeptical Western mind. Though I consider myself to be a skeptic and an empiricist, I certainly learned many valuable things from this spiritual work. On top of that, Siddhartha works as a story (though its real value is in its philosophy).<br /><br />Some will not \\"get it\\" when they read this work, but for those philosophically inclined and especially those interested in understanding Eastern thought, it is hard to find better than this. Excellent little work.
0385720920|1.0|\\"... I absolutely hated this book, and it's not because I'm too squirmish to read stuff about sex -- and in fact, one of the only enjoyable/funny things about his main character was the way he used 'are you a sex addict?' checklists and their meetings to find new ways and methods of having sex/masturbating/etc. <br />But overall, I felt the subject matter was used mainly for shock's sake alone and that a catalog of disgusting facts does not a plot nor a character make. I found Palaniuk's writing repetive... <br />All the characters are detestable, which is fine if they're interesting, but I found them all flat. <br />At the end of the book, I felt I had learned nothing about society or what it's like to be a sex addict, or even what it would be like to have a crazy nutcase mother -- so instead I was left with only a feeling of having wasted my time.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />This person cannot have explained my views on this book better!!! This book is awful. It's not funny, it's pathetic. I kept thinking it would get better, a little better, but it didn't. This book is about a man named Victor, who is really a complete loser. It makes absolutely no sense that he got into medical school. He seriously has a mind that is of a 14 year old or less. The things he thinks are so ridiculous. I would have liked this book when I was a silly 13 year old. I'm not so silly anymore and I can't enjoy the idea of his ridiculous loser lifestyle.  <br /> <br />Victor Mancini is terribly immature. All of the characters are stupid; this is a book where you will find NO intelligent or mature characters because they all are either crazy and screwed up, or having sex with Victor Mancini. This book could have been written in a more thoughtful and creative style, but it's boring and predictable. There was nothing shocking here, just stupid and immature. Everything in it seems like it wants to shock you and interest you in this loser Victor Mancini. Nope. Nothing too deep, interesting or shocking....I'd expect to read this in a 13 year old's xanga. <br /> <br />This book makes doctors look like stupid sluts who surprisingly got into medical school but know nothing about life. Victor Mancini is so lazy and annoying, I wanted to jump into the book and choke him and tell him to shut up and get a life! He's not a sex addict, just an idiot who knows nothing about life and doesn't care to control himself just for one second. <br /> <br />Don't let the cover fool you! It looks cool, doesn't it? I thought so too. I don't know how you can do Fight Club and then write this crap. There is no \\"realism\\" in this book!  <br /> <br />If you liked this book and gave it 5 stars, read it next year. I cannot believe a grown man wrote this thoughtless novel! I'm glad I stole this from Barnes and Nobles when I was 13 and never read it until now.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|This is one of the best Limited Edition packs I have seen, and without a doubt, the best Madonna has ever released.  The cd is housed in the sleeve of a large card box, double the length of a cd box, which houses an 80 page notebook for you to add your own confessions (a bit disappointing) which has a few lyrics hand written by Madonna in it, and a large 40 page, super glossy photobook with extra pictures not included in the normal album sleeve with is very nicely done.  More importantly, this version comes with an additional track `Fighting Spirit' produced by Mirwais.  It's a great dance track, perfectly in theme with the album, and whilst it didn't deserve to be on the normal version, it's a good song, a real grower.  It has been added to the end of the cd, and not sequenced with the rest of the tracks. <br /> <br />After the critical disappointment of American Life, Madonna has stormed back to the music scene with what is perhaps an album as good as ANYTHING she has made in her 23 years on the pop scene. And that's quite a statement...  <br />Staring off with a bang is the 1st single 'Hung Up' which samples Abba's 'Gimme gimme a man after midnight' and is not ashamed to be pure dance / pop at its best. The 2nd track, 'Get Together' sounds like it has a sample of 'music sounds better' in the background, and is a really classy dance track, that took a while to grow on me, but is now one of my favourites. It wouldn't be out of place on her first album and reminds me of `Holiday'. <br />Then comes the stunning 'Sorry', starting with Madonna saying sorry in many languages, and then into a vocoded 'I've heard it all before' repeated until the banging chorus kicks in. Already touted as the 2nd single, this is a fantastic song.  <br />Future Lovers is reminiscent of Donna Summer's 'I feel love' and is also a nod I think to Kylies 'Light Years', but takes it that step further. Spoken lyrics take you into a driving beat and as the song builds so does the vocal.  <br />`ILove New York' is perhaps the albums most unusual track and actually reminds me of early demo's I've heard of Madonna, pre-fame! Its great, has silly, fun lyrics, a driving beat and heavy guitar backing. Not a single, but a GREAT album track that will put a smile on your face - it doesn't take itself seriously.  <br />Then comes 'Let It Will Be', introduced with strings and then more (yes more) thumping beats and great hooks, and this song has grown on me to become one of my favourites. <br />Now comes `Forbidden Love', an absolutely stunning and beautiful track. It reminds me of the 80's track 'Neverending Story' and backing that reminded me of Airs 'Sexy Boy', mixed with Human League - this is a true album highlight and a `pop song' in the true sense of the word. <br />'Jump' is perhaps in the top 3 tracks on this cd.  The spoken parts remind me of 'Words' from her Erotica album - it's a real anthem and will be huge if released as a single. <br />'How High' is yet more pumping great pop / dance.  <br />'Isaac' is a stunning track which starts with a beautiful male voice singing the chorus from 'Im Nin Alu' made famous by the late Ofra Haza. This is the more dreamy part of the album and slows it down a notch or two, but the beat is not forgotten.  <br />The album winds down with 'Push', which has a slower more grindy beat, and then 'Like it or not' which has a 'Goldfrapp / Rachel Stevens' beat which finishes the album off beautifully.  <br />The whole album is sequenced together, and yet even though the album appears superficial (and can be taken as such), lyrically it still has something to say without preaching or winging. What's clever about it, is not just the clever use of samples or inspiration, (some more obvious than others) but the way Madonna has delved back into her own back catalogue and been inspired by some of her own greatest moments.  <br /> <br />This is an album for those who simply want to let go, to have fun, to smile, and in her words ' to dance and sing, get up and do your thing'. The sound of 2006...  <br />MADONNA IS BACK - BIGGER THAN EVER...CONFESS... YOU LOVE HER! <br />
0307276902|3.0|It's interesting how freaked out people get over whether someone like James Frey has told the truth in his memoir \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\"<br /><br />After the Smoking Gun published, \\"A Million Little Lies\\" about the man who conned Oprah, the issue has come up again.<br /><br />This book, I think, would work better as a novel, than as a supposed \\"true\\" memoir.  For it is still a captivating story, evidenced by people getting excited by it and telling others they should read it.  But part of that excitement is because people \\"think\\" it is true, so it is more shocking than if they read this story as a novel, expecting exaggeration.<br /><br />It is the work itself that stands the test of time, even more so than its author, and its emotional and spiritual truth is maybe more valuable than any actual truth. Fiction is that way, it's mostly lies told to tell truth. I guess memoirs are the same, and often, even history (though sometimes history and journalism are lies told to support lies).<br /><br />It's an interesting musing, though, making me consider how I determine my personal integrity in writing, in all forms it offers.
B00009V8Z9|2.0|Well, not really good actually. There are only a few songs that worth listening. They are Chariot, Follow Through and I Don't Wanna Be. The rest just didn't work for me. They just arent catchy at all. However, if you're a fan of Gavin, Then buy this album. 'Cause i bet he put lots of effort into it, and being a bad album to me doesn't mean a bad one to you. So guys, you may give it a try. Maybe listening to sample before buying:).
B0002XNT0I|5.0|AIDS is simple word that encloses so many meanings, destinies and opposite points of view. A prestigious lawyer of a very distinguished bureau will be forced to renounce due this disease.<br /><br />This fact will be the point of no return not only for him, but besides a red alarm for all those who think in major or minor level they are far beyond the danger 's line and absolutely immunized against this terrible lash.<br /><br />A bold film, that depicts crudely all the stages of this fatal victim, as well as his professional, social and affective circle, the legal efforts and finally a cry in the darkness of the intransigence and disregard around many human beings.<br /><br />A solid script, carefully built keeping in mind the delicate dealt issues. Tom Hanks dressed his showiest gifts and making the highest performance of his lifetime. He won the Silver Bear in Berlin and the Academy Award for this role.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After the critical disappointment of American Life, Madonna has stormed back to the music scene with what is perhaps an album as good as ANYTHING she has made in her 23 years on the pop scene. And that's quite a statement...  <br />Staring off with a bang is the 1st single 'Hung Up' which samples Abba's 'Gimme gimme a man after midnight' and is not ashamed to be pure dance / pop at its best. The 2nd track, 'Get Together' sounds like it has a sample of 'music sounds better' in the background, and is a really classy dance track, that took a while to grow on me, but is now one of my favourites. It wouldn't be out of place on her first album and reminds me of `Holiday'. <br />Then comes the stunning 'Sorry', starting with Madonna saying sorry in many languages, and then into a vocoded 'I've heard it all before' repeated until the banging chorus kicks in. Already touted as the 2nd single, this is a fantastic song.  <br />Future Lovers is reminiscent of Donna Summer's 'I feel love' and is also a nod I think to Kylies 'Light Years', but takes it that step further. Spoken lyrics take you into a driving beat and as the song builds so does the vocal.  <br />`I Love New York' is perhaps the albums most unusual track and actually reminds me of early demo's I've heard of Madonna, pre-fame! Its great, has silly, fun lyrics, a driving beat and heavy guitar backing. Not a single, but a GREAT album track that will put a smile on your face - it doesn't take itself seriously.  <br />Then comes 'Let It Will Be', introduced with strings and then more (yes more) thumping beats and great hooks, and this song has grown on me to become one of my favourites. <br />Now comes `Forbidden Love', an absolutely stunning and beautiful track. It reminds me of the 80's track 'Neverending Story' and backing that reminded me of Airs 'Sexy Boy', mixed with Human League - this is a true album highlight and a `pop song' in the true sense of the word. <br />'Jump' is perhaps in the top 3 tracks on this cd.The spoken parts remind me of 'Words' from her Erotica album - it's a real anthem and will be huge if released as a single. <br />'How High' is yet more pumping great pop / dance.  <br />'Isaac' is a stunning track which starts with a beautiful male voice singing the chorus from 'Im Nin Alu' made famous by the late Ofra Haza. This is the more dreamy part of the album and slows it down a notch or two, but the beat is not forgotten.  <br />The album winds down with 'Push', which has a slower more grindy beat, and then 'Like it or not' which has a 'Goldfrapp / Rachel Stevens' beat which finishes the album off beautifully.  <br />The whole album is sequenced together, and yet even though the album appears superficial (and can be taken as such), lyrically it still has something to say without preaching or winging. What's clever about it, is not just the clever use of samples or inspiration, (some more obvious than others) but the way Madonna has delved back into her own back catalogue and been inspired by some of her own greatest moments.  <br /> <br />This is an album for those who simply want to let go, to have fun, to smile, and in her words ' to dance and sing, get up and do your thing'. The sound of 2006...  <br />MADONNA IS BACK - BIGGER THAN EVER...CONFESS... YOU LOVE HER! <br />
0307276902|5.0|The fact that he has been CLEAN for over 13 years tells the real story.  This book really tells it like it is, and what HE had to do to stay that way.  The main path isn't always the only path.  I think the biggest problem is he doesn't buy into the 12 step program. It seems that people want to discredit him for it.  The underline message of the book is what I take away.  It has made me think in a whole new way.  It brings a great message on how to cope with everyday life, not just addiction. <br />Thanks for writing it, keep on writing.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Yes, that Korn that was once popular in the 90s and so on is dead. Musically, they completely changed their sound (which could be due to their lost band member, Head) but to tell you the truth, I think this is the best thing Korn could ever have done. Old Korn may be dead, but this new Korn is alive and full of energy. If this album is discovered by more people and bands I believe that once again there will be a new uprising of bands trying to sound exactly like THIS Korn. <br /> <br />Okay, so if you have this cd, or are just looking at the reviews (buy it, believe me, it grows on you) don't think of this as a Korn cd, or even a Metal cd. Also, don't think about the song \\"Twisted Transistor\\" if you have heard it. It sounds nothing like the rest of the album. Just think of this as a Rock album, an experimental rock album. This is definitely the first Rock album in a very long time that doesn't look to copy another sound or easily fit into a defined genre. Korn have always been that way in a sense, except with their last few albums (yes, I said few, not one or two). But this cd will surprise a hardcore Korn fan.  <br />First of all, this is the 'lightest' Korn album to date. 'Light' meaning not 'heavy', in the metal kind of sense. The album begins with a short interlude (yes there are a few interludes on this album, much like 'Issues')and then there is \\"Twisted Transistor\\". Catchy, simple, 'pop-py' (you can thank The Matrix for that), but still proves the progression Korn has made. The next few songs are the heavier ones of the album, but still nothing over the top. \\"Politics\\" is very catchy, interestingly set up, the industrial sound actually sounds really good. The only bad thing is that the lyrics don't sound 'smart'. I have found that Korn has never been 'smart' with their lyrics, they usually repeat themselves by saying some of the same lines in the same album. But this cd is 'smart', just not this song. The main chorus \\"You want to sleep with him to get to whoyou need to know, think thats they way to go don't you?\\" makes it seem like Jonathan Davis is supporting good morals, which he never had in the past (or now, 'Getting Off' for instance). But we'll excuse this, because this is a great 'sounding' song, and so are the many others. The few songs that stand out to me are \\"Hypocrites\\", \\"Throw Me Away\\", \\"Open Up\\", \\"Coming Undone\\", and \\"Liar\\". Why? Because they're different. Well, \\"Hypocrites isn't so different, but its heavy, its simple, the lyrics are actually well wrote and get across the point about their old band member, and it makes old-school korn fans happy. \\"Throw Me Away\\" is the 'lightest' song on the album, but its very 'smart' and sounds great. \\"Open Up\\" is another soft song, but it has a great bass beat and the lyrics are very thoughtful. It is also the most experimental song on this album, in my opinion. \\"Coming Undone\\" is definitely worthy of being the next single. It has an enormous beat (if you heard it you'd know what I'm talking about) and a great element of 'fun'. \\"Liar\\" is heavy, strong, 'smart', and even brings back the old \\"scat\\" that was available in old-school Korn. Bagpipes here too, as in at least 3 songs, which is very good instead of the one or two songs that it was available in before. \\"Seen It All\\" is probably one of the best songs Korn could have ever chosen for a closer, but they didn't. The lyrics are great, the concept is smart, but they used \\"Tearjerker\\", which is an ok but depressing closer.  <br /> <br />My last word to convince you to buy this album is that every song is DIFFERENT. This is the first Korn album to give us this. Not one song sounds similar to another, the lyrics are different and for the FIRST TIME, Jonathan Davis does not complain all the time in his lyrics, but instead decides to sing about meaningful things in our world, like Politics, Religion, Relationships, etc. (There are also a few sex songs, also on the extra disc, but they're nothing special). So, as a final thought, this album may not sound so special when you first hear it, but listen to it, think about it, and you'll be hooked. It proves old Korn is dead and new Korn is born.
B000001Y16|5.0|Its remarkable that it has almost been ten years since the great Tupac was unceremoniously taken from this world. I can still remember the day. Friday September 13, 1996. My freshman year of high school, not even a week into the new school year. This album is a tribute to the true art form of hip hop..heart felt emotions, street credibility, beats, lyrics and flows that are like a serenade from a man whos pain could be felt by any listener. Tracks like \\"Bomb First\\" and \\"Against all Odds\\" make Makaveli the end all be all for Tupac. I am surprised how those two songs were made in less than 7 days. Amazing, but shows Pacs love for the game and his work ethic. A mastermind at his own right with a nice mix of Dis songs, club bangers, thought provacative melodies and rnb hooks and even a song for the ladies. Pac knew what he was doing, and this album is an indication of his genius. But perhaps the most touching song is Blasphemy..i have never heard a song with so much energy..the most underrated song Pac ever has made. 5 out of 5 doesnt measure how important this album is to hip hop.Rest in Peace Pac.
B000009HF2|5.0|If you weren't \\"of age\\" in 1976, then, I guess, you don't understand. In answer (or a question) to younger critics, why would you buy a live album from the 70's when your opinion is pretty much predetermined? Frampton Comes Alive is an event upon itself. Lets face it, his studio albums sucked, as evidenced by flop after flop before and AFTER this album came out. However, he peaked in every way on THIS album. FCA proves he was meant to be live, and not in the studio. I was an Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, etc. fan when I stumbled upon this album (thanks to a very helpful record store employee in Torrance who turned me on to many good albums). I admit, the radio way overplayed the album, but by the time they did, I already knew every song they played by heart, and then some. However, you can hear the connection to the crowd on this album. So much so, I envy anyone who was there to see it. If you were old or young enough to buy this album, but didn't, because of its overplay, go ahead and grab it, you won't be disappointed. If you were lucky enough to buy it and want to hear it again, do the same. It never gets old, except, perhaps, for those who don't have enough good, live, music, to buy today.
B000031WD9|4.0|I admit I was skeptical when I first encountered this movie.  I thought something that had quickly become the Porky's for the 90s/00s was nothing but trash, but I was pleasently surprised.  Underneith all the smut and bathroom humor had a few messages and some cleverness about it. <br /> <br />Four high school friends, Jim, Finch, Kevin and Oz, make a pact that they will loose their virginity by the end of their high school careers and start their college years as worldly, sophisticated men.  They plot and scheme to attempt to get any girl in the sack by prom night, making for some hilarious antics and situations.  Oz is perhaps the most ernest of the group, who seems like a genuinely nice guy albeit a little dim.  Finch, the suave sophisticate, is the most intellectual and likely to win a woman over with his charms, who is a bit of a wild card as he seems the least likely to have the challenge beore him.  Kevin is the only one in a relationship, but he is the weaker, beta male who is hoping for the day his girlfriend (party girl Tara Reid) feels ready to take the plunge.  And of course Jim, the main character, the happy bumbling fool everyman who just wants to be cool enough and be liked.  In addition to the four is Stiffler, the devilish, super smutty, super arrogant imp who leads all of them down a road of bing drinking and foul language. <br /> <br />Besides their hilarious mishaps and physical comedy, this movie has an odd message about peer pressure.  Because the main characters were boys, once the boys achieve their goal they are to be pat on the back and told that they are heros.  Had they been girls, it would have been another story.  We do not see the guilt, the unsure feelings, or the fears.  Although I was one of those oddballs who made it through high school with my virginity intact, through them we see the social pressures that kids are subjected to become sexually active.  I felt that pressure, to be sure, but I was too unsure of myself and afraid todo anything about it.  And once it happens, it's not such a big deal.  And it becomes fun, but like everything else it doesn't become fun without practice.   <br /> <br />It's a little ironic that the star of the show was not any of them but the band camp geek who takes advantage of Jim.  The gal who on the surface seems so innocent but is the most cunning and worldly of them all.  Guess it just shows you don't have to be cool to have milage.
B0007WULVO|5.0|This is a great example of one of U2's most ambitious tours, the ZOO TV tour 1991-94.  A great addition to U2's earlier live offerings (Under a Blood Red Sky, Wide Awake in America and Rattle & Hum), this album is true to its name and features much of the Achtung Baby and Zooropa albums with a few standards thrown in as always.  The Dublin audience is over the top and U2 responds with an incredibly lively performance.      This version of Bullet The Blue Sky (in my view their best recorded live performance of this classic) appears again on the EP \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!).\\"  Edge plays the song as hard as you'll ever hear it - -in a word, he plays with more \\"edge.\\"  The recording is excellent and the cover art is very nice.

0307276902|1.0|What are you on, dude?  Read the police reports - this guy wrote a piece of fiction, loosely based on doing the same kind of crap most of us did when we were young and portrayed himself as a bad boy ex-con.  Oooo, so dangerous!  Who cares about the $12... the time spent reading... but call a fraud a fraud when they show up.
B00004U2GH|5.0|\\"Johnny Cash at San Quentin,\\" the followup to his brilliant \\"Folsom Prison\\" recording, is another brilliant album from the Man in Black. While it lacks the atmosphere and aura of it's predecessor, the charisma of Cash, and the talent of his singing troupe, more than make up for it. It is another album that belongs in anyone's collection of great music!<br /><br />Grade: A+
B000024ALA|5.0|One of the best metal albums ever. This album is much better than Draconian Times, but I like them both. A true classic.
0385507755|5.0|This book is very moving. James Frey is an amazing writer, I dont care about the bad media or the allegations that he lied about his past. This book has changed my outlook on drugs, my life and the addiction that I see many loved ones go through. This book has helped me in so many ways. If you know anyone going through addiction...PLEASE READ THIS BOOK! It is awesome! Fiction or Non-Fiction, it really doesnt matter, you wont be  able to put it down.
B000301YY8|1.0|so I gave it another chance.  I still didn't like it.  I consider myself somewhat of a singer/songwriter aficionado, and I gotta tell ya, this guy won't last.  Whiney voice, mediocre songwriting at best and just plain boring.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  For some real talent, check out Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, Damien Rice, etc.
0307276902|5.0|When I put down this book after reading it in the short amount of time as Oprah did I told everyone I know about it that I loved it and that it 'spoke' to me.  I also read 'My Friend Leonard' in one night.  The courage that it took James to convey this story, drudging up his past shameful history, which was mostly likely clouded in blackouts and nightmares is enough to cement the fact that memoirs are based on PERCEPTION.  Perception is reality.  What I took away from this book was the feeling that it envoked in me based on what I could relate to, as well as the fact that it just plain hit home for me.  I felt understood.<br /><br />Why did I feel that way?  Because James is such an excellent writer and was able to document his stream of conciousness.  The fact that he doesn't use correct grammer and punctuation is to give the book more power and take you into feeling EXACTLY what he was feeling.  That is the whole point.  The feeling of being addicted, shamed and guilty with little or no self-worth are portrayed by this man regardless of embellished facts.  The reason this book was and is so popular is because so many people can relate to the exact feelings that James explains in the book.  That is, feeling the Fury, a void, an emptiness, and need to fill it with food, or alcohol or drugs.  The need to NOT FEEL.  This is the core issue behind abuse of any substance, the need for a vice and should not be misunderstood and CANNOT be created by someone who has not experienced the pain.<br /><br />I do understand embellishment to protect people and to shorten the length of the book, but that doesn't make the core story and emotions as a result of his life any less true.  James didn't make any money off this book, nor does he care about the fame and this is easy to interpret just by reading his work, his biography and watching him speak.  What would he gain from lying as those have claimed?  Absolutely nothing.
B000BP86OG|1.0|This album was one the biggest dissapointment of 2005 for me. Their first album, \\"Permission To Land\\", was simply awesome. Creative, innovative, good guitar work, and fun. This one is soft, over-produced, not interesting and very boring. I can't believe this is even the same band. If you are thinking about buying this record because it might sound like their first one, DO NOT. Steer clear of this one.  <br /> <br />Dice

630460291X|4.0|If you like swashbuckling action, sweeping vistas, witty humor, and clever plotting, this movie does the trick.  It's a fun popcorn movie with tons of eye candy.  It moves along nicely, the heroes are heroic, the bad guy is just plain bad, to the point of losing it, and the final sequence is a riot.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers who say Morgan Freeman is a high point for this movie.  I did think Alan Rickman was a little over the top, yet I don't find it unbelievable, as someone who has invested himself that much into taking over would be likely to lose it the further he got buried in his deceit and betrayal, especially when it seems the house of cards might come crashing down.<br /><br />Kevin, well, in some ways he does a nice job, since to look at him, he looks like a handsome hero with a big heart.  But that awful accent will throw you at first.<br /><br />But it's still a good movie.  Get past the little quibbles and have a great time watching this, especially with a group of friends.

0316172324|3.0|Highly readable, and I definitely recommend, as it is a very enjoyable collection of stories about \\"gut feeling\\" decision making.  But, I ended the book not being sure what the author wanted me to take away by reading it.  It is common knowledge that experts in any field develop an inner guide that allows them to make quick decisions and quickly see what others do not see (and there are plenty of examples of this in the book); it is also common knowledge that sometimes those instant judgements are not necesarily right (and there are also examples of this in the book).  I was expecting a theory out of that book and there is none.  Read it anyhow, you will likely enjoy it.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Let me just say how much I can't stand Madonna: the phony British accent; the whore turned religious freak; the woman who doesn't know who she is; and the worst actress in film history. She deserves a lot of other bad titles, but this review should be about the album. <br />  I heard the song \\"Sorry\\" while driving down the 110 Freeway in Los Angeles. Some girls were playing it in their car. I instantly knew it was Madonna because of that squeaky, finger nails on chalkboard voice. However, I couldn't get that damn song out of my head for the whole day! Since I had a gift certificate from work, I found myself posessed by the Devil. I actually bought a Madonna album! God, forgive me! Ok, once again, I know this is supposed to be about the album. <br />  I put it in my car on the way home. I've heard \\"Hung Up\\" before, so I skipped it. I can honestly say I was in for a real treat. The songs, while not groundbreaking, are catchy as hell. Most of all, they represent something Madonna hasn't represented in years: FUN! \\"Sorry\\" is an amazing track and even though it's about a breakup, it's still fun. \\"Future Lovers\\" reminds me of the late 70s for some reason. It takes you on a \\"disco\\" journey that you don't want to end. The biggest thrill on the album was \\"Jump.\\" Madonna did something with this song that she has barely ever done: written a very inspiring song that goes beyond bubblegum. The song is about how you need to take risks with your life and even though you may not succeed, it's better than staying in the same place. This song put such a smile on my face. I think \\"Forbidden Love\\" was before that. It was catchy, but nothing special. \\"I Love New York\\" was so campy that you forgive her for the pathetic lyrics. \\"Isaac\\" is a mind-blowing track that reminded me of one of the only Madonna songs I have ever liked: Like A Prayer. Unfortunately, the last song, \\"Like It or Not\\" is about Madonna and her ego. However, by the time you get to that song, you will be overjoyed withlaughter, fun, and a lot of other good feelings. You can either forgive her for the last track, or just press the skip button. <br />   This is actually the first album that is so good that it makes you forget the pathetic person that made it. Then again, can a woman who makes an album so incredible be all that pathetic? <br /> <br />
B00008G9JO|5.0|Jethro Tull was ubiquitous to 1970s AOR radio and the album Aqualung got as much play as the classic Dark Side of the Moon. There are many fans who swear by the earlier blues oriented recordings.  My first Jethro Tull album was Songs from the Wood so I am partial to this period of Ian Anderson's writing.  Heavy Horses is the follow up and captures the rustic pagan spirit of its predecessor.  While Songs from the Wood is one of my favorite albums, I will admit that it does not have the cohesion of Heavy Horses.  Yes, Songs from the Wood features some great tracks including the title track, The Whistler and my favorite, Hunting Girl. But overall it is a mixed bag that does not seem to flow smoothly.  Heavy Horses is much more uniform from song to song while offering some great tracks, The Rover in particular.  The lyric writing is still somewhat satirical but now more romantic and descriptive.  Anderson tells less a story then paints a picture on the title track and Journey Men.  This album is a nostalgic look back to an earlier time when man was in touch and relied on his relationship with nature.  Though it got no substantial airplay, it features the classic Tull line up at their best and some of Ian Anderson's best writing.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am one of the very few who have NOT seen the actually show, but heard all the great things about the soundtrack and have read the book about a year ago. My one problem with Broadway soundtracks is staying with the story, which is actually no problem since I knew the storyline already.  <br /> <br />I was blown away by all of the voices and ranges! I love looking for a good CD to listen to and sing with, and this brings it all to the table. I prefer any song with Elphaba's character, but there are very few parts that I don't enjoy. My favorite songs to sing with have to be Defying Gravity (last half is breathtaking!), I'm Not That Girl, No Good Deed and As Long as You're Mine (which can draw tears in the right mood!). But I can say I never skip through the funnier pieces like Popular and What is This Feeling.  <br /> <br />I can't wait to see the show in a couple months, and maybe I've ruined it for myself, but if any of you are like me and just like to burst out singing every once in awhile, this CD is for you!

0446678430|5.0|Retire Young Retire Rich is split up into four sections.  The fourth section is simply and closing speaking to those who may need help keeping the wind in their sails after aquireing the knowledge to fuel their finacial journey.

B0002Y4T92|5.0|eric clapton must be applauded for bringing together such a wonderful mix of guitar styles. unfortunately a few blowhards like harry tennech would rather hear himself spout off than appreciate how good these guys are. david hildago plays a wonderful guitar solo on neighborhood, great licks and super guitar tone, and b.b king in his prime was as good as anybody, oviously mr.tennech has never heard live at the regal.this dvd is a lovefest of respect from great guitarist all over the world and i highly recommend it.
0743454537|4.0|This book was wonderful.  Lots of twists in the plot, and a great ending.  I read this for bookclub, and it was a great discussion.  Very thought provoking.
B00005JOFO|5.0|A homosexual affair erupts between two cowboys who, being poor, tough and from the mythological land of the Wild West, defy the stereotypes created by the reactionaries of Fox news as well as liberals of \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\".  The movie portrays the problem of gay romance at a time (the 60s) and place (Wyoming) where such relationships were highly taboo. <br /> <br />However, this film is neither intentionally political, nor ideological.  Like all good art, its point is not to moralize, not to take sides, but to capture the complexities of a human situation and cast a light on the personalities involved.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" succeeds in that enterprise. <br /> <br />During the film we are swept up by the drama and emotion of the story.  However, it is once we are removed from the movie theater <br />that we truly begin to ponder the psychology of Ennis and Jack. We wonder about the history of these two characters and about what was transpiring in their minds at a different level.  We wonder \\"What if\\".  Two close work colleagues and I spent every spare moment for a week discussing Ennis and Jack (as well as less important characters in the movie) as if they were people we knew. <br /> <br />Oscars for this film will bring shrieks from the American Right <br />and kudos from the Left.  However, one is to hope that the nuances of this film do not get drowned out by the roaring battle.
0307276902|1.0|Right from the very first page you can tell this book is not a real account. He's on a plane drunk, with a badly torn up face, swollen shut eyes, dripping blood, and covered in vomit and urine? No airline would let a passenger on in that condition!  <br /> <br />Also, if you've seen Frey in real life, you know he doesn't look like someone who's been through what he claims he has. He should look like a hundred miles of bad road---he doesn't. <br /> <br />Oprah defended the book on Larry King when the author was on tonight. The problem with Oprah's defense is that since it is a  work of fiction, Frey's \\"personal story\\" cannot be used as a source of inspiration to others in their struggles with addiction. His edict to \\"hold on\\" doesn't hold water when his account of what he went through was a figment of his overactive imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00007AJF9|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much!  The acting was wonderful, in my opinion.  As for the complaints about historical inaccuracy - well, it's Hollywood.  Since when is Hollywood concerned about historical accuracy????  Shakespear's Julius Ceasar isn't historically acurate either.  I saw this movie right after Shakespear in Love and after watching both I couldn't believe Shakespear in Love won an Oscar.  Elizabeth was a far superior movie.  Elizabeth had an interesting plot - Shakespear in Love was about swooning characters and G. Paltrow doing a bad job pretending to be a boy.
6303913903|5.0|I have absolutely no idea why this movie has become a punchline.  <br /> <br />Although I don't know first-hand about the goings-on in Las Vegas strip clubs, one can assume that there might be a \\"little\\" nudity in them....DUH!  <br /> <br />As for the greedy understudy looking for her chance to take the lead at any cost - yeah, like that NEVER happened before, right? (anyone remember a little movie called \\"All About Eve\\"?)....and the rape scene with Andrew Carver? Anyone want to tell me that rock stars NEVER got violent and took advantage of a groupie's attentions?? <br /> <br />Wake up and smell the KY jelly....people DO have sex in Las Vegas, there ARE topless shows and lap dancers, and there ARE backstage \\"politics\\" in every broadway show so in Vegas there won't be? <br /> <br />Personally, this movie is one of my all-time favorites and I can watch it over and over again.  <br /> <br />I bet if Quentin Tarantino had directed it, everyone would be singing it's praises from here to eternity. <br /> <br />I think that all the critics should watch the movie again with fresh eyes.....and maybe you guys should too - it is a really good movie. <br /> <br />GO ELIZABETH!!!! <br /> <br />
B000002L9W|3.0|There are some good songs on here such as the hard rocking  <br />Yankee Rose and Shyboy... But c'mon! You can't be serious  <br />when you try and stand this up next to Van Halen's first 6  <br />albums. That's just non sense. <br /> <br />It's not just about Eddie vs. Dave.... Dave's solo band just  <br />don't have the backing vocals and such to match Van Halen. That <br />isn't an insult, but it's pretty close to a fact... If you <br />believe this is on the level of any of the band's first 7 albums <br />you are truly a David Lee Roth fan way more than a Van Halen <br />fan.
0441172717|3.0|note that this novel came out in 1965. i would not recommend it as an introduction to herbert, for those who dont know his worlds, because it is his first major work. the full flavor of herbert is only developed later. some of the space-opera flavor of dune is old fashioned, but some fine writing is contained within. indeed, herbert in small doses can be even more revealing than long passages: study the chapter header quotes carefully; herbert speaks to you directly there. i recommend after a first reading, going back to reread the headers only. another recommendation for those new to herbert: forget what you've heard about this being a novel about 'ecology' or some such. herbert's ecological concerns are a background to the main story. the large idea is changes to human conciousness under duress. remember this if you read more herbert. a few words on style. the concerns, attitudes and thoughts of the characters here and in herbert deal with more crucial concerns than any other scifi world i have read. the reader is definitely challenged to keep up , especially when the innermost thoughts of characters are offered. matters of life and death are pondered. self reflection is a way of life in herberts world. the inner life of his characters makes quite an impression upon first, and subsequent readings. keep this important idea in mind when reading: herberts great strength is in the two person scene. all his concerns and themes come through strongly in the two person dialogue, that clash of minds that drives his plots. the characters navigate a realm where human conciousness is the measuring stick: you must be able to speak your mind and defend your ideas (remember changes to human conciousness under duress). to close, i urge all new herbert to seek out the dune world sequels; the style and ideas get better. my opinion is the final 2 novels (heretics of dune & chapterhouse dune) are far and above the best. also, if you have never read any herbert, consider reading whipping star or the dosadi experiment first. these novels of the 'jorj x. mckie' universe are lighter reading, relatively, and fast moving, especially whipping star, in which i detect a humorous tone. frank herberts universes stand alone in scifi for the reach of ideas adressed, though i understand some may find them 'ponderous', perhaps. remember that frank herbert is often speaking to you, the reader, directly, through the thoughts and concerns of his characters.
0800177177|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, it's one of my all-time favorite vamp films, and also one of my favorite films adapted from a book. The cinemetography and location in this film is astounding, its very rich, very alive. I love it. However, I personally feel that Reeves's performance considerably detracted from the beauty of the film. I simply could not believe that he was Johnathan Harker. However, Gary Oldman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both wonderful and brilliant. I believe that the film has done justice to Stoker's compelling novel where many films have aimed for a Hollywood/blockbuster texture. If you enjoy vampire films, or are looking for a twist on the cliche bloodsucking genre, check this film out. And if you haven't, definately read the book. Thank you.
B00006674X|5.0|Change of Habit stands alone as the Elvis film with a social conscience -- and a little rock and roll! It has much to say about religion, racial tensions,  morality, individual choice, etc. In a way, it's a time capsule for those of us who were growing up in the turbulent 60's and early 70's. The very idea that Mary Tyler Moore chose to follow her conscience instead of a \\"groovy\\" young doctor is amazing in itself. (The later MTM show was the first to feature a single young career woman living on her own.) Of course, that was back when the \\"glass ceiling\\" was made out of CEMENT!<br /><br />Most definitely highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When Madonnas first self-titled debut was released, who would have thought that more then thirty years after she would still be making excellent music? The first time i heard 'Hung Up' (probably the catchiest song on the album) i couldnt wait for the release of this album. I expected a serving of 12 revolutionary pop classics, instead i got a pre-remixed disco serving.  <br />I was VERY confused and a little upset, now i cant imagine 'Confessions' any other way. And while these songs dont seem like anything else she has really released, i think that is kinda the point of 'Confessions'. Madonna has made her name with the ability to reinvent herself time and time again in a career spanning over 2 decades, and this notion is definately presented in 'Confessions'. Madonna re-creates herself into a disco queen on this album. <br />While the old Madge is still present, especially in the racy clip for 'Hung Up', we are faced with a new Madonna who seems to have dancing on her mind. <br />This album is definately a must have, especially if you're a fan of Madonna. The songs are catchy and danceable, and the lyrics appropriate. The vocals are excellent especially as they compliment the composition of instruments. <br />The only complaint i have about the album is the way that each song is mixed into the next. This gives the feel that instead of 12 songs you get one long song...Once you get to know the songs you realise which is which and it works as a positive. <br />Overall, you should definately get this album, especially if you're a Madonna fan...you will be surprised! Here's your crown Madonna, you are the well-deserved Queen of Pop!
0307276902|1.0|Honesty, that's what it's about.  <br />Recovery is about honesty.  <br />Frey never had it, never will.  <br />He is what has been called a \\"dry drunk.\\" <br />Not using, not drinking, but no real change of heart. <br />Lying to others, likely lying to himself. <br />The perfect model for a relapse. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this book.  <br />If you do, you're sending the wrong message to \\"those that sill suffer.\\" <br />You just can't fake recovery from addiction. <br />You can't color it. You can't stretch it. Can't impassion it. <br />You can only be honest. Frey misses the mark. <br /> <br />If you're an addict. Go to a meeting, hear a real story or two.  <br />You want to know what a treatment center is really about? Ask the people there.  <br /> <br />Frey, you have set treatment back.  <br />Oprah, I thought you were about \\"truth.\\"
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is the best cd ever!! Big call, but its definately deserving. I discovered Damien on a chance and instantly fell in love with this cd. From start to finish, i was holding my breath soaking it all in. There is nothing wrong with this album! The lyrics are intricate and have depth and meaning, the vocals are delicate, and the instrumentation compliments the effect of both the singing/song writing skills Damien incorporates into this cd. The songs are so emotional and his voice just enhances the meanings presented in each song. Its hard to chose the best song on the album, but if i had to it would be 'Cannonball'. The lyrics are beautiful and really mean something to me. <br />This is one of the best albums you will ever hear, and idiots like James Blunt are the ones who are getting all the recognition for doing something different when its people like Damien who deserve more exposure. If you think James Blunt is the absolute performer of alternative music, you need to pick up his cd and throw it out the window, and BUY THIS CD!!!  <br />And yes Damien Rice is very popular in Europe, but everyone should discover him!!
B000001ESF|5.0|Now this is my first album lengh exposure to Rush,not discounting saturation airplay of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" on the radio during my youth.The greatest thing on '2112',as most fans I notice vouch for is the title song itself (clocking in at over twelve minute of course).Like many a prog rock tune the song careens from acoustic to rock and back in the blink of an eye,same with the vocals.What's amazing is how Rush carry it out-Getty Lee's voice screams at it's Robert Plantish best and (like everything else here) the star of the show is new drummer Neal Peart,whose flexible style on the skins give the tune a variety of colors-colors being difficult for alot of drummer to produce,not to mention his cosmic lyrics,both in the human and otherworldly sense.After that Rush treat us to five three minute rock tunes,proving once and for all prog rock doesn't have to be long winded.In fact the straight forward \\"Lessons\\" and the fast,defaint \\"Something For Nothing\\" are direct and anthemic at the same time.Along with Joni Mitchell Rush are Canada's best known (and under Joni talented) musical phenomenon.And both in there respective genre's deserve that status.
0151008116|5.0|I just don't understand the reviews that say this book is slow and boring.  I thought all the details of living on a lifeboat and of survival were fascinating.  There is indeed quite a bit of violence, but what would one expect in a story of desperation and survival, especially involving wild animals?  I skimmed over some of the sections I found less palatable in that respect, sort of like closing your eyes during the gory scenes of a movie. <br /> <br />I started out reading this in snippets when I had a few minutes here and there, and the farther along I got, the more interested I became, until I finally had to finish it last night in one 3-hour stint.  I was done in under a week, it was a very quick read.  I'm still pondering the ending and the questions it raises regarding metaphor, reality, and storytelling.
B000092ZYX|5.0|well, guys, this is a perfect combination of Radiohead's Ok Computer sound and the more IDM influenced Radiohead we know from Kid A.
0307276902|1.0|I am an alcoholic with my last drink being August 7, 1998.  I did not go to AA and could relate to James Frey.  As I was reading this amazing and riviting story, I kept turning to the back to make sure he was still alive!  I could not believe what he went through.  I have done drugs, but at a much lower level than claimed by James.  Alcohol was my area of weakness.  I literally could not put the book down.  The fact it was a BIOGRAPHY hit me in ways books rarely do.  I felt changed and also was able to understand what I went through during my withdrawls.<br /><br />Then today I read an article on The Smoking Gun website - [...]  The article is exhaustive and very well written.  The bottom line is James made most of the book up and what few events did take place were horrendously exagerated.  He NEVER went to jail after release from the center.  He NEVER ran over a cop.  He NEVER was beatan by police outside bars.  His girlfriend when he was a kid was NEVER his friend (confirmed by her parents!).<br /><br />As most addicts will state, we hate hypocrites.  Nothing is worse than a person bragging and exagerating how much they drank, smoked or took.  Getting sober is very hard and not something to be glamourized.  It is painful and you learn many things about yourself you wanted to keep buried.  Therefore when a person spills their life in print you emphasize and take note for their courage to tell the world.  To find out the author LIED for money, makes a mockery of what we went through.  There is nothing glamorous about blacking out or throwing up.  But to make it more than it is, well, that is down right wrong.<br /><br />The article also posted a letter of defamation from James Frey's lawyers.  The letter stated if they posted anything about their findings, he would sue them.  James also conveniently states he had his records expunged and are not verifiable.  Furthermore, most of his witnesses are conviently dead.  For a person that is so open about everything, I find it amazing he would not turn over his expunged records.  How can a person be open in one area, but not in another?  The only answer is he is LYING!<br /><br />Read the article before buying the book.  Look at their proof and then make up your mind if you wish to go further with A Million Little Pieces.  It is written in a style I truly enjoyed.  It is powerful and amazing, but it is also 90% fiction.  I am an alchoholic and James Frey made me feel violated.
0307276902|1.0|I've been mostly shocked by the people who say the lying doesn't matter and that \\"the emotions are truthful\\".  Think that through folks.  A good writer can create all kinds of emotions, especially those full of self pity. <br />I don't think that everyone needs to go to AA to get sober, but there are things that must be done, whether its through AA, a psychologist, church etc.  First, you have to admit you are powerless over alcohol, then you have to change your character defects that led to your addiction in the first place. <br />This book is dangerous because it promotes *not* joining AA (which can work out) but also not doing the work on one's character. AA folks call this a \\"dry drunk\\", a psychologist might label it a narcissist, but a person who daily lies for ego, for money, for empathy, etc is a \\"dry drunk\\".   <br />I thought this whole charade would expose Frey as the dry drunk he is - \\"this is what happens when you just quit drinking and don't change your character!\\".  This guy is sober but not clean and sober, and is down a very destructive path, yet this observation only seems to hit home to all of us who have \\"been there done that\\". <br />I find this book very dangerous - Because its all made up, Because he is full of lies - exemplifying a \\"dry drunk\\", Because people may not go into AA because they think they cannot get root canal work done with novocaine. (this to me is the worst of what he has written about as far as NOT getting people into help IMO). <br />The smoking gun only exposed the legal side, do people really think all they didn't smoke out is also real? The dental work, airplane ride, etc? They think the emotions are real?  For sure the self pity was, and the lying hasn't stopped. <br />Real recovery is boring, methodical and sometimes emotionally painful because of taking responsibility, and living an honest life. <br />If people want to cling to Frey's made-up worst case scenario.... it shows no discrimination and makes me think about thewomen who are always trying to marry the worst of criminals in the justice system, for whatever twisted reason. \\"There's a good person under there who just wasn't *understood* and I can do that\\".   <br />I would say, you have met a master manipulator who has just used your naive trustfulness to take advantage of you emotionally, and financially.  Dry drunks are great at that.  They are also great at crying while they are lying. <br />The lesson from the Smoking Gun article, should be that this constant deception and lying is classic of a \\"dry drunk\\" and indicates he may not be drinking now but isn't too far down the road.  Its is nothing anyone should be exalting.  I have lived through a the daily lies, and the next worst thing to a drunk, is a dry drunk. <br />This guy is no hero, don't pretend he is one.  He should learn some major life lessons from his lies being exposed  but it seems there are too many gullible readers out there to let that happen.
B00003CXXS|4.0|It would be nearly impossible to trump the first Jurassic Park film.  People were blown away by that movie.  The technology was cutting edge and the premise was nearly magical in its element of fantasy.  Making a third installment to the series presents an obvious challenge.  How do you uphold the level of entertainment set by the first two films?  The answer: new dinosaurs... <br /> <br />In this film, we get the addition of a few new dinos.  The Spinosaur, being even bigger and badder than the T-Rex, is the \\"guy on the block\\" now.  Flying pteranodons are introduced on Isla Sorna, where they were once housed in a huge cage, now left to patrol the skies freely.  The Velociraptors have also gotten an upgrade.  They look a bit more menacing than the Raptors from the original Jurassic Park.  These new additions are what make this film what it is.   <br /> <br />The first film was set on lush pastures of modeled prehistoric land.  The setting for this film is far more delapidated.  This is the land the dinosaur rules.  The premise of the film is a bit cheesy, but you barely notice, given the amazing production and spectacle of the film.  Once on the island, all you experience is the thrill of the search and the chase.  The fact that a divorced couple are searching for their wayward child becomes secondary to the dinosaur action that ensues once they arrive. <br /> <br />I knew I would enjoy this movie simply because I love the idea of Jurassic Park, yet I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it turned out to be. <br /> <br />The DVD is bursting with bonus material.  It would take hours to get through it all - but it's well worth it.  There's an extensive \\"Making of..\\" featurette, a \\"New Dinosaurs\\" featurette, a tour of the studio in which the dinosaurs were conceived and brought to life, storyboards, DVD-rom options, etc...  The Special Edition certainly does the process of the movie justice, providing deep insight into the production. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00005TT77|4.0|I saw the movie and decided to buy this CD after hearing some of the songs in the background during the movie.  I would say the first 11 songs are really good, especially \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" & \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\\"  Songs 12-17 though are not as good--those renditions are way too slow and strange or depressing.  I'd say the worst cover is \\"Julia.\\" That band really ruined a beautiful song.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|The band that once ruled metal now has to have a therapist almost as a band member and parent. Mustaine even whined (which he's done for over 20 years). I'll always listen to the 80's stuff but these guys have become pathetic. Burton would have quit long ago if he were still alive. I might feel sorry for them, but how can one feel sorry for a famous and rediculously rich band?
1573223026|4.0|A Long Way Down has a very depressing premise--four people meet while preparing to commit suicide on New Year's Eve--but it is also one of the funniest and most original books I've read this year. Hornby is one of the few contemporary authors creative and talented enough to pull off a story of this nature, but he does so with great success. The book follows one continuous story line, but it is told in four different voices--those of each of the four people who meet on a London roof while contemplating their final jump. Each character is unique, interesting and has their own, very distinct voice and through them we are able to learn a lot about what motivates different people to try suicide and how it is often (though not always as the book demonstrates) possible to prove to those people that life is worth living. Hornby has done a masterful job of taking a tragic topic and using his skills (humor, good writing, excellent character development, psychological understanding) to create an upbeat, funny and very memorable book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed other Hornby novel or just wants to be entertained and possibly learn something about human psychology. It is a very good book and you will not be disappointed at the end.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Batman Begins is a great movie much much better than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin because it was not tring to be a comedy and was being serious. It has great actors in it as well. It is a different look to batman but a good one. I would get right away one of the best movies that has came out.
1573225517|5.0|This is the best of several very good books by Nick Hornby. It has the same laugh out loud humor, well developed characters and crisp writing of his other novels, but this book seems to capture the moment and psychology of its characters better than Horby ever had before. The main character, Rob, is confused and self-absorbed, but using his unique way of catologuing everything in life (best songs, best episodes of Cheers, worst break ups, etc.), he leads the reader through a very interesting attempt to discover meaning in his life and to get the woman he truly loves. All of the supporting cast lend humor and insight that make the entire book a pleasure to read as well as an enlightening experience. If you've seen the movie and liked it, this book has the same flavor but is much better, and I would recommend reading this book to anyone who just likes great fiction writing and enjoys a good laugh.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Absolutely the most underrated movie of the year. Joss Wheaton's creation is spectacular and it is a terrible shame that the Network execs canned it because they couldn't understand how to market it. Many things were left out such as Shepperd Book's past and some rather unexpected twist as what happens to the Pilot Wash. It is one of my all time favorite movies, I bought the Firefly series and my wife finds it amusing that I have the theme song memorized and often sing it to myself without thinking. <br /> <br />A wonderfully refreshing change to the ho-hum movies/ TV show that have become the run of the mill as of late.
1577314808|5.0|Wonderfull book that deepens everytime you read it.     A bit like a \\"I Am That\\" that could (and probably is) be availabe at a store like Kmart, or the like! What wonderful times we live in that such a book is available to the everyone so easily.    Profound wisdom that is readily available and will fill a need no matter where you are on your journey of life.    A gift of a book.
0307276902|1.0|This guy is a complete idiot and he writes like a high school kid. Come on! Getting so much dental work done with his body restrained but not his head? There's no way a person could hold still during all he describes.  Plus, isn't it funny how everyone who could confirm his story winds up dead? [...] Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. He's all over TV, defending his books and trying to save his miserable skin. Email every show he's on and let them know how you feel about him. I sincerely hope the movie deal is off. This clown should not make another dime from this really awful book.
0893860220|5.0|This book is amazing in that it bring you some of the depth of Sri Nisargadatta's understanding of reality and consciousness.    The level of insight of this barely educated cigarette salesman, is almost beyond conception. What he is pointing at is the thing that is always there. The I that is reading this page (without any thought) is the I Am he is talking about. For me that meant  awareness watching awarenss.    It is not an easy read, something you only take in little bits of  at a time, as most of it is beyond the understanding of the mind, talking to someplace much deeper within.     Once you understand what he is saying (awareness watching awareness)it almost becomes annoyingly repetive, but it is always said in a new refreshing light.    Some of his later books written by Robert Powell and Jean Dunn are supposed to go even deeper than this, but I imagine this would be more than enough for most people.    Amazingly deep insight from a rare jewel.
B00004XPPB|5.0|If you like Mob stories and you like New York you can't afford to miss this. Aside from the Godfather series this may be the best Mafia movie ever made.

0385335482|5.0|This is one of the all-time best chic-lit books.  Sophie Kinsella captures you in the first pages and holds your attention to the very end.  I finished the book wanting a sequel right then.  A must read!

B000BB1MI2|4.0|A friend reeled me into CCF, a movie I didn't think I would appreciate (huh?, isn't it for kids?), anyway it was a most pleasant surprise.<br />Despite a few moments where it dragged out a little, I found the performances, plot and the direction to be very well laid out. Especially the spoiled little rich girl (Daddy, I want that squir-rel, I-want-it!)
1400032717|5.0|Although this book's plot is relatively simple, the completely unique viewpoint provides an entirely new way of looking at the issues presented and the world in general. The story alternates smoothly between being funny, sad, and insightful, and manages to pack in far more than its short page number suggests. The narrative's fast clip also makes it a breezy, gripping read; I finished it in a single four-hour sitting. I would reccomend it to anyone new ideas, compelling characters, or books in general.
0312995423|3.0|Just like the Davinci Code, I found DF to be a real good read with a great story-line, character development, for well over half the book...then the bottom falls out and we're into chase scenes, hired hit-men and \\"only a flesh wound\\" to the leading guy, and so on...Through it all I do feel Dan Brown is a talented writer and idea-maker and for whatever reason I'm looking forward to reading more from him.
B000002GBB|5.0|Styx at it's hard rockin' best is a good way to describe this album. \\"I'm Okay\\", \\"Sing For The Day\\", \\"Blue Collar Man\\", \\"Queen of Spades\\" and \\"Renegade\\" are all FM radio staples that define Styx at their peak. This is a must own for those first time Styx fans or those that have always been fans and just need a nudge to remind them why they are.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|I have to admit that I have a fondness for the explosive side of Buddy Guy. When he's locked and loaded, he is a true weapon of mass destruction. That's why it took me awhile to adjust to the soulful, melodic side of Buddy that this album exhibits so beautifully. He's just reminding us that he can play with style and taste in addition to horsepower. If I have a beef with the album, it's the \\"and friends\\" concept that's being beaten to death in the music industry. People like John Mayer, Tracy Chapman and Carlos Santana certainly don't bring shame to an album, I just question why they're needed. I guess maybe as a sales booster but people like Carlos and Buddy should be above that by now. They're certainly earned their stripes in my book.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I was eight years old when I first had seen this movie and even today, it is still one of my most favorite movies to watch. The soundtrack is just as good containing the most angry Trent Reznor and his band nine inch nails, along with other angry rock stars like Patti Smith and L7. Well anyway let's get back to the movie. The unrated version has a lot of extras that are worth getting like deleted scenes and other cool stuff. From the moment the movie starts, you will be enjoying the movie until the very end. A great movie!
B000002O4X|5.0|At the time I finally got this CD I haven't watched the movie in a long long time but I remember that I loved the movie and the music so I got the CD score. <br />I listened to it and my mind was able to recall the beautiful images of Africa, the endless sky, the color, the people bend working in the farm. The music is just incredible - even if you did not see the movie. It's just set you soul in a fly. If you don't totally love it the first time you listen, then listen again - it grows on you. The music is evocative and inspiring. I have to say that I normally do not buy music from the movies. I just don't because I always thought the music is just background for the movie. In this case (and in case of The Red Violin) I am glad I made an exception.
1400032717|4.0|It's really hard to know how to rate this book.  As soon as I finished it, I went back and read all the reviews I could find, just to see if anyone felt as I did about it.  It appears that there are as many opinions and \\"takes\\" on this book as there are stars in the heavens (something Christopher Boone---the protagonist in the book---would appreciate. <br /> <br />PLOT:  Has been gone over here so many times that all you need to do is read the book description or any of the other reviews.  Suffice it to say that it DOES have a plot, a dramatic arc, and a beginning, middle, and end.  And believe me, this is something really new if you've read a lot from the bestseller list. <br /> <br />STYLE:  Here's the thing.  The book is written in the \\"voice\\" of the austistic teenager-again, Christopher Boone.  Okay.  Fine.  I understand this and was prepared.  You can't say the \\"author\\" can't write, or that his style is \\"immature,\\" since he's putting himself in Christopher's place and writing with his voice and mind.  In this sense, the book is successful for it does indeed allow us to get to know the inner workings (or lack thereof) of young Christopher. I was reminded at times of McCrae's \\"A Tour of Southern Homes and Gardens\\" with its Disociative Identity Disorder slash Asperberger-like protagonist who manages to actually get out in the world and survive, albeit not without problems in communication and social mores.  So I get this part-that the book is written in Christopher's voice.  Problem is, it's a VERY irritating voice and at some point you just want to strangle the kid.  At about the third chapter, I thought to myself, \\"There's no way I'm going to get through this thing,\\" but then I fell into the style and was okay for a time.  By about a third of the way through, I again thought, \\"How the heck is Haddon going to sustain this \\"style\\" without all of us wanting to blow our brains out?\\" I was pleasantly surprised at how he broke this monotony-unfortunately, I can't tellthat away here without giving away a plot twist and injecting a \\"spoiler.\\"   <br /> <br />PACING OF THE BOOK:  The book went very slowly for me in the first half. Trust me, in the middle it picks up a great deal and really moves.  There are actually a few exceptionally tense moments that will get your heart rate up. No, it's not a car chase scene, but there is tension there and Haddon (or rather Christopher) handles this well since he (Christopher) is really the author of this book, not Haddon.   <br /> <br />DIAGRAMS AND PUZZLES:  There are drawings, math problems, puzzles, and charts throughout the book that serve to illustrate the way Christopher's mind works-or doesn't.  While these were interesting in a \\"Da Vinci Code\\" sort of way, I never really felt Haddon tied them into the story.  It did have me on the Internet, looking for more information. The \\"Monty Hall Math Problem\\" was the only one I didn't' think he proved-still looking at that one. <br /> <br />TITLE OF THE BOOK:  While the Sherlock Holmes \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is mentioned, along with Christopher's obsession with mysteries, I was a little shocked that neither he nor Haddon made the title clear.  It actually comes from a chapter in the Holmes \\"Hound\\" book called \\"The Curious Incident of the dog in the Night-time.\\"  While not totally necessary to the story, it would have been nice to pull this in more. <br /> <br />FOOD FOR THOUGHT:  There are many, many interesting insights into young Christopher's mind.  Some of them actually make you think that perhaps \\"We're\\" the ones with the problem and that he's normal.  Example:  Someone will say to him:  \\"My, it's a beautiful day.\\"  He will then just stand there and say nothing, explaining to us, the reader, that \\"It was a statement, not a question, therefore there was nothing else to say.\\"  In turn, the person in the book who has made the statement thinks Christopher is rude.   <br /> <br />PROFANITY:  Frankly, I don't know why anyone has complainedabout the profanity in this book. The point of view is told from the teenager who doesn't understand society's \\"rights and wrongs\\" and is simply repeating what he has heard.  He never uses profanity himself, but rather just repeats verbatim what others have said.  And the profanity in the book is not used that much. <br /> <br />PROS:  I liked this book overall.  If you read a lot, especially bestsellers, and like something different each time (think Browns \\"Code,\\" McCrae's \\"A Tour of Southern Homes and Gardens,\\" or Martel's \\"Life of Pi,\\"-each of which are totally different yet unique), then you SHOULD read this book.  It is not like any other and is a good break from a heavy piece of \\"real\\" fiction.  While I'm not in love with this novel, I didn't throw it across the room as I did with \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" which REALLY was a let down. The best part of the book for me was the way Haddon showed up the parent's frustration with their child and this was extremely heartbreaking.  Very well done. <br /> <br />CONS:  I thought the idea and execution of \\"Rain Man\\" was better and more easily accessible to the general public.  Christopher's \\"voice\\" gets extremely tedious and there are ramblings, which, while showing us how the mind of an autistic teenager works, gets old quickly.  You get the idea after about three pages.  After that, it's just irritating.  The book could easily have been a hundred pages shorter.  Bottomline is:  You SHOULD probably read this book, but don't expect anything terribly earth-shattering. <br /> <br /> <br />Melissa Ellis review taken off Dec 27, 2005 <br /> <br />
B000001ESJ|5.0|\\"A Farewell To King's\\" is probably the second best Rush album from the 1970's behind \\"2112\\".  Songs like \\"Closer To The Heart\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\", and \\"Madrigal\\" show a very emotive side to Rush that would reappear decades later on albums like \\"Roll The Bones\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\".  These songs each have memorable chorus and verse lines, and the guitar/bass/drum playing is still truly great given the short length of these songs.  Rush has always been a good hit singles band from my point of view. <br /> <br />The other three songs are more of the lyrical and instrumental showcase brand of song (these songs are:  \\"A Farewell To Kings\\", \\"Xanadu\\", and \\"Cygnux X-1\\").  I will say, however, that these three remaining songs are among the most sophisticated tunes in rock.  <br /> <br />For newcomers to Rush, I cannot recommend this album enough, especially when you compare its music to most any otehr album.  yes, it sounds somewhat like 2112 and somewhat like Hemispheres, but it really stands on its own (even though the track Cygnus X-1 is really part 2 to a marvelous sci-fi story).   <br /> <br />For casual fans of Rush, or for those fans who haven't listened to 70's Rush, pick up this CD.  It contains the most variety and surprising elements of any Rush album. <br /> <br />For the rest - the rabid Rush fans - like myself - let's go to the internet message boards and ask Rush to play side one of 2112, Cygnus X-1, and Hemispheres all in one concert! <br />What a trip that would be! <br /> <br />
B00003CXQX|4.0|I was strong-armed into seeing this by a young friend, and now I'm glad. <br /> <br />What it is: nice little character-driven movie, in some imaginary, vaguely meso-American time and place. The self-absorbed Emperor (David Spade with charming sarcasm)is forced to cooperate with a peasant (warm and loveable John Goodman) and inevitably becomes a Better Person. Requisite bad guy Yzma(Eartha Kitt) and her sidekick are scary but there's never any doubt that good will triumph.  <br /> <br />What it isn't: No historical events getting butchered, no legends ruined, no sickening love stories between unsympathetic characters inserted for no reason. (In a rare and refreshing move, Disney included a happily married youngish couple instead of manufacturing a romance and ending the story with the marriage!) <br /> <br />There's a totally new character in Kronk, the bad guy's sidekick who is not evil or sniveling; he's good hearted (just misguided) and not stupid--just very narrowly focused. I was rooting just as hard for Kronk's happy ending as for the Emperor to get his new groove. <br /> <br />Not a movie to change your life, but good entertainment (dare I say it?) for the whole family.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I do not own a TiVo and find no need to have \\"a show\\" that is \\"mine\\" <br />and I watch weekly, that is until \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" came along which in <br />my humble opinion is the finest hour on television each week. I never <br />thought I'd be so let down by a show not being on during its scheduled <br />slot, but when there's no \\"Grey's\\" Sunday night I feel let down and <br />sad. I love all the characters, their diverse style and the writing is <br />fabulous. I think that T.R. Knight is the best of the bunch and that <br />Sandra Oh is a close 2nd, but they are all fantastic to watch and I'm <br />intrigued with each story line. The drama is intense, and since I'm not <br />a fan of \\"CSI\\" or \\"ER\\" I couldn't believe how captivated I was by this <br />show, I don't know what they're doing differently, I only know there's <br />something real and special to this show and I think mostly because of <br />good people like Mr. Knight as well as others. I can't wait to see <br />where they are going to take these characters, it is so fun to watch <br />them work their asses off while I relax and eat my popcorn, thanks for <br />a great show ABC! Now if only they'd switch timeslots with the cruddy <br />show before \\"Grey's\\" so people could see where the real quality is at, <br />that would be priceless!~
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Few words can really describe the true beauty of this recording, and few words can convey the feelings which emote when listening to this album. Being my first experience with a Sufjan Stevens album, I was quite literally taken back by the sheer scope of this album, both lyrically and musically. The album, in it's entirity, can be best likened to a painting, with every track making up a part of the entire picture, which in this case, is the state of Illinois. To skip, shuffle or selectively listen to this album would be a crime to it's sheer beauty, and would certainly undermine it's emotional impact. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, to summarise this album in a simple review would be nearly impossible. It is very rare that an album aims this high, and succeeds, and for that, a purchase is not only mandatory, but a necessity. Music is music, but this album may transcend any defintion of music you may hold.  <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is a great album for him to end on. Those who have followed Johnny's career can still appreciate this album because of the emotion in it, even though most songs may not have been his own. On this CD, he made them his own. <br /> But I will have to disagree to those reviews on here that say Johnny Cash isn't country music. Cash is as country as Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. These are all the Godfathers of country music, They made their music together, with eachother, and it was country. These reviewers obviously haven't listened to any Cash beyond this album. And I only think they say that because they probably hate country music, but like Johnny Cash. He, along with the other fellas of the era helped define and expand the genre by adding their own brand of folk to it.  <br />    My grandfather sang and listened to country, and only country, and he died in his pick up truck with tapes of patsy cline, merle haggard and Johnny cash in the dash. The man was country. That was what country was in his era.

He takes you on this tense rollercoaster ride and you experience just about every emotion humanly possible while reading this book.  I just can't say enough- READ IT!!
0596007124|5.0|How many times can you say that a technical book is entertaining, fun to read and packs lots of information into your brain....not many times. Well, this is one of the great books that does all of that.<br /><br />The patterns are explained in a creative setting, with the smallest possible example code (so you learn the topic, not wade through a bunch of non-topic related code).<br /><br />My only issue is that they don't cover all the patterns, they give a brief overview of the remaining patterns at the end of the book). But, they do cover the most used and useful patterns in detail.
B000AP04FG|1.0|Definatly not worth seeing. I think the only reason this movie made any money at the box office was because of the rumored realationship between Angelina & Brad. I can't beleive Brad Pitt even did this movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna does ABBA.
B000BP86OG|3.0|Justin Hawk sings like a faery choir boy and I have the impression that The Darkness takes itself only a little more seriously than Tenacious D.  Certainly when the band's debut album was unleashed on the music listening public it had the effect of a rough shake of the shoulders followed by a cheeky smack on the ass.  The sound was not original, but the concept was at least fresh:  unapologetically hard rock riffs, laughably powerful vocals, and ridiculous lyrics (love on the rocks with no ice?).  The Darkness had managed to re-brand 80s heavy metal for 2000.  I think on first listen people all around the globe must have looked at each other quizically, shrugged their shoulders, and rocked on.<br /><br />Only with the release of 'One Way Ticket to Hell . . . And Back', The Darkness has abandoned its freshly branded sound for, to be honest, cheesy glam rock.  There are no bawdy guitar riffs to back up Justin Hawk's voice and on this album he sounds, at times, weak and camp.  A dissapointing lack of 'shake-your-head-in-wonder' vulgarity (get your hands off of my woman . . . you c**t!) leaves me thinking that this band has maybe started to take itself seriously.<br /><br />But whatever, I'll get the album for 'One Way Ticket To Hell' and hope that their live act still rocks hard.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've waited a long time for these guys to put out some new music and it was WORTH THE WAIT.  From the very first cut \\"the pain that I'm used to\\" I was pulled right back into their magic.  This is a foot tapping, head bobbing, sing along out loud type of cd.  It immediately brought back memories of their \\"101\\" cd, which is still my favorite.  This is certainly worth the cost of the cd.  DM should be proud of the legacy of music that they have brought to us.  If you don't have this - get it now and enjoy the music.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|It's probably impossible to rate this version without comparing it to the 1995 BBC version, which is longer(you get to know the characters), better casted(way better) and more fun. <br /> <br />This version is so short that when you are used to the BBC version it just feels rushed and characters and balls have been completely cut out. Lydia is back home almost before she has run away (or so it feels). <br /> <br />The casting is not very good. The only one who matches the 1995 version is Mr. Collins. He is really good (although not as fun) in this one.  He is very annoying which is his job :) <br /> <br />Many of the lines are delivered in a very flat manor. For example \\"Are the shades of Pemberly....blah blah\\". She does not sound REALLY disqusted by the very thought. It's like the line is just read without any feeling behind it.  <br /> <br />Miss Caroline Bingley is noway as sophisticated and superior as when portrayed by Anna Chancellor. Mr. Bingley is almost too goofy but I have not read the novel, so I don't know if he is supposed to be so goofy. But I don't see why the serious and shy Jane would fall for that silly person. <br /> <br />Another thing is the music by Carl Davis which I really missed. In the 1995 version every important character had it's own tune which underlined the character and really helped with the flow of the movie(well episodes). <br /> <br />This new version is not wholly bad (hehe). Actually compared to many of the other BBC series like Middlemarch, Wives and daughters it is good. But compared to a masterpiece it fails utterly and completely. <br /> <br />2 stars!
B000025SJ8|4.0|Varg Vikernes is an absolute psychopath, a racist, and a murder; but he crafted some amazing music. 'Aske' is among the pinnacle records second generation black metal (though not nearly as impressive as the likes of Darkthrone). Fans of black metal should, well, already own this album.
0393327655|4.0|In The End of Faith, Sam Harris offers us perhaps the most blistering critique ever written on the possible evils of organized religion. Harris' basic premise, which is rock-solid, is that people are generally reasonable and only believe things about the world around them when presented with sufficient evidence. However, when it comes to their religious beliefs, their critical thinking goes out the window: people tend to believe the most absurd things about life, virtue and death, without a shred of evidence, all because they have been told to believe this by some religious authority or some holy book.  <br /> <br />In the first 2 chapters, Harris outlines his premise as described above. Chapters 3 and 4 chronicle the atrocities that have been committed in the name of Christianity and Islam, respectively. Harris comes down particularly hard on Islam, claiming that no true Muslim could ever come to any other conclusion than the need to kill members of other faiths. I'm sure many Muslim scholars (and practitioners) will disagree with him. In Chapter 5, Harris explains how Christian beliefs have led the US government to make bad decisions on issues such as abortion and the war on drugs. Although the link to the rest of the book is tenuous, Harris does a superb job of backing up his position. The last 2 chapters deal with the objective existence of ethics in the absence of religion and the possibility of spiritual experience without blind faith. <br /> <br />When he is at his best, Harris is nearly unstoppable: the thinking is clear, the writing is easy to follow, and the arguments flow. He loses his readers, however, when he delves into more philosophical tangents, such as what it really means to be an \\"I\\" that can observe the world and interact with it. Also, he also glosses over several obvious flaws in his argumentation: for example, none of the most murderous conflicts of the last 60 years (World War II, Korean war, Vietnam war, Rwandan genocide, Congo war) have had obvious religious causes. Though Harris does mention what he is against is dogma, not just blind religious faith, he spends awfully little time on the nationalistic or ideological dogma that has often had the same effect as religion.   <br /> <br />Overall, the arguments are effective: Harris deserves points for challenging the politically correct view that we may never question a person's faith and beliefs. He even argues that religious moderation is one of the most dangerous forces in the modern world, since it serves to disguise the religious wolf in sheep's clothing. Atheists reading his work will no doubt feel vindicated and understood. Ultimately, his point is valid: in a world where religion leads people to massacre civilians, fly planes into buildings, and claim land as their divine right, maybe it is time we started looking at some of these beliefs with a more critical eye.
B0006GAOBI|1.0|Just another boring movie that goth kids will pull-one off to. The pinnacle of pseudo intellectualism and kids who beg their parents to take them to Hot Topic, then pretend like they don't know them.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Here we have another example of an artistic genius made into only a semi-likeable person, in order to tell a story which does no justice to the man and his music. In order to sell itself to a large and semi-literate artistic/musical public, the music, terrific as it is, is once again put in a secondary level with a story that makes the great composer seem like an infantile, bathroom humored semi-cretin! Yes, there are some fine scenes of Amedeus at the piano as a youth with his sister and Dad supervising. And the costumes, and settings are all top notch! But can't we have a real movie about the real greatness of an eternally great artist like Mozart without the crassness, and feeble storytelling which is probably essential for ticket sales?! Probably not! Having said that, if you can forget the incipid general themes of the movie, including the idea that Salieri poisoned Amadeus, an old idea spread around by conspiracy-mongers,and concentrate on the historical settings and music, this movie is as good an intro to Mozart as Holloywood, or any visual medium, is likely to come up with!
B00005JOFO|1.0|A second rate love story that has gained notroiety by being about gay love. Just a gimmick, nothing more. Don't get me wrong, unlike a lot of other idiots, I have nothing against the idea of homosexuality, the movie just blows.
B00005JLYW|3.0|With my girlfriend, and since this is kinda like a chick flick, her and i saw it together.. and were going to see it a second time with our other friend,who said, the women are hot, and i said yes indeed... it may not be the best movie in history, but a good action film. Not to be picky. but cameron and drew are getting up here as far as age, lucy liu is the hottest and the cutest. Dont get me wrong some scenes cameron looked great in bikini's, and drew looked scary at the end. with that big ol chin of hers,not to be mean. and drew use to be a hottie?? but there were only a few scenes when she looked hot and it was when she had two gallons of makeup on, cameron also.. cameron was also hotter years before especially in THE MASK with jim carrey. wow what a babe. Demi moore still is in great shape, but you can always spot wrinkles on her face especially when she smiles. cameron as well. I shouldnt be making these comments because i too will know whats its like to lose my looks as i get older, i'm 24 now but times flies. I especially enjoyed the music in this film. yes some terrible lines and some cheesy dialogue and barely a plot. still great action. although exteremely unrealistic it was still a fun film at the movies just us girls. still a great time. and i especially like it when they changed into new outfits and disguises in almost every scene. But yes i agree first charlie's angels was better....
B00003W8NM|2.0|Despite a few key scenes and decent one liners, 'Fight Club' is simply self-indulgence at its peak (until Donnie Darko of course). Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they neglected to include direct quotes from the book (written by the god-awful king of pseudo intellectuals Chuck Palahniuk).    Though I did think it was funny when Meatloaf's brains fell onto the floor.

SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS.
B00097DX3U|1.0|all these high ratings probably mean that Audioslave fans dont expect much.I got this cd as a Christmas present,and I was so bored that I gave my copy as a Christmas present to another friend (who didnt like Out of Exile much either).The problem is that while these veterans may play good technically,the music feels muted and forced.Chris Cornell especially sounds like a 40 something father of three pretending to be 'down with the sickness' for the rock kids but having nothing more to say.And it is hard to believe that he had one of the best voices in the early 1990's.I doubt he could even pass a American Idol audition today.  This kind of music is also not very interesting being \\"Mature\\".Both 'Rap Rock' and Grunge were all about angst.The big drama and big release from wailing vocals and loud guitars.Out Of Exile on the other hand is safe and bland and uninspired radio rock-Rage Against Nothing.I'm so happy that my other friend got me the SOAD cd-now that is the kind of exciting music members of Audioslave would have been making maybe 18 year ago.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|I'm a Renthead from way back - I was fortunate enough to see the original cast on Broadway, and have been a huge fan of the show ever since.  And I was so excited for this movie I could hardly stand it.   <br /> <br />So I was a little disappointed that I didn't love it instantly.  I do like it a lot, and I suspect that it will grow on me even more with subsequent viewings.  Therefore, I'll own the DVD. <br /> <br />The good news for other Rentheads is this:  the DVD will include \\"Goodbye Love\\" as an extra. According to Christopher Columbus' video blog on the official webpage, the movie didn't work with that scene.  He said it killed him to cut it (and that the editor, who suggested cutting the scene in the first place, cried as they took it out), but that the film works better without it.  He said he would definitely include it as an extra, but he would never put it back into the film itself.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought this CD on an impulse - one which I have not regretted for one moment.  In fact, I am greatful I didn't pass it up!  It is pure musical delight that doesn't fade with continued listening. I have enjoyed it over and over!  Rarely have I encountered a CD on which every song is my favorite (well maybe one isn't). Her sound is Billy Holiday-ish but she is still uniquely Madeleine. Her accompanying musicians are stellar as well.  This is a quality piece of work from the first take to the last.  I know there are a few people who might not agree, but I confess I don't understand them!
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is a revelation to a person who has never smoked, injected, swallowed drugs. I, too, think it was important to stop romantizing addiction and make the consequences clear and honest.    The literary style of James Frey is quite compelling because it deconstructs an addicted personality and psyche. The reader lives the additction and the pain. The writer has involved the reader in his addiction, and subsequently dares the reader to take the ride with him to sobriety on his terms. It also made sense to me that addicts would rather help one another than work on their own problems. Afterall, they have been in denial for years and years. So it is not surprising to me that he gets involved with Lilly because he thinks he can help her. It is a compelling and intriguing story.    What Mr. Frey probably does not realize is that even though he does not accept the substitution of a higher power for his addiction, he has substituted a type of spirituality with the compelling matra \\"hold on.\\" This spirituality does not take on the same type of assumptions as AA, which makes it different, and probably what made it work of Mr. Frey.

B000024D4R|4.0|1976 saw Pink Floyd at a crossroad of sorts...punk rock was coming in along with disco and the west coast sounds of Fleetwood Mac,Eagles ect.In their newly aquirred studio/rehearsal spot,Brittania Row,the Floyd was trying to come to grips with a new album.Dogs and Sheep were already pretty fleshed out by then from numerous live renderings and Pigs was a rant about the government and censors that dominated England at the time. <br />The ballad Pigs on the Wing,written for Waters wife,was originally one song that was seperated into two parts for 8-track,a popular format at the time.A dark album(disc)that does have moments of classic Floyd musical interludes and they also rock hard,especially on Pigs.The last time the Floyd would record as they were before The Wall and its difficulties effectivly split the band. <br />One of my favorites and always a great disc to listen too on a rainy day.
6305075492|5.0|I'm not going to spend time raving about the movie, because I'm going to assume that if you've got this far you already know how wonderful it is.  What I think could be far more useful (as this is an area where I have been burned) is some comparison between the two DVD editions I know of. <br /> <br />I have copies of both the Kino Video edition and the Image Entertainment edition.  My preference is for Image Entertainment for the following reasons: <br /> <br />(1) The print seems slightly cleaner (and most helpfully, the DVD packaging warns you about the horizontal line across the top of some scenes which is a defect on the original film) <br /> <br />(2) The intertitles on Image use the correct expressionistic style as per the 1920 release.  from what I recall, Kino's are the 'normalised' printed intertitles from 1923. <br /> <br />(3) The Kino version has possibly the most insensitive layer transition location I have ever come across.  For reasons of their own Kino put an intertitle before the final sequence in the asylum, and it would have been a natural place for a layer transition.  Instead they put it a few seconds into the final sequence (and only a couple of minutes before the end of the film!).  Image has no layer transition. <br /> <br />(4) Both scores on the Kino version are dreadful.  One consists of strange electronic noises, while the 'orchestral' one is pretty inappropriate.  Instead Image chose a very nice specially composed score by Timothy Brock which is a remarkably effective pastiche in the style of Alban Berg (very appropriate for an expressionist film). <br /> <br />(5) Image has a commentary track; it's not clear that Kino does (I can't remember, but certainly it isn't mentioned in the blurb on the back). <br /> <br />Just about the only plus of Kino is that there is considerably more bonus material (43 minutes from 'Genuine: the tale of a vampire' as compared to about 3 on Image).  However, if the price for that is the awful layer transition, then I know which I prefer. <br /> <br /> <br />So that's why I prefer the Image version and wish I hadn't bought the Kino version.
B00005JJX8|3.0|TO CATCH A THIEF is a light, frothy confection, full of beautifully shot location scenery, a mystery whose resolution is not rushed to conclusion, (though it should be obvious early on) wonderful verbal repartee between the brilliant Cary Grant and the never-lovlier Grace Kelly, with perhaps a dollop of comic frosting on the top to make it all go down quite nicely.  Just the sort of pallette cleanser to prepare one for the masterpieces to follow.
0307276902|1.0|Most of the glowing reviews state the power of the author's honesty in telling all the nasty secrets of his past.  Oprah herself SOLD the book on her show by saying she had to meet the man who lived through this extraordinary nightmare.  She ranted over and over about his criminal past - being wanted in 3 states.  The guy made the whole thing up!   Injecting himself into a real tragedy just for the sympathy is not only dishonest, it is sick!   And now we are to believe that he just fabricated a few things to grab an audience.  His mother stated on Larry King Live that she didn't even know he was drinking and doing drugs.  Nothing he has to say can be believed.   <br /> <br />Shame on you James.  Shame on you Oprah.      <br />
0393327655|5.0|The author clearly did a massive amount of quality research based on the references listed.  This is the best book about using reason and rational thought to create a better World since Thomas Paine's Age of Reason!  A must read, now only if we can get the religious people that cause all of the intolerance, hatred, murder and wars to read it and use their God given brains in positive and productive ways versus destroying their brains with religious venom.  Maybe someday we will live in a World where parents stop poisoning their children by teaching proven false religions to each generation of their poor helpless children who believe anything their parents tell them.  Let's face it, if you read the bible it is clear Moses is guilty of war crimes against humanity by ordering the murder of innocent women, children and men but sparing the young virgin girls to be raped and enslaved by his people who were murderous barbarians!!!  This is the basis for Judaism and Christianity?!??!  This is not from God, this is the work of murderous barbarians.  Also, if you read the Koran it orders the murder of anyone who is an infidel and does not follow their religion!  When people claim these religions are about peace and brotherly love they are complete liars!

B000002VJH|5.0|The Dead are best appreciated live and rarely made the successful transition to the studio. Blues for Allah is one of the few exceptions. It's a marvelous album containing some of their strongest songs. In 1975 the Dead took some time off from their grinding tour schedule, wrote new songs and created this gem. Many of the songs became Dead touring staples including Franklin's Tower, Help On The Way and The Music Never Stopped. The melodies and playing are superb, the country influences heard on previous albums starting with Workingmans Dead are largely gone and replaced with a jazzy bouncing sort of swagger. But what really makes this album for me is that the Dead stretch out and jam on many of the songs including the two instrumentals King Solomon's Marbles and Sage And Spirit. That jazz like spirit permeates Blues For Allah and makes it more akin to the Deads live performances than other studio albums. Closing the CD is the beautiful and trippy Blues For Allah suite. There's a wonderful feeling about this very odd song, like an excursion into the desert at night with an atmosphere of mystery or discovery.<br />And that atmosphere somehow permeates the entire album making Blues For Allah a more interesting affair than any Dead studio album post American Beauty. That the songs were written around the same time, specifically for this album gives Blues For Allah a cohesiveness largely missing from other Dead studio albums. Many of their other albums seem to be collections of songs they happened to be playing at the time or those that hadn't been released on previous albums. But with BFA every song somehow fits with one another making a larger whole. I would argue that BFA is their second most successful studio album right after American Beauty.
0684833395|4.0|\\"It's a Catch 22.\\"  It seems I've heard the phrase all of my life and never been able to put my finger on what it actually meant.  Reading the book mostly clarified it.  A Catch 22 is illogical thinking, explained in a logical manner contrived to suit the people who make the rules.  For example:  If you are crazy, you should not be in the army.  How does one go about getting classified as crazy?  You'd have to tell the doctor you are.  Having the insight to tell the doctor though, means you are sane.<br /><br />It's difficult.  I liked it - don't get me wrong, but the man has an extensive vocabulary and really seems to enjoy using it.  Also, he's a bit crazy and reading crazy sometimes makes me feel it.<br /><br />It's an Anti-War story written about the Second WW.  I guess when Vietnam was going on these books were really important - they showed the pain of war, rather than the glory.  I've read a couple of them in the past year or so and I feel almost the same about each.  I get why they were written but I don't identify.  I feel like I've missed something almost by not having a comparative analysis of my own.<br /><br />It's also a black comedy, but by the end I couldn't shake the \\"black\\" enough to enjoy the \\"comedy.\\"<br /><br />I really did like it, I just don't think for the same reasons it became a best seller.<br /><br />The main character of this book is Yossarian, though he is not in all of the chapters.  He is a philosophical character whose anecdotes constantly put him in center stage.  His demise is heartbreaking, his brilliance is beautiful and his thoughts are totally soulful.

B000C65Z1G|1.0|That's the problem with this Meirelles offering.  A little old-fashioned straightforward storytelling would have gone a long way here.  That's what a movie is--a story with visuals, not the other way around.  Yes, beautiful scenery is terrific, but enough already with the over-saturated colors--they're distracting and remind us we're watching a movie.  Ditto for the jittery hand-held camera work.  Also, has there ever been a widely successful film with a Le Carre script and/or storyline?  No, and here's why:  His stories purport to be thrillers, only they're not thrilling.  They're just unlikely, incoherent and relentlessly downbeat.  Justin's \\"love\\" for Tessa and his willingness to forego continued existence because of the memory of it seemed unlikely to me.  She was a spoiled, wealthy brat who had almost no time and even less room in her life for Justin.  She lied to him constantly except for the one time she was honest with him when she admitted that her \\"work\\" (poking the Establishment in the eye with a sharp stick) was everything and that her life was nothing without it.  Additionally, the motive for her grand crusade went unexamined.  It seems that a drug company has discovered a cure for drug-resistant TB which will forestall a coming pandemic which will sweep the globe.  Unfortunately, the drug is not perfect and there have been \\"some\\" deaths in the trials.  How many?  1 in 10?  1 in 1,000?  This isn't revealed.  And when is this global outbreak of untreatable TB expected to break out?  If the pandemic is to begin imminently, then these are acceptable risks considering the alternative (no treatment).  If the pandemic is to start in 5 or 10 years then the market will address the problem with another drug company producing a safer treatment.  For a so-called \\"thinking-person's\\"-type movie there doesn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the crux of the plot.  The storyline is as jarring as the camerawork.  Just being different doesn't always mean better.
1594200106|5.0|I did not have any expectations when I started this book. It was recommended to me by my bookseller. It sat on my bedside table for awhile before I started on it but when I started I just could not stop. I read it straight through in less than a day. It's a great ride. I don't understand why some readers didn't enjoy it. I certainly did.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Alrite yes, i admit it may not be KoRn's greatest acheivement ever but they don't give up. And it's good that theyre trying somthin nu with the techno-metal feel. If they did the same thing as they did in the mid 90s you people would get bored of it still. And all you \\"Hardcore\\" kids that are \\"too good for korn\\" i hate hardcore stuff (norma jean anyone haha) but i can still aprecciate korn and even softer bands (eg. red hot chili peppers, AFI) you need to open your minds just a crack.    Twisted Transistor-9/10 some of the best korn vocals ive headr in a while and the guitar intro is the best one ive heard since confined    Politics- 8/10 i love his veiw he doesn't care!!! and the drums sound like older korn david was a stronger drummer in the 90s and the chorus is ingenious    Hypocrites 5/10 not a very good song kinda weak guitars and fieldy isnt heard as much    Souvenir 9/10 one of my favorite songs on the album bass is very good and i love the way the other instruments cum in after the intro    10 or a 2 way 7/10 dont really know what it means but its pretty good     Throw me Away-7/10 Reminds me of issues which i think was one of their strongest albums    Love song 8/10 sounds A LOT like marilyn amnson    Open up 3/10 blah    Coming undone 4/10 blah    Liar- 10/10 best song beautiful chorus sweet inrto love the bridge    for no one 5/10 not too much thought    Seen it all-7/10 pretty kool sounding intro but really dumb sounding vocals    Tearjerker 10/10 so depressing and it is so quiet at the beginning but the drums pound with a min and a half to go and john begins to scream
B000066SBB|5.0|There's been only one of her. She is by far one of the greatest vocalists and artists of all time. The soul genre shook under the feet of this mighty woman (thats not a dig at her weight - I swear), for hers was the mightiest of voices, and it has never been captured better, than on this collection.  <br /> <br />Granted, Aretha is one of those singers that with almost every song sung offered an essential piece of music to cherish and remember, however, most fans of her music (and i am one for sure) can still never be without her hits. They're all here. A one disc collection of her recorded work is, frankly, a joke - unless part of a series - like Rhino's The Very Best of Aretha Franklin '60's and '70's CD's. However, a two disc set is fairly acceptable, and this is the best you will find.  <br /> <br />Combining the lady's many Atlantic hits, and some slight rarities, as well as her Arista power house throw downs, is a God-send, that any fan will adore, and sew a special pocket on all their clothes for its carriage so as to never be without it(maybe, or is it just me?).  <br /> <br />Although thats not to say that only fans would appreciate this collection. I'm sure any more casual fan of, say, Respect or Think or Chain of Fools (which i assume anyone with ears is), would highly likely fall head over heels in love with much of the material included here.  <br /> <br />Therefore, it is my recommendation that everybody buy this CD. And might I suggest that if you like this you buy some of her remastered reissued original albums, so as to hear the overlooked gems on each.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I'll be honest - When I first heard this album, I was DISAPPOINTED!  I wanted something much heavier and more like RAGE.  I almost gave it away to a buddy of mine all the while cursing Cornell on how he could make an album like this!   <br /> <br />Then I listened to it much later and fell in love with \\"The Worm\\"  Gave it more of a chance and now I LOVE IT!  \\"#1 Zero\\" is by far my favorite track - it just kicks you in the ass.  \\"Dandelion\\" and \\"The Worm\\" round out my top 3. <br /> <br />So those of you who may hate this CD, chill, listen to it later, and you may just be surprised....

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Despite initially being somewhat put off seeing it by the rabid behavior of some of the more fanatical fans of the series, Serenity was easily the most enjoyable of this year's admittedly disappointing crop of Summer movies, so naturally it proved a box-office flop despite its modest budget. As if aware that this probably was a last shot deal, Joss Whedon manages to provide a genuinely satisfying finale to the dominant plot-thread of the series that leaves just enough of an opening for further adventures if the DVD sales pick up. But beyond that, he takes some surprising chances, particularly his willingness to kill off key cast members (one of the few areas where seeing the TV series actually is necessary: without their backstories it's unlikely their genuinely unexpected deaths would be quite so affecting), providing a sci-fi movie that's not just sassy and funny but also surprisingly touching as well. Certainly in the film's final moments you get a real sense that this has been made with real love for the characters and the setting rather than by focus groups and merchandizing arms, something long missing from sci-fi movies: the final lines could just as easily apply to the film's box-office rivals as they do to the Serenity.     Some of the regular cast members do tend to get sidelined, it's true, but never to the extent that you feel cheated - not least because it avoids the Star Trek movies trap of adding redundant big scenes for each of the fan favorites to lure them back. And in Chiwetel  Ejiofor's Operative, very much a logical evolution of Richard Brook's calmly pathological bounty hunter in the Firefly episode Objects in Space, he creates an intriguing villain, a true believer with a coldly rational mind, regarding himself as a necessary and monstrous evil creating a world without sin in which he will have no place.     The setpieces are both fun and ingenious (not least the way they manage to break through the bad guys' blockade) but not without consequences, and the big secret at the heart of the conspiracy actually makes sense. The only slight minus was the addition of sound effects to the space sequences, when their appropriately silent small screen equivalents seemed so much more novel and memorable. Eminently shiny.    The extras are good, but be warned that there will apparently be even more extras on the UK and, especially, Australian DVDs.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|It arrived today and like a teenager waiting for his parents to leave for the weekend, I waited for my girlfriend's next door neighbor to clear out before I put it on (I gave in half an hour ago). <br /> <br />I just finished the first disc and I am knocked out! There is a lot on here to digest-many different musical styles, many different time periods. Some stuff I've heard before, some I haven't and some I can't stop listening to.  <br /> <br />Disc I Song-by-Song: <br /> <br />\\"All Night\\" is a fun little punk romp. \\"Sad\\" is a powerful song of loss that affirms love and memory will always trump death. \\"Down\\" is a bouncy, moving-on type song-an upbeat \\"Rearviewmirror.\\" \\"Hitchhiker\\" is a kind of fun, throwaway diddy. \\"Don't Gimme No Lip\\"... eh, it's there. Kind of like when Stewart Copeland would do vocals on Police songs-it's for hardcore PJ/Stone fans. \\"Alone\\"-PJ people will know this one. This was my song when I got kicked out of college. Gen X-ers will remember their abject alienation. Beware though, this version is a bit different sounding from the bootleg. Fans will miss the raw-ness of the live version from '93 or so. \\"In the Moonlight\\"-this is a cool song-kudos Matt Cameron! Driving beat and check-out those melodies. This song is quite a departure. The only problem is it's too short and doesn't sound like it was finished. \\"Education\\"-The Doors anyone? It starts off that way, then turns into that primeval moaning Vedder has trademarked. \\"Black, Red, Yellow\\" and \\"U\\"-these were left off of \\"No Code\\" and \\"Yield\\" respectively for a reason. The bridge on \\"BRY\\" is reminiscent of \\"In Hiding.\\" \\"Leavin' Here\\"-PJ doing their best Motown rave-up. It reminds me of that footage from \\"The Kids are Alright\\" where The Who cover Martha and the Vandellas-dance Pete! Oh but it gets even better, \\"Gremmie Out of Control\\"-Vedder and Company doing... SURF MUSIC! That's right, cowabunga dude! Vedder's vocals do not gel with this material but it's always interesting to hear an artistdo something different. \\"Whale Song,\\" uh... yeah, the keyboards are interesting-very 80s New Wave maybe(?) \\"Undone\\"-quietly politically polemical ala PJ (one reason I do luv them so). \\"Hold On\\" was done during the \\"Vs.\\" sessions and will remind you of \\"Dissident.\\"  <br /> <br />Finally,, we come to, you guessed it \\"Yellow Ledbetter.\\" The comparisons to Hendrix are trite and not worth rehashing. This song has had a couple of working titles (I think) including \\"Ledbetter Blues.\\" What can I say, the liner notes quote Mike as saying he \\"doesn't know what it's about and doesn't want to!\\" Anyone who's lost a friend to drug abuse knows what it's about-\\"Can you see him... walking away.\\" Much better and understated than \\"Save You\\" off of \\"Riot Act.\\" I remember I was coming back from a funeral to drop off my car at the mechanic's and this one was playing on the radio on the ride over. I couldn't believe it, I almost lost it right there in the lot.  <br /> <br />That's always been the thing with Pearl Jam for me, I've always been able to personalize the songs to something I've been through or thought about. Overall, it's a great compilation. Admittedly, the best stuff is from their earlier period but the newer stuff is still relevant.  <br /> <br />This is the first time I've listened to Pearl Jam sober in quite some time (it's not an insult) but that could change as the evening progresses.
B00008EY65|1.0|Nice movie for the die hard comic book fans I guess, but here you have a bunch of potentially interesting characters that I ended up not caring one bit for.  Soap opera city!  Slick look, but style over quality.  It's just not fun.  Very disappointing.
B000002I97|5.0|I saw John the first time at William and Mary Hall at a \\"festival\\" when this album had just been released.  I saw him 4 more times, last time when Bruised Orange was new.  <br />He writes and sings with more raw passion and wit than anyone.  Buy this one and his next 4.  They are amazing.   <br /> <br />Thanks, John for the music.
B00000JNJ1|4.0|I love the Rolling Stones, but often when I'm in the mood for them I end up listening to Faces instead. I'm not sure why that is, but this collection offers a lot of great evidence to ponder while I'm tryin' to figure it out. Cinema enthusiasts may recognize \\"Ooh La La\\" from the \\"Rushmore\\" soundtrack (Rod Stewart also re-recorded it not too long ago, but this original is far better), and \\"Stay With Me\\" pops up on classic rock radio every once in awhile. Beyond that, Faces didn't have a lot of hits before Stewart's solo aspirations, Woods' ascension to Stonesdom, and Jones' flight to The Who did them in. What they had mostly was just great, fun rock songs.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Great album, great bonus track, great booklet... <br />ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SPECIAL EDITION OF A MADONNA'S ALBUM!!!
0307276902|4.0|Halfway through this book the media explosion happened with The Smoking Gun claiming the book was more a product of great imagination than actual fact. I refused to read the article until I had finished the book so I wouldn't be influenced by any seeds of doubt. First off, regardless of truth or fiction, the book is a powerhouse. Like strapping yourself into the first car of a rollercoaster that combines velocity with hairpin turns, it grabs you from the first paragraph, and doesn't let go. Reading it I was shocked that this was an Oprah selection, and couldn't imagine her viewers digesting this,littered as it is with cursing, and vivid descriptions of bodily functions, fluids, and the most horrific dentist scene since 'Marathon Man'. Frey has since admitted he's embellished elements of the story to heighten the drama, and after finishing it, that seems clear, especially the slightly sappy and melodramatic 'David and Lisa',like fractured souls falling in love in rehab, and an incident with a Priest in Paris. However that's a small blip in what is a great read regardless of if some, all, or none of it really happened.
0307276902|5.0|This is still a great book.  Frey's biggest problem is that he is successful and also outrageous.  He has no reverence for the literati, and he also contradicted the old-school substance abuse wisdom re. 12 Step programs.  John Berendt didn't tell the truth in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but you didn't see any outrage about that (What, you didn't know that the murder happened before he ever moved down there?) <br />  This stuff from the Smoking gun is crazy:  they seem not to understand that Frey's book does not deter people from participating in treatment, rather it shows that despite his immature behavior while at Hazelden, he was still able to stay clean and sober after discharge. <br />  I am not qualified to say much about the veracity of police records, but I have heard that many people are quite surprised, often pleased, at what does not show up in their criminal background checks. At any rate, a memoir is a story of what the author wishes to communicate about his life.  It does not lose its power or value simply because some of the facts are not verifiable as described.  Even the outright falsification of facts does not necessarily ruin an otherwise fine piece of writing such as Berendt's book or this one. <br />
0307276902|1.0|I just finished reading this book about a week ago and as a recovering alcoholic and crack addict myself, it did not ring true from page 1. If it was as easy to stop using as Frey made it out to be after just making up his mind to stop, there would be no need for rehab and ongoing treatment programs in the world! Sure he gives a good portrayal of the depths to which we do sink, but his supposed journey of how he quit is just too pat and oversimplified even amidst all his descriptions of the supposed depths of his addictions. I do believe he was in rehab. I do believe he drank to much and did some drugs when he was younger. Naughty boy. But to call himself an' addict and an alcoholic', and imply that in the end all he really needed to do was just make the `choice' to quit, is dangerous for the true addict or alcoholic as well as the dangerous to the people that love them. <br /> <br />Regardless of what Frey embellished, (in my opinion a lot more than what is being proved by TSG) the real problem with this book is that it has put back the whole field of recovery a half century or more! First of all, most addicts do not have parents that will send them to a rehab costing thousands of dollars to recover. Most TRUE addicts have made the 'choice' over and over to quit without a program only to relapse again and again. Does anyone really think we ENJOY killing ourselves, slowly, hurting the people that love us, losing our lives, killing ourselves slowly? If it was really just a matter of making the choiec to quit, don't you think we would all be just quitting without ongoing recovery program such as AA or SMART? Quitting on our own without a support program is impossible for the majority of us addicts. As an addict and alcoholic myself, I do not believe James Frey is or ever was a true addict or alcoholic. Writing his book to portray himself as such is his true crime.  <br /> <br />This book may be an inspiration for some addicts and I am sure ALL the people that love anaddict. We all want HOPE! But in this case it is a false hope at best, maybe according to the latest developments, even a `fictitious' hope.  <br /> <br />My deep concern is that too many people that love an addict are going to read this book and have the false expectation that their addict will just read it and quit the next day. My other huge concern is that Frey's put down's of the AA 12 step support as being, his words something to the effect of:  `weak and substituting one addiction for another...the meetings' will be detrimental to the millions of addicts that might otherwise seek this program out as a means of support for quitting. I for one am very happy that this book has been exposed as a possible work of fiction. I hope that the publishers will go one step further and place it where it belongs, in the FICTION catagory!  <br /> <br />Belittling a program such as the AA 12 Step Recovery is dangerous ground to be walking on. For a majority of us addicts, this is the only affordable place we can seek help. What will Oprah and Frey do when addicts start committing suicide because all of a sudden there is a book out there that tells their families and society around them that all they need to do is `decide to quit'? What if the addict reads it and says to themselves, 'if James can do it, so can I\\", but falls back into the addiction? They will feel even more weak because some stupid author who is possibly not even an addict said all he did was make the choice to quit and did it! Addicts already have very fragile self-worth. Failing to live up to this book with all of it's popularity and endorsement by someone as powerful as Oprah? Heaven forbid the poor addict can't do it!What if the addicts can't afford to go to a rehab center for months? What if they were contemplating going to AA but because of Frey's book say it is useless?  <br /> <br />There is a much bigger crime in Frey's book than embellishing a criminal past that did not exist. Embellishing an addiction that didn't exist and consequently being able to miraculously conquer it for good `just like that' is the real issue I have with this book. I apologize for this being so long, but I don't want anyone to be given FALSE hope. <br />
B00005M91K|5.0|There's not much else to say... This movie is epic. It's semi-documentary in style, but carries an amazing story with a great soundtrack and the visuals are second to none! The whole movie is a masterpiece from every angle of conception.<br /><br />Be weary of any other recommendations from viewers that have watched this movie. Nothing can compare. They just aren't in the same category!<br /><br />I've bought several copies of Baraka over the years. It's a DVD worthy of everyone owning or seeing at least once!
0307276902|1.0|There's a big difference in puffing up a story and flat out lying about it. This book is about his personal recovery. But then again it's not his story is it? It's a mythical character that he created to sell books. It's a mythical character with  mythical adventures. If the book had been listed as fiction I wouldn't have a problem with it. But lies are lies no matter how much color they add to the story. Oprah is dead wrong to say the lies are much ado about nothing. I guess any whacko can lie about their history, road to recovery and because it helps the story sell it's alright. Two Thumbs way down!!
0307276902|1.0|The man tells a good story. But it's not true.<br /><br />While people declare the book's message is still worthy in spite of hearing about the controversy surrounding this so-called memoir, the plain fact is that this book is pure fiction and events depicted never happened or if they did, it was in a greatly reduced fashion. No matter how noble the message, that does not make it right for James Frey to tout this book as the truth when it isn't.<br /><br />In fact, Frey originally wrote this book as fiction, but after being rejected by about 18 publishers, he did a major overhaul on his manuscript and VIOLA! The book is reborn as his memoir, and James Frey's Bad Boy image is born. Poor Oprah has the misfortune of selecting his book for her Book Club.<br /><br />In his book, Frey keeps mentioning about being a Criminal with a Capital C. Well now he is, because he has duped Oprah and millions of others into believing his story was real. It seems James Frey is playing The Michael Jackson role--that of a guilty-as-sin, maligned, picked-on victim being investigated by \\"haters and doubters.\\"<br /><br />[...]
B00005KB9R|5.0|This is not \\"Bob Marley and the Wailers.\\" That's an anachronism. Bob Marley and the Wailers didn't come into existence until after the breakup of the original Wailers. This is the masterpiece of that original band. Marley's solo work was brilliant, of course, but it's a different kettle of fish from what you get here. Here you get the vocal and spiritual harmonies of three great musicians -- Marley, Tosh, and Bunny Wailer. The songs, many of them recorded years earlier without the sound quality they deserved, are beautiful, soulful, spiritual, and righteous (I can't deal with Scratch Perry's brilliant but rather low-fi productions of the time, so the pre-Island stuff is out for me.)  If you get this, and also the deluxe issue of \\"Catch a Fire\\" with the original Jamaican mixes (sans Chris Blackwell's cheesy overdubs -- you should hear how pure and amazing \\"Stir It Up\\" is without that d*mn synth), you've got all the Wailers you need, and two amazing documents from the fountainhead of reggae.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I 1st got into Nightwish while looking at some homemade movies and one of them had the track, over the hill & far away. I got that album and Once and after a couple listens to the Once album i cannot stop listening to it. Tarja has a Wonderful voice that does not get tiring to listen too and while the metal guitar riffs are somewhat simple, that isnt what makes thes song so amazing, its the orchastral accompanyment and haunting vocals that suck you in deeper and deeper with each listen. This is a must add for anyone who loves Music and isnt jsut a collector of a genre of music. It really isnt classible as metal, this music is something all its own.
1565847032|5.0|Chomsky has written so much so its hard to know where to begin and almost impossible to read it all. So a \\"best of chomsky\\" type of book is very useful. Together it comprises and education between two covers that will give you new way of thinking about the world and our (US) place in it.  <br /> <br />The beautiful thing about Chomsky's writing and philosophy is to have a clear moral/legal view and apply the same standards to ourselves that we apply to others. His basis in lingistics is very scientific and he applies the same sort of definitions and applications of ideals to the behaviour of nations in a Euclidean sort of way. (E.g. he shows that our common use of the word \\"terrorism\\" comes down to things other people do to us but not the other way around) Those who disagree with him, are merely showing the degree to which they are indoctrinated with propoganda and not able to follow his principles intellectually or morally. Often his detractor's arguments revolve concepts such as \\"We have a special right to ...\\" (invade a country, occupy a country, befriend a tyrant, etc.). No conservative can debate Chomsky, and phoneys like Ann Coulter fall of their chairs when they learn Pat Tilman was a Chomsky fan). <br /> <br />The only criticism I have is that much of the prime of Chomsky's writing seems to have taken place in the 1980's. Of course he is still active to this day and speaks out about the US and Middle East and other places. But the attention to Central America and Cambodia seem (I hate to say) no longer of much relevance in a specific way. Of course they are very relevant in a general way because the same types of things continue to go on daily.  <br /> <br />I also liked Chomsky's book on the Middle East illusions, and the little book \\"The spectacular success of propoganda\\" is the subtitle. There are also several Chomsky DVD's which are well worth having. In the same vein, the documentary on Zinn is highly recommended.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Oh, it is so great to see the Strokes experimenting with new styles of music; It's nice to see that their not just rehashing the same old formulaic sound off their first album. It is kind of a shame however, that the members of the Strokes have turned into ball-less pansy little girls. But that's all right because, you see, it quite obvious that they were going after the ten year old girl market, that's a huge market you know. I really like how all the energy, drive and artistic depth have been completely sucked out of this album. Who knows, maybe with their new bland parental approved brand of rock & roll the band would like to come play at my sisters high school prom this year.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I remember when the original \\"Concert For Bangladesh came out on 3 LP discs (Vynal record albums for the young uns). I played them over & over again...except side 1. I just couldn't appreciate the music of Ravi Shankar (It just sounded like a lot of noise to me back then). I don't know if it had to do with the aging process, or watching the performance, but the Shankar part is one of the most fascinating parts of the concert. At one point, it almost looks like a duel between Shankar (on sitar), and the sarod player. And the Tabla player is excellent. Had I not SEEN it, I never would have appreciated it. (I think I'll take a second look at my Monterey Pop film).<br /><br />The sound & picture are clean. The performance (a real piece of history) should be in anyones collection.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|Dark water was a movie a lot of people expected to be really good but the truth is it isn't. It's almost like false advertisement because the movie wasn't scary at all and it was very boring and way to long. I fell asleep a after the first half hour and when I watched the parts I missed I knew why I went to sleep. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen, you find is some interest in it to see what's up with the dark water but it turns into being a watered down version of The Ring. Everything is obvious from the beginning, you know why the dead child is torturing the apartment building and after that you just watch to see how she died. The only thing making this movie even a little worth watching is the surprising ending. It's better to see the original Japanese version anyway.
0307276902|1.0|I read this way before Oprah's deal.  I first tried to read it randomly, and lost interest after the dentist scene (terrible).  I read it all the way through when I quit smoking.  Time filler.  I was shocked.  I thought it was a pretty bad piece of writting, but this guy was telling his life story, and it was pretty gripping in that sense.  If this book was a fiction book, it would not have made it anywhere.  It does matter.  You're crazy if you think it doesn't.  I can't figure out why I'm obsessed with this.  I'm not mad so much.  I just want to see this guy dragged through the mud.  What a scam.  He should run for office.
B00003CWPL|1.0|This is my pick for the WORST movie EVER.  The sound track is like listening to a crying baby, someone scratch a blackboard, and white noise at the same time.  The images are a combination of fear factor and an abstract painting.  Run for your life unless you are trying to desensitize yourself before spending an eternity in hell.  Hell couldn't be much worse than watching this movie.  I can't believe I made it to the ending credits.  I must be a masochist.
B000006O7C|5.0|This CD is one of my favourite CD's of all time. You people saying that the disc 2 is not worth listening to, you haven't got it, have you..? When disc 2 really starts with \\"haven't you heard\\" (the first two songs are remixes from disc one), it takes you to a totally unique experience all the way to the last chord is played. <br /> <br />I feel dragged into a spiritual world in a way I've never been before when listening to this record. It's so raw and naked that it took me a long time to like it, but when I first did, it just got better and better for each time I listened to it, and it still does. Jeff Buckley is truly one of the most gifted and talented musicians of all times, if not THE most gifted. My favourites on the disc 2 are perhaps \\"we could be so happy baby (if we wanted to be)\\", \\"murder suicide meteor slave\\", \\"demon john\\", and \\"Jewel Box\\", but all of the songs, except \\"your flesh is so nice\\" perhaps, are just unbelievable. <br /> <br />I do not dare to think about what this could have become if he got to finish it.. Jeff Buckley has, with all of his music, added new aspects into my life, and I am forever grateful. <br /> <br />But it surely takes time to like the second disc, you will probably think it's just weird and far too raw if you don't give it a real try, but if you are a Buckley fan (which you all should be), listen to it until you like it, and trust me, you won't regret it. I can't get it out of my cd-player, not even to play Grace!! <br /> <br />By the way, the first disc also rocks!!(\\"Vancouver\\" is just soo cool!!)

B00005JO1Y|4.0|Kids today may not have been interested in sitting down to watch the old King Kong and the Jessica Lange remake, but they will be with this one.  Good casting, reasonable acting, especially Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody, and outstanding effects make this a solid fantasy movie to watch.<br /><br />Very much showing a \\"comic book\\" approach to camera angles and stilted dialog in the live action sequences, the film is most remarkable when Kong is in the scene, especially when coupled with the lovely Watts.  Furthermore, as a thrill ride, Jackson challenges many human phobias in ways reminiscent of Indiana Jones movies.  In the same way, \\"Everyman\\" Adrian Brody is often surprising as the unassuming hero, not unlike Indiana Jones, too.<br /><br />Many complain about the film's length, and I can't argue that the film didn't need some deletions for time, but it's clear that the director was very interested in showing what he could do with his animation effects.  So he did and the film grew in length to accommodate.  So, yes, there are lulls, but there are subtleties in those lulls, too.  A careful viewer will find lots to be entertained by in this movie - just remember to suspend disbelief and all will be well.
0340718269|5.0|Mr. Commitment by Mike Gayle is an excellent chick-lit book.  I initially was interested in reading this solely because it was written by a male, as opposed to the normally female chick-lit authors.   <br /> <br />Mr. Gayle did not disappoint.  It was very interesting to get the male's view on girls, although this novel still has a very decidedly chick-lit feel to it.  Duffy, the main character, is absolutely the quintessential modern-day \\"emo\\" man.  While he can sometimes be a bit whiny, I believe the reader will generally come to root for Duffy, especially given his rocky family history and genuine love for Mel, his girlfriend. <br /> <br />If you've ever been curious about what guys think of girls (and come on!  What woman hasn't??) then this book is something you will want to pick up.

0553213105|5.0|My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.<br /><br />While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come.
0395389496|4.0|The title of this book is The Polar Express, and the author is Chris Van Allsburg. The Polar Express was published in 1985 by Houghton Mifflin Company. This is a children's book. The book is a Christmas store of little children getting on a train on Christmas Eve that is going to the North Pole to see Santa and everything that goes on up there.<br /><br />This book is about how this little boy sees a train that is stopped in front of his house on the night of Christmas Eve so he goes outside to see what is going on. He walks outside and talks to the man that is working on the train and the man tells him that the train is going to the North Pole. The boy doesn't believe the man is telling the truth since he doesn't believe in Santa Clause. The little boy gets on the train anyway and he finds that there are other children on the train and they all believe that Santa Clause is real. The boy goes to the North Pole and finds that there really is a Santa and he then believes that there is a Santa no matter who tells him any different when he gets home.<br /><br />I believe that this is an excellent Christmas story and the children will love it. Most children believe in Santa Clause so they may like that this little boy doesn't believe but then later changes his mind and sees things that go on at the North Pole so children may like that. I also think that it is a classic Christmas story. This book is easy for children to relate to.
076790592X|1.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is trite. If something profound happened or was said, Albom missed it. Morrie faced his terminal illness and his death just the way that he faced his life which is exactly the way that everyone else faces these same events. When Morrie was interviewed by Ted Koppel, Koppel asked him what he dreaded most. Morrie responded, \\"Well, Ted, one day soon, someone's gonna have to wipe my ass.\\" What a lot of other people dread is being incapacitated and not having anyone who will wipe their asses because they can't afford to pay for a sufficient number of health care workers to tend them round the clock and they either don't have family or their family has to work to maintain the living so that they don't have the time and the energy to spend 24 hrs. a day caring for a loved one who is dying. Many also dread placing such an emotional and financial burden on their loved ones.  <br /> <br />Morrie says that everyone knows they are going to die but no one believes it. I disagree. Everyone knows they are going to die but very few of us know when. <br /> <br /> <br />
0553801503|4.0|I loved the first three books of this series and looked forward to A Feast for Crows, it seems, forever.  While I enjoyed book four, I am extremely disappointed by the fact that I again have to wait for a year or more to get answers, and that the story may take many more volumes to conclude. I think Mr. Martin is a great story teller, but I hope he doesn't do what Frank Herbert did with Dune - namely, to make the plot so convoluted that no one knows what's going on, and then leave us hanging with no satisfying solutions/conclusions.  I firmly believed that book four would be the \\"The End\\".  If I had known that this series was going to go on forever I wouldn't have entered the world of Westeros.  Having to wait years in between books is devastating and I hope Mr. Martin puts all the pieces together very soon. Nevertheless, I highly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire.

6300270432|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times and NEVER tire of watching it. As someone involved in Japanese Budo and having been to Japan several times, I get lost in the movie each time. Watching Takakura Ken perform the first Iaido kata-Ippon Mae: Mai is excellent. <br />The cast speaks for itself. Premier actors/actresses. I even see Kishi Keiko on shows I watch now on Japanese TV. One of the central and underlying themes is that of \\"Giri\\"-translated by Ken as \\"the burden hardest to bear\\". I think we in the west have by and large no real sense of that level of indebtedness. And for that I am sorry. The story is well written AND the soundtrack will be availble soon on CD after 30 years!!!!!! I am so very happy. Now all we need to do is cut this movie released in its full length (123 minutes in Japan) with both Japanese and English dialogue and subtitles in DVD, REGION FREE format. What a great day that will be ;-) <br />For those students of Budo, Japanese culture and who want a glimpse into the multi-layered aspects of that culture, I highly recommend it! (The previous was an unpaid endorsement of this title).
0517123207|1.0|Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence.  This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades.  One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts.  That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the \\"Descent of Man,\\" not \\"Origin of the Species\\" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.    Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development.  It's the worse case of reductionism in history.  James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book.  They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton.  They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological.  How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific?  Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment.  Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.     First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75:  \\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.\\"  There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book.  Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection.  Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye.  See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, \\"Hume, Newton and the Design Argument.\\"  Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.    But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake?  First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks.  Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded.  Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it.  A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this.  I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards.  Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book \\"Statistical Mechanics.\\"    Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's \\"Descent of Man\\" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey?
B000002JSN|4.0|Physical Grafitti, Led Zeppelin's sixth studio album, was released in 1975. <br />The band was at the top of their game in that time. With releases like Led Zeppelin II or ZOSO, They became gods of rock n' roll and influenced many musicans with their blues-rock style. However, when Houses Of The Holy was released in 1973, They left their blues roots and started to experimentate with various styles. The follow-up to that album, Physical Grafitti, is also not quite essential Zepp release, nevertheless it's an excellent album. On this record, the band uses hardrock, but darker and experimental sound. They also add various elements of many styles to the music here. There is some blues, sythenizers, folk, and much more. The final result is excellent. <br /> <br />Custard Pie opens the first disc of the album. Though it's not its strongest track, it's a really good opener. This rocker is just classic Zeppelin rock. Bonham's drumming gives this song a funky sound.  <br /> <br />The Rover is one of my favourites on the album. The riffing is great and the song has a dark sound overall. Just a very cool rocker that You'll surely grow to like. <br /> <br />In My Time Of Dying is dramatic and mysterious rock opera. Jimmy Page shreds out some good riffs and Plant gives a fine vocal performance. For Me, however, this song is a little too long and a bit repetitive. Not to say I don't like long songs, but in this particular one the band repeats the same parts over n' over again and in moments doesn't manage to keep things interesting. It's still pretty good, though. <br /> <br />Houses Of The Holy is a leftover from earlier album of the same title. Actually this song would fit pretty well there, but it also fits well here. A good, funny and happy rocker. The lead riff is very catchy and the entire song is excellent. <br /> <br />Trampled Under Foot is another killer tune. Page's riffing, suported by Bonham's drum beat, shakes Your body to dance. John Paul Jones does a good job on the keyboard. <br /> <br />Kashmir is propably the most famous song on the whole record, and for a good reason: it rocks! The lead riff is what a good riff should be, it's easily one of the best and most recognized in rock history. Though the song lasts 8 min.+, it won't let You down. It's an epic in itself and a rock anthem every rockfan knows. To sume it up, it's an amazing masterpiece. <br /> <br />In The Light opens the second disc of the album. This number starts with mysterious, almost haunted melody, and then turns into a dark rocker as the riff comes in. It's another epic that deserves attention. <br /> <br />Bron-Yr-Aur is short but sweet. It's an acoustic instrumental that never fails to please. The melody is beautiful and charming. Don't overlook this little gem! <br /> <br />Down By The Seaside is a mix of country, pop and blues. The ending result is pretty cool. The song is sweet and features great bluesy licks from Jimmy Page. It also has a rocking part in the middle that breaks the mood of the song well. Overall, it's another excellent track. <br /> <br />Ten Years Gone is sad, but inspired ballad. It has that dark feeling to it. One of the greatest tracks on the album. <br /> <br />Night Flight is a decent rock tune that is catchy in its own way, but sappy in the other way. Quite interesting, but You can pass it by. <br /> <br />The Wanton Song features a riff that is quite similar to that from Immigrant Song. It's another good rockin' tune, but also nothing that special. <br /> <br />Boogie With Stu is a funny blues jam. Always something good to listen to. Well, pretty cool song. <br /> <br />Black Country Woman is country tune with some good acoustic work from Mr. Page.  <br /> <br />Sick Again, a dark and powerful rocker, closes the album. This song is not as great as other rockers from the album, but it's pretty good and a nice closer. <br /> <br />Physical Grafitti, in my opinion, is not Led Zeppelin's strongest album. There are a FEW songs thatgive You the feeling of \\"filler\\" and could be cut, but for the most part, this album is satysfying. Of course it's not as catchy, shocky, straight in-your-face like let's say Led Zeppelin II, but it's still an excellent effort. If You're a Zepp fan, this is a must have, but if You're a new fan, I'd recommend Led Zeppelin II or ZOSO first. Come back to this record once You taste essential Zepp sound. <br /> <br />
0385507755|1.0|Should have been a \\"Million Little Lies\\" James Frey. <br />He write a fictional novel that is rejected by 17 publishing houses and then on his last attempt changes the context and make the novel a memoir. The book is filled with over exaggerated, vulgar and macho egos of the wild minded Frey. <br />The book was very capturing as a memoir, and very disappointing as a fictional novel. <br />He makes up a story contrived from what I can only believe as a wild imagination and over exaggerations of others lives. <br />He gets to the heart of the reader with love, death and a against all odds of fighting addiction. <br />He convinces true addicts that if the have the will they can conquer the demons. After finding out these memoirs were fictional I felt ripped of and betrayed by the author and his greed to deceive his readers and fellow authors as well as lead true addicts down the road to self-destruction.
0060934913|4.0|This book may not be for everyone; but, then, surprisingly, not everyone seems to get it.  Oddly enough, although the author seems to be quite experienced, hip, urbane, wordly and well... a \\"New York\\" chef; still, his book seems to ask the more experienced reader, \\"so what?\\"   <br /> <br />Where do we go from here?  I would give the author higher praise if he put behind the drama and got on to the next thing.  Affectations, no mater how naked or open, are not becoming. So although I give 4 stars, it is really a B or B-.  Perhaps his work is not quite finished.  (FYI: There is no A+ at chef school.) <br /> <br />It is ironic, that on occasion, Mr. Bourdain presents an occasional riddle in his memoir.  Its as if he questions what all his toil or success is all about. Yet, he doesn't go there, perhaps for fear of over intellectualizing.   After all that's contrary to the so-called work ethic of the kitchen, as he sees it.  Stick it out and just do it-- no matter what it takes. Or get out of the way.  That's his philosophy.  Or maybe that's not really it-- perhaps its insanity? <br /> <br />Well, I lived in New York for years. I expect anything and lived with everything.  I understand -- even studied--the French; i.e., culturally, historically, linguistically, etc.  I am a foodie myself.  I have grown up in food business, with generations of food business on my shoulders.  But I am Italian-American.  I am originally from Northern California. And so, I say, \\"So what!\\"  Been there, done that.  What's next? The last great American food revolution was, quite frankly, well beyond New York and all things French.  In fact, all things New York and French are almost dead now, in my opinion.  It been that way for decades.  Americans love Italian, Chinese and Mexican.  Go to any food convention or show, but also study our commercial culture, and then you will see that.  \\"Haute Cuisine\\" is only that.  There are West Coast trends that are equally tired, although Bourdain seems quiteclueless to them.   He makes no mention of it, except of a fleeting, admitedly ignorant California wine tasting.  The wine business is over-successful here and just as silly and pretentious as the French, with their fancy marketing nonsense. More, too, there are other tired \\"regional cuisines,\\" popular since the revolution of the 1980's gourmet movement. So, then, is this cutting edge or just postured attitude and ego?  I also share Bourdain's disdain for many celebrity chefs, but that does not say much, given all that.  They were already famous, when he was doing dope (no offense meant). <br /> <br />Bourdain is an engaging writer and I love his honest, brutal, stream of consciousness writing; but...  Did it occur to the author that there is a whole world out there, unlike NYC, unlike the French and unlike ego-maniac executive chefs.  And, said to what little he gives, there is indeed a thing called high-end, authentic Italian, unlike what he unflatteringly describes in his book.  There are so many ways of doing things.  Moreover, its been done!  Done to death!  There is lots of diversity out there and not everyone sees things the same way.  Ask what is good and what is right and you will get many opinions.  There are so many other people who make this industry, who call themselves, chefs, restuaranteurs, foodies, operators, owners, etc.  All of them are successful and/or failures.  This book is affirmation or fascination for some of them; and perhaps it is MUST reading for industry newbies; but, despite this book's honesty, it honestly is not all that honest.  A lot of it is indeed postured drama.  A lot of it is blindsighted bias and just plain full of itself.  Working with chefs, from inside or out of the kitchen, I'd say its very much Chef!, but there is more to being a foodie, than being just a French chef in New York City.  Attitude is nothing more than that.  Experience and insight, however, is another world beyond this.  Here's a taste... here's a place atthe table... now let's enjoy our food, be thankful for it and move on.  We have good food to eat and a lifestyle to live; but, after having said all that, and after being in the business for generations, I will tell you that its not simply a passion and choice for one over another.  Its a \\"simpatico,\\" for everone and everything and all things done.    <br /> <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Films that mess with your head and make you think long after they're over are the best movies.  This is definitely one of them.   Donnie Darko started small, just playing in very select theaters in select cities.  Basically everyone who saw it fell in love with it and it instantly became a cult classic.  Nobody really understood what was going on, but something about the film grabbed them.  Now with this director's cut, audiences all over will finally understand what the hell the movie's about.  From the visually astonishing cinematography to the incredible acting to the mindbending plot, Donnie Darko is by far the most outstanding over-all film of the past decade. <br /> <br />IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS YEAR, SEE DONNIE DARKO!
0061020710|4.0|Having read a few other novels in the Discworld series, I must admit that I was a little disappointed with Terry Pratchett's maiden voyage.  That is not to say that it isn't imaginatively as humorous and discordantly funny as some of the others I am more familiar with.  It is just that \\"The Color of Magic\\" seems to be so discordant as to make one wonder how the entire series spawned from this.<br /><br />\\"The Color of Magic\\" introduces readers to Discworld through the eyes of Rincewind, an inept magician who cannot say the only spell he knows (because he doesn't know what it is or what it will do), and Twoflower, a tourist who has 'hired' Rincewind as a guide.  Their time together is littered with adventures and misunderstandings, each one more outlandish than the one that preceeded it.<br /><br />And this is the very problem with \\"The Color of Magic\\".  There is so much movement between space and time and different lands and magic fields, that the readers as tourist get a little lost in the shuffle.  Terry Pratchett is a brilliant writer with an uncanny eye for the absurd and the book is filled with his trademark humor.  Even though I got a little lost on this voyage through Discworld, I look forward to reading more sagas about this land that is not too unlike our own.
0307276902|1.0|Drink and drugs make most people boring, and this is no exception. The book is the narcissistic rant of an egomaniac who seems to think it's entirely all right to misbehave. <br />North American society has created a wretched culture of celebrity that has deemed Frey's behaviour acceptable and something to be admired, rather than calling him to task and ensuring that he and only he takes responsibility for what he's done. <br />It's not even a polemic or cutting-edge, since so many others have lined up to tell their stories.  It's not big and it's not clever, it's just dull.  Frey is not a superior person, he's just a person who thinks he is.
0393327655|2.0|A few quick thoughts: <br />1) A subject this large is far too complex for Harris' polemic. <br />2) The enlightenment critique of religion is a hardy perennial and has been done before and better by Voltaire & Bertrand Russell, among others.  Perhaps we need a contemporary reminder, but this is a shallow refreshment. <br />3) Read the sociologist-cum-historian Rodney Stark to get the other side of the story, i.e. some of the long term positive effects of Christianity in the West. <br />4) Harris cannot be a serious writer on this topic without referencing John Locke's \\"Letter Concerning Toleration\\". <br />5) Any polemic against religion in general that fails to acknowledge the 148,000,000 civilians murdered by communist regimes during the 20th century is intellectually lacking to the point of dishonesty.  Marxism was modern, rational, \\"scientific\\" according to its times, and explicitly atheistic.  Religion, that \\"opiate of the masses\\", looks pretty good by comparison. <br />6) Unless of course you argue that communism was harmful precisely to the extent that it became a secular religion itself -- which is called begging the premise. <br />7) I'm not sure who said that the only true sins are crimes against human nature, but it was a brilliant humanist insight. The need to believe in religion is part of human nature.  You cannot eradicate religion, nor is it reasonable to try.  You can perhaps gradually alter its doctrines, subordinate its place in the polity, and/or channel its effects within society, as recommended by Locke (the great thing about the separation of church and state).  <br />8) Regarding Islam in particular:  It is a theocracy that does not recognize the distinction between church and state.  Nor can Islam admit of Koranic criticism or reform, for the Koran is held to be the direct, immutable, and eternal word of Allah.  You can see the tensions between its origins and the modern world.  I can do no better than to quote Nietzsche from his essay \\"On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life\\": <br /> <br />\\"A religion for example which, under the rule of pure justice, is to be transformed into historical knowledge, a religion which is to be known in a scientific way, will at the end of this path also be annihilated. The reason is that the historical audit always brings to light so much that is false, crude, inhuman, absurd, violent, that the attitude of pious illusion, in which alone all that wants to live can live, is necessarily dispelled: only with love, however, only surrounded by the shadow of the illusion of love, can man create, that is, only with an unconditional faith in something perfect and righteous. Each man who is forced no longer to love unconditionally has had the root of his strength cut off: he must wither, that is, become dishonest.\\"  <br /> <br />Nietzsche's observations are a problem for any believer, but Christianity has survived in a splintered and attenuated form because it has adapted historically, whereas Islam is less flexible and therefore in a crisis as it confronts modernity.  The shariah is all-encompassing.  I believe that many muslims are fearful of losing their culture under globalization in part because they intuit the truth of Nietzsche's criticism.  <br />
B00005JOII|4.0|In \\"Match Point,\\" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more \\"serious\\" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating.  Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky, the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy\\" (albeit set in England, perhaps to throw us off the scent). The parallels between the two works are not perfect, of course - in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted - but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did, indeed, do it all on purpose.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a down-on-his-luck social climber who marries into wealth but longs for the passion he finds with another woman.  Chris is a professional tennis player who decides to leave the circuit when he realizes he hasn't the skill to compete with the real pros.  Taking a job as an instructor at a posh, highly exclusive tennis club, Chris finds himself wining and dining with the rich and famous after one of his pupils, Tom Hewett, takes a liking to him and introduces Chris to his snooty but accepting family.  Chris begins to date Tom's warmhearted sister, Chloe, but he is really smitten by an aspiring American actress, Nola, who just happens to be Tom's fiance.  Chris makes the mistake of marrying Chloe before Tom and Nola call off their engagement and go their separate ways.  The fact that Nola is free but he is not doesn't deter Chris from pursing an affair with the woman who provides all the passion and excitement his loving but boring wife cannot.  But Chris soon discovers that carrying on an affair can result in a life filled with secrecy, lies, guilt and self-loathing.  And when the going gets to be just a bit too much for our hero to handle...well, there`s always that \\"final solution\\" lurking in the wings, as many an earlier adulterer has discovered to his everlasting regret.<br /><br />\\"Match Point\\" starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love.  Yet, Allen really knows how to draw us into Chris' predicament, so that, by about halfway into the film, we feel as enmeshed in his seemingly irreconcilable dilemma as he himself is.  Torn between the wealth and position he has as Chloe's husband and the love he feels for the relatively impoverished Nola, Chris is frozen into a state of paralyzing indecisiveness, his every waking moment a tormenting hell of fear and gathering dread as he keeps waiting in breathless anticipation for that other shoe to drop.  It isn't until the \\"other woman\\" becomes more of a burden than his clinging wife that Chris can finally launch into action.  This turnabout in the screenplay might strike many in the audience as arbitrary and implausible and there is certainly a case to be made for that.  But if you can go with the flow, you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story, which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that, for all the efforts we make to control our lives, The Fickle Finger of Fate - or in this case a tennis ball precariously balancing on the top of a net trying to figure out which way to fall - always has the final word.<br /><br />Allen has written dialogue that is incisive, intelligent and literate, and the performances he's drawn from the likes of  Rhys-Meyers, Goode, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail.  Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters, rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance, keeping us firmly locked in the near-claustrophobic drama.  Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.<br /><br />Guided by the hands of a master, \\"Match Point\\" is one of Allen's finest films in years.. <br /> <br />\\"Match Point\\" starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love.

B000002KBU|5.0|I think that this is one of the most hauntingly beautiful albums I have ever heard. I love her poetry and weird lyrics that jump from everyday conversation to these deep deep places in the heart. It hurts to listen to this stuff but its also incredibly euphoric at the same time.Melodies that go where they want to go with highs and lows constantlly surprising you. The song River is my favorite cause its so sad.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards \\"Catwoman,\\"  for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world.  In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.<br /><br />Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products.  When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen.  However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.<br /><br />The best parts of \\"Catwoman\\" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her.  It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society.  Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well.  Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.  Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her \\"fading\\" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\").  Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.<br /><br />The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film.  Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me.  And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long.  The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.<br /><br />Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable \\"Catwoman\\" turned out to be.beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\").

B00005QW5X|5.0|Why should any audience see \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\"?  Well, it depends on what type of moviegoer you are. <br /> <br />If you like the indie film way of characterization through vignettes, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you prefer imperfect characters and only slight resolution to bang-bang-pow-pow everything's-back-to-normal endings, you'll enjoy this movie.  If musicals get you hot-and-bothered, you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of David Bowie's mid-'70s work, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you like the goofy, glitzy pop craftsmanship of \\"Rent\\" but are looking for lyrics that probe deeper and lack the incessant pop-culture references, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you have been looking your entire life for a movie about alternative lifestyles that simultaneously eschews the typcal stereotypes of those lifestyles and pokes fun at them, you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Really, I'm pretty sure only Rush Limbaugh wouldn't enjoy this movie.  Then again, it's no \\"Passion of the Christ.\\"  It's much, much deeper, and much, much more fun to watch.
B000301YY8|2.0|I heard James Blunt's \\"Back To Bedlam\\" playing in a local music store at the local mall and to me it's just mediocre pop and nothing else. This guy sounds like he's been listening to The Bee Gee's since he was ten years old.  Atleast The Bee Gee's had talent, something this guy doesn't have! I hate \\"You're Beautiful\\" it's so mainstream pop and syrupy it's sickening. As a matter of fact the whole cd is just that! \\"Cry\\" and \\"Billy\\" are about as weak as you can get, both crappy acoustic guitar tunes.  Let me tell you James Blunt would have never have made it in the seventies. Artists like Cat Stevens, Paul Simon, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Croce, and James Taylor could run rings around Mr. Blunt. It's too bad, but our music industry is hopeless!

B000023VR6|3.0|When someone releases one of the top 10 albums in Hip-Hop History (The Chronic)it is really hard to top a masterpiece. When I first took a good listen to this, I was less then impressed with most of the album, as I felt there are only five or six really great tracks on this, maybe two or three ok ones, and the rest seem like just filler (and thats with a CD with a total of 22 tracks) Of course I think the time lapse between the two albums was way to long (7 years) and since Dre has been so busy producing and finding new talent, I believe that there might have been some \\"rust\\" when he went to do this album (its much easy to produce for others then write, compose, and produce your own album) Yet fear not, its still pretty damn good, and it might be the last thing we hear from him again, unless he is doing guest apprearences on other artist albums. The one thing I dont understand is why in the hell he is working with 50cent who I believe is one of the biggest fakes in the music bizz. Thanks for Eminem Dre, but you can get rid of 50 anytime....ENJOY
0312323859|3.0|This book follows up after her other work, \\"Something Borrowed\\" and is the second in the series.<br /><br />This book centres on Darcy, the girl in the first book that is the best friend of Rachel.  Darcy is a spoiled, superficial, whiner in the first book who was always wants the spotlight.  She lies and does whatever she can when competing for the #1 spot in anything.  Rachel was the smart, socially conscious lawyer in the first book who inadvertently falls in love with her best friend's fiance.<br /><br />In this book, Darcy has been dumped by her fiance and is pregnant with a new beau.  The new beau dumps her too, and she finds herself in need of a good friend and faced with the realization that her best friend is now unavailable and her usual dependence on her is glaringly obvious.<br /><br />Rachel decides to fly to England to visit Ethan, her childhood friend, to escape her situation and try to rebuild her broken life.  Once she arrives, her flaws and her poor decisions are brought to her attention and she faces the hard reality that she may need to mature and change in order for her to move on and find a happy life for herself.<br /><br />This book is great for an escape, and I enjoyed the last half of the book tremendously.  The first half was repetitive and could have been condensed 50%, in my opinion.  The first book is a better book, but this one was also a 'page-turner'.  The one criticism I would make of it is that there are no real strong female characters in this book or the first book.  Rachel doesn't stand up to Darcy when she should in the first book, and clearly she should have been fed up of her antics by the time she got to college and ventured out to make new friends and replaced Darcy, who she clearly had grown apart from.  Darcy is flaky, and it takes her until the age of 30 to realize obvious truths about herself, which I find hard to buy.  The ending to this book was also a bit too condensed, I felt.  I felt like she realized she only had to write 40 more pages, so she rushed the ending.<br /><br />All in all though, this a fun book and Giffin does a great job with the Chick-Lit genre.  It is also a very good follow-up to the first book.he only had to write 40 more pages, so she rushed the ending. <br /> <br />All in all though, this a fun book and Giffin does a great job with the Chick-Lit genre.

0684824906|5.0|Someone gave this to my husband for Christmas and I had no intentions of reading it as I'm a fiction lover at heart.  American history has never been especially interesting to me; however, I picked this up just to thumb through but found myself reading the first chapter and then couldn't put it down.  I've learned more American History than I did in all my high school or college. <br /> <br />The author does a great job in blending the political and personal.  After all, political leaders are much of what they are because of personalities and add that to the culture of the times and one begins to get a much more interesting and insightful view of why things happened the way they did.  The Civil War was a complicated affair; it wasn't just a case of the good guys fighting the bad guys and it certainly wasn't just about slavery.   <br /> <br />In short, I would highly recommend this book to anyone especially those fiction lovers who normally don't consider non-fiction.
B0000035E7|4.0|I'm not gonna start to compare 'Bleach' too much to their later efforts, but try to concentrate on this one. <br />It's very clear that 'Bleach' is music made totally spontaneously in a short time, and without any expectations of getting famous (unlike 'Nevermind'). <br />I really sense that Kurt Cobain is very anxious and ambitious already here, and these songs are pure pictures of his mind. <br />Muddy guitars, that very well reflect Kurt's complex and crazy head (and the fact that he wasn't very talented player...)make it a very honest album. While most songs here are petty forgettable, some do standout, like the Beatles-like 'About a Girl' which also proves that Cobain had a great sense of pop and that his singing is far better than guitar playing, though his rhythm talents are okay. 'Blew' is another highlight, though it's a bit frustrating, it is Cobain's filtered pop-rage at its best. <br />'Negative Creep' pretty much speaks for itself, with very angsty lines like 'daddy's little girl ain't cure no more, I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned..(yes you are), so I guess the best thing with 'Bleach' is its honesty, it's no faking! <br />'Love Buzz', despite its nice riff is a pretty boring cover, but definitely a notable song however. The rest is pretty much average punk that might grab you for riff or two or a chorus here and there, but the songs don't stick in your head, nor show off any great talent from none of the members. Krist Novoselic is a good bassist, thouhg he doesn't stand out as much here as he did later. Dale Clover is also an okay drummer, though it wasn't till Dave Grohl joined, that they really got a dynamic drummer. <br />Jason Everman is supporting guitarist on the album, although he wasn't around for a long time, and nothing much I can say 'bout him. I think this record is pretty much the only 'grunge' album that Nirvana made, with its muddy and dark guitars and some wicked vocals going from softer to loud screaming. <br />Definitely for a Nirvana fan, but if you really consider 'Nevermind' to be like the best album you've heard ever, don't expect 'Bleach' to be anything near it! it's very different! there is no 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' or 'Lithium' on this one, well I give the record 4 stars, for being an interesting effort that is so much better than anything that's pop nowadays, and for the few songs like 'about a girl' & 'neagtive creep' , that were some of the best songs Cobain ever wrote. Worth to check out! but not a masterpiece!!

B000H30B2C|5.0|The original KING KONG is the movie that made Peter Jackson want to become a filmmaker. His whole life he's been wanting to make his own version of KONG. Ironically it was the box office pounding of THE FRIGHTENERS that allowed Jackson to make KING KONG: he was supposed to have made KING KONG after THE FRIGHTENERS, but since it did so bad, the studio said no. So, instead, Jackson did the incredible and made THE LORD OF THE RINGS instead, guaranteeing him that he would be able to make any movie he would ever want. Thus, Jackson's version of KING KONG was finally made.<br /><br />The plot goes something like this. Slimy filmmaker and showman Carl Denham gets into some trouble. To escape it and to make the movie of his dreams (catch Jackson's own self-mockery here) he hires a ship to take him to a mysterious island that only he has a map to: Skull Island. Sailors have long told stories about this mysterious island, but common folk have disregarded such talk as that of a drunk or mad man. But, Denham believes and sure enough, his belief leads his ship to Skull Island. There they find a somewhat cannibalistic group of islanders who kidnap the only female on the ship, Ann Darrow, and offer her up to their god, the gigantic gorilla King Kong. Kong takes their offering, but instead of destroying it, becomes fascinated by Darrow. In fact, Darrow's beauty enchants the great ape.<br /><br />But Kong isn't the only one who has fallen for Darrow's charms. Jack Driscoll is a semi-famous author who fell in love with Darrow during their trip at sea. Risking everything, Driscoll ventures deep into the jungle to rescue Ann and bring her back home. But Kong won't be separated from his person of affection and chases Driscoll. However, a trap has been set and Kong becomes trapped.<br /><br />He's then brought to New York and put on display. But Kong isn't a beast that can be tamed easily. He escapes his chained existence and finds the girl of his dreams. Unaccustomed to the urban jungle, Kong climbs to the one place he feels most at home--on top of the city's highest building. There he enjoys a few moments of peace with Darrow, before he faces off with a squadron of airplanes.<br /><br />KING KONG is a very impressive movie. Jackson does an extraordinary job of re-creating 1930s New York and to remaining faithful to the original spirit of the first KING KONG. However, at the same time he does so much more. Jackson's version of KING KONG does everything from turn a &#34;B&#34; movie into an &#34;A&#34; film to illustrate the class system that is developing in America, to satirize the extreme materialism and consumerism of our modern culture, to re-establish the classic everyman (Jack Driscoll as played by Adrian Brody) as a potential hero. The movie works on so many levels and has so much to say. At the same time, it is just a great movie.<br /><br />The film is a bit too long and the whole insect thing could have been cut (Even though it might be crucial to the Dante-esque journey Jackson was trying to display). Nevertheless, KING KONG is everything movies were meant to be. I wouldn't doubt that if 30 years from now another brilliant director comes along and says, &#34;When I saw Peter Jackson's KING KONG, I knew I wanted to make movies.&#34;, Kong climbs to the one place he feels most at home--on top of the city's highest building.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I was initially scared how this film would play out...in fact, I was skeptical whether the film would even be shown in my town (Salt Lake City) -- if anyone has seen the recent media circus about one theatre owner refusing to show the film (Larry Miller, also the owner of the Utah Jazz NBA team), you probably understand what I mean. <br /> <br />After watching it the first time, I knew I was going to need to watch it again. There are moments in the film that I don't think I fully understood or heard what was being said...a couple days later I caught my mind thinking about the story, the characters, and the effect the film had on me. So, I waited a couple weeks and watched it again.  <br />It was so refreshing to see a gay-themed story told without all the stereotypes that so many other movies seem to be trapped into...The actors are believable, the soundtrack was beautifully complementary...leave your expectations at the door and just watch the movie and characters unfold, and you will thoroughly enjoy the experience.  <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Returns is a wonderful exercise in symbolism. It's also a fun ride. The old castle . . . moving from a paradise . . . to abandoned estate to reborn at the end all serve to mirror the hero's inner state. His relationship with bats works on many different levels . . . from fear to total control again mirroring the hero's inner psyche. How about his father's medical instrument? The tram? The company?? Any symbolism there? Batman Returns works on so many levels, and, as a boost, is loads of fun to watch(while scarfing down endless gummie bears of course).
B00005JO1Y|5.0|The new King Kong movie was very true to the 1930's movie.  If you were watching it, you could pick out things that were in the first movie.  In fact some of the lines were word for word.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I'm so happy that Enya has released a new album.  I've been waiting forever.  Amarantine is a well put together album.  I don't think there's one bad song on hear.  I bought this album the first day it came out and I love it too death.  \\"Less that a Pearl\\", is very beautiful song.  The title track is also great.  \\"It's in the Rain\\", and \\"Long, Long Journey\\" are great.  Actually the whole album is great.  I can't pick my favorite ones becuase I like all of them.  Well done Enya.  Only next time have some more tracks on here.  I don't want to have to wait another five years just to get tweleve songs.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is horrible. It's very well made. Very well acted. Very well directed. The cinematography is excellent. This movie is horrible because it is so real, and so depressing, and once you see it you will not be the same. I watched it a few days ago, and it is sticking with me like a splinter. I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel so bad for the characters. Their lives go so horrible wrong, and you want to stop them. You want to help them. You want to turn off the movie and run away, but you can't. You can't do any of it. You have to sit there a watch as their lives unravel. Right from the very beginning, this movie made me uncomfortable. I've never experienced cinema like this before. I'm used to being entertained by movies. This movie was not entertaining. That being said, you need to watch this movie. Everyone under the age of 40 should have to watch this movie. It should be shown to every high school student in the country. Then again, maybe not. This movie is so different from anything out there, I'd hate to make it common place. On second thought, don't watch this movie. Run away now while you still can. Oh, and by the by, here's a fun little exercise. watch this movie without a clock in the room. No watches either. When you get done, guess how long it was. Then check out how long the film really is. I bet you're way off
B000BPG2JC|1.0|I expected a lot better after reading the reviews.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This movie will be released on Platinum Edition October 3, 2006(date subject to change). This movie will be given the same treatment as all of the previous Platinum Editions (Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin, Bambi, Cinderella). This 2-disc set will include brand new bonus features and a fully restored version of the film. The Limited Issue release includes absolutely no extra features, and sometimes grainy picture quality.  <br />This movie is without a doubt, Disney at it's best. For more information on the Platinum release, visit [...] for information that is to be announced. You can also try the official website, [...] However, this website is not yet up but should be within a few months. <br />I highly recommend waiting for the Platinum release. <br />P.S.- Lady and the Tramp: Platinum Edition will be released on February 28. 2006
B00000DOZH|5.0|I originally bought this album for the title track. I never really heard the other songs and thought at first that I was taking a huge chance. And it actually worked! Not that I was ever doubting AC/DC's greatness... I just never heard anything else on this album besides the title track. Obviously, \\"Highway To Hell\\" is one of the many anthems of American music, along with songs like \\"T.N.T.\\", \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"Hell's Bells\\". Obviously it is one of their best, but when you look deeper into this album it is not just great for the one song, but the whole entire thing. Oh yeah, for anybody who said that all the AC/DC songs on this album sound the same, you must get your ears checked. If you listen to it good enough you will notice that the ten songs don't really sound the same. <br /> <br />Basically, you can listen through all 10 songs without skipping... it's that good. After the title track, it is \\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\". That is actually a pretty good song. Next is a very underrated AC/DC song, \\"Walk All Over You\\". That is one of my favorite AC/DC songs. As you progress, songs like \\"Shot Down in Flames\\", \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\" and \\"Get It Hot\\" make up the great points of this album. The only weak song is \\"Touch Too Much\\", but it is still a kick-ass track. If you are an AC/DC fan, then you probably own this already, and I would recommend this one if you are just getting into this band. If you like it (which you will) then get High Voltage and Back In Black. These are my favorite AC/DC albums that should most certainly be in your collection if you have a good taste in music. <br /> <br />AC/DC will always be remembered as the best rock bands of our time. They were fresh and original when they first came around, and wrote about immature things like girls and booze. One guy even said that Axl Rose was a better listen and not that immature. Come on... Guns n' Roses was one hell of a band, but get real. Usually I dont care much for lyrics, unless it is political or something, but the lyrics of AC/DC are fun. People need to open their ears and not judge music on lyrics... just listen to the music and you will forget about the lyrics. Oh, and even though Bon's voice wasn't the be-all-end-all, it fit the songs perfectly. I certainly recommend this album to any person that claims they are a rock fan.
B000BWI9U0|2.0|...that you never get another chance to make \\"First Impressions...\\", or however that cliche goes (it's true, of course)...But anyway, this is pretty much a holding action on the part of the Schtrokes - not terrible, but nothing particularly exciting or different, nothing that stands out. \\"Juicebox\\" is semi-exciting, but soon pales once the saminess and repetition of the Peter Gunn riff sets in...the most catchy, memorable moment is probably the Barry Manilow (!?!?) knockoff \\"Razorblade\\" - yes, the chorus quotes musically from \\"Mandy\\". So, nothing to be ashamed here, but I don't think this cements their career as they probably hoped it would.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw this anime when I was a pre-teen.  It was the first Japanese anime I ever saw.  I was absolutely captivated.  Now at age 27, I am still as captivated by it as the first time I saw it.  The first version I saw was the abridged English dubbed version.  I also had possession of the Japanese version but without subtitles.  Both were bootlegs and I watched them both several times (despite my inability to understand Japanese).  Before the Disney release hit the stores, a friend of mine found a boot leg copy of the Japanese version with English subtitles.  The subtitles were sloppy and inaccurate.  There was some dialogue that was never even translated.  However, with the understanding provided by the additional scenes in combination with a more accurate portrayal of dialogue than the English dub version, Nausicaa took on a whole new and deeper level of meaning and plot.   <br /> <br />I recently watched part of the Disney release with the modern dubbing.  I did not particularly care for the voice talent and acting.  Worse was the translations chosen for some of the dialogues.  Nausicaa, the main character, IS the ideal woman.  She is brave, strong, hopefull, compassionate, loving, gentle, intelligent, humble, and very human (she, despite being wonderful, has weaknesses just like everyone else).  I felt that the modern Disney English dialogue played down several of these strong virtues in Nausicaa's possession.  Being that her character is the central attraction of the movie, down playing these virtues is detrimental to the emotional impact of the movie. <br /> <br />Tonight, I just watched Nausicca on Turner Classic Movies (TCM).  They showed the film in the original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.  This was not the same version as the boot leg that I already own.  The version the TCM showed was by far the best rendition that I have ever seen of Nausicaa.  Her inteligence shines in the dialogue, more so than any other version and her sweetness and humility are just a strong as the older English dubbed version.  I am not sure which edition TCM showed (perhaps it is the Disney release but with the viewing options of Japanese with English subs instead of English dubs?), but it was by far the most excellent rendition of the dialogue. <br /> <br />If you want the full impact of this wonderful story, the version shown on TCM is what you want to get.  Be sure to sacrifice English dialogue and read the English subtitles.  It is well worth it. <br /> <br />In the scope of all movies, animated or not, this is the movie that holds top place in my heart.  If you want a story synopsis, read some of the other excellently written reviews.  As for me, I will tell you that it is a wonderful and inspiring story.  Definitely a breath of fresh air in a world that is often gloomy and cynical.  It captivates the imagination, warms the heart, and just seems magical to watch.
0895260131|1.0|While reading a brief except from this book, I could not stop laughing. Robert Spencer's claim that the crusades were defensive had me rolling in laughter. The image of the Children's Crusade (during which by the way, many innocent children were sold into slavery under the guise of religion) as somehow defending Europe is ludicrous. Spencer manipulation of the Quran is ridiculous; I wonder is he ever even consulted with a Quranic scholar at any point while writing this book. It is a sad commentary on the people of the United States that a book so ill-researched, so poorly written and so arrogant could somehow make the NYT best seller list.
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls was the album that saved The Rolling Stones from a fast descent into old rocker hell. It began to look like all the partying and drugs were wearing on the Stones until they released this 5 star rock and roll gem. Not only is it their last great album, it's one of the best they've ever done. It reels and rocks the entire time leaving you wanting more. Some Girls kicks off with the disco flavored \\"Miss You\\". This reinforces the fact that the Stones can do any music, even disco. Then it slams into high gear with the rockin' \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" followed by an incredible cover of The Tempations song \\"It's Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\". The next songs, \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"Lies\\" are the weakest on the album but they pick themselves back up with the country flavored \\"Far Away Eyes\\". The blues soaked rock rhythms of \\"Respectable\\" help perfectly lead into the next track. \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" is a rough and ready tune that features Keith on vocals at his raw best. They slow things down on the fantastic anti-love love song \\"Best of Burden\\" that has one of the most memorable guitar parts. The phenomenal album finishes off with the punk, NYC rocker \\"Shattered\\". From the beginning to end Some Girls is nothing but pure rock bliss, unfortunatly it was the last great album The Rolling Stones ever did. <br /> <br />Track Rating- <br />1. Miss You- 10/10 <br />2. When The Whip Comes Down- 10/10 <br />3. Just My Imagination- 10/10 <br />4. Some Girls- 7/10 <br />5. Lies- 7.5/10 <br />6. Far Away Eyes- 10/10 <br />7. Respectable- 9.5/10 <br />8. Before They Make Me Run- 10/10 <br />9. Beast of Burden- 10/10 <br />10. Shattered- 10/10
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I can't believe how many people are taken in by this phony known as Madonna, Madonut to me. Are there that many blind sheep who thinks this disgrace to Italian Americans is great. Her use of the song Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba on Hung up which should be called Hung Over was sickening. She's proven over and over again that she's a bad singer, actress, writer  and king sized HYPOCRITE who hates her fans and only likes their MONEY!!! Confessions on a Dance Floor!!?? Dressed up disco crap for the millenium or shall I say ARMAGEDDON. If any of you pallies want good music, buy Ted Nugent's Double Live Gonzo or Live at Hammersmith!
B0002OOUP0|5.0|It's true that this is a much better album than disc two of Forty Licks but I would just buy Forty Licks and then if you want more of this era purchase Some Girls, Sticky Fingers, Black and Blue, It's Only Rock and Roll etc. <br />Also, WHERE IS HAND OF FATE!!! Hand of Fate is one of the best songs the Stones ever did and it isn't on here.
B00003CWPL|1.0|Eraserhead is BY far the worst movie I have ever seen (and I have seen some doozies). It is painful to watch. And I would not sit through again even on a dare.
B0009SS00A|1.0|well..what I could say...I am a I.T consultant and I am from Spain, and I have been in the beautiful Seville, too many times, that when I read that this autor have been writing this novel -I have read el codigo Da Vinci before reading this - the first thought was: cool, I am going to read the book of the year. Not only the topic is computers but also, it is in Seville!! ok... but now the only idea that I have from Dan Brown is that he has not documented anything about this novel, and the question that I have on mind is :have you ever been in Seville?, well I know that the answer is NOT, and that you have written a novel with a lack of knowledge about this beautiful city. From now, I will think twice about reading another novel from this autor. I really liked el codigo da vince and angeles y demonios, but this novel...sucks. Really...
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Actually I really liked this movie.  I'm a big fan of the whole 'makes you think' kind of thing.  Not saying this one does that, but I just thought I should share that.  This movie's pretty cool though.  In the ever popular manner, the main character realizes he  will be the one to save the world, but he has to sacrifice himself to save the rest.  Sound familiar?  Jesus Christ, anyone?  Whatever.  It still makes for a good story.  I would personally like to attribute this movie with the whole '80s is cool' thing.  Because in my mind it started with all the 'cool kids' and we all know they liked this movie.  The 80s sucked.  And they still do.  The music was terrible, the politics were even worse.  Fashion, art, color schemes.  Everything was terrible.  I'll thank this movie next time I'm wearing my neon green tank top with shredded acid wash nut huggers, listening to Motley Crue, and reading that privitization is the answer to all of the world's problems.  Supply side economics only works if you cut spending, douchebags.  But aside from that abomination, it's one of my favorite movies.
0307276902|4.0|It's hardly news that an addict has a tenuous relation to the truth. What's more damaging about Frey's nonfiction masquerade is that others who need help will take seriously the author's \\"Will to Power\\" program of recovery. Testing the strength of one's will with a full glass of whiskey under the nose, as Frey claims to have done, isn't a recipe for lasting recovery for many people who are truly alcoholics or addicts.    The faith-based program that Frey rejects is NOT the only way to overcome addiction. But even major alternatives such as rational emotive therapy acknowledge that the addict must CHANGE to have decent odds of survival. I hope for Frey's sake that he avoids a return to addictive hell.    I stopped believing that A Million Little Pieces was a True Story a couple dozen pages into the book, as cliche characters and pat situations entered the story.  Still I found it a difficult book to put down. Frey's writing carries emotional heft, and his slapdash style well conveys the urgency of a young addict.     I plan to read his second book. I won't recommend his stuff as a blueprint for anyone else's life. I recommend A Million Little Pieces for anyone who has a couple hours to kill and an interest in what takes place in a treatment center for addiction.

B00006IX0R|5.0|They are probably my favorite band right now, and i hope they can do some new stuff soon. This cd is perfect for someone new to the band, and the 2 new songs are awesome.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I received this album as a gift, and brielfy considered returning it to the store for something different. I'm a fan of System of a Down, but I wanted something else. Since listening to this album many times, I'm glad I didn't swap it. The whole album is excellent, with 'Kill Rock 'n Roll' and 'Soldier Side' standing out as notable favourites. My least favourite track would have to be 'U-Fig', but I still consider it a great song. <br /> <br />I can't wait for SOAD's next album!
0385507755|2.0|The standard for a memoir should be the TRUTH.    Burt Kearns wrote Tabloid Baby, his memoir of alcoholic degradation, journalistic domination, and eventual salvation, and every word was true.    He inspired millions with his story.    And as with Mr. Frey, I was moved by the book because I knew IT WAS TRUE.    This infraction costs the book three stars.    (...)
0307276902|1.0|How many more tap dances by this guy are needed to convince the herd of sheep that a charlatan is in their midst? Interesting (read: unusual) writing style or not, when someone purports to tell the truth, it should be the truth. Clearly, if this were presented as fiction, it would not have been as compelling. The author's reaction to criticism: he initially threatened to sue The Smoking Gun for their exposé, then quickly moved to redefine what memoir means, then glibly admitted to embellishing the text in question. He transformed himself from tough guy to whining victim within 3 short days. Please!!! Do you need a road map? Do you actually think the telling of his experiences in the clinic are without similiar fabrications and exaggerations? If he did work the miracle of recovery (assuming he was as bad as he claims) without a 12 step or similar method, he's exceptional, but given the holes already discovered in his story, that is not an apt adjective. Perhaps liar is more appropriate. The Days of Wine and Roses is a better story and closer to reality than this crap.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Let me tell you a bit about myself to provide some context. I'm a big fan of punk rock and I like music with some darkness and energy. However I also do like some 80's bands just for nostalgia sake. My wife is a big Depeche Mode fan and always has been. Me? I've been slow to convert. Sure, they have some great 80's hits and whatnot, but couldn't really \\"get into\\" this band. <br /> <br />Until I heard Ultra. When I listened to this album I realized that Depeche Mode was no ordinary 80's band. This is a band with some serious musical genius brewing. After listening to this album I came to respect Depeche Mode as a true dark musical force to be reckoned with, approaching the likes of Danny Elfman.  <br /> <br />Today I find myself a true fan of the band, and actually like Violator a bit more than Ultra today. I was of course bored to death with Exciter... that album just sucked. Sorry, there's not much in terms of redeeming quality on that album. Even the good songs on that album are below average for Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />But this album, Playing the Angel, is so amazing I can't even begin to describe it. Well, let me go ahead and try :). Like others who have reviewed this album, I believe it has an excellent shot at being viewed as Depeche Mode's ultimate achievement down the road. There's plenty in the album that rings true to their style, and the ways in which they branch from their typical style are welcome, at least in my opinion. I like DM when they are dark, and I like DM when they groove, and I like DM when their lyrics really shine. \\"Precious\\" is outstanding... \\"My god, what have we done to you?!?\\" Love IT! I also really like Sinner in Me and John the Revelator, and Pain that I'm Used To is quite good for an opener. The rest will have to grow on me I'm sure, but those 4 songs more than make this album worth it. I'm not your typical DM fan, so you know you're not getting some blah blah cheerleading. This is some good stuff, no joke.
B000002UD7|4.0|Among many other accomplishments, at their creative and stylish peak the Pet Shop Boys were responsible for contributing hugely to the definition of a more solid, intellectual and sophisticated face of 80's synth-pop, far from the stereotypes of superficiallity and sterillity atributed by many exceptics to the genre, without losing its funny, catchy shape of party music. Their second album shows Tennant's tiny speak-singing voice going more traditionally melodic, but yet working as a mere channel to the transmission of words, even if it also projects comfort. This album offers a much more focused songwriting then that of their also very good debut, and there is a lot of fun and hits to enjoy here: their first UK #1 'Heart', the lush midtempo 'Rent' and the bombing megahit 'It's A Sin'. The rest of the songs match the melodic and lyric quality of the choosed singles and, as a whole, this album works of an explanation to the question \\"Why the f**** are there so many bands immitating and re-processing typical 80's synthpop?\\".
B000BJS4OY|5.0|What can you say about one of THE great albums in the history of music?  As interesting as the documentary was, and as great as it is to have \\"live Bruce\\" on DVD, the highlight of this set for me is still the original album.  To my non-audiophile ears, the remastering job is an immediately noticeable improvement- listen to songs like Tenth Avenue Freezeout, Meeting Across the River and Jungleland.  The depth of the sound is drastically improved, and you'll hear sounds both subtle and blatant that you never knew were there.  Now if only Bruce would authorize remastering for the rest of his catalog.<br /><br />These songs are just classics, and while it's not a concept album in the sense of The Who's Tommy, every track on here is essential to the overall story.  There's no other artist like Springsteen, and this album and Darkness on the Edge of Town are him at his absolute finest.  Music simply doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Sorry for the short review, but I just don't know what else to say.  Buy this set, even if you're skeptical of repackaged material with the dubious label of \\"remastered\\".  You've never hear or seen Born to Run like this, and it will be like listening to the album for the first time again.

By the way you dumb little girl, Alice's lead singer, Layne Staley, died, not their lead guitarist, Jerry Cantrell.  Please try to know a little something about what you are talking about before you speak.  It is obvious you do not know anything about music, but hey you are only 16.  Alice in Chains in my opinion is the greatest band of all time and this album kicks ass.
0307276902|1.0|Sorry but anyone who has abused any substance and faced recovery would say that it isn't just quitting the use of that substance that proves you are recovered.  It is the change of character, the facing down your demons and gaining victory over them.  If one has to lie about one's circumstances and events surrounding one's addictions then I would seriously question their recovery.  This author is not recovered, sure he isn't abusing any longer but he is still living with his demons and is using lies to keep them at bay.  But with the present controversy nipping at his heals he will have to stare those demons and his obvious self loathing down.  But if he just 'holds on' perhaps he'll come out better on the other side of things.  After all, he is his own higher power.
0307276902|1.0|Truthfully, what type of person would believe this cliche ridden piece of garbage? I, literally, laughed out loud reading it. When I learned of the controversy surrounding the ligitimacy of many details in the book, I was not the least bit surprised. Face it, he`s a pathetic little rich boy, who grew up lonely and unpopular, desperately wanting to come across as a tough, no-nonsense, hard-living, bad ass. Anybody who can`t see that, is in need of some real life perspective. Shame on Oprah!! She has now lost every bit of credibility she had left.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|I really was looking to buy a non-Canon battery pack (or 2) but after seeing the various tech specs on others that claim cell capacities higher than are even made to fit in this size case, I knew the best thing was to stick with the honest listing of 1390mAh Canon lists.<br /><br />After all, I already knew how good this one was from using the original that came with the camera..

0307276902|5.0|While the marketing of this material as \\"memoir\\" and \\"nonfiction\\" may be confounding to some in light of recent \\"revelations\\" (and Frey does not hold the major responsibility for choosing how to classify it, his publisher does), most of the self-proclaimed critics who now base their observations and, in some cases, even reverse their original assessments of this work, seeking to dismiss Frey's talent, really reflect most negatively upon themselves.  Frey is irrefutably a major talent.  The merit of a work, whether fictional or not, lies in the degree of truth that resonates through it and how vibrantly that truth is conveyed.  In literature, as well as in all art forms, \\"truth\\" is not to be confused with \\"fact\\".  This isn't journalism; Frey's tale doesn't break with truth for an instant, regardless of the degree to which it's factual, and that is the ultimate basis for determining the merit of any work of art.  This book will forever reside among my favorite hardback volumes on my bookshelf, and I am grateful to have discovered it.
0307276902|1.0|I actually finished this book about 2 weeks ago.  Sorry to jump on the band wagon this late in the game.  I work in the addictions field. While reading this book, I never comtemplated the author's legal issues as being truthful or untruthful. I did however, find his story of his treatment to be quite unbelievable. First, what rang false for me was the author's depiction of the emergency dental care under the watchful eye of the unnamed treatment facility we know now to be Hazelden.  As an addictions' treatment professional with 20 years experience, I cannot for the life of me fathom why a dentist was prohibited from using novacaine to treat some serious injuries and HOW a dentist agreed to that.  What treatment center would make that a condition of allowing their patients to receive adequate dental care? Novacaine is NOT addictive.  It is not mood-altering.  It is not, as some would believe, related to cocaine.  Second:  Hazelden has the reputation of being a pretty expensive facility which offers good, thorough treatment.  According to Mr. Frey's book, there was a sorry lack of true treatment professionals coupled with a lack of structure.  There are scenes depicted in the book when counselors felt free to share private patient information with the other patients (a violation of a federal law, by the way). This facility was apparantly a place where patients were allowed to have private, catered parties, leave the facility frequently for romantic trysts, and go on rescue missions to the local crack house (accompanied by Hazelden staff !!???).  All with staff knowledge.  Sorry, that just didn't happen.<br /><br />I understand that ALL treatment programs are flawed.  It is a fact of life and a factor in helping addicts to receive adequate help.<br /><br />Finally,don't even get me started on the encounter in France with the priest.  In 20 years, I have heard just about every horror story and have been witness to as many miracles. I have seen Mr. Frey's scenarios in movies before.  And that is just what this is: a Hollywood screenplay waiting to be picked-up.<br /><br />Those who find inspiration in Mr. Frey's story should not lose hope. He has faced and triumphed over some emotional hurdles. I love a good tale.  That's exactly what this is.ore.  And that is just what this is: a Hollywood screenplay waiting to be picked-up. <br />Those who find inspiration in Mr. Frey's story should not lose hope.

B000002G85|4.0|Although this cd has it's moments of boredom \\"easy Now\\" and a few other ballads,it still produced some of ofClaptons best songs,Slunky, Let It rain, Bottle Of Red Wine ,After Midnight,Blues Power. These are the songs along with the Derek and Dominoes cd's that really make Clapton stand out. unfortunately with the exeption of a few live lps. not the ones from the seventies as I saw him live back then and he had fell into the same trap Aerosmith did. Too much drugs. With riding with the King and his tribute to Robert Johnson maybe we can get a few more decent cds from him. until then I'll continually listen but probaly end up buying cds by Sonny Landreth, John Hammond and Charlie musselwhite if i want real blues.

0307276902|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book and, in fact, found it hard to put down.  However, once I found out about his embellishments it was a real turn-off.  I also think that his way of \\"testing\\" his sobriety is to put a glass of whiskey ( or whatever it was) under his nose is ridiculous.  It is a good read but I somehow have lost some respect for the author.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is an amazing book that combines the life of a worker and social pressure. It takes place on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. The two main characters, George and Lennie, are out to create a life for themselves. They are almost like brothers. This story has many twists and turns and makes you think about your best friend. The story creates a suprising ending. It is a great short story for someone looking for a short and good read. I recommend this to everyone. The only thing about this book making it un-acceptable would be the colorful language that John Steinback uses, but otherwise, the entire story is amazing and will never be forgotten.
0307276902|1.0|The MOST interesting parts of this book are complete fiction!  I don't think many people will be staying awake at night (Oprah and staff) reading this book knowing that he never spent time in jail, was not responsible for or even invlolved in the girls death, or if there was a Lilly (the girl he meets in the rehab facility) that committed suicide.  This doesn't include all the things in the press the last few days such as the root canal sans anesthesia.  James Frey's A Million Little Pieces chronicling his stint in rehab is a very detailed account of what it may be like but the real facisnating facts of this book are fiction as it turns out.  I must admit I was more than puzzled while reading it that these events could possibly be true and am vindicated knowing that I was right to question it.  It should be read as fiction and therefore not \\"gut-wretching\\" whatsoever.  This is just a story of what could be.  Fiction.  While I \\"enjoyed\\" reading it I was ranting to anyone that would listen that this story couldn't possibly be true.  I read it several months ago but felt compelled to write a review now given the recent press and my outrage at his lack of answering the questions to the media.  Here is one simple question, James.  How much time have you spent in jail?  For what and when?  What would My Friend Leonard be without the opening pages in jail and being confronted by Porterhouse?  Reading to him.  Three months in jail?  James Frey CAN tell a story.  Fiction as it turns out.
0060935464|5.0|In the book: To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, the author is very varied in the writing. It tells the story from a girl, Scout, who is normally dis-regarded. She tells the powerful story of her father, Atticus who decides to take on the case of a black man. During these hard times, her brother, Jem and Scout were often hurt and made fun of for her father's decision of taking on this specific case especially when the African- Americans were looked down upon. The children deal with hurt and emotions run high in this powerful novel. It is the type of book that makes you cry as the read the most powerful words ever put down on paper.
1400031087|3.0|You'd never be let on an airplane in that condition. Bottom line.    But it sucked you in didn't it?  Me too.  I dropped an awful drug habit over 5 years ago.   <br />Yes, it was painfully obvious that the book was embellished.  But the underbelly of it all is painfully true.  Kicking a habit is one of the hardest things to do--drugs, alcohol, all of it. Frey gives a good kick to the story that we've all heard a hundred times before.  He does it well.  He makes you feel how disgusting it all is.  The writing style is unique and kept me reading 'til it was done.  My underlying feeling that it was very much embellished kind of got to me, but how else can a loady convey a story about being a complete wasted wreck?   <br />Pick up a copy if you want something to read on the plane or in line at the bank, or just to pass some time.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey is a brilliant writer who has the misfortune of being a little less wicked than he portrayed himself in his memoir. Admittedly he used literary license when describing the extent of his law-breaking.  He was a rich frat rat, for God's sake.  But just because his worst offenses consisted of binges that lasted for months, broken promises, a cowering family, police breathing down his neck, vomit-covered bathrooms, severe acne, missed classes, nightmare exams (with no advance study buddies) and no future to speak of doesn't mean he didn't feel totally demoralized when he hit rock bottom.  So what if the feds weren't waiting to send him up the river for 100 years -- it could have felt that way to him at the time.      Personally as a woman I couldn't relate to the train wreck story,  the REAL reason that his one true love left him, etc etc. It all seemed a bit too over the top. But I'm not a great writer.  Maybe I wouldn't have found the book quite as mesmerizing if his prior offenses weren't so serious and horrendously guilt-inducing and if the legal threat looming over him weren't so serious.    But to get back to the title of my review -- give the guy a break.  Let's pat him on the back for not being such a bad guy after all.  And -- Smoking Gun -- I don't want to hear from you again unless you catch Jim Frey hitting the bottle (or shooting up) because that would be a story (an unfortunate and sad one) -- not your petty unravelings of the TRUTH.
B000683VI4|3.0|First of all I have to say I'm a fairly picky when it comes to romance dramas. There is nothing wrong with this film. It even adds something new to a typical romance. It's one of those movies where perhaps if you haven't seen thousands of movies you'd think it's good going on great, but for me it's just good. <br /> <br />Perhaps I can't relate to the young couple in love that always gets into heated fights but still are madly in love with eachother. That's just too Hollywood for me. In real life I've yet to see a relationship like that last.  <br /> <br />To sum up there really isn't anything wrong with this movie. It's pretty clean and wholesome by today's standards.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols are the seminal punk band.  Even diluted through two decades of imitators, the fury (and sarcasm)of the band is impressive. While I favor the more lyrical and musically talented Clash, but this single album still is high upon my list, if only due to its anger and anthemic banners God Save the Queen and Anarchy in the UK. The neglected Holidays in the Sun gives this  album a great starting kick with the sound of jackboots marching and an odd little song about going to East Berlin on vacation.  Bodies is hilarious with a marketed pro-life stance and a stanza of nearly continuous swearing.  GSTQ is brilliant political commentary amid name-calling, and AUK is stupid but catchy.  A lot of the rest is filler, but good filler (Sub-Mission, New York, EMI).  The Pistols are angry, but they seem to enjoy it.  I did as well.  BUY THIS ALBUM
0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown is three for three with me (I've yet to read Deception Point). What Dan does well, he does VERY well. His plots are tight and maticulousely well designed. He textures his stories with intriguing, almost unnecassary details which yet prove contrary to that assumption and eventually prove crutial to the plot. For example, he'll educate the reader on the root meaning of a particular word which then ties into the plot in some crutial way. Everything is plot driven, and the stakes are always at their peak. It is his ploting skills and masterful stakes building that attract so many readers.<br /><br />However, though his plotting has proven successful, he has followed the same plot skeleton in each of the three books I've read. This may play well for many readers who enjoy the familiarity of the same well-traveled paths. For this adventurer, though, I prefer to travel new trails, or at least trails disguised well enough that they feel new. I also noticed with this particular plot that a few of the subplots were drawn out far too much in order to keep pace with the main plot. And, as with any author who writes plot- and stakes-heavy stories, a reader who is seeking an intimate relationship with the characters and the sense of being lost in emotionally rich language will likley be disappointed.<br /><br />That said, most warm-blooded readers will enjoy this tale like the rest of Brown's thrillers. What he does well is done so well we forgive him the rest and are waiting patiently for the next dose of adrenaline.
0553801503|3.0|After reading some of the reviews that compared this book to the demise in writing that happened with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, I was almost afraid to crack the cover.  For anyone that has managed to keep up with Jordan's fated series, you have a good idea of just how bad writing can get, and just how low a once good series can fall.  In fact, I would say that book 10 of the Wheel of Time series is probably the worst book that I have ever read (fiction or non-fiction). <br /> <br />Fortunately, having just finished \\"A Feast for Crows\\", I can say that although the book is not on the same level as the first 3 books of the series, it is still an OK read.  I enjoyed the first 3 books so much that I pre-ordered this one before it could be reviewed.  I will not make that mistake again.  I would advise getting a copy form the local library unless you need it for your collection.  I don't think we should reward the writer and publisher for less than quality work.  Having said that, Martin is a very good writer (several levels above Robert Jordan), and even one of his poorer works is an entertaining and worthwhile read. <br /> <br />Of course, as Martin points out in the end of the book some characters are left out of this book, because he felt it would be better to \\"tell the entire story for half the characters, rather than tell half the story for all the characters\\".  But, isn't telling part of the story for all the characters exactly what he has been doing in the first 3 books?  Doesn't that really define what a series is about?  The whole story is not complete until the last book.  It is very hard to pick up on a character that is completely skipped in one book, and that you don't hear from for 2-5 years.   <br /> <br />Some of the characters that were covered in this book were \\"over cooked\\".  Many of these pages could have been spared to keep us up to date with those not covered.  I liked Brienne, the girl knight in the other books, but we had to follow heraround through so many useless ramblings in this book that by the end I was hoping she could just die a valiant death and be finished.  I also got very sick of Cersei.  She got way too much press in this book.  I think that Martin had managed to establish Cersei as a self-centered, self-serving, evil bitch in the other books.  That image was beaten to death in this book.  In addition, Martin also made Cersei an insane drunkard, just in case we needed some extra ammunition to hate her.  I got to the point that I dreaded seeing her name on the chapter heading.  I knew that it would just be more of her scheming, evil plans, and stupid political moves.  Many of Cersei's schemes never seemed to go anywhere, but just filled page after page after page.  At least Cersei's last chapter was satisfying. <br /> <br />Too many pages seemed to go to establishing characters that were already well established, without advancing the story line.  In fact, the story seemed to get side-tracked in this book, and ended up meandering around, but not getting very far.   <br /> <br />If this book were a pie, you would find that the crust (Cersei, Brienne, etc.,) to be burnt, while the center of the pie (Arya, Jon, etc.) was under-cooked and still cold.  If you taste the pie you find that the cook has forgotten some of the key ingredients in the recipe (Tyrion, Dany, etc.).  You can eat a slice, but you will not desire seconds. <br /> <br />I read that Martin originally planned for this series to be 3 books.  That number grew to 4, then 6, and now I have heard that it will take at least 7 to finish it.  If the next book is anything like this one, seven may be a conservative number. <br />
0375507256|3.0|I found this book whilst on holiday, and hoped it would be as exiting a read as the blurb promised. I was half impressed half dsisappointed by this book, and it was tough going for long stretches. It's hard to review this novel as a cohesive whole, because it's not. At times it's barely coherent, and story quality fluctuates between fabulous and barely readable. The first (and last) visited story is arguably the dullest, even though plot wise it showed great potential. The only thing I could really say I enjoyed about it was the depth of period detail employed. The next story we are invited into was much more exiting, and enjoyable, to read. The third, 'Half Lives, the First Luisa Rey Mystery' was my personal favorite segment of the novel, it was exiting, interesting and like a mystery novel. Sadly from then on it was all a downhill ride, though Sloosha's Crossing and Evrything After' picked up from time to time. <br /> <br />I think the real problem with this novel, for me at least, was the lack of connections between the stories, it struck me as odd that these seven self contained worlds should even be part of the same novel. It seemed that Mitchell had been unable to decidce which idea to novelize, and had simply chosen to include all of them, which could have worked brilliantly had the stories fitted together better. Reading 'Cloud Atlas' was akin to reading a collection of short stories. And by the time each tale had you intrigued it would be over, and you'd have to start again with a different one. I think this book deserves five stars for beauty of description, use of language and clever characterization, but the plot messed me around so much I can only grudgingl give it three stars, which is a pity, because I think Mitchell's writing is generally brilliant and one of his other novels, 'Number9Dream', is probably one of the most enjoyable books I've read to date.
0307276902|5.0|For those of you who are disappointed, or upset about the controversial news about this book need to get over it.  This book was great.  Fake, real or otherwise I enjoyed it and everyone else that I know did too.  You go James Frey.  WRITE ON!!!!
B000002J0G|5.0|I've been aware of Testament since their very beginning and I'm agree with almost everyone that their three (or perhaps four?) first releases are all classics. Also, no doubt about the skills of Alex Scholnick, who arguably was (IS, after the recent reunion) the main attraction of this band. However, in spite of all that, I have terribly felt in love with \\"Low\\" and now it is my preferred Testament album. But... why? <br /> <br />Well, perhaps the first thing to notice is the sharp production. Killer sound, you find no better in the Testament's catalogue! Other element would be the downtuned guitars. They give a darker feeling to their music. The death metal influences integrate well with the proggish edge Testament always had, and still the final product sounds coherent and very solid from the songwriting point of view. Additionally, Chuck Billy shows some new vocal influences, which is far from being disappointing. In fact, the more divergent from the Bay Area archetypical voice his vocals are, the more I like him!  <br /> <br />Some words now dedicated to the amazing shredder James Murphy is. I must confess that he was almost unknown to me when I picked this album up. I must say now: for those of you who are worrying about the absence of Alex Scholnick (like I was too), I can safely tell you that James Murphy is an axeman of the same calibre. \\"Low\\" is a safe buy for sure, but an even safer one if all you want is a shredding guitar fest. His work on the superb ballad \\"Trail Of Tears\\" is of the finest around, but every guitar riff and solo on this album finds the perfect balance between taste, spontaneity and technicality -- that's guaranteed! I dare to say: even if you loved Scholnick I don't think you'll miss him here! <br /> <br />So, this album has changed it all for me. Before \\"Low\\" I thought Annihilator had produced the two most magical thrash masterpieces ever (\\"Alison Hell\\" and \\"Never Neverland\\"), but now \\"Low\\" has also entered in my own temple of sacred metal records. \\"Low\\" maybe is slightly less progressive, but it has a lot of \\"charm\\" -- that weird impalpable thing emanating from true works of art! In few words, if you are looking for a greatly-produced, written and performed thrash metal opus with all the heavy ingredients you wanted, from growling vocals to a true blast of GREAT guitar riffs, solos and power drumming, search no more: this is it! FIVE freakin' BIG stars!
1401300901|5.0|This is a heartwarming book that has me crying one minute and dying of laughter the next. A great read for anyone who has ever loved and had those crazy friends that lift you up when you are down.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|Ok, let's face it: Jamiroquai's strength have never been his lyrics, and this album is no exception.  They are flat, ridiculous and pure non - sense.  But were we really expecting a literary diamond? NO !!  We just want more of the DELICIOUS FUNKINESS, SUPERB voices and chorals, FANTASTIC basses and WILD arrangements.  And that is EXACTLY what you get !  ...and if you have a CD or DVD player that will play it, buy the Dual Disc version to get better sound quality (you won't regret spending the extra dollars). <br /> <br />1.- Feels Just Like it Should is the first single of this album.  A strange pick, for I think it's the weakest track.  It's choppy, boring, so non-Jamoriquai. <br /> <br />2.- Dynamite is one of the strongest tracks in the album.  Full of incredible effects, superb chorals, and an incredible arrangement.  So near to your typical Jamiroquai song. <br /> <br />3.- Seven Days in Sunny June is THE BEST track in the disc.  A ballad of some sort, this incredible song reminds us of the style introduced in the album A Funk Odyssey in the track Corner of the Earth.  So full of great guitar playing and yet funky and fun. <br /> <br />4.-Electric Mistress is strange indeed, with some weird bass lines...yet it works !  It's simple but addictive. <br /> <br />5.- Starchild is a delicious slow groove.  Exactly the funkiness you expect in a disc like this.  It will not dissapoint you. <br /> <br />6.- Love Blind reminds me of most pop music out there mixed with the characteristic bass lines of Jamiroquai, yet after so many times hearing it, you get used to it and like it.  Its a very strange mixture. <br /> <br />7.- Tallulah is just jazzy lounge music.  Ear pleasing, no more. <br /> <br />8.- (Don't) Give Hate a Chance competes with Seven Days in Sunny June as the best track.  It's funky, dance, groovy, smooth.  It's SO ADDICTIVE.  I must have heard it so many times and can't have enough of it !  The music video is awesome too. <br /> <br />9.- World that He Wants is also a weak track, ballad-like.  I think it is missplaced in a disc like this.  Yet, there is something for everyone.  If you like soft music this is for you. <br /> <br />10.- Black Devil Car is a heavy piece, reminds me of other groups (Blink 182, strangely comes to mind).  Not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />11.- Hot Tequila Brown sounds a lot like Electric Mistress, it's simply addictive in the long term. <br /> <br />12.- Time Won't Wait is a great way to finish the album off.  It's just what you expect of this album.  It invites you to dance and to wait for the next album ! <br /> <br />Enjoy !
B00003CWPL|5.0|hellfaucet, despite your use of a double negative i know what you are trying to say. <br /> <br />this movie is definitely brilliant. every element, both conceptual and technical is in some way meaningful. while i dont pretend to recognize every single one, i do recognize that every element is also aesthetically....sweet! <br /> <br />i don't know what to say to you people, other than you probably weren't lynch fans going into this. but this movie is just as good as any of his others (and better than some) in terms of showing off the lynch genius. and not to mention, it was completely revolutionary for its time. and for now.  <br /> <br />damn, bitches.
B0000844IT|5.0|here we are again with yet again another rare out of print goody....i luckily got my hands on it before they all skyrocketed past 50 bucks. i got it for like 30 or something... still expensive, but well worth it for a movie such as this.  I have seen that both editions of this movie are very different indeed. If you are a huge evil dead fan and dont want to fork over 50-100 bucks for a boomstick edition(which im sure nobody does) then id say buy the director's cut and theatrical cut in their single disc editions. you would save a good 50 bucks.

0307276902|5.0|I do not understand why people are trying to slander James Frey. <br />If his books are fact or fiction, he still has a great writing style. And the ral reason he's number one is Oprah, she hyped him, Frey just went along for the ride. Hopefully everyone learns a valuable lesson, but I don't think they will. <br />People will always gravitate toward celebrities, why? I have NO idea. Author, Moviestars, Television personalities, sports stars. There is nothing special about any of them, but people will continue to give them their hard-earned money, There is nothing I like better than paying for that Musicians private jet. <br />God only knows life couldn't continue without these court jesters. Like Louie the fourteenth, off will all their heads.
0743243315|1.0|I have read \\"Brick Lane\\", by Monica Ali, over a period of two and a half months. We had to read it in school, so we concerned ourself intensively with this book. Believe you me, if I hadn't had to read it in school, I wouldn't have bought it to readin my leisure time. Every time I started reading the book I had to stop myself from yawning! <br /> <br />This book is about a Muslim woman from Bangladesh, called Nazneen, who is forced to marry a 40-year old man, named Chanu, at the age of 18. When Nazneen was born everybody thought that she would die except her mother who believed that if fate decided her daughter should live, then she would live. Nazneen survives and this is the reason why she accepts everything that happens to her instead of fighting against her fate. <br />After the marriage both live together in a small flat in Tower Hamlets in London. Nazneen always misses her younger sister, Hasina, who lives in Dhaka. In contrast to Nazneen Hasina does not believe that her fate is already sealed. In her opinion her fate lies in her own hands. While Nazneen lives in London with her kind and educated husband, who does not beat her. Hasina has a horrible life in Dhaka. <br />Nazneen envies her younger sister a little because she takes responsibility for her own life. <br />Although Nazneen knows that she is not allowed to have an affair, she starts one with a younger man, she does not really love. <br />During their life in London Chanu has to suffer some defeats, so that he thinks that it is the best idea for his family to go back to Bangladesh. At this moment Nazneen realizes that she has to act in a responsible manner and tell her husband that he is the only one who goes back to Bangladesh, because Nazneen as well as her daughters would be unhappy in Dhaka. <br />Finally, Nazneen stays in London with her children and works in a fashion factory of one of her friends. Her husband has moved to Dhaka and her affair has also ended. On the whole, Nazneen seems to be really happy when she takes control of her life. <br /> <br />All in all, I am totally surprised that this book is a \\"Sunday Times\\" bestseller because, in my opinion, their is nothing special about Monica Ali's work. It is just boring! <br />The story is introduced by Nazneen's birth and how she is left to her fate. Although it is a nice idea to start a novel with a flashback, it is actually pretty boring because of the way it is written, in other words she uses a lot of description that makes the book uninteresting, and the topic \\"fate\\" does not belong to any important issues like poverty, unemployment, etc. A topic that relates to one of them might have been more interesting. During the whole novel you are reminded by almost every event that Nazneen was left to her fate. On the one hand, you can say that the characters have a personality development, but on the other hand it is not a big one and after a few pages you realize that it is always the same, so that you are not interested in reading the book any more. <br />I think specially Chanu, who always teaches Nazneen, Mrs.Islam, who crave for money, and the self-pitying Dr.Azad are boring. They show the same behavioural pattern until nearly the end of the novel and then their personalities change from one moment to the next. It is so taxing to try to remember anything about them. Another annoying aspect is the way it is structured, e.g. by Hasina's letters. Although I know that her English is not better than Nazneen's English, which is actually really bad, I am surprised that her letters are written in bad English instead of perfect English. It might have been more pleasant to read and as a matter of fact it wouldn't have changed anything, because they would have written each other the letters in their own language. As a result it is more difficult to concentrate on reading them, so that you are soon on bad terms with thebook in general. <br /> <br />You can describe this book with just one word: BORING!!!
B000065BPB|5.0|I have very expensive in-ear Shure E3Cs that I THOUGHT had great sound. These sound so much better it's not even close. I'm listening to music in a whole different light.

0440418569|2.0|The final volume of the His Dark Materials trilogy pales in comparison to the first two books.  It seems as if Pullman could have pulled the series out into more than just a trilogy.  The Amber Spyglass is full of many questions and many solutions to the questions put forth earlier on, but as you finish the book, it feels like Pullman really had to rush and squeeze all the answers into the 518 pages of the novel.  For one thing, the novel tries to closely follow too many characters' storylines.  Lyra and Will's journey is obviously the most important, but their story shares equal time with the stories of Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter (Lyra's parents), and the totally uninteresting, weird, confusing story of Mary Malone and her encounter with a race of animals called the mulefa in a different world.<br /><br />Also, for me personally, the entire undertone of the book (and trilogy, really) was just a little too disconcerting.  Granted, I am a Christian, but normally I have no problem reading books or watching movies that don't agree with me spiritually.  But I can't remember reading or seeing anything that was so blatantly hateful of religion in general.<br /><br />As opposed to other fantasy series, His Dark Materials never really sets a \\"good vs. evil\\" conflict.  I'm sure some people like it that way, but I prefer having a side to root for in a novel about epic conflicts, and there was no side for me to identify with here.<br /><br />I went into this trilogy with high expectations, hearing that it rivaled LOTR in epic status, and I leave the trilogy very disappointed.  The first two novels are both exceptional, but the final volume, in my opinion, brings down the entire trilogy with rushed, convoluted ending.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first fell in love with Radiohead when I heard \\"Creep\\" in 1993; I was 10 years old. I then I forgot about them for the next 9 years. I did not hear any of their albums or knew anything about them; to be honest with you I was too busy listening to Jay-Z, Linkin Park and Creed. Then in 2002 a radio station by the name of K-ROQ in Los Angeles played an intriguing song that opened my eyes and triggered my intellect, that song was \\"There There\\". I instantly fell in love with the way it made feel and think. I went online and researched the last nine years of Radiohead, within the next three months I bought all of their records in random order as I could find them. It was a beautiful feeling to hear Radiohead go thru their evolution from where I stood in 2002. I heard the albums in the following order: first there was Pablo Honey which had enough display of musical talent to get me intrigued, and then Hail to the thief just blew my mind. The third was The Bends; that which had me wanting more Radiohead, Kid A was too beautiful for words, and Amnesiac introduced me to one of my favorite songs of all time: \\"You And Whose Army?\\" The last album I heard was OK Computer; I heard it repeatedly for the next two months, and I can still hear it today and feel the same way I felt the first time around. Radiohead introduced me to other genres of music such as jazz, classical, and lounge music, and in doing so I feel it ignited my intellect and taught me to appreciate music for what it should be and not for it's \\"Bling-Bling\\", and this is the reason why this album deserves at least 5 stars out of 5. It is very different from anything anyone that does not know Radiohead will ever hear, it has musical innovation beyond any band of its time, you can hear it from beginning to end without skipping a song, it has some of the best songs of the past twenty years all in one album, and also, it is said that it was influenced by Douglas Adams' \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" Here is in myopinion the top 10 Radiohead songs in no specific order, but all their songs are pretty great.    <br />  Lucky - Ok Computer <br />  You and whose Army? - Amnesiac <br />         The National Anthem - Kid A <br />  Fake Plastic Trees - The Bends <br />  There There - Hail to the Thief <br />  Paranoid Android - Ok Computer <br />  Everything in its Right Place - Kid A <br />  Karma Police - Ok Computer <br />  Subterranean Homesick Alien - Ok Computer <br />  2 + 2 = 5 - Hail to the Thief

The thought that Lilly had committed suicide bothered me for days....because I thought it had actually happened.  <br /> <br />I now feel that the majority of AMLP was completely fabricated. I have since read Another Day In Paradise by Eddie Little.  If you haven't read this one, you should.  Even if you only read the excerpt from this book on the Amazon site, you will see the striking similariries.....the main character is a tough guy addict who is mentored by an older, hardened criminal.  The girlfriend is an addict with the same basic background as Lilly - even the description of her \\"lost, sad eyes\\" is similar.  But the biggest giveaway for me is the main character in the Little book talks about the \\"rage\\".  Hmmmm.  <br /> <br />I really don't doubt that James went through a rehab program, but I think his story is a fantasy based in part on Another Day in Paradise.  There are just too many similarities for it not to be.
0307276902|5.0|i know that this book is untrue, but aren't many great books. lest we forget he is not the first to pull this kind of trick on readers. Beatrice Sparks is infamous for this, but she is not nearly as critisized for it because her books are not as well-written. the reason this book is so popular is because it gives hope to those that need it. it doesn't have to be true to be loved. i believe many of you forget that we are rating the books, not the authors here. <br /> <br />that being said, i am currently reading the book, and loving it. i know plenty of people that have recommended it as their favorite. great story of a great character. i would recomend this book to anybody with an open mind about Frey's situation
B0007TKH66|1.0|What was the problem with enterprise? There are many opinions, but upon closer examination of the show the problem is not the choice of actors or failing ratings. Scott bakula must have been happy when he was chosen for this role and probably thought rightfully that it was the role of a lifetime after all it made William Shatner a  household name. Many people have complained that he was a wrong choice for this role, but he was perfectly suited for it. This actor , in fact all the actors that graced the small screen in enterprise were more than competent, particular Bukula. <br />Scott bakula was an actor best known for a role he had in another TV show that was long running.   In this show he played a wide variety of roles some even female, and some in different historical settings. This would have been too much for most actors ,but Bakula  managed to succeed and hit a bulls eye constantly. Just this show alone proves Bakula is an outstanding actor that can handle any role tossed at him. <br />John Billingley is another fine actor, pay close attention to his facial expression and mannerisms, particularly in the temporal cold war arc and in later episodes. He manages to capture the psychological portrayal of his character despite the laughable lines that come out of his mouth. The problem with enterprise lies with the writing particularly the script. The actors do an above average performance with sub- material.  Even outstanding actors cant save a sinking ship- and the enterprise was a sinking   ship, literally a sinking star ship. Without solid writing a TV show or film will not survive and prosper. Despite its expensive budget, state of the art special effects and a name brand recognized by millions, and flawless sets enterprise should have succeeded and gone where star trek didn't go before. But enterprise only managed to cause embarrassment for everyone involved  especially the actors who tried their best with the trash handed to them. They deserved better than this and we the viewers deserve better. <br />The actors are probably going to be blamed for this shows failure maybe even vilified, but anyone with intelligence knows it wasn't their fault the enterprise sank. Without good or even average writing a TV show cant survive, this show sadly suffered from all aspects of bad writing- derivative and ill-conceived plots to a far fetched premise and down right embarrassing scripts. The actors had nothing to do with this mess, bakula and billingley are more than competent actors I  would even call them outstanding- just check their other work out . <br />Enterprise was a  bad idea that should have never seen the light of day  or in this case the darkness of space. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009S3HI0|5.0|Most of the other reviews are pretty much spot on, but I wanted to throw out which songs are covers and who the original artist is (sry, but seeing someone tag \\"No Ordinary Love\\" as a Skynyrd cover hurt my eyes).  The liner notes say it all, but here it is again... <br /> <br />Savory - Jawbox <br />Wax and Wayne - Cocteau Twins <br />Change - Deftones <br />Simple Man - Skynyrd <br />Sinatra - Helmet <br />No Ordinary Love - Sade  <br />Teenager - Deftones <br />Crenshaw/I'll Throw - Deftones <br />Black Moon - Deftones <br />If Only... - The Cure <br />Please Please Please... - The Smiths <br />Digital Bath - Deftones <br />The Chauffeur - Duran Duran <br />Be Quiet... - Deftones <br /> <br />I'm guessing that the Deftones don't own all of their covers, like those that appeared on soundtracks, but not on this album.  Doesn't really matter, this is still a great release for any fan. I don't think anyone needs to tell casual listeners to pass b/c who is going to buy a b-side and rarity collection for a band they're not that familiar with?  Then again, it would still be a good buy.  You really can't go wrong with this album.   <br /> <br />See you at the \\"Taste of Chaos\\" tour!

Second, my libido diminished and I haven't been in the mood for sex for weeks now. Thirdly, my CD player spit the album out with BILE! <br />WHY, WHY, WHY are these guys famous? They have nothing to offer the rock world, not image, not songs, not lyrics, not talent. <br />Yeah, these guys need to be \\"fixed\\" all right, fixed as in neutered and spayed.

0307276902|1.0|Like most readers I was deeply moved by James Frey's account of his redemption of soul and recovery from drug and alcohol addiction, but with the recent unveiling of blatant fabrication in the book I can no longer accept to book for having any level of credibility.  I remain touched by the possibility that the story could have taken place, the broken lives represented most certainly exist in the world every day, however the book is fiction inspired by acutual events.  To examine how deep this problem goes consider this example: since Frey didn't commit the crimes he claims he did and was not facing years in prison how deep could his relationship actually have been with \\"Miles\\" and \\"Leonard\\"?  Neither of them obviously could have \\"pulled any strings\\" to help him out since he wasn't in any trouble to begin with.  Since the prison episode is a lie maybe Leonard never confronted James out in the rain when he was on the edge of leaving the clinic either let alone the \\"this is my new son\\" godfather-esque parting at the end of the book.  Forget about the whole event of nearly killing the Priest in Paris, that smacked of hyperbole even when I believed the story.  Most sadly I have lost confidence in the reality of James and Lilly's love affair and especially his act of her rescue.  I do not mean to say that what James Frey accomplished by rebuilding his life is trite or unworthy of praise or even that the book he wrote is without power.  I simply believe that there is an expectation that even though this is a memoire that blatant lies will not be fed to me as a reader.  I believed in James Frey, but now I only wish he had labeled his book a novel because there would have been no betrayal of trust.
B000002VCQ|4.0|I honestly think that a lot of the divas in the music industry today, really all seem like they are just plain manufactured, and don't really have the feeling a lot of divas did in the past. It is very unfortunate, because good or bad, we often forget how influential they have been whether it is Cher, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, and even Whitney Houston. Everybody in the past few years has had so much fun poking fun at her, and even hurting her because of some of the vices and public problems she had in the spotlight. Nevertheless, it is just too easy to forget that her songs still remain a absolute constant in this industry, all the way from the beginning.<br /><br />Whitney Houston's 1985 debut album really is a true pop gem. The album that launched the diva from New Jersey is a absolute standard of records from the 1980's, and a treat from the days of MTV. The album includes so many beautiful pop melodies that truly have withstood the test of time like the #1 smashes Saving All My Love For You, her first track to chart, You Give Good Love, the beautiful Greatest Love Of Them All, All At Once, and the upbeat dance track How Will I Know. The songs here still sound great after all this time, and are just great guilty pleasure melodies that can't be resisted to this day.<br /><br />If you don't own a Whitney Houston record, than her debut album would be a great buy for anybody who still enjoys her music after all this time, or anybody who isn't too familiar with her legendary songs. I still love her voice after all this time, and I will keep enjoying this album all at once.<br /><br />Album cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: A 1/2-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Enjoyment: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B000BW7QWW|4.0|After having sat through the series, which I ended up being rather indifferent towards, I decided that I had to see how it ended, so I got myself a copy of this. It was definitely the right decision.    There wasn't much Western in sight at all, in _Serenity_, (which was my problem with the original series); it was nearly pure sci-fi, which I truly enjoyed. Finally we have an answer to the problem of River, we see how Simon rescued her and what it is the Alliance is afraid she knows. We finally know where Reavers come from! That alone was pretty awesome.    There were some good surprises thrown at us, things I never saw coming, and one that actually brought a tear to my eye, even when I really hadn't cared much about the characters in the series. The action is good, there's plenty of suspense and you really aren't sure, even in the end, if they're going to win or not.    Granted, the wrap up of that felt a little...forced, to me, a bit on the dues ex machina end of things, but it was still satisfying. I don't think I would've preferred that they all go out in some sort of _Butch and Sundance_ sort of way. That wouldn't have felt right; I might not be a hundred percent comfortable with how this was resolved, but neither was it bad. Not completely believable, but not totally beyond the realms of belief, either. Not too bad of a mix.    This movie does a pretty good job of wrapping up the series while still giving just a hint of leeway for a sequel, or even a second chance at another series. I don't see that happening, not with the networks having their heads stuck in places where sunlight is rare, but stranger things have happened and Joss has shown that he can pull off minor miracles before.
0061015725|2.0|You may turn the pages, but you will not care about either the robotlike heroine or hero in this mechanical dance of a novel. The hero, if you can call him that, is more concerned with the price of diapers and feeding the baby than he is that his wife has become a stranger who slaps the baby.<br /><br />When the story finally progresses from shopping and changing diapers to fighting the little monsters, the plot loses all originality and becomes a cut and paste from other books and film. Sad.<br /><br />That this is what passes for popular bestselling fiction is a good reason not to read it.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I heard so many glowing reviews about this. So many of my friends kept gushing about it, tossing about words such as \\"inspired,\\" \\"visionary,\\" and the like. So, I decided I had to see what they were talking about. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I came to a conclusion very early on in my viewing, one that didn't change through the rest of the episodes. Other than the Holy Trinity of Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, from which I can quote most of the dialogue and feel compelled to watch whenever I run across them on TV -- I don't like Westerns. I don't hate them but at best I'm just indifferent to them; they bore me. <br /> <br />Being as objective as possible, I think Joss had an awesome idea. Sure, _Star Wars_ was the original Western in space, but Firefly didn't try to disguise it under a thick layer of pure sci-fi, it *was* a Western. It just happened to have spaceships and other planets. It's brilliant, really, and on the right network it should've run for a good five seasons. The acting was good, the plots were good and it had a loyal audience. FOX sucks as a network, that was the problem. <br /> <br />But even if it'd had a seven to ten year run, I wouldn't have been one of the regular viewers. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones that took place solely within Serenity or within space itself, where it became straight sci-fi with little to no western in sight. Once they hit planetside, my interest waned and I started looking at the clock on my DVD player, counting down the minutes until it was over. <br /> <br />The theme song was pretty bad, too. Yeah, the words were good, but the tune sucked and so did the singing. But, then again, I think country music sucks as a whole, so I'm probably biased. <br /> <br />This really wasn't the series for me, unfortunately, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending it to people who like westerns, which I've done many times since. This may not be a show I personally enjoyed, but I do think it was a good one and itshouldn't have ended when it did.
B00008OWZC|3.0|Unfortunately, I regret buying these CDs. I am a lifelong Zeppelin fan - growing up there was no other band I would listen to - but this isn't what I'd call Led Zeppelin at their best. For starters Robert Plant's voice frequently breaks and he struggles with high notes; I think this was around the time before he had throat surgery. The ad-lib sounds he makes to go along with the guitar in the longer medolies actually become kind of annoying. <br /> <br />Having said that, the live version of 'Immigrant Song' is incredible ... in fact all of disc 1 is worth a listen. However I suggest you go with 'The Song Remains the Same' if you want Zep at their best onstage. This compilation isn't bad, but there's a reason these tapes weren't released as Zep's original live album.
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has rapped out a gem of a book that has added greatly to our knowledge of Abraham Lincoln and his times. This book by this woman is indeed a sacred effort, and the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass could not have had more appreciation for Lincoln's second inaugural address than I did for Ms. Goodwin Kearns' latest contribution. <br /> <br />By focusing on four men, with Lincoln in center ring, Kearns Goodwin is able to view Lincoln and the issues of his times from multiple perspectives. In comparison of my knowledge of Lincoln, I knew little of Salmon Chase, William Seward and Edward Bates, Lincoln's major rivals for the 1860 presidential nomination of the fledgling Republican Party and who Lincoln cleverly appointed as members of his Presidential cabinet. The narrative of \\"Team of Rivals\\" shows how Chase, Seward and Bates grew during their time with Lincoln, or, in Chase's case, grew unevenly. Lincoln and Seward especially, became brothers in time.  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed obtaining new knowledge of the rolling temperament of Edward Stanton, Lincoln's hard Attorney General. Kearns Goodwin employs \\"Lincoln's Neptune\\" Gideon Welles as a sort of court jester, who pops in and out of her story to draw out different elements of Lincoln's character; many are playful and amusing.  <br /> <br />Mary Todd Lincoln is treated with dignity and feeling, and when Lincoln finished his life, his finish was not overwritten and glorified into some kind of dark romantic act, as political assassinations often are. That was mature restraint on the part of the author. By choosing that path, Kearns Goodwin focused on the special light that was the life of the backwoods, self-educated rail splitter. <br /> <br />Ms. Kearns Goodwin dedicated this book to her husband, Richard Goodwin. She is deeply in love.
0307276902|2.0|I read the book way before the smoking gun came out with their report.  Needless to say, I didn't really believe the majority of what Frey wrote. Now that we know that the majority of it is fiction, i would not recommend this book to anyone who has been in rehab or is dealing with a drug and/or alcohol problem.  If you would like a beach bum read, or something to keep you occupied on a rainy day then MAYBE pick it up.  Honestly, there are so many other better books out there.... don't waste your money.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is the story of a 57 year old man recalling his senior year in High School.  Landon Carter was the some what of the town rebel; him and his friends would go into the graveyard and hide in the bushes across for the reverend's house and make crude remarks as he passed them.  No one in that town ever thought that Landon Carter would be the one to fall in love with Reverend Sullivan's daughter.   <br />Jamie Sullivan was the girl that everyone made fun of.  She would come to school everyday wearing the same outfit, a skirt, the same sweater, and her hair pulled back in a tight bun.  Landon had to perform in the school play that winter, A Christmas Story, he had the lead male role co-staring Jamie.  After the play Landon and Jamie spent more and more time together, then one day Landon's feelings grew stronger. <br />Landon and Jamie spent all the time they could together.  Landon's friends would always have something rude to say to him when ever they saw him, he didn't even care what they had to say about Jamie or about the two of them together, he was in love with her and nothing was going to change that.   <br />Then one day Jamie dropped a bomb shell, she was sick.  Jamie had been diagnosed with Leukemia about two years before they really got to know each other.  Landon was heartbroken when he heard the news.  The next day Jamie and her father informed the church of the news and they were all shocked, No one would have ever imaged that someone as sweet as Jamie could ever suffer like this.   <br />Landon and Jamie spent the rest their senior year and then summer following side by side until the day she passed.     <br />This is a great book for those of you that love a great love story and a good cry. <br />
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects wasn't like anything usual or anything I ever suspected or expected. It had been out for some time by the time I'd finally seen it. My ex was shocked beyond belief I'd never watched it, so he sat me down and made me watch it. He & I are still friends so even to this day, I still thank him for introducing me to this amazing movie. Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the plot. Even if this isn't the usual kind of movie you'd tend to grab off the rack, just do it. You won't be disappointed. It's captivating and smart and the ending is awesome. No matter how many times I watch it, I still adore it. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but then again, he always is in my book.
0385507755|5.0|This book opens up the world of rehab protocol, the diverse characters residing therein, and the mind-challenges to \\"believe\\".  I now understand the depths of despair addicts undergo.  Frey's relationship with Lilly is more passionate and sexual and loving without going further than light kisses in rehab; a true, love story. His tenderness toward her, his touching of her face, would make any woman's heart melt. The book encompasses so many facets of relationships. His bond with Leonard, his honesty of his feelings both negative and positive, his portrait of others, the judge, his roommate etc, leave the reader with a room full of emotions.  I have a terminal condition and was given 3 months to live a year ago.  Here I am a little less agile but living as full a life as I can. My mantra was always \\"be strong\\". Now I've added \\"hold on\\" as well. <br /> <br />My Friend Leonard, while a stand-alone book, it helps to have read A Million Little Pieces first only because it more completes how they met and Leonards feelings toward him.  It is currently my favorite book.  I loved it. <br /> <br />Mr. Frey, you are remarkable. Your staccato style is new to me.  Your repetitious wording works for me.  I would love to know more about Maya and your daughter.  <br /> <br />I have recommended the book to several friends. They enjoyed it as well <br /> <br />I have watched your interviews and can only say to those who would quibble about something that doesn't change the context of the book one bit, \\"Oh, grow up.\\"
1400031087|5.0|A person should not write a review for this book until they have read it. I read A Million Little Pieces two years ago and was moved greatly. This is not a work of fiction packaged as a memoir. If some details happen to be embellished, I say \\"thank you\\" for adding some extra drama. James Frey writes with heart and soul about his life's events and if you read the book you'll feel it. The only reason James Frey's work is being critiqued is because Oprah had to stick her nose into his success and try to make it her own. Everyone has the urge to tear down Oprah and so here is the end result...
0380789035|5.0|If deity is the function of those who believe in one; and the nature of the deity is shaped by the beliefs, what sort of thing will happen to the gods who travel to America?<br /><br />That's the question Gaiman plays with.  The answers are painful, because the reader will reflect on the things said about the culture the gods inhabit.<br /><br />Schizophrenic, self-interested, and many without any sense of care for those who worship them.  Taking advantage of every opportunity to get a little ahead, exploiting ignorance and cheating each other as they struggle to keep a slice of the, small, pie the devout have left to offer.<br /><br />It's grim, whimsical, depressing, uplifitng and poignant.  Love, and death, in the shadowlands of those who can be immortal.
055357342X|5.0|I just finished the third book in the series and I am eagerly awaiting receiving the 4th book. I love this series, it's so entertaining and addictive. You can't put it down! I really don't know what people are talking about when they say this book is a sorry example of fantasy. I have attempted to check out fantasy books at the library but the genre seems deluged with generic, poorly written crap. Martin's books are not that. <br /> <br />People also seem to be complaining about the many different subplots and that they have nothing to do with the main story. Um, yes, yes they do. Besides the fact that the subplots are causing mayhem for the main characters, you have to know that they are all going to come together in upcoming books. Martin is a good writer, why else would he have a character like Daenerys? You just have to have a little forsight and common sense to know that all the subplots are going to intertwine with the main story somewhere along the way. <br /> <br />Some good characters die in this 3rd installment. But it's not the end of the world. I was a little pissed at some turn of events, but I take it as a sign of a very good author that I have come to have strong feelings for a lot of the characters.  <br /> <br />It's a very good book. Go buy it.  <br />
B0000074FL|5.0|I am tired of hearing about this album not being up to the rest of Thin Lizzy's albums.  This was a defining album for them.  The title cut is so identifiable to so many teens and adults alike it goes to the heart of who Thin Lizzy is.  This was the first Thin Lizzy album I bought and so I measure the the rest of their works to it.  There are many of their albums that in no way meet up to the standards of this.  It may not have all of the songs being balls to the walls rock and roll, but it goes back to the blues where so many bands have forgotten where it all started.  Not a bad song on the album.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This is a very good cd, but it's just not \\"amazing\\". Most of the songs are great. IMO, they should've ended the cd with \\"13. Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head\\". The last two songs, while good, don't really go good with everything before it.<br /><br />I do have other problems, but it's not really anything that ruins it. Overall, the greatness overshadows the problems. If you're looking for something that's new and laid back, then buy this.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I dont have have a bad thing to say about this album. It is really a solid listen from start to finish. The best track is the one he does with Bo Bice called \\"Brown Skin Girl.\\" I cant wait for the next one.
B000002G7G|4.0|This album is a mellower version of the Velvets, probally trying to clean up old habits, I don't know, it's a pretty good set though. Candy Says is a nice little slow understand every word song, along with the organ in control What Goes On. Beginning To See The Light, good little sample here of rebirth or something. And if you want to save yourself well then Lou will sing you a little bit of Jesus here in this set. This album didn't get good reviews back in the day, but I thought this was a pretty good album, not as good as Velvet's with Nico, but I still like it better than White Light White Heat, that album just kind of aggravated me. Anyways for you AVANT GARDE lovers only, heres your 1969 Velvet Underground
0307276902|5.0|I would like to point out that many of the people who are writing negative reviews on this book have not written any reviews on any other books... which truly just looks malicious and lame, in my opinion.  This is a good book.  I don't even think that everyone who read this book thought that 100% of it was true... but they took it as a well written, entertaining and inspirational book.  So what if it's not 100%... it's still good.  If it were completely put as \\"non-fiction\\" it would have gotten the same acclaim.  People really have WAY too much time on their hands and need something/someone to focus their negative feelings towards.  Get a life, people!  I wonder if everyone that gave it a negative review even read it or are they just putting their 2 cents in without true reason other than to try and feel important.  People...read it and make your own choice as to whether you like it or not.
B000003S0I|4.0|Even though this album really only has three songs I liked on it, it still gets 4 stars. Robert Fripp just lets it go crazy on Lark's Tongue Part 1, Book of Saturday, not bad future Asia's John Wenton, bass and vocals on that track. I think they might have been competing with Floyd on Easy Money, still an awesome track by these guys. So three out of six ain't bad, I don't think considering it's progressive, so you have to sit thru long sets, but the songs I liked that I mentioned in this review aren't too long, so you'll live. This album I would only recommend to people though who do like progressive rock in the fact that some of the delicate types might not quite grip the concept, enjoy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I am gonna be honest with you all. I haven't really got a favourite album, because all of Radiohead's albums are a great success. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I were to choose a favourite. Their music overall, in my opinion is GENIUS. <br />There is something very eerie, mysterious, and yet beautiful about Radiohead. Something that you will never be able to explain, or put your finger on. It's just the fact that they create such masterpieces of work, which take you into a completely different world. <br /> <br />How many bands can you say, dare to go that deep with such imagination and creative Genius!

Page's little tribute for Jeff to play Bolero, very good and clever. Shape of Things a little ditty done prior with the Yardbirds. Rod Stewart you just jam on this album, you were meant for blues, but like a bird you flew away into a different group, but here he's new, welcome to the 1968 Jeff Beck's Truth.

B00008QSAA|4.0|This album is just amazing, just too bad it didn't have Nantucket Sleighride, I know that's their next album, but boy it would have fit perfectly with this set. But still this album is jam packed with the best rock and roll money can buy. Mississippi Queen, a classic always will be. I have to say though Theme For An Imaginary Western is a hell of alot better jam song though and gets no airplay on any regular classic rock station, boy what a shame there. Never In My Life packs the punch and as always loud as hell. To My Friend a good little acoustic number. But just like the CD says it was meant to be played LOUD, enjoy.

0385336942|1.0|I was disapointed by this book,the whole story seemed very intriguing. Imagine what it was like to be a young man, sent to the arctic for bomb disposal.The bombs are secret japanese balloon bombs, made by every japanese citizen and launched to land on the United States. Several of these bombs landed in California, the state of Washington and most in Alaska.<br /><br />  But beyond this, the story is very dull. The main character<br /><br />Beik, rambles on about a dying friend and about his fears of meeting up with a woman of japanese descent.He takes abuse from his surly superior officer. I could not finish this book because<br /><br />there was no point to it.

B000002UJQ|5.0|If you know anything about the history of our current state in the music industry, then you probably know about \\"OK Computer\\"'s influence. What they did, essentially, was implement electronics into their anthemic rock sound which made it \\"ok\\" (get it) for such a move to even take place (after all, this came out in 1997). This wasn't just a gimmick, however - every song here is good-if-not-amazing. Most people only know their classic hit \\"Paranoid Android\\", but the rest are just as good, creative and inspired as this song (though it *might* take some time to like the others as they aren't as instantly catchy and memorable most of the time). Musically the album sounds relatively similar to \\"The Bends\\", but, like I said, with an electronic element added to it - this is where the name of the album factors in. The lyrics are always interesting to listen to, even if they're not necessarily memorable or decipherable some of the time. They're essentially about finding beauty in a world of seemingly unnatural things (aka technology). Singer Thom Yorke has such incredible energy, personality and charm that it would be almost impossible not to love him. He's definitely a unique-sounding singer who can take the emotion of the lyrics and musicianship that much further with any song in which he sings. I'm pretty confident that most people in this world will enjoy him. Basically, if you're a Radiohead fan or if you're looking for music that will remain interesting and fun forever then \\"OK Computer\\" is a great purchase! Absolutely recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />the entire album!

B000B2YQX4|4.0|Some bands, like REM, start out awesome, have an amazing 10 year run, then frustatingly start slipping into middle-age and, yes, boredom.  I sadly gave up on them a couple of albums ago. <br /> <br />Thank God this has not happened to Depeche Mode.  Perhaps because of David Gahan's dangerous fall and fighting return, perhaps because of Martin Gore's still sharp musical sensibilities, perhaps just because DM still has a soul, this feels like a semi-classic DM album - the same themes they've always explored, but with some very exciting new offerings. <br /> <br />No, this album is not as amazing as \\"Music For The Masses\\" - and it's unfair to expect something like that - but for a band going on its 30th year (?!!), DM has managed to keep my faith. <br /> <br />It's worth it just for \\"John the Revelator\\", which has quickly become one of my all-time DM favorites.
0679409998|3.0|Mary Shelley was born in London in 1797, two years before the death of George Washington.  She wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was 19 or 20, depending on which literary historian you choose to believe.  If you approach this novel as the work of a teenager in the England of two centuries ago, it is impressive.  If you treat it as a piece of literature, it is absolutely awful.  As many other readers have pointed out, the basic story idea is great but it is very badly written.  Shelley's language is flowery to the point of absurdity.  She might be allowed to get away with wildly overwritten dialogue, considering the period in which the book was written, but just try to imagine the nine-foot tall hideous monster, who has deliberately murdered a small child, speaking these lines: \\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood, the cottagers.  They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.\\"  The plot, too, has some seriously nonsensical elements, the most basic of which may be Victor Frankenstein simply walking away from his newly created monster.  The creation of the monster, incidentally, is not described.  All of the lightening-catchers and pseudoscientific gadgetry was the invention of later dramatists.  Mary Shelley's achievement was to create the Frankenstein myth, which has been dramatized and parodied repeatedly.  Despite the glaring faults of her novel, \\"Frankenstein\\" is historically important, and the story itself does have some genuinely interesting episodes.  The edition published by Everyman's Library is inexpensive, nicely printed and bound, and has an excellent introduction by Wendy Lesser.  Shelley's early life, as described by Lesser, was so bizarre and socially irresponsible that it would make a good subject for a historical novel.  \\"Mother of Frankenstein\\"?ect for a historical novel.  \\"Mother of Frankenstein\\"?
B0000025H0|5.0|As my title suggests I have 'ripped' this CD--as well as several thousand--of my three thousand CD collection onto my iPod and have revisited many of the older albums that I had put into storage cases. I have always thought this CD was a fantastic one and repeated listening to it via the iPod has affirmed it.<br /><br />The title track warns one and all, that the remainder of the album is going to be a long running sprint. The music is fine. This is latin rock--or rock at its finest form; lyrical, driving and melodic.<br /><br />\\"Aqua Marine\\" describes melodically the comparitive imbue of blue and green: imagine the ocean and the waves.<br /><br />\\"Stay (Beside Me)\\" is sung by Alex Ligertwood (dang I miss his vocals), a vocal track with emblazoned Santana licks.<br /><br />\\"Hard Times\\" is an anthem dedicated to positivity.<br /><br />\\"Love\\" is asking--pleading actually--for change.<br /><br />The music beckons endurance--the verb is the vibe--pay attention, the competition is fierce.
1592400876|5.0|I think this book was written especially for me! I have always been a \\"stickler\\" for grammar, spelling and punctuation, much to the dismay of my schoolmates and even the occasional teacher who dared to misspell a word on the chalkboard. I have even corrected signs at Wal-Mart: \\"For Safety Sake\\" changed to \\"For Safety's Sake\\" with a handy black Sharpie. I can even point you to a permanent inspection sign over a fire extinguisher where I added a much-needed apostrophe. <br /> <br />In Lynne Truss's own words: <br />\\"For any true stickler, you see, the sight of the plural word \\"Book's\\" with an apostrophe in it will trigger a ghastly emotional process similar to the stages of bereavement, though greatly accelerated. First there is shock. Within seconds, shock gives way to disbelief, disbelief to pain, and pain to anger. Finally (and this is where the analogy breaks down), anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage with the aid of a permanent marker.\\" <br /> <br />I keep a permanent marker in my purse at all times. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Ms. Truss touches upon the accepted uses for multiple forms of punctuation, as well as their grotesque misuses. She often quotes noted writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, Gertrude Stein, James Thurber, and Mark Twain, and has a seemingly unending supply of colourful, humourous anecdotes and quotes to illustrate her points (no pun intended).  <br /> <br />In another passage, Truss writes what could be a dust-jacket summary for a grammarian's mystery book: <br />\\"Yes, you can see the bullet points here, here and here, sir; there are multiple back-slashes, of course. And that's a forward slash. I would have to call this a frenzied attack. Did anyone hear the interrobang?\\" <br />\\"Oh, yes. Woman next door was temporarily deafened by it. What's this?\\" <br />\\"Ah. You don't see many of these anymore. It's an emoticon. Hold your head this way and it appears to be winking.\\" <br />\\"Good God! You mean -?\\" <br />\\"That's the mouth.\\" <br />\\"You mean - ?\\" <br />\\"That's the nose.\\" <br />\\"Good grief. Then it's -?\\" <br />\\"Oh, yes, sir. There's no doubt about it, sir. The punctuation murderer has struck again.\\" <br /> <br />It was a truly delightful read, and I recommend it to anyone who has ever winced at a poorly punctuated passage. :-)
B00026WU9Q|4.0|At this time, Bob was warming up to do his masterpieces like Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde, its not his best album, but its definitly worth a look. <br /> <br />This album has alot of variety, jaunty rockers {Subterranean Homesick Blues, Maggies Farm}, love songs {She Belongs To Me, Love Minus Zero/No Limit}, haunting poetic epics {Gates Of Eden, Its Allright Ma} and masterful classics {Mr. Tambourine Man}. <br /> <br />
B000DZIGDU|1.0|When I first saw that Anthony Swofford's travesty of a book \\"Jarhead\\" was being made into a movie, I was sickened.  His book was bad enough. I remember reading it and, as a US Marine myself who ALSO served in Desert Storm, I thought in the back of my mind that it probably wouldn't be long until the Hollywood left came to this book to make it a movie.  Also, Swofford is the type of bottom-feeding traitor who would do just about anything for a buck, so it's no surprise there either.  But, I digress.<br /><br />This movie/book is an abomination.  Point blank and period.  It's not \\"realistic\\" in any sense other than, perhaps, the color of desert fatigues.  You want a real sense of life at USMCRD?  Go get a copy of \\"THE D.I.\\" with Jack Webb. Or at least watch nothing past the first 30 minutes of \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\"  Anything past that is garbage.  That's how it is, how it was for me at P.I. - can't say for my Hollywood Marine brothers in SD.  You want to REALLY get an idea?  Enlist.  Anything else and you're really selling the experience short, take my word.<br /><br />Desert Storm itself was nothing like this.  And coming from a Marine who still has brothers fighting in Iraq, I take this movie/book as a personal attack against all Marines.  It truly is, and always has been since Swofford wrote it.  Do yourself a favor and avoid it all costs.<br /><br />If you've seen this movie and you're inspired to read something, I urge you not to read Swofford's book.  Go pick up a copy of \\"MARINE\\" about Chesty Puller instead.  Then watch \\"The Sands of Iwo Jima\\" or \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" and thank God that you live in the USA and still have sensible brothers/sisters in the Armed Services (not just Marines, though I am biased after serving in the USMC 12+ years), who hold this country's values near and dear.<br /><br />Semper Fi.
0385512104|3.0|The Curious Incident is nice in that it's a different style, but because the story is told through the eyes of an autistic child, the writing is necessarily bland, random, and matter-of-fact.  This can make it rather dull at times, but Haddon does a nice job of conveying other characters' emotions despite this.  It's also a nice quick read, so you're not investing that much time in it.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|If you have played this cd on your computer, you can go to [...] and there you can uninstall the program from your computer. If you haven't played this cd on your computer, I wouldn't because then it should save you the worry of whether your computer is at risk or not.<br /><br />As for the remixes, they are all pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the orginal version of \\"Early Mornin'\\" but the remix of this song is better than the original song, I think. I love \\"And then we kiss\\", that's the song I have listened to the most on the album. \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\" is a long remix but every second of it is great. The \\"Everytime\\" remix is also very excellent. Sometimes remixes can be really boring but all the remixes on \\"B in the mix\\" are fabulous and if you are a true Britney fan, then this is one cd not to be missed.

I'm  not surprised people would need their drug addiction stories riddled with fabrication's and typical falsehoods about drug addiction spoonfed to them by Oprah's book club so they can feel safe and superior to others in society who don't have trust fund money and parents to bail them out. I would also reccommend The Basketball Diarys by Jim Carroll over the work of this cliche-ridden poser.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Troy is based on Homer's The Iliad, and tells the story of the Greek's war with Troy, after they took Helen, Queen of Sparta.   <br /> <br />It stars Brad Pitt as Achilles, Eric Bana as Hector and Orlando Bloom as Paris.  Personally, I just didn't think Brad Pitt was right in the role of Achilles, but I am sure that many of fans would disagree with me.  However, Eric Bana was great in his role of Hector, and it was good to see another Aussie actor doing so well. <br /> <br />Although I had heard of the Trojan war, I didn't know too much about it.  I spent a lot of time during the movie saying \\"Of course, that's where we get that saying from\\".  However, I did spend the whole movie wondering where Achilles heel came into play.  I came up with some very crazy ideas before I saw what happened. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a good movie, but not great.  I found the characters of Paris, Achilles and Helen of Troy very hard to like.  And, in my opinion, none of the characters were particularly enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br />I was also quite disappointed, while watching the special features on the DVD, to hear that they are made everything in bigger proportions than it would have appeared in real life.  For instance, the Trojans had 10 foot statues, but they made 40 foot statues.  I would prefer to see more attention to historical accuracy. <br />
0786890762|5.0|This is my first Cecelia Ahern book and it will not be my last. I loved every page of Love, Rosie. The characters in this book was so great and I genuinely cared what happened to them. I have to say my view on the \\"Time issue\\". I don't believe that Rosie and Alex were Baby Boomers(I don't know if they call them that in Ireland, which is where the book is set. I believe that Rosie and Alex were born somewhere in the late 1970's to early 80's. I was born in 1983 and Instant Messaging was becoming popular by the time I was in high school. I can't fully explain the Colin Farrell thing but I'm sure that he will be still nice looking by the time Katie becomes that age that she was when she liked him. Plus maybe Cecelia Ahern maybe just needed a cute actor and didn't want to make him up. I don't believe that Ahern wanted us to know exactly the year that everything took place.<br /><br />Anyway, the book was both funny and sad. I loved the Chat Room scenes and the first Chat Room scene had me laughing out loud, which I hardly ever do when I read a book. All the family moments for Rosie later on in the book were sad yet it turned out great for her professional life in the end. The epilogue was of course, the best part of the book.<br /><br />Love, Rosie is written in a way that has become more popular in recent years. It's written in form of e-mails,IMing, letters, and cards. Readers of Meg Cabot's adult books will be familiar with this format. This format is one of those things where you either love it or you hate it. It's hard to be indifferent about the style. I personally like the style and it doesn't bug me in the slightest. But if you don't like the format of a book written entire in e-mails and letters then you have been warned.<br /><br />But the story of Rosie and Alex is truly a great one and hopefully everyone will like it as much as I have.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost In Translation is not to be watched as a traditionnal \\"story\\" movie. It is also not a dumbed-down american flick. And it is certainly NOT for everyone.

So it goes for the legions of ill directed cinephiles who erroneously watched Lost In Translation *sigh* <br /> <br />The ambiance in the movie is mesmerising, Murray and Johannsson are beautifully directed and the ending is sublime.

0553212443|4.0|Every Christmas I say I will reread A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, and this past Christmas I actually did it. <br /> <br />Nobody needs reminding of the story of A Christmas Carol.  We all know the tale of Scrooge and his visits by the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Future.  Even for those who have never read the book, the story has been retold in many different forms and at least three versions make their appearance on our television screens each Christmas. <br /> <br />So why has this little tale proved to be so popular?  I think it's because Scrooge is such a memorable character and we all know someone we like to think of as a Scrooge.  And, let's be honest, we would like them to change.  A Christmas Carol touches the desires of all of us to show people what they are really like and have them change for the better.  And Scrooge is also one of those characters that seem to be likeable even when they're easy to dislike. <br /> <br />I think this book is still worth reading, even though we know the story.  It is a very small book.  I read it in its entirety on Christmas Eve.  It is also very easy to read.  Some classics, I feel, are difficult for the modern reader because our tastes and expectations are different from those of the past.  But because A Christmas Carol was written quickly by Dickens, and kept short, it will pose no problems to readers of today. <br /> <br />Besides being a great tale, A Christmas Carol also gives us an insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in Victorian society.  Don't wait until Christmas to read it! <br />
B000BYRCH4|4.0|I was at the video store ready to make an indiscriminate purchase.  My hand was on \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\" when out of the corner of my eye I spyed \\"Into the Blue\\".  I should say that I zeroed in on the sight of Jessica Alba in her too small blue bikini.  This impulse had struck me in the past most notably with \\"Catwoman\\" last year.  Would Jessica make me feel like the jilted bridegroom as Halle did before?  Would this movie be an instant candidate for the discount bin at Wal-Mart?  Much to my surprise \\"Into the Blue\\" was not the extended SI swimsuit video I expected but an honest-to-goodness edge-of-your-seat underwater thriller.  Normally I hate underwater movies but director John Stockwell shows an expert hand at not only framing the beauty of the Bahaman waters but staging action undersea.  Both Paul Walker and Alba make for appealing protagonists.  It shouldn't be held against them that they are, <br /> well,pretty.  Scott Caan has a nice turn as Walker's oily buddy.  Josh Brolin makes for an imposing heavy.  My only real reservation about the flick is that it gets a little bogged down with gratuitous violence towards the end.  My initial reservations about this flick emenate from it's lukewarm critical and box office reception on it's initial theatrical run.  The problem is not so much with the film itself but how it was marketed.  If they played up the action angle as well as the cheesecake factor it's fortunes might have been better.
0066620996|5.0|A very well organized discussion. Lends good insight into how some companies could use some really simple principles to steer clear of mediocrity & rose a great deal...<br /><br />Simple principles - as it turns out - arent all that simple to put to practice. And that is what causes some good companies to remain good forever - while others rise.<br /><br />Quite many reviewers have harped on the fact that most of the companies studied to have risen to great levels have - since then - not been all that great. well, i dont think that is a problem with this book. It could be argued both ways - probably those companies lost it and werent applying these principles as well..in any case, this book is not meant to be the God written will that these companies will always be great.<br /><br />Just that they used these principles & -in that phase- did rise to great levels. period. So, you could apply/adapt these principles & potentially benefit as well. Simple.
B00005JNEI|2.0|For the individual who is well read and keeps up with current events, much of the content on this DVD will not come as a surprise. Moore's documentary argues that the Bush administration not only handled the terrorist attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon in an incompetent manner but that George W. Bush along with members of his family had ties with the individuals who were either directly or indirectly responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The film opens with the aftermath of the 2000 elections and moves on from there. Moore rehashes much of what was already reported on such as Dr. Rice's ignorance regarding the report on Bin Laden submitted to her a month before the attacks. He also rehashes former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke's interview on Good Morning America, after he quit his job, where Clarke elaborates on how the Bush administration was obsessed with linking Iraq and al-Qaida together when in fact no such link ever existed. There are some entertaining parts of the film such as the former phone worker who was questioned by the FBI at his apartment after calling Bush a derogatory name at his local gym which was overheard by another gym member. With the exception of the revelation of Bush's relationship to James R. Bath, much of this won't come as a surprise. If one wants a better in depth look into the 9/11 attacks I recommend picking up a copy of House of Bush-House of Saud by Craig Unger, Superpatriotism by Michael Parenti, and Forbidden Truth (two French authors) which elaborates in detail the U.S. government's early diplomatic relationship with the Taliban regarding establishing a pipeline. Also PBS Frontline put out two excellent specials, which may not be on DVD yet, entitled House of Saud (history of the U.S.--Saudi relationship up to 9/11) and The Man Who Knew which is the story of the late FBI agent John O'Neill and his attempts to foil the 9/11 attacks only to fail due in part to diplomatic red tape and an apathetic U.S. government.

However, while Frey does certainly dramatize and embellish numerous parts of his book, he clearly goes far beyond that as well. There is no definition of embellishment that allows for turning a traffic ticket into three months of hard time in prison; when you take a tragedy that you have only heard about and write that you had been a key player in its unfolding, you have gone beyond dramatization. Both these, and numerous other examples, are fabrications and fictions. Plain and simple. If we, as a culture lose the distinction in our literature between embellishment and complete fabrication, then we lose the distinction between fiction and non-fiction altogether. Let Frey call his words what they are, and have them judged accordingly. Thus farhe has not done this. He has admitted to embellishment only, and that is neither fiction nor fabrication nor embellishment nor dramatization. It is a lie.  <br />

B000BEZQ18|5.0|A soundtrack should really bring back the \\"feel\\" of a movie when you listen to it and this one does in spades. From Gus Santaolalla's spare, evocative, guitar scoring to Willie Nelson's He Was a Friend of Mine and Rufus Wainright's mournful The Maker Makes over the final credits, this cd will transport you back into the movie. (I couldnt get the movie out of my head for days). I'm not a big country music fan, but I liked (or loved) everything on here and its made me more interested in exploring some of the performers like Teddy Thompson (who has a great duet with Rufus on King of the Road, which alone is worth the price of the CD!) About the only song cut that doesnt fit is Ronstadt's It's So Easy (heard briefly in a bar in the movie). A better choice would have been Ronstadt's version of Hank Williams', I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You. There is a lot on here that didnt make it into the film (at least that I remember) and you dont have to have seen the film to enjoy the music. But what are you waiting for? See it!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love Jane Austen, but I am not a purist when it comes to any movie adaptation of a book. The book is always better; that is a given. The films based upon it strive to deserve its title. Cinema and literature are two very different forms of creative expression, and I believe that it is impossible for any film to completely capture Austen's genius of Pride and Prejudice. Yes, the BBC miniseries was excellent. This film is better. By not trying to \\"be\\" the book, but \\"be\\" the characters, this version of Pride and Prejudice brings new emotions that the BBC miniseries missed. I was never swept away by the miniseries; I love it, but it did not make me wish to be Lizzy, as the novel, and now this wonderful film, does. The director and actors portrayed the Pride and Prejudice of my imagination, and I can offer no higher praise than that.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I saw Rent twice in the theater, once on opening night.  I have never been to a movie that made me laugh and cry at the same time.  The fact that Chris Columbus was able to get most of the original cast for this movie made it even more special.  Don't let the fact that the movie talks about AIDS influance you.  The topic is as relevent now as it was almost 10 years ago when the Broadway Play opened.  This movie shows how people live with diseases, being poor, and battle drug addiction, yet still are true to themselves, they are true friends and more of a family than some familys I know. And they fight to be better people everyday.  This movie makes grateful for what I have and makes me want to do more for others too. I AM COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS UNTIL I CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE WHEN EVER I WANT. <br /> <br />I think this movie should be seen by everyone, it is amazing, wonderful and timely. <br /> <br />No Day But Today!!!!! <br /> <br />Tori
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Say what you want about Michael's...well \\"interests,\\" he is still one of the greatest musicians in the history of pop music.  Michael was not just a singer, not just a dancer, but also a composer.  He is a multi-talented genius.  And Thriller is his opus.   <br /> <br />Between Michael and uber-producer Quincy Jones, Thriller is the epitome of a great album.  The musical variety of the songs made for countless #1 hits.  Compare the chanting of  \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" with the light pop duet of \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" with Paul McCartney.  Each song is vastly different, yet each brilliant in its own way.  Then there is the title track, the opus of the opus, with a superb extensive addicting danceable song and a Vincent Price narration.   <br /> <br />My favorite MJ song is \\"Rock With You,\\" part of the nearly-Thriller-good Off The Wall album.  But, if you want to hear Michael at his best--Thriller is the album to get.
B0000CBHOI|4.0|Martin Scorsese says it himself in the special features section of Disc 1, there have been other historical films done on the blues, this isn't one of them, at least for the most part.<br /><br />This film, instead, is a colage of different ideas about the blues, where the director's preferance is the guide. It's more about a snapshot of moments than any kind of real history. While some have argued that the directors spend too much time on \\"insignificant\\" bluesfolk and not enough time on popular bluesmen of the time. That's really the director's perogative and overall the collage format works.<br /><br />There are a couple films that overall are just really, really slow \\"The Road To Memphis\\" (Featuring B.B. King) and Clint Eastwood piano bit seems like an odd way to end the series. But, it once again falls into the over all theme of the project, 7 men painting what the Blues is for them.<br /><br />I would have loved to hear more about Huddie \\"Leadbelly\\" Ledbetter, but he was mentioned briefly in the first film. What I got instead was a wider perspective than my own small view on the Blues before hand. And I'm no slouch either. There are plenty of people talking up John Lee Hooker, Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton out there, this series hits other spots, some of which I didn't really know about.<br /><br />There are some complaints about talking over musical performances. All that is easily mended when you venture into the Special Features and Song Selection options on each disc. Uninterupted footage of the performances within each episode. Maybe it's not the most time efficient way of getting what you want, but seriously.<br /><br />Ken Burns I think is a bit overrated and other reviewers pleas to him to do a Blues series, will probably never happen. He did Jazz and that's really all he's going to do on music. I'd love to see one the other said films on Blues history, but Blues to me has always been more about feeling than accuracy or chronology.
B000AARKW6|4.0|I liked this movie alot, even though i agree with one of the other reviewers that it's a bit formulaic. And while Pacino is solid enough, I wouldn't rank this performance as anywhere near his best. But SEAN PENN! Man, was he great as a smarmy weasel of a lawyer! And with the great make-up job on his head, I know a few people who didn't even know it was him until they were told so later. <br />   I'd give the film about 3 and a half stars altogether, but I'd call Penn's performance a must-see and give it 5 stars plus! <br />
0446310786|5.0|Being in High School, this is one of the many books that we are FORCED to read.  When this book was handed out one morning, the normal reaction occured.  Everybody looked at it as another book that we are all going to sleep through, and BS our way throught the tests and quiz's.  What happened next was to all of our suprises.  The book was mind blowing, mind inspiring, and mind turning.  The way Harper Lee can bring the plot 360 degrees, even in the very end when Scout is reitterating the book that Atticus has read to her, it all still fits in.  Reading this book will not be a waste of time, but a growing experience.  It will teach you how to grow as Scout has to realize that prejedice is one of the worst issues we deal with in this day and age, as in the 1930's.  As a 16 year old high school student, this book has changed me, and helped me to learn something that a book has never been able to teach me before.
B0009I7O7A|1.0|I love this album, but was really disappointed that my CD-Rom Drive in my computer won't even recognize the audio side of the album.  That's because, as I gather, I have iTunes installed and apparently it doesn't like iPods.  So for that, I give the Dual Disc 1 star. I don't see why I cannot enjoy the tunes I buy in a format (or device) of my choice.   <br /> <br />I did like the DVD featurette of John's home video of recording the album/touring/about to hit it big. A nice time capsule.  <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|OK, I'll admit it: I've gone to the theater to see this 6 or 7 times already--I've lost count; I'm thrilled that the DVD is coming out sooner rather than later. <br /> <br />No, this is not the much-loved 1995 multi-hour A&E version. And no, MacFaydan is not Firth, and Knightly is not Ehle. And some liberties were taken with the original storyline (sometimes a bit disconcerting like Lady Catherine's night time visit?? and Bingley entering Jane's sickroom, even before knocking?? \\"simply not done\\" in those days!). <br /> <br />But I very much agree with the positive reviewers below --this version is MOST enjoyable on its own. The scenery, photography, and music are gorgeous (you must buy the CD!). Darcy and Elizabeth are still wonderfully Darcy and Elizabeth. It was a little disconcerting at first to see so much mud, livestock, and plain gowns--but you get past that fairly quickly. And it seems maybe a bit more realistic for country gentry. <br /> <br /> <br />BTW--if you're a P&P addict like me, don't miss Pamela Aiden's Darcy trilogy--it tells the entire story from Darcy's viewpoint and fills in a lot of what I think is missing. Also, if you have wondered what might have happened after the wedding and like a \\"spicier\\" novel, read Linda Berdoll's \\"Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife\\" (Austen meets Bronte and Sandra Brown).

B000000W5N|5.0|Very few albums come out that grab you the very first time you hear them and after years of repeated listenings still manage to have that same appeal. Every song on the record is a winner and in typical Stone's fashion, they meander between Blues to Country satire to Jazz to straight out rock.<br /><br />Listen to the anguished scream of Jagger on Sway, a greatly underrated cut. Then listen to the melodic interplay on Wild Horses. This just intensifies with \\"Can't You Hear ME Knocking\\" where the aggressive, slurred hook eventually segues into a jazzy jam/finish.<br /><br />It all works here and the record is tribute to the band at the top of their talents.
0307276902|1.0|Mr. Frey writes \\"I lied if I needed to lie to get something or get out of something.\\"   <br /> <br />Say it ain't so, BigJim.  <br /> <br />Mr. Frey also says (out loud, mind you) that he \\"wants to be the greatest literary writer of his generation.\\"  <br /> <br />That ship sailed with that sentence. If he aspired to being the greatest NON-literary writer, maybe he'd have a shot. <br /> <br />  <br />
B0000VD04M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this look into the life of Ed Wood. Johnny Depp was excellent. The thing he did best was present this aura that Wood thought everything he did was genius, even though it wasn't. When Wood improvised just so he could get Plan 9 from Outerspace done, he seemed to have a genius glow in his face, even though it looked like crap. The film, not his face. It was very amusing. <br />Martin Landau was awarded an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and that's deservedly so. The first time I saw the movie, I didn't even know it was Landau! Of course I was much younger, but the voice, the facial expression, the movements; he really transformed for this role.  <br />If you see the finished product of Plan 9 from Outerspace, after seeing this movie, you find yourself looking for all the tiny, yet humorous flaws in it. Don't get me wrong; Plan 9 is still cool, but it was pretty cheesy, and Ed Wood seemed to highlight its shortcomings.
1591840562|3.0|This is not a manual, but rather a collection of mostly useful tips for people who wish to start businesses, or even, as author Guy Kawasaki claims, other sorts of projects, including nonprofit organizations. Kawasaki may overuse business-babble such as \\"bootstrapping\\" or \\"rainmaking\\" (in fact, he recommends coming up with a brand name that can enter the language as a verb, such as Google or Xerox) - but his style is good-natured and humorous. The chapters are divided accessibly with subheads, charts, bullet points, \\"minichapters,\\" answers to \\"Frequently Avoided Questions\\" and reading lists, making it easy to find important points. Many of Kawasaki's \\"exercises\\" are tongue-in-cheek, like, \\"Go to eBay and search for used Aeron chairs.\\" He got his start working at Apple Computer, marketing early MacIntoshes, and he now runs a venture capital firm, Garage Technology Ventures. He refers to both frequently, and most of the book's examples come from these venues, not from inside knowledge of other start-ups, even though the author has been involved in several. This isn't the only book you'll need to read when you decide to start a business, but we find that its iconoclastic pointers are useful and fun, and its sections on pitching, recruiting and branding, in particular, apply to businesses of any size.
0307276902|1.0|As a recovering addict and alcoholic myself - female - 47 years old - I had seen Mr Frey's intereview on Oprah when it was on a month or so ago and I could really relate to a lot of what he said.  But, now after these allegations came out and to find out that he embellished \\"parts\\" of his memoir makes me totally doubt if he even had any problems with addiction at all.  Could he have gone to rehab as a writer to gather information for this book ?  Might have happened.  I had planned on getting this book, now I wouldn't read it if someone gave it to me.  He makes a mockery out of the TRUE recovery process and the pain and suffering that we encounter.  I, for one, don't believe that he was even and addict at all.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|Into The Blue was filmed in the Bahamas, so if you're missing the water, this is a great little movie to see.<br /><br />I'm older than the target market for this flick, but that's OK.  Jessica Alba is cute in a 2-piece, but better than that (for me anyway) is that the girl has character and we get to see that in this movie.<br /><br />Alba plays Samantha (Sam), girlfriend to Paul Walker's character, Jared.  These two lovebird/dive bums are making a go of it on their own in the Bahamas, diving for treasure, working for jerks, doing what they can to sustain their chosen lifestyle.  You gotta respect them: they're doing more than a lot of slacker 20-somethings to live their dream.  And they're not doing so bad until trouble comes to town in the form of Bryce and Amanda.  Bryce and Jared are buds from college days, and Bryce has done well for himself as a criminal attorney back in NYC.  Amanda is the hottie honey Bryce just met and invited to the Bahamas with him for a great island vacation.<br /><br />The set up is a plane crash in the ocean, a plane filled with bricks of cocaine.  This is the source of conflict in the movie--greed, drugs, money, guns, car chases, the usual fare.  While it's fairly predictable, the movie still has moments of suspense and intrigue and you will get caught up in the clearly drawn characters.<br /><br />Great underwater filming, a bit of an insider's look at how treasure hunting is done, a little bit of island lore history, and decent character sketches make this a pretty good movie.  And of course, if you're the target market, there's plenty more to enjoy.<br /><br />Into the Blue is definitely worth a rental.  I give it a solid 3.5 stars.  1 hour 45 minutes running time.  Extras on the DVD include interviews with the cast and crew.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Most would probably agree that their interpretation of Josh Whedon isn't all that great. I found myself along these same lines mainly because of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Slayer and Angel and I've never considered myself a fan of his work. While I had watched Buffy on more than one occassion it was mainly due to the fact that there was nothing else on at the time so I watched it during those offbeat times. <br /> <br />Then, when Firefly aired, I had caught an episode or two and soon stopped watching it for various reasons but I think the main reason was because it didn't hold my attention at the time. When the series was announced to be coming out as a DVD Boxed Set I was like okay, I think I'll pick this one up and considering that the price at the time, $34.99, was more than enough of a reason to check out this series. After watching the first episode, I soon remembered watching this series on television and sat through all 15 episodes of this set. I soon became enamored with this series and quickly wondered why this show hasn't been brought back by the powers that be. <br /> <br />Recently, Universal Studios just released the movie Serenity, the big screen adaption of the television series which served to wrap up the lingering plotlines that were left open in the television series and served as a finale tribute to the short-lived television series. Even if there were no more Firefly projects in the works it was nice to return for a visitto this wonderful universe of characters. <br /> <br />Josh Whedon's direction for this series is plainly evident in these epsiodes that accompany this wonderful set and considering the multitudes of science fiction that is available this is one of those very rare science fiction shows that actually fares a lot better than Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Andromeda and the like. The writing for these characters in Firefly actually is so well written and well acted that you can't help but fall in love withthe characters that take you along for their adventures. <br /> <br />It's just a shame that not many science fiction fans have discovered this series just yet. There are some episodes that are quite amusing and the writing of some of the episodes is so well done that it's believable and doesn't leave you shaking your head and wondering how the shows writers can defy the laws of gravity or physics. Evertything about this show doesn't leave you feeling like you can't feel for these characters or what they are going through. <br /> <br />If you get the chance, you really should check out this series. I'm a hard fan to satisfy, especially when it comes to science fiction, but this series really needs to be experienced in its entirety before coming to a final judgement call on the show. <br /> <br />The western theme of the series did die out after the sixth episode, mainly due to the studios concern with Josh Whedon and the deviation away from the western theme also seemed to make the acting a lot better as well.
0452282152|5.0|This story is about a girl coming of age in 1664 and dealing with the struggles. She takes a job as a maid in an ever growing home to support her mother, blind father and siblings. Much of the book deals with Griet, the main character, adapting to life as a maid and also being overwhelmed by the life of the father, a painter. Being an artist myself I could relate to how Griet was feeling for example when she was mixing the colors and how she began to look at things differently. Griet endures many struggles while becoming a young woman, with her family and also with a young man pursuing her. This book contains simple sentences that are very literal which make it easy to understand. Being able to relate to this book like I did, I was able to enjoy it a great deal and could not put down the book near the end, it just flew by.
0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer wrote the book \\"Into the Wild\\" and in my opinion did a great job explaining the life of Chris McCandless. McCandless grew up with ideal living conditions in a nice suburb of Washington D.C. His parents had money, his dad was an engineer. He got great grades and was a popular student along with being a great athlete. So what drove this young man into doing the things that he did? That is what you will find out in this book. Krakauer does extensive research on both McCandless's childhood and after he deserted his family. He ventures into the journey McCandless took and provides astonishing details that occurred along the way. McCandless abandoned both his family and life savings. He graduated from college with honors and gave away thousands of dollars to a charity. He then took his car and began traveling as a tramp. In the book you will learn about the people that he touched and encountered along the way. At one point he even ditched his car and began tramping by foot. There are numerous side plots in the story in which you will find out fascinating things the McCandless did. He had a number of odd jobs and traveled to many states and even out of the country. At one point along the way he decides that he is going to journey across through Alaska during the winter and live off the land. As all of you know Chris McCandless did not come out of that Alaskan wilderness alive but the way he got there was truly an amazing story. At the beginning of the book I thought that McCandless was and idiot for leaving what so many will never have and that he was just being ignorant. As the book went on I found myself gaining more and more respect for Chris and what he stood for. Now Krakauer does not answer the question of why McCandless did what he did, but that is a question that no one can answer. To hate and bad mouth McCandless for doing with his life what he wanted is absurd, because even if you don't agree with it, it was his life not yours.
B00005JO04|4.0|This films has several real strengths and thus is very suspenceful and thoughtful. I found two major strengths to the film, the method of allowing multiple story lines to develop and converge gradually while withholding information from the viewer so that the viewer is continually trying to figure out the plot. I will discuss those two strengths below and then I will end this review with a discussion of the weakest link in the chain, which is some of the conceptualization around the role of the United States in the international arena and the means by which US agencies will ensure that the US corporate interests are protected. <br /> <br />First, the film used the technique of truncating activities and  dialogue that would clue the viewer into the full scheme or plot of the film. For example, banker Christopher Plummer asks the youngest son of an Arabian state what he 'wants'. We never hear the answer. Only later do we learn that he wishes to be king which means disposal of his older brother. Thus the viewer must be on their toes during the entire film, trying to piece together the various plot lines of the film. <br /> <br />Second, the acting was superb with wonderful performances by Clooney who does a wonderful job of gradually becoming enraged by his employer - the CIA, Alexander Siggig as the idealistic and realistic eldest son of the Arabian king wishing to break from US influence over his father and his country, Jeffrey Wright as a lawyer investigating his own client's from the outside to determine if the Justice Department can uncover wrong doing in the major oil industries, Chris Cooper as an outspoken Texas Oil man, Christopher Plummer as the senior partner of a powerful Washington law firm that actually tells the CIA whom to assasinate, and Matt Damon as a stock specialist who befriends the young Arabian Prince and begins to serve as his financial advisor.  <br /> <br />However a carefully written and directed script and a great cast of actors does not necessarily make this a great film (a score of 5). The film is based on the premise that world wide petroleum supplies are drying up at a time when the Chinese demand for oil is increasing exponentially (which is true). Thus, it is in the best interest for the United States to control oil producing countries at all costs so that oil continues to flow to the USA un-interrupted (maybe true). Major oil corporations thus are able to command considerable political power and are able to influence the governement agencies to support their business enterprise (probably true). Therefore, when an Arab Prince decides to sign a contract with the Chinese for sale of oil and to cancel contracts with US defense contractors for overpriced weapons systems, the CIA actually asasinates this Prince at the bidding of the US oil giants as communicated through their power broker Washington attorney (very improbable and very doubtful). Of course the film is fiction and should be rated and reviewed as fiction, but many viewers may feel the film went one step too far when it indicates the CIA practices asasination at the request of the oil industry.  <br /> <br />Many entertaining aspects of the film rung very true - such as Hezbollah requiring approval of a CIA agent before they are allowed to operate in Lebannon as well as CIA bureaucrats practicing spin control when an agent is captured trying to asassinate an oil Prince. The most fascinating story line in the entire film was not the asasination story line which many reviewers found to be unrealistic, or the tragic Matt Damon storyline where his young son gets electrocuted at a swimming party, but rather the wonderful Jeffrey Wright storyline where an African American lawyer is asked to investigate the powerful clients of his law firm to find out the 'dirty laundry' before the US Justice Department finds any smoking guns. Wright not only finds the dirty laundry, but he negotiates giving up the unlucky small fry crooks with the Justice Department so that the major big boy corporate heads can continue to control world oil supplies with the assistance of US agencies for a gas guzzling nation of SUV drivers. <br /> <br />The far right will hate this film. The far left will love it. Whatever, it is thoughtful entertainment that does challenge the viewer to take a stand as to what they believe the role of the US should be in regard to protecting America's interest in oil consumption.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is a great album. The first song I heard from this album was their single, Bat Country. It's not the song itself that caught my attention but the guitar solos and crazy drumming just made me fell in love to the band. Every track in this album is perfect and it's not just a short 3 minutes long song. I never skip a track when listening to it. The guitar duo done very well in every track, they just done crazy guitar shredding and a lot of amazing guitar solos. The drumming is perfect and so do the bass (they really got a good bassist). I never listen to their past album, so I don't know much about their past work. M. Shadows's voice is unique. And who said that he didn't scream anymore?! There sure are some screaming in the song.  \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" and \\"Seize the Day\\" are the best track here (I rate it 20/10) and the others are cool too (10/10).
B000059Z8J|5.0|Ah, Christopher Reeves.  The best Superman, ever.  My family recently rewatched this movie and after twenty-seven years, it has stand the test of time as a quality movie.  Sure there are a few campy things, but then again we're talking about a comic book hero.  Genie Hackman and Ned Beatty were comic genius and it was just hard to believe Christopher Reeves was a newcomer in this film.  He had great comic timing and absolutely had a commanding presence.  Too bad  he was pretty much typed cast after this series, but to a whole generation, he is the one and only SUPERMAN.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard the concept of Wicked.  I was never a \\"Wizard of Oz\\" fan, however, I questioned how this would twist around the old classic.  But then I heard the music... <br /> <br />It didn't take me long to see the power behind the now hit musical.  I recieved the soundtrack for Christmas this year, and was blown away by not only the music, but by the pipes of Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel.  They are both incredibly talented singers and harmonize with each other so well that you can almost HEAR a bond between the two of them.  I had heard Chenoweth before in \\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\\" and in Disney's production of \\"Annie\\", but I was never all that impressed with her until now.  Her bubbly and decreasingly snobby impersonation of Galinda is nothing short of hilarious, but her voice is amazing as well.  Her voice communicates her character's emotion so that we can almost see what's happening onstage, even if we've never actually seen the stage production before.  \\"Popular\\", her leading song, makes me chuckle everytime, but it still has an amount of musical depth like all of the other songs. <br /> <br />However, the star vehicle of this soundtrack is none other than Idina Menzel.  Only one word can describe her voice...POWER.  The second half of Defying Gravity was the first part of this musical that I had ever heard, and that was all it took for me to put the CD on my Christmas list.  She can belt out notes like I've never heard before.  It only takes one listen of \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\", or \\"No Good Deed\\" see this.  Sometimes I'll just put the soundtrack in and listen to 30 seconds or so of one of her songs just to hear her sing.  Menzel's voice just has that extra ummph that you can feel in your very bones.   <br /> <br />Don't miss out on this exceptional production that will leave you stunned by the power, drama, and depth of Steven Schwartz's music.  It's like a cross between the Broadway of the 50's and the world of rock that we know today.  It's perfect for just about anyone who appriciates musicals.  You'd be crazy not to make it part of your collection.
0553801503|4.0|This was an excellent addition to the series. Although I was a bit disappointed not to read about all of the characters, I understand how Martin may have needed to split the story and fully address some characters while leaving others out until the next book; instead of partially addressing all of the characters. <br /> <br />One important point that readers should remember is that this is NOT a stand-alone book - it is part of a series and should be read and rated as such.  Martin artfully advanced the plot of several characters and gave us a well-rounded picture of the events surrounding these characters.  He left readers wanting more. <br /> <br />When I read these books by Martin, I read the complete story for Each character separately.  I tend to pick the character that a feel is most interesting first, and then continue in descending order.  While I was reading I realized that ALL of the characters and storylines are both interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful read and a great addition to the series. <br />
006054094X|5.0|This book, as one may well gueess from its status as a bestseller, is a riproaring triumph. It is a detective story, travelogue, and history book rolled into one, and is as beautifully crafted as one would expect from a man who has spent many years of his life putting it together. <br /> <br />Let's cut to the chase; the claim that Menzies makes - that the Chinese treasure fleets of 1421 discovered the Americas, Antarctica, Australia, and New Zealand long before any Europeans - is one which ruffles many feathers. Menzies argues that Colombus, Da Gama, Magellan, and Cook all followed in the wake of these Chinese discoveries, and in almost all cases, relied upon Chinese navigational and cartographic knowledge. This argument is no doubt controversial, and if this book is as widely read and accepted as it ought to be, there will soon be piles of history books all over the world which need to be replaced. <br /> <br />Menzies has mounds of evidence to support his claims, and that evidence is explained and discussed in this book with great clarity and intelligence. He argues that the clues left by the Chinese fleets take the form of porcelain, plants, animals, buildings, wrecked ships, and most conclusively, people. The author ties this evidence together and reconstructs the threads of the Chinese voyages with great mastery. Perhaps most impressive is the sheer volume of reading and research which Menzies has done in order to get to the point of publishing this book. <br /> <br />1421 is an important book, and one which is made accessible to all through Menzies' easy narrative style. It is difficult, in the face of the evidence which Menzies presents, to see the history of exploration in the same light after reading this book. At the most, 1421 has begun the process of rewriting history, and at the least, it poses important questions which ought to be explored elsewhere in more depth. Read this book, and decide for yourselves. Even if you do not agree with the conclusionsposited in 1421, you will go away knowing that you have still read a first class work.
B000002U94|5.0|This later Bob Seger record/cd could be remastered. As one reviewer noted, it could also be 2 discs. The same thing needs to happen with the \\"expanded\\" Nobody's Perfect, by Deep Purple, which had to edit Child In Time, to allow for inclusion of previously omitted tracks, and how an import version of Jethro Tull's Bursting Out, has more tracks than the single disc version. Record companies must think fans might not shell out money (to get the same as their old albums, but some, myself included, would) to get the \\"full\\" recording. Thank God for import and independent reissue labels. Another live record/cd that got short shrift from Capitol was Live After Death, Iron Maiden, as the whole of side four didn't see the light of day on American shores until it got reissued. What gives?  Sorry for the asides but this recording is a fine example of Bob's work live.
B0000020C4|5.0|INCREDIBLE.  AMAZING.  STUNNING.  POWERFUL.  The list goes on.  Widely accepted as the greatest musical of all time, Les Miserables is more than a musical.  It is a story full of beauty, richness, and passion.  It has every sort of human emotion you can think of expertly written into an megahit of a production.  This recording is what Les Miserables was meant to be.  With a star studded cast, a 200 voice choir, and a full orchestra, the Tenth Anniversary Recording brings the musical to new heights.   <br /> <br />\\"The Dream Cast\\" is given title to the incredible group of individuals who perform in this version.  Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean from the West End, once again plays the part of the escaped convict.  Though his voice sounds less youthful than in the Original London Cast, his still plays the part with the same passion that we have come to love.  He sings what I believe to be the best version of 'Bring Him Home', sustaining an incredibly long and in-tune note at the end.   <br /> <br />Though he's not the original, Philip Quast is by far THE Javert.  His voice has so much depth and power that pulls you in and doesn't let go.  He is simply one of my favorite voices in musical theatre.  'Stars' and 'Javert's Suicide' are the best I have heard them sung. <br /> <br />Ruthie Henshall steals the show as Fantine.  I listen to this recording just for her voice.  I can't say I've ever heard a bad Fantine, but Henshall takes the vocals to the next level.  Her voice often sounds erethral and heavenly, especially in 'Come to Me'.  Her duet with Eponine (Lea Salonga) in the end scene sends shivers down my spine. <br /> <br />Lea Salonga, while not my favorite Eponine, is argued by many to be the best Eponine of all time.  Eponine's tragic character has that extra spunk that captivates many of us, making her the most loved character in Les Mis.  Salonga captures her spirit so well with her more than powerful voice.  Her version of 'On My Own' blows me away. <br /> <br />Alun Armstrong and Jennifer Gallaway pull off a HILARIOUS Thenadier couple.  They are by far the best suited for the role. <br />\\"Master of the House\\" actually recieves the longest applause, other than the finale. <br /> <br />Micheal Ball once again portrays the Marius that we know and love.  Ball plays Marius on all of the english Les Mis other than the Broadway version, making him to me and other, THE Marius.  He has an incredibly strong voice and steals the second act with his haunting version of 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a recording of the entire show, get the Complete Symphonic Recording (this one doesn't quite have all of it), but otherwise, this should be the first Les Mis recording on your list.  Don't miss out on what truly is the most amazing musical of all time.

0140177396|5.0|First published in 1937, this masterpiece of the Twentieth Century still resonates strongly today. The book is ostensibly the story of two men's friendship, but the themes which Steinbeck explores extend much further than is normal for a book of only one hundred or so pages. Hope, fear, love, justice, and friendship are all touched upon by Steinbeck's flowing prose. In addition, Steinbeck touches upon subjects which still impact on modern society to this day; racism and sexism. The book is also interesting for its representation of agricultural life in 1930s California. <br /> <br />The story offers the reader a fly on the wall's perspective as the two main protagonists, George and Lennie, take up their new jobs on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley. George is small and quick-witted, while Lennie is large and simple-minded. George tries his best to look after Lennie and to keep him out of harm's way and Lennie rewards him with loyalty. In the end though, George is unsuccessful in his attempts at helping Lennie avoid trouble and Steinbeck leaves it up to the reader to consider the consequences of this failure. <br /> <br />In 'Of Mice and Men' Steinbeck experiments with a genre of his own creation; the play / novelette. With this knowledge in mind, the book takes on a different aspect and the descriptions and dialogues appear to have been written with the stage in mind. This is just one example of how Steinbeck's mastery of literature becomes apparent upon reading this book. <br /> <br />This book deserves to be read; for Steinbeck's hard-hitting prose and his use of realistic dialogue, and also for his classic exploration of what friendship means.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's 1991 self-titled album is far from under-rated. This album produced Metallica's first ever #1 album on Billboard 200 albums and topped the Canadian chart. #1 single in Enter Sandman on the Canadian charts and #1 video on Muchmusic.  Metallica's Enter Sandman is one of the best songs recorded by the group and they delivered with this album.  This album was worth the wait in 1991.  This album has other great songs: The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters, Don't Tread On Me and finally Sad But True.  Dave Mustaine thought his Countdown to Extinction was the metal masterpiece in the 90s but not that's not the case.  It was Metallica.  Metallica always delivers. <br /> <br />Metallica produced one of the best albums of all-time with the Black album.  This is a masterpiece!! <br /> <br />Under-rated? Not a chance. <br />

0698119347|4.0|In this action packed novel, Alex Rider is thrown into a life that most people only dream about.  Alex is told that his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, was killed in a car accident.  He gets suspicious when they tell him that he was not wearing his seat belt because Ian always was careful about everything especially wearing his seat belt.   After finding his uncles car with bullet holes in it, Alex discovers that he didn't work for a bank after all, he was a special agent for the MI6.  After only two weeks of training, they send him, posing as a computer geek who has won the competition to try out the first Stormbreaker revolutionary super computer, to pick up where his uncle left off.  His task... to find out what is going on at Sayle Enterprises, and stop the new Stormbreakers from being spread across the country.  Equipped with only some seemingly harmless supplies (such as zit cream that eats metal, a game boy that can scan, fax, emit smoke, or see through walls), Alex is shipped of to port talon.  Along his journey he meets many people such as an ex-circus knife catcher with scares from an accident and a professional hit man named Yassen Gregorovich.  Alex finds clues left by his uncle to help him find out what he already knew.  Once the people at Sayle Enterprises found out what he was really up to, they tried to get rid of him.  Alex is chased across a field by two security guards on ATVs and thrown into a large tank with a Portuguese man-of-war.  The action in this book is brought out even better by the author's great detail.  You will love this action filled, spy novel that answers all the questions of, \\"what would James Bond have been like as a teen?\\"

This is a great book.
078324228X|5.0|I was very touched by this movie.  It was not the actual story/plot, or it's accuracy that was important to me.  Rather, what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal Transcendence the main character brings about in his life--from rage, hate, and bitterness, to self caring, willingness to learning, inner directedness, to a sense of spirituality and something \\"bigger than himself,\\" to forgiveness and \\"letting go,\\" and then the untimate Transcendence--reaching out, risking trusting others with his core pain, and risking loving others.  Also, this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles, determination to care about \\"the individual\\" and to rectifying an injustice.  I do not know whether or not Rubin Carter murdered those people.  From my stand point, this is a movie that models personal healing.  It is touching and inspirational--even if it were to turn out to be total fiction.

020161622X|5.0|This book has a lot of good advice.  Here's some of my favorites:<br /><br />- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  So much unmaintainable code is written when you copy-n-paste stuff around.  The pragmatic programmer goes out of his way to minimize the amount of code, testing, and documentation that is duplicated.  I think if you take one thing away from this book...take this advice.<br /><br />- Design techniques, such as DBC (design-by-contract) that make sure that you define the pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants for each method or function you define.  This stuff is inherent in Eiffel, but he also talks about a Java library called iContract which accomplishes the same thing in Java.  Thinking about coding this way makes it easier to define tests and conveys to the caller the state the system should be in when the code is executed.<br /><br />- Know a scripting language.  A lot of programmers see PERL, Python or Ruby as something that sys admin's use.  However, these can be very powerful tools in your toolchest if you ever need to manipulate text, files, system resources, etc.<br /><br />- Minimize coupling.  I know we all know this...but it doesn't hurt to repeat it.

044022425X|5.0|In this continuation of the story of Jamie Fraser and his wife, part of the story shifts to the romance of their daughter Brianna.  Brianna not only looks like her father, but is also strong willed and determined, but so is Roger who loves her and follows her back in time to the 18th century colony of North Carolina.  Jamie shows his flaws by his constant jumping to the wrong conclusions, violence, and mistreatment of Roger.  Roger suffers not only at the hands of Jamie, but also at the hands of the Indians that Jamie sells him to.  Roger stays with Brianna despite the violent arrogance of her father, Jamie, which would have discouraged most people!  I also found Claire to be disappointing in this book, as she doesn't try to curb Jamie's violence and his mistreatment of Roger.  I found myself angry at Jamie and unable to undertand how Claire could not stand up to him.   <br />This book keeps your attention to the end, and I enjoyed every minute despite the disppointments I had with the characters of Jamie and Claire.  It points to the fact that all people have weaknesses, and sooner or later Jamie & Claire's were bound to erupt. <br />
B000002HMH|5.0|First off, this is not Master of Puppets.  It's not ...And Justice for All.  It's not even the Black Album.  Load is a different entity.  It is an eclectic mix of rock music, ranging from bluesy rock to southern boogie rock.  Load is my favorite Metallica studio album.  Other than \\"Ronnie\\", there isn't a song I skip over.  If you can handle change and evolution from Metallica, you'll probably like this.  If you expect Master of Puppets over and over, forget it.  Personal favorites are \\"Until it Sleeps\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Hero of the Day\\", \\"Cure\\", \\"Mama Said\\", and \\"Thorn Within\\".  If you like Load, try ReLoad as well.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Buckingham's still Brillant.  Why isn't the title of the CD \\"What's the World Coming To\\" or \\"Peace Keeper?\\" It's because despite the fact that Lindsey's material on this LP is far superior to Stevie's, she is the one with the cult following.  Don't get me wrong.  In her day, Nicks was an incredible singer and songwriter.  But, can one imagine \\"Rhiannon\\" or \\"Landslide\\" without Lindsey's guitar work?  Hard to do.  All you Stevie fans can chill out as I love Stevie's old stuff (I even own her first three solo LP's and once upon a time I was a huge fan, o.k.?) but her songs on this LP don't cut it and her voice ain't what it use to be.  However, \\"Say You Will\\" is a pretty good tune.  Unfortunately, Buckingham hasn't contributed much to Nick's tunes on this LP either. I bet Lindsey was inspired to write a few of these songs after 9/11.  His new songs are somber and speak to the world we are living in, he moans, \\"They all explode just the same...everyone must suffer the price we've paid.\\"  He even has something to say about the lame press coverage \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave.\\" Very moody and thought provoking work.Intriguing. Interesting, his guitar work is surprisingly basic on some songs...I wonder if he's trying to keep it simple so that he can fit in with today's alternative (beginner)players. He underplays on many songs...and yet it works.  He does show off his guitar virtuosity on a few songs \\"Murrow,\\" \\"Miranda,\\" and the mean spirited \\"Come.\\"  <br />Really!  This should have been a Lindsey Buckingham solo cd.  But I forgive him because everyone needs a little money. LOL.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|\\"Lord of War\\" --in my humble opinion-- is an Americanized and fictionalized biography of the notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout (the real \\"death merchant\\") who literally \\"made a killing\\" since the fall of the Soviet Union selling weapons to pretty much anyone who could pay for them.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" --when it sticks to the gunrunning-- is an excellent movie.  It does a particularly fine job demonstrating what people like Victor Bout made possible in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone (think \\"Lord of the Flies\\" in Africa).  Some of the vignettes are priceless like when Yuri (the character played by Nicolas Cage) evades having a freighter of his laden with contraband seized the authorities through a hastily improvised deception.  Another great moment is when we get to see happens to valuable property like cargo planes when they are left unattended in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone (think \\"chop shop\\" on an epic scale).<br /><br />The movie does have some problems with it that prevent me from giving it five stars:<br /><br />-The plotline involving Yuri's wife is pretty unbelievable.  If you are married to someone like Victor Bout for a long period of time and you profess to be oblivious to his business, you're either lying, being willfully blind, or are too stupid to live.<br /><br />-The idea that after Yuri had been indicted and arrested (and a trailer full of incriminating evidence seized as well), he could be sprung from jail by some shadowy US Army officer is ludicrous.  How do I know this?  Because, I did a study on another one of nature's noblemen Manuel Noriega some years back.  Even though he was once very useful to the US and in the pay of the CIA, once he was indicted for drug trafficking, it became impossible for the US to use him as proxie.  The same thing would apply in Yuri's case.  Once he was indicted, I'm sure that anyone who was making use of him would have dropped him like a hot potatoe.<br /><br />My final beef with the movie is the text that comes on the screen right before the credits role.  The words tell us --quite accurately-- that the world's biggest sellers of arms are the US and the other permanent members of the Security Council.<br /><br />That is very true, but what the movie doesn't tell the viewer is that the nature of US and British arms sales tends to be things like ships, planes, guided missiles, and other high-tech toys.  These items aren't the tools of atrocities like those committed in Sierra Leone and Liberia in the late 1990s.  Those things --AK-47s, machine-guns, are the items in Victor Bout's product line.  Lumping sales of weapons to countries at peace with themselves and their neighbors in with criminal sales of \\"gear\\" to people like Charles Tailor of Liberia and the hand-chopping \\"RUF\\" of Sierra Leone is completely unfair and is a gross distortion of the facts.ght before the credits role.

0765309408|4.0|Many people have compared this book to \\"Starship Troopers\\", which I can't truthfully do, since I've neither seen nor read it.  I can compare it to \\"Forever War\\"by Joe Haldeman-and quite favorably. But it's not a clone by any means.  John Scalzi's futuristic soldiers have their own problems and worries. The idea of an \\"elderly\\" army just makes sense.  Why wouldn't you want to take advantage of their intelligence and experience? But as the author points out, sometimes age doesn't always bring that.  There are still a few diddlyboobs in the pack.  There's an interesting collection of characters with very opposing viewpoints.  <br /> <br />This novel is full of cool ideas, from the \\"skp drive\\", to the green bodies, etc. etc.  The aliens are a lot of fun, considering they're always trying to kill you.  An ally or two might be nice to see. <br /> <br />True-the story's plausibility button gets pushed a few times for dramatic effect.  I mean, come on, of all the soldiers in all the units, John Perry survives a massacre and THEN gets rescued by...er...she-who-must-not-be-named? I don't want to provide a spoiler! Didn't didn't we all see that plot point from a mile off?  It didn't stop me from reading. Great effort! <br /> <br />I'll definitely be reading the sequel.
0307276902|2.0|I got this book for Christmas on request, and read it shortly after.  It kept me up nights, unable to put it down.  The sheer intensity of the author's experiences, and the ways in which he works to get past his troubles are inspiring and thought provoking. <br /> <br />A few days after I finished I read the smoking gun website and the NY Times article about the significant falsehoods in the book.  While the author used to say it was all true he is now saying it is embellished.  If you read the evidence, you'll find that important and significant plot points are likely totally fabricated (or at the least, wildly embellished). <br /> <br />As a reader of this book before this evidence was revealed, I found that the book was most appealing because of its supposed truth.  That the author made it through what he writes about is what keeps one reading the book.  But if I had known it was fiction?  Not so interesting and I doubt I would have read it at all.  It just isn't the same thing. <br /> <br />This book may be fine for those who know it is fiction before they read it.  But as one who got duped, let me tell you--it was a major letdown, and I now wish I hadn't wasted my time reading the work.  I have lost faith in Oprah as well, as she has failed to respond other than to support the book regardless.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|You know, I've never really thought of the Strokes as pushing the boundaries of music.  I've always placed them more so in the quality bin of my music collection.  This CD like their previous two is top notch with great quality pop songs.  Nothing new, nothing pushed, just good old fashioned sing alongs.  I kinda like that fact that this is their third release and I still dig them.  The first two songs \\"You only live once\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" are great numbers.  \\"On the otherside\\" is fantastic.  One of my favorite Strokes songs.  \\"Electriccityscape's\\" chorus \\"Change your mind...\\" is wonderful.  The vocals are way more in the front of the mixes this time around.  The overall mixing is much more straight forward.  I think the first two albums sometimes compressed the hell out of everything, and the sounds bounced of each other to much.  Everything here is given ample space to breath.  So, yeah, I have to say I like the album.  Maybe you will too.

068987474X|5.0|I first picked up this book because I thought the title was amusing. But when I read the first page, I realized I would get a lot more out of this book than amusement. I would learn a lesson, a life lesson, which not every woman wants to wake up and realize. \\"He's just not that into you.\\"  <br /> I'm sure we have all dealt with our own handful of \\"dating excuses;\\" \\"maybe he doesn't want to ruin the friendship.\\" \\"He just got out of a very serious relationship.\\" \\"Maybe he's afraid to get hurt again.\\" \\"Maybe he lost my number.\\" But in reality, the only \\"maybe\\" you should be thinking about is, \\"maybe he's just not that into me,\\" and this book is an excellent way to help you realize that.  <br /> The format of this book is appealing, it is written in letter format. Many women write \\"Dear Greg,\\" letters telling him about their dating problems, filled with excuses of why they think they shouldn't totally give up hope yet. But Greg always seems to reply to their letters with the first sentence always being \\"he's just not that into you,\\" and then further explains why he thinks so. <br /> You may think that some of the stories in this book are far from normal, but I'm sure you can find at least a few that hit right at home. I mean, I'm sure we have all had a crush on a friend at one time or another, and this is just the book to tell you why it didn't work out.  <br /> Not only is this a book to help women get over men who take no interest in them, but its also a book that keeps you from wasting your time with someone like that; and furthermore sets you on the correct path to a happy life with Mr. Right! <br />
1574535676|5.0|I posted a review on Psychology of Achievement about this CD and so I won't be too redundant here.  In that post I mentioned that I had quit college and went to work and that I had been a great listener of rock music and TV, even as a child.  I failed to mention that I became a smoker, a drinker and eventually ended up homeless and I attribute that, in part, to what I was putting into my mind, and what I was making my mind do, that was benefitting someone else and not me or my personal life.  I was waging a battle in my mind as my father had taught me to read only educational stuff, but I rebelled and ended up on the streets penniless.  I read educational stuff but not to the extent that I had watched TV or listened to music.  They were my priorities.  Getting the latest music CD was a must or seeing the latest Drama was my goal.  You can see how it paid off.   <br /> <br />I finally got a copy of Psychology of Achievement and I realized immediately what I had been missing when I quit college (my father died my freshman year), I needed that coaching and we all can benefit from some kind of coaching in whatever we do.  You don't have to be in business or a salesman to listen to these ideas, you can apply them to your personal life.  I also purchased, Psychocybernetics by Maxwell Maltz, but unfortunately this has not been availale in audio, it should be and I think it is an excellent book to use in conjunction with Tracy's works.
B000A6T262|5.0|The Star Trek movie myth has it that only the even numbered Trek films are successful. This isn't a bad rule of thumb when dissecting the rank of these movies.<br /><br />The first \\"motion picture\\" is a chiefly a milestone because it is the big screen translation of a classic piece of TV and Science-fiction history (I think about the life imitating art contributions every time I flip open my cel). As a movie alone, it is awkward. Star Trek II> The Wrath of Khan, best sets the bar for what all Star Trek features aspire to be. It has it all, including Ricardo. Star Trek III, is the best of the odd #s, but it works so seamlessly with II. and IV. that it's hard to complain, the Klingons return, Spock returns, what could be better. Star Trek IV., a lighter even number, features the crew's return to save the Earth, time-traveling to the present/80's, it's kinda Star Trek's take on SAVING THE WHALES.  Star Trek V. is mostly forgettable, except for a few beautiful and moving moments of brilliance, like: \\"the death of  Bone's father, meeting God and Campfire songs w/ Kirk & Spock.  Star Trek VI., subtitled \\"The Uncovered Apology\\" (just kidding) is a fine wrap-up for the original crew dispite it plot holes.  Star Trek Generations, is a poor introduction to the next generation of the Enterprise, it has Kirk's \\"Death(s)\\" in it, I wish they had stopped after one. The Next Gen. Character's are very cardboard in this-one, watered down for anyone new to the TV spin-off. Star Trek:First Contact may be the best of all Ten movies, it reintroduces the Borg menace with a intense roller-coaster ride. The odd-numbered follow-up, Star Trek Insurrection, earns it's number, while the even-numbered Star Trek: Nemesis ( or X.) is a decent action-flick with a clone captain that would have be more interesting as evil twin.<br /><br />UNLESS YOU WANT DIRECTOR'S EDITIONS OF ALL 10 MOVIES, THIS SET IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL CREW SET, THE NEXT GEN.

However, one thing does bug me a little bit. In the first book in this collection, there is a strip where Calvin askes his mom if he was adopted, if he will be forced to work in a cannery when he turns 7, and if he's being fattened up to be eaten. Well, in this collection, the adoption question is edited and becomes \\"Was I genetically engineered or cloned?\\" Did Bill Watterson get so much flak from the adoption people about comparing adoption to slavery and cannibalism that he had to change the strip? I wonder if that was the only strip that was changed. Still, this is a great collection of comics.
0307276902|1.0|What a jerk!!! An obvious liar and braggard.  He does a great disservice to people in recovery.  At one point in the book he rails against a rock star  who exagerates his drug and alcohol abuse and says   \\"The truth is all that matters. This is f***ing heresey.\\"  At another point he is offended by someone's bragging and thinks, \\"Bobby, like all Liars confronted, is instantly defensive and instantly mad.\\"   The worst of his offenses is his appalling prose  style. Puerile, repetitive, stupid, clumsy...  He actually writes \\"I turned and I walked away and my legs were shaking like jelly with each step down the stairs.\\" And this guy says he wants to be the greatest writer of his generation.  Heaven help us!!!
B00005MCX3|3.0|I am an old fan of spacey music.  My roots are in heavy classic material but I have very much ventured out to ambient, jazz, space rock and many other types.  I love Ozric Tentacles and Porcupine Tree when in the Psych/Spacey mode.  Hawkwind seem to be a staple of spacey hard driving music based on reviews and their popularity.  I need to know why this album is one of their top sellers.  I bought it but don't see the magic in this.  This is average garage burnout music (I should know, I'm one of the burnouts).  I find it generally pleasing and do play it from time to time but nothing here that strikes me.  Someone please recommend where to go in the Hawkwind collection to experience the greatness that is cast upon this band.  I'm ready.  I'm willing .. but not getting it thus far.
1400031087|1.0|I dont understand why the issue of fact or fiction plays a role in how this novel is received: it's just bad writing.  No wonder the book would never have been published as fiction, but to me, even factual overtones cannot redeem the painful, jerky melodramatic style in which this book is written.   <br /> <br />Addiction is bad, sure.  Most people develop and overcome a fixation at some point in life.  Most people do NOT develop a complex about being a big, bad criminal for doing a few petty, rebellious, childish things.  People with far more sordid pasts, with much harder lives, people who could NEVER have afforded a fancy treatment center to kick more chonic addictions than Frey's would also NEVER be the people lamenting over just how awful and low and vulgar they had been.  This sort of circumspect acceptance of being a 'Criminal' seems to me rather contrary to what one really is.   <br /> <br />For Frey, the most disturbing revelation of all was realizing he was ordinary and normal and blessed.  Dire straits for a rebellious kid who wants to think the world is out to get him and fate is turned against him.  To attempt to obliterate normalcy and the potential for satisfaction is the most pathetic excuse for this sort of lashing out at society.  People like Frey think happiness and satisfaction are like everything else they've gotten in life: automatic.  And that despite their best attempts to resist what are in fact privileges like education and rehab centers, they still come out average.   <br /> <br />If youre unhappy, the real thing missing from your life is misery.  True misery.  Not this sort of childish defiance toward nothing.  It's a matter of perspective, of which Frey has little.   <br /> <br />This genre is overdone, overplayed, and overhyped.  Look at Fight Club.   <br />Lastly, I find it very Ironic that Frey likens himself to Hemingway and Fitzgerald.   <br />Content aside, the writing style is just not in that league.  It's pedestrian and lackluster and jagged.  The best prose is also somehow poetic.  There was nothing poetic in this book.
B000022TSH|5.0|\\"chinatown\\" is a damn fine film.  it is among my favorite movies, but i'll qualify that a bit and say that it didn't really blow me away the first time. <br /> <br />it's strange to say, but for a film with an angular faye as femme fatale, a salty and zoot-suited nicholson, a convoluted plot design, virtuoso direction, some kinetic physical violence and a dash of sordid sexual tabbooed subject matter is actually a bit on the SUBTLE side.  something about the pacing and the washed out dull browns and pale yellows gives the film an uncharactoristic languid feel for a whodunit. <br /> <br />that said, i watched it a second time about a year or two later and it was a revelation.  i was thrilled at every line and twist and marvelled at the 1930s fantasy of the sets and outfits.  when approached with patience, \\"chinatown\\" is full of details, nuanced moments and dark existential energy. <br /> <br />this movie operates on many levels.  one obvious level is a modern homage to film noir, even using john huston as a primary charactor.  noir classics such as a private dick in over his head, a conspiracy that goes all the way to the top, a femme fatale, bad guys, angst...the whole kaboodle, you get the idea.   <br /> <br />however at another level the noir is updated and given a more 70s type psychedelic sophistication and polanski's stamp of nihilistic absurdism. every charactor is given more nuance and breathing room then in typical treatments.  for instance, faye's evelyn becomes more fragile and less \\"fatale\\" with every scene she's in.  her beauty also takes on an odd charactor, as a friend pointed out to me, she almost starts to appear as grotesque by the end, and her final revelation to gittes (nicholson) is overwhelmingly grotesque, making the admission not nearly as surprising as it could be, because you are sensing the depth of her disaster long before it is brought in full light. <br /> <br />combined with the overall richness of the personalities and the constant snapiness of the dialogue is the unmistakable goofy and very dark touches of polanski.  i am a huge admirer of his, and he puts his mark fully in this picture, including of course his infamous cameo with the knife.  among my favorite \\"polanski\\" moments in the film are the many inept fighting sequences in which gittes is made to look like somewhat of a clown whose bark can not defend his bite. that gittes spends fifty percent of his screen time with a silly looking nose bandage adds to his folly.  additionallly the ending sequence in the street of chinatown polanski has several charactors who are hand-cuffed together limping in tandem vaudeville-style to see what the result of gun fire is.  i feel that this is classic polanski because we know that something horrible has happended, yet before we get confimation of this we are forced to see an obviously goofy lampoon.  the mix of the deadly serious and negative with a sharp and humorous bite is a very endearing and brilliant charactor of polanski's best work.  (see \\"rosmary's baby\\") <br /> <br />on a whole other larger layer this film seems to be about LA, and maybe about america generally and maybe about humans generally.  i don't know if it's so heavy-handed as all that, but nonetheless it does come very close to the true story of the double dealing involved in the origins of america's prototypical sprawl, the san fernando valley.  \\"chinatown\\" seems to hint not subtly at what lies inside of american utopianism.  an idea seemingly displayed in chinatown is this - \\"someone with power and money writes the book, then everybody goes along with it, believing it is bible.  then someone some time later rewrites the book for personal gain.  then, since no one can really remember what the book was supposed to say in the first place takes the rewritten book as the original.\\"  whistleblowers in this process, such as our private dick jake gittes protagonist, are squashed immediately and treated to a buffet of nasty humanity in the process.   <br /> <br />it's a film noir staple that is given a new level of cynical desperation.  but because the whole miasma is wrapped in a thoroughly stylish and entertaining package i didn't feel bummed out or turned off by the downbeat vibes and outcomes.   <br /> <br /> 70s film fans buy immediately.  it's cheap as far as dvds go too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me explain to you something about Firefly.  This is not for the fans, or for anyone who's seen a couple of the episodes. <br /> <br />This is for the people who have had no chance to know just how good this show is.  And to them I say: <br /> <br />This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen grace the small screen.  This is the show that was so good that, while it was airing, the fans raised thousands of dollars to take out a full page newspaper add thanking the creators and asking Fox to keep the show on the air.  That didn't happen.  Not everyone can understand, or want to. <br /> <br />This is the show that makes me laugh, and alternately cry.  It is realistic, and beautiful in the way that only things that are real and honest are. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon said it was about nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things.  It is also about the right to be free and independent. <br /> <br />The story is that a doctor breaks his sister out of a top secret government institution that has been torturing her.  They take refuge and run from the law on one Serenity, firefly class spaceship captained by Mal Reynolds, a verteran on the losing side (the independents) of a galactic civil war.  There are no aliens in this space western.  The reason that there are no aliens is because this show is about humanity, and all its problems, trials and tribulations.  Joss Whedon didn't see the need to throw aliens into the mix to 'create problems'. <br /> <br />The characters are standard fare: a preacher, hardass butt-kicking woman, pilot, captain, mechanic, burly ill-mannered hardass guy, crazy genuis butt-kicking girl (more of a Whedon thing), and companion (well-educated member of the world's olderst known profession, though more of a geisha).  The actors were exemplarily cast, and there is excellent chemistry between them.  And each gets their 'moment to shine' in which they become more than cliches.  <br /> <br />It's a damn shame that this wasn't given more of a chance to be a success like it could have been.  Like it should have been.  Even with the movie, there is so much untold story.  But I the avoidant of cliffhangers, who went into catatonic shock at the end of Gone With the Wind...I tell you that Firefly as it is, uncompleted, is more complete than a great many things, that just because it didn't get its proper run, is no reason not to watch.  If I valued gold, I would say that Firefly is like gold.  Instead I shall say that it is like books :)

0553801503|2.0|I love the series and the first three books were all excellent.  However, in Feast of Crows, Martin's writing is out of control.  Rather than offer the cop out that the book grew big enough to be two novels, Feast of Crows should have been edited with the same ruthlessness Martin showed the Starks in the series.  This book is encumbered by surplus characters and overburdened by pointless scenes.  Paring down the excess would reward faithful readers with a book in the same class as the first three instead half the novel in twice the words.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Compare this to any folk/traditional/rock masterpiece you've ever heard: <br />Blonde on Blonde <br />Beggars Banquet <br />Sweetheart of the Rodeo <br />Astral Weeks <br />Music from Big Pink <br />American Beauty <br />Etc...etc...etc! <br />This is every bit as good!!! <br />
0307276902|2.0|First off, in going through the reviews, it's interesting to see how the ratings have dropped since The Smoking Gun information came out.  Prior to that, it appears as though Frey was about to captivate nearly everyone reviewing this book.  I am *NOT* a fan of Oprah in the sense that I'm one of the few (apparently) that doesn't hang on her every word...so I was really going against my grain when I happened upon James Frey on her show...and after hearing his story, and how she and her staff extolled the virtues of this man and his book, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br />I am about 150 pages into it so far.  Even before The Smoking Gun, I was skeptical about its authenticity as a MEMOIR.  There have been so many points in only 1/3 of this book that leave me thinking, \\"come on!\\"  I don't doubt his addictions.  I don't doubt his recovery.  I do, however, doubt many of the details given.  The root canal et al is especially unbelievable.  I wonder where the dentist, the two accompanying nurses and other dentist are now and why they don't step forward to claim it as true.  I most assuredly don't believe that he was allowed on any commercial aircraft in the condition that sets off the opening scene in this book.  These are but a few things that don't ring true to me.  Coupled NOW with the facts that have been uncovered by The Smoking Gun really leave me shaking my head.  There is no way for him to explain himself to those inaccuracies without seriously damaging his credibility...which I think he has done. <br /> <br />While I believe the book has done alot to help others in similar situations, I think many people will now hold this as a fictional account.  Where will that put all those who trusted in him to help them \\"hold on?\\"  Who knows.  I do know I feel cheated.  I was drawn in by his story of horrendous addiction and subsequent recovery. Now I question whether he was as bad off as he writes.   <br /> <br />My last remaining gripe is his writingstyle.  I find his inappropriate capitalizations and repeating repeating repeating wording to be quite annoying.  The technique lost its impact with me early on as it was too much.  I feel let down by this book.  I bought it as a nonfiction.  I wanted to read nonfiction.  I believe it to be at best an extremely embellished account of a  guy who went through some unfortunate addictions.
0143034901|3.0|This could have been a great novel, but it just fell short.
0792839730|4.0|I believe in reviews that should tell fellow amazon.com buyer if a product is good.  This movie isn't bad, but it has limits. <br /> <br />This movie was made in 1977 and was the last major WWII movie until Saving Private Ryan, a movie that is both better and a lot worse. <br /> <br />What is good about A Bridge Too Far?  The cast is sterling!  You get Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliot Gould, Gene Hackman. Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neil, Robert Redford, Maximillian Schell, Liv Ullmann, and John Ratzenberger.  John Ratzenberger - who later on plays \\"Cliff\\" on Cheers - portrays a lieutenant under Robert Redford; it's amazing to see the change in people from movies of old. <br /> <br />Now, what is bad about A Bridge Too Far?  Well the producers of the movie could not get any German tanks, unlike the dozens of Shermans and M-3 half-tracks used in the film.  So the producers get one, count it - one - West German Army Leopard II prototype tank and used it as a Panzer.  At that time in Europe there were thousands of M60A1 tanks that could have been modified to resemble King Tiger tanks.  The Leopard II looks nothing like a WWII tank.  I guess its better than seeing an M-47 or M-48 with a cross painted on it.  However, if you enjoy military hardware then you really will not like the German armor because there isn't any. <br /> <br />There is a fair amount of German armored cars, such as the ubiquitous Sdkfz 223.  Most of these vehicles are merely British armored cars in drag.  But this was the beginning of the major effort to make military vehicles look like German vehicles.  These converted vehicles are used in the best scene in the movie, the attack on the British troops holding the bridge at Arnhem.  That part of the movie is worth two stars out of four. <br /> <br />One part of the movie I hated was showing the 101st Airborne.  Many military buffs will know what the 101st did at operation Market Garden.  There is a very weak part in the movie where a nervous captain confides to his sergeant, played by James Caan, that he is afraid of dying.  Then you read the books \\"Band of Brothers\\", the 101st Airborne series of books by Don Burgette, and \\"Biggest Brother, the life of Major Dick Winters\\" then you find that part of the movie is pretty much sheer bulk.  If you think for a second that Lieutenant Spears, Captain Winters, or Captain Heileiger would have drank a fifth of whiskey in front of a NCO then you're nuts.  Captain Nixon would have drank a fifth, but he was on the 506th Staff and never was around the enlisted men.  Anyway, the commander of the 506th was Colonel Sink.  Sink ran a pretty tight ship, would have fired a bad officer, and Elliot Gould does a poor job playing an airborne commander.  Colonel Sink was the guy who had the bridge in Holland blown up in front of him.   <br /> <br />The movie uses quite a few old aircraft.  The close support aircraft are old T-6 trainers dressed up to look like P-47s of WWII.  This was done in the old days before computer digital effects.  I would rather look at a real aircraft dressed up to resemble another aircraft.  Digital effects still look a little fake.   <br /> <br />The movie does not really communicate the hornet's nest XXXth Corps plows into going on the advance towards Arnhem.  For some reason the producer of the movies didn't show the effects of the German Panzerfaust, a rocket launcher that was used by the Russians for the basis of the RPG that is used by every terrorist group in the modern world.  The excellent German tanks and anti-tank guns did not knock out the majority of allied armor.  It was German soldiers shooting Panzerfausts at tanks that destroyed the majority of armor lost by the allied armor.   <br /> <br />Now the movies music score is from the 1970s.  This is the days of the rich orchestra music and the theme of the movie will stay in your heads for days.  The scenery of the movie is breathtaking.  You can tell the movie makers really got their money's worth from this movie. <br /> <br />Get this movie on discount and it goes pretty well in your video library.  It's a fairly good movie. You see a lot old movie stars, beautiful European countryside, and some great battles.  Yes, the movie has problems, like the fiction on the 101st airborne.  But it's not bad.   <br />
B00097DXZS|5.0|I got this CD from my daughter for Christmas, and I havent taken it out since. I think its even better than his last 2 cd's. I dont normally buy new CD's, but this is the best one I've heard in a while. Keep Rocking Santana!!!
5558765283|2.0|After the first three books in this series all of which I give 5 stars, A Feast for Crows was a tedious and almost painful read at times.  Some legitimate setup was necessary for the future but much of this book is boring filler about nothing. ( Seriously, WHO CARES what Alayne(Sansa) is going to wear for her ride down the mountain, whether her shoes fit or not,and who cares how many times little Robert spits up ?  He's fragile, we get it.) Mr Martin needs to win our respect and our interest back in A Dance with Dragons. He absolutely enraged us by killing off almost all of the Starks after getting us to love them in the first book.  Then of all things he has one of the finest swordsmen of all, Jamie Lannister, lose his sword hand. What ?!  That makes about as much sense as Stephen King making Roland the Gunslinger lose his right hand in the Dark Tower series.  A Feast for Crows could have been half as long. A Dance With Dragons needs to win back our respect and fevered interest.
B00005B5L4|5.0|I bought the DVD Audio version, created by Fleetwood Mac's old engineer Ken Caillat. He did an excellent job tweaking the songs, and the songs really shine in this format.  <br /> <br />As for the album itself, it does not sound dated, despite the fact that we've heard the songs on the radio for the past 30 years. Later Mac albums suffer from overproduction, which give them a definite '80s feel, but Rumours escaped this fate. Okay, the harmonies are a bit California '70s, but they're beautiful, so who cares? Heartfelt, authentic music so rarely made these days.
0307276902|2.0|Maybe this book would be better if it wasn't a pack of lies to make money.  Lack of integrity on the writer's part really ruins a work.
0307276902|1.0|Not only did James Frey misrepresent his past, which is bad enough, he told everyone on TV it was an honest account of his past. Memoirs don't have to be 100% true, but stretching a five hour stint in a small holding room to a three month stay in prison takes way too much liberty. Also I was not impressed with his trying to blame his publisher for designating it nonfiction. Who decided he would tell the world over and over again he was honest in the book?    Frey seemed to be writing a screenplay rather than a book when he penned this. I know his background is in screenplays and this really shows. Unfortunately, he has a tin ear for dialogue. \\"James, I would like you to be my son. From now on, I will introduce you as my son and you will be treated as such.\\" \\"Make us proud, kid.\\" I love you, Lilly. I love you, James.\\"    The repetitive style of the writing makes a lot of the words feel like filler. Don't buy this unless you really like repetition. For example: \\"I stared at the wall. the wall was white. I stared at it. I looked at my father. He stared at me. I looked at my mother. She was crying. She looked at my father then looked at me. I stared at her.\\" Ad nauseum.     The characters are so one-dimensional and you never understand exactly why or how he forms relationships in rehab. He rehashes conversations, but goes no deeper. He and Lilly have a couple of conversations and all of a sudden they're in love? That whole SHOW, don't TELL rule is thrown out the window.     Yes, he writes convincingly about his cravings. It is the only part of the book I believe. The rest - the characters, the conversations, his criminal record, the story about his jr. high school sweetheart, the Paris priest - sorry, but they are just so unbelievable.     Poorly written, and untrue.
B000002J03|5.0|If your a led zep fan you should by no doubt get this album. Its one of the most influential. Most bands around can trace their influences back to this album.  And i can definately see why.  From the moment you hear the opening riffs of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" your instantly and eternally hooked. The whole album rocks on and on until its over, and you have no choice but to listen to it again. At least thats how it was for me, you'll probably feel the same way.  At this point in my review youve probably already decided to go buy the album. Good! Enjoy the music and the power of ROCK.
B000001ES9|5.0|Despite it's naysayers 'Rush',the bands self titled debut album ROCKS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!Great stuff to put on with some Rolling Stones,Zeppelin or the first Aerosmith album.First things first EVERY SINGLE TUNE on this album rocks-\\"Finding My Way\\" gets the ball rolling.And like it or not John Rutsey cannot be said to be imitative of Neal Peart at all.His style is far more direct and simple.As on every Rush release the roaringly high screaming vocals of Geddy Lee and his drum like bass work bring the bottom to the front.While the long closer \\"Working Man\\" looks to a progressive rock future \\"Take A Friend\\",\\"Need Some Loving\\" and \\"Need Some Love\\" are all straight ahead rock n' roll without bluster.Sure there were more then a few albums like this but what seperates the good from the bad and the okay is individual vision and superior,catchy tune smithing.In Rush's case on this debut they have both in gigantic numbers.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Miller's Crossing is a considerable departure from any gangster movie I can think of. It's sometimes funny, it's not about the Italian mafia, and the dialogue is priceless. When I watch it I'm really curious to know if that's how the characters really spoke or if the Coens just made it up. Whatever the case, it's great to listen to. The story is a Coen staple, having the main character (the hero) bumble through the story with some truly close calls, but coming out relatively unscathed and seeming smart for it. Miller's Crossing should have come out on DVD long before it did because I think it's a classic. The Big Lebowski is my favorite Coen Brothers movie, but Miller's Crossing isn't too far behind.
0307276902|1.0|Anyone recall the old saying: \\"If you're caught lying about one thing, what else are you lying about?\\"   <br /> <br />Just  good old common sense. The evidence that was brought out is quite credible and there will be more to come--the thing that got me was the train wreck of the two teen girls (he knew neither of them as well as he states and had nothing to do with this incident). It is just too eerie to think Frey wedged himself into that real incident for dramatic effect. It's actually downright sleazy.  <br /> <br />After what has occurred this week, I know of no one who   would say : \\"You know... I think I'll read this book!\\" Especially after finding out his tough-guy persona & history is fake.  <br /> <br />No one in their right mind could read this now. It's over for Frey. No matter the new disclaimers--he keeps saying (along with Lady O) that it's the emotions that are real--well you know what? It's obvious to millions now that that's not true, either:  Frey comes off as a Casper Milquetoast of sorts with his Mom iby his side. He's well-mannered, soft spoken and Mom is happy to speak on his behalf. What we have is, really, a Jekyll & Hyde of sorts who is coming out with his alter personality on the page!  <br /> <br />The very success of this book happened ONLY because the premise was that we were getting the straight story about this guy's drug addicted life. <br /> <br />A far better read for your time and money? Try-- ANOTHER B*LLSH*T NIGHT IN SUCK CITY(a real memoir that deals with alcoholism, exquisitely written).  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002TQB|5.0|I had been eventually turned off by the posturing of Leisure and had given up Blur as being not very original, but when I heard Parklife when it was released I was immediately put in my place. These guys really were something else. They weren't singing about how there was no other way and telling you to just watch them play, but much more interesting observations on the drudgery of English life that seemed to actually be satirical instead of adolescent literality. Parklife is rock solid from start to finish and one of my favorite albums of the 90's. It absolutely deserves to be called a classic and should be so many years from now.
B000002L82|5.0|If you think \\"Blue Monday,\\" New Order's signature New Wave dance track, is the only song worthwhile on this 1983 release, you couldn't be more mistaken.  As I'm sitting here attempting to collect the necessary words to write this review, I hear wave upon wave of Gillian's magnificent synths in \\"Your Silent Face.\\"  With an album filled with songs of this high calibre, where can one go wrong?  I suppose I've got to say that POWER, CORRUPTION, & LIES is THE New Order album, my favourite out of the band's (currently) eight LPs.  While the others have their own charm and spirit, this one perfectly captures and blends the post-punk ethos of Joy Division with the new lease on life that is New Order--and it's the one I find myself drawn to the most whenever I feel the need to pop in a CD and enjoy some music.  Incessant, stacatto, almost militaristic beats courtesy of Stephen Morris and an assortment of drum machines icily pulse in the listener's ear while the aforementioned synthlines, delicate and forever lovely, create a dreamy, lush, and warm effect.  This album is thus a very strange mixture of frost and warmth as displayed on the cover, a still-life of roses (now the desktop picture on my personal computer).  When you're finished looking at the cover and you pop the CD into the stereo, you're instantly grabbed by the urgent riff of \\"Age of Consent\\"...and you're not let go until the last notes of \\"Leave Me Alone\\" fade away (well, unless you choose to listen to \\"The Beach,\\" the instrumental/dubbed version of \\"Blue Monday,\\" which was rather uselessly tacked onto the American re-release).  While \\"The Beach\\" may ruin the ending flow of this masterpiece (\\"Leave Me Alone\\" is the PERFECT closer), \\"Blue Monday\\" fits snugly in between its prototype, \\"586\\" (quite possibly my favourite New Order song), and \\"Your Silent Face\\" (certainly in my top five).  If you, however, feel the need to listen to the album minus the \\"bonus\\" tracks, feel free to do so.  But I've written enough:  if you're reading this page and looking for something new, something different, something grand, read some of the wonderful reviews already posted and do purchase this album.  I can't guarantee you won't regret your decision, since we all have different musical tastes, but I can tell you that this album changed my life and the way I listen to music--and it continues to do so every day.
B000002L7J|5.0|Meat is Murder was one of my first forays into indie music as a 15 year old kid in 1987 and what a great place to start. Full of painful angst and alienation, Morrissey really bears himself... his wretched life lives all over these songs. Maybe it's a little dramatic, but it never seems faked and it always sounds fantastic.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Great acting. Stunning photography. An absolutely different kind of thriller. Goes where you do not expect, which is a great reason to see it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly really didn't do it for me right away, but after the first few episodes and the characters started to flesh out, they really grew on me. All of the characters on Serenity turn out to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch. The episodes just got better and better for me as it rocketed towards its premature demise. As everyone's said before, it really is a shame that it didn't get a chance to go any further in this format, because finding out about the true story over the course of several seasons would have been a joy to watch. I just hope somebody like SciFi will pony up and bring it back. If Battlestar can be so good on SciFi, why can't Firefly? The funny thing is, I really don't like most science fiction out there.
B00005J6UP|5.0|There are so many reviews about this movie so I'll cut to the chase.  It is a movie about kids being kids!  So there is a bad  word from time to time - they are on a pirates treasure hunt and the conditions for that are not usually pretty sky's and chirping birds.  One turn of events lead to another and it keeps you on your seat, and at most times pretty funny.  All the characters fit their parts and the acting for the age group is better than most adult movies I see these days. <br />I have a slew of movies that family go through when they visit and I have had more comments about having the Goonies movie than any.  \\"Oh you have the Goonies, can we watch it?  \\"Can I borrow this?\\"  Its just a fun show!
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement had a perfect sound forever right here on S&E. My friends always thought they sounded terrible and I just couldn't hear it. All I heard was beautiful songs played and sung shambolically, but in such a great combination of earnest/kiss off flare, it made them even better songs than if they had been played and sung \\"competently.\\" This is and was a truly groundbreaking album in terms of tossing off perfection which a lot of people have tried to do since. The new edition compiles some stuff that used to be sold seperately or was otherwise hard to find and they're all a boon for anyone who hadn't owned it before. I bought it again because I love this album so much. Now I have the original CD and this one. I'm just really bummed I neve saw them live. Nobody would ever go with me.
B000001EAQ|4.0|SO I AM A PRETTY SOLID U2 FAN AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT POP IS AMAZING...ITS FUNKY, ELECRTONICA, SOMBER BUT YET UP BEAT... THERE ARE SOME BLUES UNDERTONES AND BONOS VOICE COMPLETES THIS MASTERPIECE...MUCH LIKE ZOOROPA (MY OTHER FAV U2 CD) THEY STEP OUT OF THEIR TYPICAL AND EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW SOUND... ITS A GREAT ALL THE WAY THRU CD AND EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A U2 FAN YOU SHOULD PICK UP POP AND ZOOROPA... GOOD MUZIK IS GOOD MUZIK AND THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS U2 GETS
B00005JNBQ|5.0|What's this? A comedy that is actually funny? Napoleon Dynamite is so well done and obviously on a shoestring budget... I can't get over it. It's chock full of genius joke vehicles and is immediately quotable. I especially like the timeless nature of it. It seems like it could be taking place anywhere from the 80's up until now. The time machine bits are absolutely priceless as well as almost every single thing that comes out of Napoleon's mouth.
0808519387|3.0|I have to say first that the book is, in its own way, revealing. <br />But the reason I couldn't vote it a five stars is its extreme definitions of egoism and altruism. I smelled scents of resentment to communism in its debunking of altruism, which is, in this book, quite terribly distorted. Two major characters, Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey, are poles of two dogmatic principles. But not only so, Ellswork Toohey also soiled himself with the evil of destroying others, the effacement of independence and creation, that are, in my impression, not part of altruism. This is just not a world that one has to kill another to gain his or her independence, vice versa. But to make a world like that, Ayn Rand is sucessful in her own way.

0307276902|1.0|You can tell he's a liar from the first paragraphs. A *doctor* (?) and two others bring him aboard a plane. How gothic. Why not a nurse in a miniskirt and a creased white hat bobby-pinned to her hair?    Around 40 legitimate reviews of Frey's book were purged today from this page--dating from 01/10 through present--in order to refloat the author's rating.  They deleted reviews which hadn't pointed to the URL at all.    You will notice an organized, concerted effort to redeem the book by reviews that have appeared in the last several hours. They are easily recognized by ellipses that bracket them--as well as their pistillate writing style.  The ellipses may be traces of a field (in a form mailing) asking for upbeat reviews from confederates; the punctuation may have been poorly arranged so that many of these writers overlooked them before posting.
B000AADYRQ|2.0|These guys were, at best, a servicable college rock band in their early days, but as they've forged on and \\"up\\" the lyrics and music have just gotten really tired and, honestly, difficult for me not to laugh at their lame songs... And the fact that they've spawned a bunch of imitators that are just as insufferable only reinforces the notion that this lame emo-ish bandwagon is best kept off of.
0394818237|5.0|I got this book as a prize when I was 8, and I loved it every minute. I have read this book so many times and this has been a blast 18 years owning it. It has been my source for dreams of many of my childhood dreams and these illustrations are so good. If you are looking to buy your kid a book, do yourself a favor and get this own. It was my best friend for a long time and I am sure, it will be for your kid too !!
B00007AJF8|5.0|Charlie Kaufman has an absolutely sick imagination and I am pretty amazed that this movie ever got made. It's so abstract that it just begs to not be something that actually came out of Hollywood. A portal into John Malkovich's head? Comic and creative genius!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|...and a great ending to the Firefly series. Tired of the ever more  artificial futures from galaxies far far away ? Did you perhaps watch the latest big budget movies and were disappointed ? Then Serenity is the right cure for you. <br /> <br />Great scenario, wonderfull acting by Nathan Fillion & co., lots of  action and plenty of that special flavor of humor that made Firefly so enjoyable. <br /> <br />While Serenity is great by itself, I recommend watching it after Firefly for maximum effect. It's very rewarding to see River fulfill her unexploited potential from the series and everything else makes much more sense this way.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna once again puts out another album that is \\"concept-ey\\" but it works... her last three albums have had small but signifigant evolutions... indicating that the queen of chage may have finally found her place.
B0000C23DO|4.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who noted that when he is trying to expose someone unfamilar with the Dead to their music, a lot of the best songs for doing so are on this album. With a few notable exceptions, the Dead didn't make strong studio albums, but even their weaker efforts usually contained a few stellar moments, most of which are included here. Even though the Dead were first and foremost a live band, I learned a long time ago that 10 and 15 minute improvised live versions of unfamiliar material are not usually the best way to get a newbie coming back for more. This album, unlike a typical dead show, is tightly constructed and moves briskly, as if to say \\"If you didn't like that, maybe you'll like this\\"- a sort of Cliff Notes for the Grateful Dead. With the glut of Grateful dead product on the market, choosing any entry point is a dicey proposition, and this disc is probably the most logical way in. It's also a good disc for someone who just wants a tiny sampler of Dead in their collection. You don't have to be a Deadhead to appreciate this album or this band.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah, does it again, for all the haters who said that Glitter was the end of her career, she comes out the gate swinging with so many tracks that could be released as singles this album could have easily been split into two and mixed with medicore songs and she still would have had mutliplatuim success. By this time I don't think anything else can be said that hasn't been said already. If you haven't coped this album yet, what are you waiting for you know there are at least 5 good songs on it, that's better than 50% of popular music these days.<br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Classically Mariah... grown, sexy, and vocally beautiful & rich!

Seeing the older brother with his sexy \\"thick\\" or PHAT (Pretty Hot And Tempting) Black Blonde was so funny... seeing his change from \\"super geeky White boy to Hip Hop down bro\\" was enough to make me watch the moive by it's self.<br />**************************************************<br />Warning this is a film is either one you'll love or hate... there really isn't a place in between for it.
0307276902|5.0|As Oprah said on Larry King, the smoking gun accusations are \\"much ado about nothing\\". This book is a phenomenal story about one man's incredible determination and willpower in the face of addiction. You would be hard pressed to find a family in this country not affected by addiction and James Frey's story is a MEMOIR- and this genre in publishing leaves room for padding around a subjective recollection of events.  I have purchased at least 10 copies of this book and handed it off to discriminating reader friends and ALL were not only touched, but agree that this book is having an impact...and it's an important piece of work that is doing great things for hundreds of thousands of people who just need something to inspire them to hold on. Read this book!!

B000000JO3|5.0|This is probably my favorite hardcore album (besides various Misfits ones). These guys aren't the wimpy cristian striagt edge guys, they were real hardcore straigt edge.

B0009X766Y|5.0|Each time a studio releases a so-called 'full screen' - in plain English: pan & scan, most of the time - version of a widescreen movie (read this, Disney!), reviewers complain, and rightfully so. Now, after 'The Sting' has been available for years in a (ahem) full screen version, at last Universal releases it 16x9 widescreen, and complaints rise the other way round. Some folks never seem to be happy. <br /> <br />So the director's intention was to release 'The Sting' in a 1,37:1 theatrical aspect ratio to give it a 30's look, eh? What a crock! In the mid-70's, all movies were released in matted 1,85:1 widescreen, and mainstream theaters no longer bothered to show movies full screen, and you bet your bottom dollar George Roy Hill was fully aware of that. So even if he had full screen in mind, chances are he had his framing arranged so that it wouldn't suffer from matted widescreen release (same as today's full screen releases of movies shot in Super 35). <br /> <br />This issue is as pointless as the debate over Stanley Kubrick's alleged intention to release 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Eyes Wide Shut' full screen, which led to these movies being released that way on DVD. Well, if you scrutinize carefully these 'open matte' versions, you'll find out that all you get is useless empty space at the top and bottom of the picture... <br /> <br />
B0007OASII|4.0|I too have been a listener of this band since the very beginning. I still recall hearing their first disc called \\"Eternity\\" like it was yesterday, and remember sharing it with my friends to hear their standard reply of \\"it's the guy from Crimson Glory singing lead, I just know it is, it has to be!\\"  <br /> <br />Actually it wasn't Midnight of course, and since then the band has seen several line-up changes, most notably at singer, and now with \\"The Black Halo\\", toss their seventh full-length album at the progressive metal masses. <br /> <br />Actually \\"masses\\" is an appropriate word in the foreshadowing of my review for this disc. For I was anxious to finally listen to this offering for myself, as \\"The Black Halo\\" has received a tremendous amount of buzz in both the prog metal community and the mainstream market as well.  <br /> <br />To say that I was disappointed in this release would be totally inaccurate. I thoroughly enjoyed this album immensely. But to say that it's groundbreaking in any way for the band or the genre, and to grade it next to the all-timers in the progressive metal world is going a bit overboard in my opinion, because I wasn't totally blown away with \\"The Black Halo\\" from front to back either. <br /> <br />What I think any truly seasoned Kamelot listener will find here is simply a continuation of the sound they began producing on albums like \\"Karma\\" when Khan entered the fold as the band's front man. It's different than that album, maybe even better in some ways, but I personally didn't hear anything to shake the very foundation of the progressive metal world.  <br /> <br />Moreover I think there are two things that set this album apart from the others Kamelot have produced to date. One is that many of the songs seem shorter, and appear to be wisely crafted at potentially reaching a mainstream audience. I.e., there's the chance you might finally be hearing Kamelot songs all over the radio waves. Stuff like the catchy and quick \\"When The LightsGo Down\\" and the enchanting, but simple \\"Soul Society\\" make me think that they are taking a shot at getting a wider appeal in the ears of the masses (hmmm, there's that word again?). <br /> <br />The other thing that is present on \\"The Black Halo\\" is pretty much the opposite of what I mentioned above, and that's the inclusion of a musical underpinning that is based in a pure prog sound. Still heavy, but borrowing from the softer-spoken masters of a by-gone era. Trust me, there was more than one \\"riff\\" on this album that was a deadringer for something I've heard done in the past. The distant past! Kamelot seems to be digging deeper in the vaults to refresh their sound this time I feel, and instead of dusting off their old Dream Theater or Stratovarius albums as inspiration, their borrowing their older pal's Camel, Yes and Vander Graaf Generator stuff.  <br /> <br />I'm not kidding! The skin of this musical bounty is all about metal, but the root is tapped firmly in the progressive stylings of the 1970's. This is way more obvious on the longer and more complex passages, like the grand \\"Momento Mori\\" or the haunting \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"Serenade\\". <br /> <br />Like I said before, I like this album, in fact I like it quite a bit and I don't think any fan of the band or progressive metal in general will be disappointed with it. But let's be a little more discriminating about what we start calling a \\"classic\\" or \\"the best of all time\\". I know the prog metal well has been parching many thirsty fans lately with it's empty offerings, but just because it rains every couple of years doesn't mean the waters taste any different than before.  <br /> <br />Buy \\"The Black Halo\\"...it's good, but I promise you that giant cracks will not open in the earth's crust and God won't appear to many of you while you listen for the first time. Perhaps on the next installment from Kamelot something of epic proportions will occur, one never knows? <br />

B00022M518|5.0|After Brian Eno left the band Roxy Music, he made this glam rock masterpiece with all the members of RM except for Bryan Ferry. Here Come The Warm Jets is every bit as good as, if not slightly better than For Your Pleasure; the second and last Roxy Music album he did with them. It's also right up there with David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane. I like Bryan Ferry and everything but after Brian Eno released this, it was clear that Eno was the driving force behind Roxy Music.     Brian Eno's lyrics sort of reminds me of Syd Barrett's. The lyrics are just really enjoyable and completley out there. Some of them don't make much since at all, and it's hilarious when they don't! His music is a good bit different from Syd's, though. It's more glam than trippy.    Every song is perfect and each one sounds different on this. My personal favorite would have to be \\"On Some Faraway Beach.\\" I LOVE that song!! Andy Mackay does some really impressive keyboard playing on it. My other favorites are \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye,\\" \\"Blank Frank,\\" \\"Dead Finks don't Talk,\\" \\"Baby's one Fire\\" ...well practically all of them. If you've heard For Your Pleasure and liked it, you'll love this one. If you haven't heard it and you like glam rock, you need to own these two classics! I haven't heard Eno's Taking Tiger Moutain and Another Green World yet, but they're also supposed to be pretty impressive.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|I may be one of the few people who actually enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, despite the many inherent flaws to the story, direction and all-over-the-place feel. I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.<br /><br />Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.<br /><br />These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.<br /><br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.<br /><br />One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.<br /><br />Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel, but I am hoping his next project less of an homage to horror's past and adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.ain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery. <br /> <br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel.

0385507755|1.0|Frey employs a tedious, simple-formula writing style.  The subject matter is compelling.  Whether or not \\"the emotional truth is there\\" as James maintains I'll never know. That statement certainly cannot be trusted. But what we DO know are the simple facts as brought to light recently.  Shame on you, little man.  Couldn't sell your fiction until you peddled it as non fiction?  Reminds me of what happened with \\"Mutant Message Down Under.\\"   <br /> <br />The truth always wins.  Wow, but he made a bundle!  I myself am seeking a refund for $16.15, which is what I dropped on the thing at Barnes and Noble in Santa Rosa, CA.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When Fox cancelled the series we knew they had made a huge mistake.  The series is big, entertaining, and avoids the perils of perpetual soap opera-dom.  The actors are fresh, the pacing crisp, and the out-take reel created for the Christmas/wrap party made me laugh and cry at the same time.  The DVD set provides excellent back ground for 'Serinity', but both the movie and the series stand on their own merits.  I turned my niece and nephew onto the series and both are now avid fans. <br /> <br />I may be making this up, but I believe the network was aware of who was watching; intellegent, thinking people.  When the show's fan base increased, they realized that the cloyingly sweet crap regularly dished out to the masses would no longer satisfy and they would have to actually work (I'll get off my soapbox now).
B000021XS0|5.0|Words cannot do this masterpiece justice! You have to hear it to truly appreciate it. But still, here's a run-down of the best songs here... <br /> <br />2. Overture 1928 - Great instrumental! You gotta love that first guitar solo...sound familiar? <br /> <br />5. Fatal Tragedy - Things start to get heavier. It starts out errie and melodic, then segues into a great metal song. The guitar solo is amazing! <br /> <br />6. Beyond This Life - Heavier than the previous songs, a long song at 11:22. The guitar solos, keyboard solos, and opening double-bass all rule! <br /> <br />8. Home - .....Need I say anything here? D/L it, the only song you'll ever need! <br /> <br />9. Dance Of Eternity - Better than O1928, IMHO. Nice use of 7-string guitar! <br /> <br />11. The Spirit Carries On - One of the best ballads ever with one of the best solos ever! I seriously almost broke into tears when I first heard this song it's so good. <br /> <br />So, this album is worth ten times the price you'll pay for \\"Home\\" alone!
B000002JKA|5.0|This was the first DT album I had ever heard, and I immediately got totally into it.  So it goes without saying that I was surprised to see that this one of Dream Theater's least popular albums.  I've since picked up some other albums, Images & Words, Scenes From a Memory, and Train of Thought, and while I like them all this still remains my favorite.  I think maybe it's because it's very well rounded...It's definately a mixed bag, with heavy songs like \\"Lie\\" and then really soft ones like \\"The Silent Man\\" and \\"Space Dye Vest.\\"  I think this CD would be great for a first time DT listener because you really get a good sense of their vast range of style.
6305909326|4.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  Johnny Depp was great as Corso and while I dislike Seigneur as the \\"Girl,\\" she was perfectly creepy for this part. <br /> <br />It was totally scary and fascinating at the same time, especially about the obsessions with old books by collectors to the point where morality ceases to exist.  It also points out the emptiness of people's lives where they have to turn to playing with fire, such as seeking out the devil (they can find the devil on any street corner and in Congress and the White House).  Others seek out religion to avoid reality. <br /> <br />But, mainly, I loved it for a good horror story that it was.  And the soundtrack was truly wonderful.  It introduced me to the gorgeous voice of Sumi Jo, and made me a fan forever. <br /> <br />And it had the benefit of introducing me to the works of Arture Perez-Reverte, a wonderful Spanish author.  The Club Dumas, however, had more going on than the movie, which focused on only one part of the book (much like the film version of East of Eden only focused on the last 100 pages of the book). <br /> <br />And the ending was no surprise!   <br /> <br />b Spoiler Ahead <br /> <br />Corso wound up exactly where he wanted to go: to Hades to meet the Devil, although he did meet him/her.  S/he picked Corso out, knowing the A-type he was.  I loved the image of him walking right into the \\"lion's den,\\" like a lamb to the slaughter.  Great scene and quite chilling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I watch this movie as frequently as Angel Heart, both movies for a rainy, dark day. <br /> <br />

B00006EXL5|5.0|Well unlike most people that listen to MCR now i have been a long dedicated fan, preordering thier first c.d.\\" i borught you my bullets, you brought me your love\\", this c.d. has a very gritty low quality sound tone to it which i love, the lyrics are much darker then the new mainsteam \\"three cheers for sweet revenge\\" c.d. but the guitar work and mixing job on this c.d. was much better thoguht out then revenge. For me personaly I can relate to gerards lyrics in bullets alot more then revenge simply becasue the revenge album was written from a story board sort of view, which was hard for me to relate with, bullet however gets deep inside the emotions of hate, greed, fear, as well as many other creepy topics such as blowing your brains against the ceiling, and a ex girlfriend turning into a vampire. over all this c.d. is alot more true to the \\"My Chemical Romance sound\\" which i love, all thought the recording job is not as high quality, the mixing and thought out lyrics make up for it.... in my opinion buy this c.d. before you buy revenge and you won' be dissapointed. 5 stars to MCR for this c.d.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is an \\"eye opening\\" book; a \\"heart breaking and heart warming\\" book to say the least. The first book I honestly couldn't put down. <br />       The Lovely Bones would be a wonderful and must read for teenage girls and women alike who ever asked the question \\"Where do we go from here, and why?\\" <br />       Alice Sebold writes of a young girl named Susie Salmon who gets murdered at the age of fourteen. The book is told through Susie's eyes as she watches life after her death. Susie is murdered by her neighbor Mr. Harvey in a field close to her high school. The police search for Susie's body and her killer, while her family is in grief and simply trying to live day after day without her.  <br />Susie's family isn't the only ones who were affected by her death. Before Susie left for heaven, she passed by a girl named Ruth who also attended school with her, Ruth had a feeling something touched her and she was sure it was Susie. Ruth spends her time trying to find Susie's killer while also experiencing other spiritual experiences. A boy named Ray is also grieving about Susie's death because he loved her. Susie watches the family, friends and boy she loved she left behind as she learns more and more about life, love, death and her heaven.  <br />       Susie Salmon's story will touch all of your deepest emotions, while giving you a whole new outlook on life. With all the things this book has given me, I must say the one I am most grateful is: Hope. <br />       \\"I saw Lindsey move toward Samuel Heckler. She kissed him; it was glorious. I was almost alive again.\\" (Page 71) <br />
B00082IJ08|5.0|Blistering rock/hip hop laced electronica from Blur front man Damon Albarn and friends.<br /><br />The catchy ditty `Dirty Harry' features a children's chorus, a very funky bassline, and dramatic strings. I first heard this when they performed it at the MTV Europe awards in November. The upbeat `Feel good inc' features De La Soul and great string/acoustic breaks. Alternative meets hip hop. `DARE' is a bubbly upbeat number.<br /><br />`Kids with guns' features spoken lyrics set to a choppy, funky bassline. `El Ma&ntilde;ana' is another standout. It features brilliant guitars, electronic effects, cutting strings, and soothing vocals.<br /><br />The Radiohead-like `Every planet we reach is dead' is a sluggish song with ghostly backing vocals, and lashings of piano and electric guitar. `All alone' has a dub feel and almost jungle beats. It features a nice acoustic break with the vocals of Martina Topley-Bird.<br /><br />Actor Dennis Hopper narrates the dark and mythical tale of monkey mountain on `Fire coming out of the monkey's head', set to brooding humming, a steady beat, and electronic flourishes. Title track `Demon days', after a string laden intro flows into a slight dub sound, with electronic flourishes and choir style vocals. Rather anthemic!<br /><br />Repeated play is necessary to grasp the depth of sonic and melodic innovation. Already nominated for 3 Grammys, a work of genius!!!
1851774408|4.0|Like the previous \\"Fashion in Detail\\" books, this volume has excellent, close-up color photographs of beautiful finishing details.  Unlike the previous \\"Fashion in Detail\\" books, there are also full-length photographs of a good many of the items featured--not simply line drawings as in the other books.  A must-have for 19th century costume enthusiasts, and great fun for any lover of historic costume or fine sewing.
B00005JOIF|4.0|After the shrill disappointment of his \\"War of the Worlds\\", Steven Spielberg has returned to terra firma with a melodrama \\"based on real events\\", the retaliation for murders of Israeli atheletes at the 1972 Olympics. \\"Munich\\" has become a hotbed of controversy since its depiction of Jewish assassins, their coldness and their greed, could easily be construed as anti-Semitic. Of course, Spielberg himself is a Jew, as is his primary scenarist Tony Kushner. So it does seem odd that the leader of the commandoes can prepare and eat rich, heavy meals after killing someone in cold blood. (The leader has been recruited from Mossad, but he has been obliged to resign from that organization and works with no political recognition.) Further, his victims (the men who masterminded the Olympic massacre) are presented in the most attractive light possible. Their first victim is a gentle translator of \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\", and the second is a loving husband and father. (An almost Hitchcockian touch: after the latter's telephone is rigged with a remote-control explosive, it's his young daughter who answers the signal.) When one of the assassins congratulates the leader on becoming a new father -- Mazel tov! -- he adds that one of the victims has finally succumbed to his wounds. \\"And so,\\" he says \\"mazel tov again.\\" They get their assigment locations from an apolitical French informer whose price depends on the importance of the target. (\\"I want receipts!\\" their Mossad boss yells.) It all makes Israel seem very frosty and forbidding, which is why Spielberg has been accused by critics of working with a guilt complex; but I think had he made his patriot a clear-eyed hero with no doubts and no regrets Spielberg would have been accused by those same critics of chauvanism. (There are artistic critiques and then there are personal attacks.) As it is, the character Avner becomes increasingly paranoid, so that his life becomes nightmarish. Eric Bana is impressive as Avner; his staunchHector was the only really interesting thing about \\"Troy\\". Spielberg occasionally falls into Hollywood clichs: when Avner returns to his wife and child in Brooklyn he's so entranced he walks into traffic, not very likely for someone trained in intelligence. And about two-thirds into the story there's a Mata Hari sequence that might have dropped out of another movie. But for the most part Spielberg, influenced perhaps by Costa-Gravas, has created a tense political thriller, strengthened by the photography of Janusz Kaminski, grainy and filled with muted colors. (One suspects that Spielberg was tempted to film in black and white.) Spielberg's style here is exclusively cerebral (I notice that Colin Wilson is now one of his producers), and there is almost no humor in \\"Munich\\". A grim study of endless retaliation, the film seems to say we are all murderers and deserve our place in Gehenna.
0307276902|1.0|Let's face it - the book's impact evaporates once it's known it's an invention. Sure James only 5% of the book has been overturned as a fake - but the other 95% can't be examined the same way because it involves your fairytale list of first name only characters who all died. <br /> <br />Noone should have to endure this insufferable prose for a lie <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|I tried to read this book about a month ago, after a very long wait list at my public library. I didn't know a thing about it and have never watched Oprah in my entire life. But, several people reassured me it was a \\"great book.\\"  After realizing it was about puking, puking and more puking I returned it in disgust because, basically, any book that shoves vomit, guts, and other bodily fluids in my face page after page is of little interest to me. Never mind the fact that the writing is not half as good as the stuff my son wrote in kindergarten. <br /> <br />However, never having taken it directly from the library shelves myself I did not notice, until giving it back, that it had a \\"Biography\\" designation on the spine.  That was a very perplexing moment since I had assumed the book was just another badly written novel. For instance, as an ex-employee of Pan Am Airlines, I assumed the opening scene was the author's Hollywood-styled fantasy where vomit-covered, incoherent passengers are allowed on airplanes with bloody holes in their faces and stinking to high heaven.  <br /> <br /> Now I find out that a major publishing house irresponsibly promoted a fictitious story as a memoir without a background check (how hard was it for The Smoking Gun researchers to get their hands on data that a major corporation never thought to look for?) <br /> <br />If the pathetic excuse, \\"but,it inspired so many people\\" becomes the standard by which Doubleday and Oprah are going to save their literary reputations - not to mention their pocket books - America is better off not reading anything, not watching anything and, certainly, not believing anything. We have become a nation of sheep in which no one thinks for themselves because people like Oprah know best and anything on TV, or in print, is gospel.  <br /> <br />To perpetrate this hoax on a publishing company is nothing less than fraud - and no, a \\"memoir\\" is NOT permission to make up crimes you never committed, cops you never ran over, people you never knew and feelings you never had!  Anyone who defends this kind of immoral, unethical behavior is delusional. <br /> <br />When Henry Ford was confronted by journalists with unassailable proof that his anti-Semitic publication - \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" - was a blatant fake, he had a similar response as Oprah and Nan -  What's the difference if it isn't true? At least it accurately describes the problem while \\"helping\\" millions of people.    <br /> <br />I am greatly saddened by the refusal of so many readers to acknowledge that they were bamboozled, hoodwinked, and flim-flammed - especially those who claim to have been \\"saved\\" by Frey - not only because the author of this improbable and poorly written saga is a blatant liar, but because corporate interests -Doubleday, Oprah, Larry King, etc. - appear to be willing accomplices to save this unethical literary hoodwink. As if it wasn't bad enough that millions of people had their hearts wrenched out by a money-making scam you can be sure that the publisher, author and the rest of the Media will make a killing on the repercussions.  <br /> <br />Americans will continue to believe in fairies as well as futile \\"just say no\\"  recipes for their extremely serious troubles while moneyed interests continue to lull them into Hollywood style daydreams with books like this. <br /> <br />Carl Sagan used to say, \\"Keep an open mind. But, not so open that your brains fall out.\\"  <br /> <br />Take my advice - instead of \\"holding on\\" just go and ask for your money back. It's the only way to say \\"I won't take it anymore.\\"
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Given that The Strokes haven't had a huge hit in a while, you'd figure that \\"Juicebox\\" the lead single from the album would give some indication of what is to come.  \\"Juicebox\\" as itself is such a rockin single;  probably one of their best.  After purchasing their album, turns out that that is the only standout song on the entire disc.  Not to say it's bad, but well below expectation of a band that was onced called the best new band of the rock era.  Better luck next time...
B000001EYO|4.0|The best movie of all time!! The soundtrack however was so lacking in movie quotes and the two important Creedence songs. So I would suggest that people buy this CD and like I did, rip the soundtrack, add the Creedence, mix in a few classic movie clips, mix up a white Russian for yourself and friends...sit around and have a Big Lebowski party!! The soundtrack that I remixed is so popular that when I throw a party everyone is always asking me to, \\"Hey Dude put on that Big Lebowski soundtrack you made....It's just so...DUDE\\"   <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|The essential truth of this book is that it is a lie.  If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else?  To say it's okay to lie to help people is tantamount to saying the ends justifies the means.  Frey and those that support him should be ashamed and if he is the man he claims to be, he should come clean.  I will never  read anything he writes again.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I really loved this movie. Great scary scenes and I love court room drama. The thing that left me confused is why exactly the priest was on trial. I don't think that was fully explained. They were holding him responsible for Emily's death but wasn't it her family that put him in charge? He didn't ask for that position. And then he used his faith based methods to try and help her (DUH! He's a PRIEST!) and then they wanted to throw him in prison when it didn't work. That didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I was very let down by the DVD extras. I really wanted to learn more about what REALLY happened. I know everything they showed happening to Emily was totally made up for the sake of the movie but how much of the trial was reality based? It left me frustrated that it didn't answer those questions.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Watching writer/director James Cameron's 194 minute masterpiece TITANIC (1997) in one all evening sitting on letterboxed DVD alone in a dimly lit bedroom, I felt a miracle pass over me that I seldom feel at a movie.  This is not just a great movie.  This is one of the great motion pictures of my lifetime, one of the greatest of the movie sound era.  It is flawlessly crafted on every craft level and down to the smallest detail.  It has a highly intelligent and very interesting screenplay.  And it has a dream cast who give performances they can all look back on with great, great pride. <br /> <br />It all starts with the writing.  Cameron gives us all of Titanic's voyage, unlike A NIGHT TO REMEMBER (1958) just doing the night the ship sank in April 1912.  We need those first few days to get acquainted with this exquisitely lovely ship (re-created both as miniature and almost full-size in Baja California) and its passengers.  And no one else seems to see the triangle romance between Rose-Jack-Cal as akin to a 1912 D. W. Griffith silent romantic melodrama-dashing hero, lovely heroine, and dastardly villain.  Plus an even nastier villain, the despicable manservant Lovett.  This is especially so in the gripping climax with Jack handcuffed in a steerage room, Lovett with a gun, and Rose swimming down a flooded corridor with a fire axe in one hand; and Cal callously seeking her out as she debates getting into a lifeboat.  Pure Griffith melodrama-sublime.  And my heart stopped when (SPOILER ALERT!!) survivor Rose is hiding from unjustified survivor Cal on the deck of the Carpathia.  Man, I detest him! <br /> <br />Cameron was a fanatical perfectionist, determined to let his audience truly feel they are passengers on the real Titanic, again re-created perfectly down to the slightest detail, from furniture and wallpaper and china in first-class, to the look and feel of steerage, to the boiler room and car garage.  The Oscar-winning sets and elegant first-class costumes and breathtakingly beautiful wide-screen cinematography are stupendous achievements, as is the loveliest of music scores by Oscar winner James Horner.  (The movie won a whopping eleven Oscars, including editing and sound, and was nominated in three other categories.)   <br /> <br />The night of the ship's sinking is also done just right and really gets to you emotionally.  You are with those characters in lifeboats that were in some cases heartbreakingly only half-full, or on the deck of a huge ocean liner that is literally splitting in two.  You really feel the frosted breath on freezing passengers on overturned wood pieces in a freezing clear deep blue night ocean with a starry black background. <br /> <br />Most of all, I think TITANIC is a flawless movie gem is because of the towering starring performances by Oscar nominee Kate Winslet as young Rose and Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack Dawson.  This is acting the likes of which I have seldom seen even as a film scholar.  These are performances of a lifetime, the type that both talented actors can look back on decades from now with deep pride.  So will I.  But Billy Zane as the nasty and egotistical Cal, David Warner as the reprehensible Lovett, Frances Fisher as Rose's unpleasant mother, Kathy Bates as the likeable \\"Unsinkable\\" Molly Brown, and especially the amazing 87 year old Oscar nominee Gloria Stuart as Old Rose (blessedly still with us) are also wonderfully right. <br /> <br />You simply must buy and lose yourself in the three-disk DVD of James Cameron's movie miracle, on sale for only $20 at Target and also Amazon.com.  The first two disks have the 194 minute movie in wide-screen format, with three audio commentaries.  James Cameron (on the one I chose) talks about his deep dives down to the real shipwreck in the years before the movie was made and how those dives both deeply moved him and inspired him to tell the true story of the ship as a memorial to its 1500 victims.  He talks about fanatical realism, safety, butalso a lot of movie wizardry with visual effects.  For instance, the people clinging to wood in the freezing ocean under a 2 a.m. starry sky-this was shot in 70 degree water, four feet deep, in a tank in Escondido, with faked frosty breath, and computer graphic night sky!  Amazing.  The other two audio commentaries have cast and crew on one, and Titanic historians on the other.  Maybe one of these can be played by me on the April 12th anniversary.  Needless to say, the DVD quality is unequaled, and you get to watch the whole movie in pajamas, stretched out on a bed, taking breaks with a pause button whenever you need or want to. <br /> <br />Disk three has a full three hours of bonuses, including 45 minutes of very good deleted scenes with optional commentary by Cameron; a mock 1912 newsreel; more on deep dives down to the real Titanic site, which also provided blueprints for re-constructing the ship for the movie; a haunting Celine Dion music video of the Oscar-winning song \\"My Heart Must Go On\\"; visual effects breakdowns; and press kit and publicity material.  It takes a whole evening and tells you everything you want to know about the making of the film, especially if you play the actual movie with one of the optional commentaries. <br /> <br />James Cameron allegedly really drove his cast and crew hard to get TITANIC right, but always with safety in mind.  There must be a thousand people listed in ten minutes of closing credits, including dozens of lifeguards and stunt extras when the ship breaks in two.  Everyone here has proudly raised the bar on what movies can do and how passionately one can embrace them, even on a tiny TV screen on DVD.  After all, you don't think this movie had return business week after week at the box office to become one of the five highest grossing movies of all time if people were not reacting to something very special here.  The unforgettable tragic romance between Rose and Jack. Amazingly, it still has that feeling alone on home video at night.  Maybe more so because the romance is so private and intimate. <br /> <br />This 1997 masterpiece is a movie to cherish and embrace passionately as the highest pinnacle of movie art and emotional storytelling.  Thank you again, Kate, Leo, and Mr. Cameron!  The queen of the world and her two kings, now and forever. <br /> <br />
0156027321|2.0|a little over-hyped.  Fluffy metaphors for the masses?  I should have known.  This book had way too much popularity to live up to the hype . . . and the \\"Readers Group Guide\\" seems pretentious for a second novel.  Rapid critical praise for a novel almost always disappoints, and Life of Pi is no exception.  If you doubt me, just read a random sampling of the hundreds of gushingly superficial 5-star reviews here on Amazon - you'll get seasick before you've even left port.  For more honest, well-rounded and stimulating assessments of this book you'll have to look in the 2-3 star reviews; of which I highly recommend Eric Squire's review entitled, \\"Unconvincing Psychological Allegory\\", from 12/28/2002.<br /><br />I admit, I was intrigued by Yann Martel's opening \\"Author's Note\\" in which he describes how Life of Pi came to be.  The honesty and personal tone of this opening was appealing, and the promise that I was about to hear a story that would make me \\"believe in God\\" was a wonderful build up.  The first chapter in which Pi has already suffered his ordeal and is making insightful comparisons between his college studies in both religion and zoology and the three-toed sloth of Brazil was promising, and I was excited about this book.  Suddenly we're in India and Pi is describing his unique life as the son of an Indian zookeeper and how he got his rather odd name.  This should've been interesting but takes up approximately 90 pages and somehow manages to bore.  I found Pi's character rather unsympathetic and difficult to relate to.  His story quickly becomes meandering, dry and tedious.  We discover that Pi is named after a family friend who loved swimming and swimming pools (i.e. Piscine) - okay, unique and sort of interesting.  Zoos are praised for having saved the lives of many animals who supposedly prefer their safe and familiar confines to the unpredictable wild (and the rest of the book reads like a paen against nature and the wild).  The Pondicherry zoo at which his father works no longer exists, or never existed?  Pi struggles to practice Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam (a theme much, much better explained and explored in E.M. Forster's, Passage to India) but can't combine all three into a personal belief system.  Why not?  I'm not sure, but these themes which at first seemed intriguing quickly lose their interest as author Yawn Martel gets bogged down and lost in what ulimately comes across as an amateurish experiment for a creative-writing class at your local community college.  We readers are his guinea-pigs, or \\"meercats\\" (what the hell is a meercat anyway, and what was Martel thinking? see below for some suggestions).  When we reach the Pacific, and Martel's vivid imagination (or is it Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar's imagination? whom Martel \\"borrowed from\\" but at least acknowledges as being \\"the spark of life\\" in his introduction on page xii), Pi is supposedly trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, an injured zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena.  Pi's life promise's to get wild and crazy now.  Amazingly, it doesn't.  Somehow I grew bored after a few chapters and this was my greatest source of wonderment and perplexity after I'd finished this promising story.  How was this possible given all the colorful animal symbolism, \\"deep\\" religious allegory, and \\"complex\\" literary metaphors?  I still don't know, but somehow Yawn botched it.<br /><br />In the end Pi gets sane and straight for a few brief pages when he tells two silly Japanese investigators from the ship company what \\"really\\" happened after having told the story we have just read.  They obviously don't believe the story, rightly believing him to be insane.  Yet, for some odd reason Martel feels it necessary to portray these two Japanese in a stereotypically demeaning manner and they come across as aetheistic, noodle-eating, bonzai-tree worshipping goofballs.  These last passages almost border on racial biggotry.  This potentially offending dialogue seemed moreappropriate for a racially charged WWII era comic-book instead of a 21st century novel.<br /><br />I like symbolism and allegory and I like it complex and meaningful, but both are juvenile and fluffy in this story, which make them appropriate for younger readers, or more superficial a-dolts on an airplane for vacation.  Martel asks us to choose between stories.  Rubbish!  You don't have to choose between \\"animal story\\" and \\"people story\\" any more than you need to choose between religions.  And that IS the point of the book, if anything at all.  It's not either/or, but both or none.  If \\"none\\", then Pi and Martel are pathological liars and you've just wasted your time in reading this ficiton without any basic comprehension or understanding of metaphor - you can go home now.  If it's \\"both\\" then you are moderately enlightened, and understand that Pi was shipwrecked with his wounded mother whom he symbolically represents with a friendly, loving orangutan named Orange Juice (the color orange being itself a symbol for Hinduism in Pi-ology).  The wounded zebra is the injured sailor, and the savage hyena the nasty French cook (another racially motivated stereotype?).  And of course, the tiger is Pi's brutish animal nature itself (again, orange because he is a Hindu by birth).  The compulsion to tell his travails in the form of an allegory is what's at the heart of this book.  My question for you is do we really need to be asked whether or not \\". . . the telling of something always become[s] a story?\\" (p. 302).  As human beings exposed to thousands of years of literature we already know this, right?  The Japanese Laurel & Hardy want facts, not \\"invention\\".  So Pi Martel rewards us with this pearl of deep, semiotic wisdom - in riddle form of course: \\"Isn't the telling about something - using words, English or Japanese - already something of an invention? Isn't just looking upon this world already something of an invention?\\" (p. 302).<br /><br />In sum:<br /><br />(Yawn Martel) \\"I can tell you what I want, how I want because I'm a writer, creator, and historical revisionist of my own life.  You can believe what you want, but you'll have no power to tell me I'm wrong - especially in terms of my relgious beliefs.  There, take that book club readers of America!\\"<br /><br />READING GROUP GUIDE ADDENDUM:  As for the \\"mysterious\\" self-consuming algae-island and meercats, I have various interpretations for you (all equally as absurd as this book), but you'll have to choose . . . and of course, how you choose will define you as a religious person or aetheistic animal.<br /><br />A.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Ok lets just get it out in the open, if you have never played Final Fantasy 7 then you pretty much have no reason to watch this movie. And yes I mean that, simply because everything in the movie was played off of what happend in the game that some of us have spent 200 + hours playing as well as the other FF titles. One thing that makes me mad though is that I was reading alot of other reviews of this movie from people who apparently have played the game and still didnt understand the movie, and I'm sorry but you have to be a moron not to understand it all, plain and simple. But to wrap things up this movie is amazing as far as visuals, action, music, and PLOT ( yeah I said it ). So if you've played the game you'll love the movie, and if you havent played the game then its probably not worth your time cause you'll hate it.
0307276902|4.0|When I first read this book, I thought it was amazing.  With a brother in and out of recovery for most of his life, I could relate to so much of what Frey described and at the same time was able to get a glimpse of some of the things my brother must have felt.  However, several things did not ring true for me.  The first, as many others have mentioned, was the airplane ride.  The second was the dental work.  I checked that one with my brother who was a drug counselor himself during one of his periods in recovery and he said that novocaine would never be withheld.  It is not a narcotic, it is only a local anaesthetic.  The third thing I had trouble buying was the \\"fact\\" that Frey's parents allowed him to scream for the first two years of his life with only one visit to a doctor \\"the best one they could afford\\"--whatever that means.  Obviously, Frey does not have children of his own or he would realize what a ridiculous scenario this is.  These things bothered me even after I finished the book and when I heard about the Smoking Gun article, I read the whole thing expecting some reference to them.  However, Smoking Gun focused only on exposing the inconsistencies of Frey's alleged criminal record.  At this point, I'm not sure what to think.  I haven't heard that anyone is contesting that Frey was/is an addict and that he is in recovery and has been for years.  Maybe that's still the most important thing?

0064409422|5.0|I must confess that this was one of my favorite books and series, as a child. My second confession is that I  have on occassion ( about once a year ) pulled it out to read it again.  <br />  <br />The story is charming, imaginative and down right fun. <br />  <br />Now, I have heard that it is a Christian themed book. Maybe this is true and maybe it isn't. I never noticed that aspect when I have read it, so if it is true it isn't one of those hit you over the head with a religious debate type of books. There are some subtle moral lessons in it, which I think many children's books contain, but the main objective is to tell a great story and get children hooked on a wonderful new world. <br />  <br />I recommend this series whole heartedly to anyone who longs to get lost in a world of infinite imagination. <br />  <br />Sincerely, <br />Caterina Christakos
0307276902|1.0|Many of the \\"facts\\" in the book are being questioned.
B000BYRCRY|5.0|Okay, The DVD here is the Unrated edition, but as a bonus, you get a special preview disc for Underworld Evolution, containing, the new trailer, a 'making of' documentary, a preview of the Evolution comic and a DVDrom link for the website. <br />I loved the original film; and the Unrated version is even better with more footage, different commentary tracks and completely different extra features from the original release on both discs! <br />The only downside to buying this set is if you already have the unrated edition, (Guilty) then the DVD is the exact same one, you just get the attached 'Bonus disc' as 'one more extra'.
B000BMSU68|4.0|Film buffs, DVD collectors, and John Hughes fans beware!  The \\"Bueller...Bueller...\\" edition DVD does not include the commentary track by writer/producer/director John Hughes which was included on the original 1999/2000 DVD release.  It is a great commentary and is sorely missed from this edition.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Steven Spielberg has often been the focus of a lot of criticism throughout a career of blockbusters and Oscar-winning films like SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but I don't think the criticism has been as intense towards him as it has been to MUNICH.  Here he is, taking on the subjects of terrorism and vengeance--and there are all these people, condemning him not only for doing it, but for the very way he's doing it.  Why is this? <br /> <br />Well, for one thing, he takes as his starting point the murder of eleven Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich on September 5, 1972, and how Israel responded to it.  The Israeli agents, led by a devout Jew (Eric Bana), are assigned to go after the eleven Palestinian masterminds behind the Munich massacre and kill them.  But the more these agents kill, the more they realize that their actions are not only leading to more bloodshed, they themselves are not just the hunters but also, in many respects, the hunted.  For every terrorist, whether actual or supposed, that they assassinate, one more pops up somewhere around the world. <br /> <br />This last point is the point that Spielberg is the most intent on making clear--vengeance is only so good up to a point, and then one must ask, at what price?  It is the kind of ambiguity that is rife in the real world, and a lot of people with very fanatical views don't want to be confronted with that kind of reality, and particularly not in America after the 9/11 attacks.  Contrary to what its detractors would say, Spielberg never condemns Israel for its post-Munich actions--NOT ONCE.  But he is asking some straightforward questions about what the costs are for mere vengeance, not only in human lives, but also, and most especially, in human souls, be they Jewish or Arab.  The film's final shot, across the Hudson River to the twin towers of the World Trade Center is Spielberg's way of saying that now the issue of the cost of vengeance appliesto his own country as well. <br /> <br />Although a very long film at close to two hours and 45 minutes, MUNICH still moves with lightning precision, tension, and documentary-like camerawork, utilizing television footage from the actual events at Munich, and describing how the operations of Bana's team are often carried out on the fly and with always bloody, and sometimes imperfect results.  This is definitely NOT the kind of us-versus-them film that the American far-right likes, but it's the way the real world often works, and it's the way Spielberg sees it.  All of his skills as a director are put to the fullest possible use to make MUNICH yet another feather in his cap as Hollywood's premiere prestige filmmaker.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter/mercenary who is sent to the village of Transylvania.  With the aid of his assistant Carl (David Wenham) and the Transylvanian princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), Van Helsing battles the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), The Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the most powerful of them all, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) <br /> <br />The most PATHETIC movie I have seen in a while.  I'd take a Uwe Boll movie over this, and I am NOT a Uwe Boll fan.  It's horrid.  I enjoyed Stephen Sommer's THE MUMMY, but even that was lacking in substance.  This movie has no substance what to speak of.  Sommer's direction is fine, but the real fault is the script.  It was a terrible idea of make Van Helsing a younger James Bond-type character, when in truth he is an elderly professor with a strong moral authority.  On the acting side, Hugh Jackman broods throughout the whole film, Kate Beckinsale just kind of stands around, and David Wenham provides some good laughs here and there.  As the monsters, Richard Roxburgh is easily the WORST Dracula I've ever seen, Shuler Hensley's Frankenstein Monster is a shadow of the true thing, and Will Kemp's Wolf Man lacks any real emotional depth or substance.  Even the special effects are weak.  Still, the movie is entertaining, at the least.  I would suggest passing this movie altogether, and just going for Lugosi/Karloff/Chaney, Jr. movies from the 30's and 40's.  They are by FAR much more worth the price and time than this
B00005JOFO|5.0|I'm not really sure what else I can say about this movie. There are some intelligent reviews here that cover much of what I'd like to say. At some level, I guess, it's just a matter of adding my affirmation to what others have said. My most enthusiastic affirmation. This is a great film. It's not great just because the acting is good. Though it is. It's not great just because the cinematography is wonderful. Though it is. It's not great just because it puts a taboo subject on the big screen at a time when Americans need to face a whole variety of realities about themselves. Though you bet it does that too. <br /> <br />It's great because the story just makes sense. Annie Proulx has looked into an unfortunate aspect of American culture - our reticence to acknowledge that love and affection doesn't fit into easy, cultural-correct cubicles - and she's told a story that in one way or another must have been lived and relived again and again by a great many people. All the characters in this movie get full and sympathetic treatment. Yes, that begins with Ennis and Jack, but it goes beyond them to include everyone unfortunate enough to be caught up in the repressive society this film details. They're all victims - wives and children included. And it just makes sense! You can totally understand why people would live the lives these characters do, unable to love themselves or those around them naturally, because of pressures from a close-minded, fearful society. <br /> <br />I came home from this film wondering if other actors could've done a better job than Ledger and Gyllenhaal, only to find an old Mel Gibson movie on the box. I was painfully aware of how poor an actor someone like Gibson is in comparison to these two young, talented men. I was also painfully aware of how brave they are, and how someone like Gibson would never have done a film like this. It actually makes me - usually a cynic when it comes to Hollywood - enthusiastic about the future of mainstream Americanfilmmaking. Every now and then we get something right. Brokeback Mountain is one of those times.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity rebukes the traditional Hollywood system for making TV series into movies.  A successful TV series gets its niche viewers established and then a movie deal is struck.  Serenity was based on the 2002 Firefly TV series. This series was pulled after its first year. It was not allowed to age and prosper.<br /><br />After Firefly gets cancelled, Director and writer Joss Whedon decides to make a movie based on his television show Firefly. To build movie hype, He says to his viewers to get the word out utilized unconventional means. First of all he pleads with Firefly viewers to spread the word about his upcoming Serenity movie using internet blogs and chat rooms. The word of the movie Serenity starts running rampant with his new sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Serenity stands by itself as a great movie. The viewer can quickly catch on to the feel of the movie. Firefly TV series followers will not be disappointed as Joss Whedon stays the course of the TV series. Humor and action is still utilized along with modern day innuendos which give this movie some repeat viewing.<br /><br />Capt. Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) commands his lady (Serenity ship) and its crew of personalities.  Second command Zoë (Gina Torres), Pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), Muscle Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Engineer Kaylee (Jewel Straite) and Mal's flame Inara (Morena Baccarin). When Mal picks up Doctor Simon's (Sean Maher) sister River (Summer Glau) strange things happen. Everyone is suddenly after them. It could be the Reavers (crazy human cannibals, Alliance assassins and/or possibly his own crew.<br /><br />I give this DVD a must buy for Sci-Fi thrillers. If you have not seen the Firefly series play the Joss Whedon introduction first. And spread the word.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|I'll admit, when I first heard Theory Of A Deadman, back in 2002, I instantly wrote them off as a Nickelback clone. Afterall, they kind of have that sound, and their first album was even produced by Nickelback's own Chad Kroeger. However, as I have learned many times before, passing judgment so quickly on a band is hardly ever a good idea. If it wasn't for the fact that I'll be seeing these guys open for Staind in a few weeks, I probably wouldn't have checked out this album. However, I gave Theory Of A Deadman (or T.O.A.D.) a second chance and recently picked up their sophmore album, \\"Gasoline.\\" I have to say, I was quite surprised by what was inside...<br /><br />While it is true that T.O.A.D. may not re-invent the genre or bring anything entirely new to the table, what they do offer is a solid, healthy dosage of modern rock. Their sound is one that you are used to if you are familiar with radio-rock, but that's not a bad thing, as these guys do this style better than a lot of bigger bands out there (not naming names). Not only does vocalist/guitarist Tyler Connelly have a smooth, strong and disctinctive voice, but the guitar playing between him and co-guitarist David Brenner is a notch above what is usually heard in this type of music. As for the songs, Connelly pretty much writes the perfect breaking-up/being dumped songs. The first single, \\"No Surprise\\" is a perfect middle-finger to those that like to tease, while semi-acoustic tracks like \\"Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This)\\" and \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" could easily be the next big hits, despite their tendency to get a bit predictable. However, to counteract the few cheesy songs (\\"Hell Just Ain't The Same,\\" \\"\\"Me And My Girl\\"), T.O.A.D. delivers some damn fine hard rock material in \\"Hating Hollywood,\\" \\"Save The Best For Last\\" and \\"Better Off.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gasoline\\" is, overall, a solid listen. It's a good album to take with you on a long drive, as just about every song has something memorable going for it. If you like, or can even tolerate modern-rock, you should really give these guys a chance. They definitely deserve the fame that lesser groups have gained, as they seem quite accomplished in both musicianship and songwriting. No, on the surface, they may not seem special, but I think any rock fan can find something to appreciate with \\"Gasoline,\\" or even their self-titled debut.If you like, or can even tolerate modern-rock, you should really give these guys a chance.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I first heard this album when I was at a pretty low place in my life. I had suffered a miscarriage, I was at a college I didn't like and I was alone until I found a guy I could connect with. As odd as it seems...this is the only CD I've ever found that was the perfect mix of desperation and hope I was feeling at the time. I remember feeling drained after I listened to the whole album. This is a CD for anyone who is low and wants to feel like there is light coming soon. You may not feel better...but you will feel like its coming soon <br /> <br />The music is an amazing mix of raw feeling guitar and orchestrated electronic sounds. I can't even agreet that Thom Yorke's voice isn't beautiful because it is. Every single emotion is there for you to feel and here. It's one of the few albums from the past 10-15 years that I would even consider giving a 5. It will let you experience every single emotion. It's a 5, no matter what and anyone who doesn't agree isn't listening for what they music is, they are listening for the formula they prefer, be it death metal or country. Listen for the value of the music.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|The 1 star is for the set designer. The show itself was awful. Slow and boring. The (way too many) songs are easily forgetable.  Even with the visuals I found myself nodding out during the first act. I'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews for this CD. There must be some hidden subliminal messages in the tracks or something.  This has to be the worst broadway score I have ever heard.
B00005JNTX|2.0|In my opinion this was a good movie, but in now way deserved all the hype.  The plot felt a little stupid and forced.<br /><br />Want to see this movie?  Save money by renting it from Blockbuster, because you'll only need to see it once.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I didn't get to seet this movie until I baby sat my nieces at my sisters house on Showtime. I couldn't change the channel It was one of the best movies of 2004. Jim Carry is one of the best actors I've seen. He can do both comedy and drama. Kate Winslet is also really good in this movie. I'm gonna try to get this movie on DVD but I highly recommend it.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Gloria Swanson is outstanding in the role as the aged silent screen star Norma Desmond, who awaits her glorious return to  motion pictures. Desmond is a recluse, living in the gowns of her old movie star image, with a butler/ex lover who does anything to protect her from the cruelty that is outside their estate. She has become demented in thinking that Cecil B. Demille will be calling her for her come-back any day now, though years have gone by.<br /> Enter William Holden who plays Joe Gillis, the deadbeat broke screenwriter who seeks refuge in Desmond's mansion one night. Gillis though enthralled by Desmond, does not realize that his harmless flirting and promises to stay with Desmond, will cause his leaving her to be the worst thing to do. As the movie unfolds you understand how twisted and pathetic Desmond is and the grip she has on Gillis. As he becomes more successful, and less obtainable, Desmond sees to it that he stays by her permanently.  The best part of the movie is when Cecil Demille does ring Desmond but its not the starring role she expects, causing the final unravelling of her poor mind.<br /><br />In a lot of ways this movie is darker, and scarier then Alfred Hitchock's flicks (who I am a huge fan of), Wilder has built in a lot suspense and there is no way of knowing when Desmond will show up during a scene as she becomes more and more delusional.<br />With this DVD interpretation also, there is a documentary that is included which shows certain parts of the script and the action that I had overlooked, so it was great to watch it again.<br />This movie is my favorite suspense. I hope you enjoy watching it. Biography has also a great look at Gloria Swanson and William Holden if you are more interested in the actors
0312995423|2.0|Its as if all of Brown's weaknesses in his writing are included and magnified.  Weak/no character development, thin plot that doesn't make sense when you work backward, cheesy dialogue, gaping holes, lack of pacing/non-stop tension. <br /> <br />Its an interesting weekend/vacation read, but could have been developed much better without the constant 100% throttle...
B000096IBA|5.0|Chaplin is incredible. This collection comes highly recommended.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I had amazon call me and they said that it would be shipped overnight and it still hasnt come yet.  Anyways though.  As many others are saying, Do not get this if you didnt get at least 70+ hours of play in the game.  I spent about 150+ hours on this and Im still playing it.  As for the movie.  Graphics are amzing.  Plot is excellent and the fight scenes are breathaking.  The one thing that got me though was the music.  It's so awesome.  I have the Japanese version and if you cant wait then I recomend it.  I will own both of them and recomend them to everyone.
B00005JLWN|4.0|With the release of 'The Matrix' series of films, the sci-fi thriller genre was given a much needed breath of fresh air.  Proving that good sci-fi can be comprised of terrific storytelling, and contain issues and ideals that do apply to the modern day, the sci-fi world was allowed to explore other things than just the inside of a space ship.  In 2002, writer/director Kurt Wimmer presented audiences with a bleak look at a post-World War 3 existence for humanity in \\"Equilibrium\\". <br /> <br />\\"Equilibrium\\" is set in Earth's future where World War 3 has occurred, in an attempt to stop any and all future wars from happening, the powers that be have outlawed the very thing that makes us human, emotion!  Requiring that all people of the world take a daily dose of a emotion-blocking drug, and that anything that could possibly trigger emotional responses are destroyed.  To enforce these laws, the governement forms an elite police force known as, Grammaton Clerics.  Trained in the art of 'Gun-Kata', a blend of martial arts and weapons training, the Clerics are a force to be reckoned with.  When a resistance to the anti-emotion laws begins to increase in strength, the government looks to it's top Grammaton Cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale) to bring an end to the rebellion.  During a raid on a rebellion hideout, Preston meets a woman who slowly unlocks the emotions within him.  As a result Preston slowly begins to cease his emotion-blocking drug, and starts to feel all of the emotions he had never experienced.  Realizing that what the government and the Grammaton Clerics are doing is wrong, Preston joins forces with the resistance to bring down the emotion-less leaders of this dark world, bringing emotion back to Earth's people. <br /> <br />Packed full of incredible action scenes that can easily rival \\"The Matrix\\", a strong story of redemption and self-discovery, writer/director Kurt Wimmer has masterfully crafted a new classic for the sci-fi genre.  Terrific performancesfrom all involved, it has to be tough for an actor to give a solid performance without relying on their emotions, delivering their lines virtually dead-pan and not sounding bored is an achievement for any actor.  This cast comprised of Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean deliver on all counts, Christian Bale especially, his journey of self-discovery regarding his emotions is carefully handled, and Bale truly excels with conveying every newly discovered feeling Preston has in this film. <br /> <br />Sadly, this movie did not do well in the box-office, mostly due to other sci-fi films of recent time overshadowing it's possibility, films such as, \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Minority Report\\", and \\"Star Wars - Episode 2:  Attack of the Clones\\".  Though it didn't do well, it has enjoyed a fairly strong following on DVD that serves as a testament to the film's quality, that even though it didn't produce strong box-office numbers, doesn't mean it's not a good movie that audiences will enjoy and pay money to see on DVD.  If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the other movies I listed above, or even just an action movie/martial arts fan, then I truly believe that you will enjoy \\"Equilibrium\\".  So do yourself a favor and rent it today, you won't be sorry. <br /> <br />\\"Equilibrium\\" is rated R for violence.
0385507755|1.0|As a former drug addict,clean 28 years, and former Director of an Internationally and well reputed and highly accredited Drug rehab Womens Program , I feel personally manipulated and dismayed by the recent events surrounding the James Frey book and slippery 'memoir genre' controversy. <br />From the Larry King kid glove interview ( Time Warner parented, as is the book publisher and movie rights purchaser) to the Oprah Winfrey 'tie it up, we've got a rep to protect, make it pretty and move on' closing statement and endorsement. This interview was so staged it was insulting. ( and really folks, did you believe for one minute that Oprah was on hold until the end of the interview because of a busy signal???) <br />One of the first commandments to a successful recovery is learning to shed your past skin and work on becomming honest with yourself and others. No embellished war stories allowed. Period. <br /> No embellishments for the sake of making your past seem tougher and badder because that stuff is not supposed to be important anymore, unless of course you wish to continue being the ' giant of your dreams\\" and the \\" dwarf of your fears\\".  <br />James's need to embellish for the sake of story telling seriously discounts his current credibility and his message as a recovering drug addict and alchoholic speaking to other recovering addicts and alchoholics. And does insult to people like myself who have accomplished enough years under our belt to be authoritive in this matter. <br />My own experiences are left in the past and will remain there, thank you very much, but if they reared their ugly heads they, by comparison, would make James Frey's recount ( even the embellished version) seem that of an overindulged, spoiled, party boy weekend warrior addressing the Hamptons cocktail circuit where AA meetings are a place to see and be seen and entering treatment is always conveniently scheduled during the dreary winter months.  <br />Though I ,like everyone, else enjoyed hiscontemporary Haiku and Soho-esque Spillane approach to his story and personally relate to the not for me 12 step approach and writings of the Dalai Lama, I repeatly wondered how he was able to remember so much and with such detail, given that those periods are usually such a blurr as many of us know.  <br />Now I know his formula. <br />I don't want my money back but would have preferred the straight deal from the begining. <br />Shame on you James. And ..shame on you Oprah, for falling for the old 'rope-a- dope', flimsy 18 to 432 page, fiction vs. fact equation. <br />That's like saying \\" Ma , I only snorted 1 line and there were 8 lines of coke on the table.( though I'm an ex addict not an ace mathematician) <br />I hope I'm wrong, but I think James Frey is having trouble with his perception of being succesful in his recovery and that he , his mother and Oprah Winfrey wake up and take notice and  <br />rethink the message they are sending to those people who are now in trouble and contemplating the hard and painful road to recovery. <br />Those of us who have hit bottom, and recovered, have.
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel must be an intriguing individual. His thoughts on religion and spirituality, so beautifully poured out in the pages of this book, had me pondering my own diverse religious background and it's validity. I was immediatley put at ease in Pi's presence. He is a fallible human like myself, but through his profound experience he became enlightened. I couldn't help but cry at the ending especially when Richard Parker made his exit. Have we not all been on the receiving end of an animal's lack of emotion? feeling that deep sense of disappointment that we were just another blip on the radar of an animal's life experience? i couldn't put this book down and stayed up way too late finishing it. i think it is a great work of literary fiction that is more than just a great story but a fable or a koan- something to ponder and take with you. i am grateful to yann martel for this book- i was touched by it and changed by it- for the better.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This album is insane. KoRn is on their seventh album and showing no signs of slowing down. And not only that, but they seem to be re-revolutionizing the industry.

0307276902|1.0|Like many readers, I was drawn in by the raw, shocking, and graphic depictions in the book.  But I wish I hadn't been.  What a waste of time.  There is nothing, NOTHING, that James Frey writes that is redeemable.  He is careful to paint himself as a thoroughly abhorrent human being, and the recent controversy about the truthfulness of his statements only makes that mosre sick.  What kind of twisted character actively works to make himself out as more vile than he is? The only explanation I can think of is that he he FEELS as if he is conscienceless, vile, and completely without remorse.  Of course, a more realistic explanation is that he is making money hand-over-fist from being foul and exaggerating it. <br /> <br />This book  may shed some light on the power of addictions, and how debasing they can be.  But it is also dangerous, in that Frey, while he supposedly chronicles his time in rehab in this book,  is careful to show himself as a maverick who never does what he's told, who doesn't listen to the lectures, seek counseling, or cooperate.  So the message is...don't bother going to rehab?  I don't understand how he can glorify his past and think that he is in some way contributing something useful to the rest of us. <br /> <br />Skip this one.
B00005JOFO|5.0|<br />I have watched the film as a result of a friend suggesting me to visit dimsix.com for a Brokeback Mountain film review.  <br /> <br />Such review forced me to go and watch the film in a movie theater and get to Amazon for more book information on this subject. <br /> <br />Well, the message of the book/film clearly is about a passionate love story between two people. Now, who are these people? Well, they are two super male cowboys with a message...a message that homosexuality and love can be paired and therefore, people could have a clear understanding about the fact that human beings are human beings and as such they can experience love and show affection for each other regardless of their sexual orientation.  <br /> <br />Regular main stream heterosexuals' society has a very difficult time to understand that homosexuals can have the same or perhaps more intense love and/or feelings as any other couple out there.  <br /> <br />Easterners are more inflexible towards to homosexuality unlike Westerns who have learned to be more tolerant. While watching those 2 guys reviewed the film, and the many others out there, I have noticed that there is and act of indifference as to what really is the issue here.  <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is a film that is going to change a lot of things in the world regarding perception and acceptance of homosexuality. In 1968 a major milestones in filming occurred- Midnight Cowboy was one of the first films about open homosexuality.   <br /> <br />Such Film brought an open message of awareness that homosexuality exists and therefore, we had to make note of it. Today, Brokeback Mountain is telling us, homosexuality was always here and as such we must learn to accepted and live with it, because it's going nowhere.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, as many guys reviewing this film, it makes them think, how many out there are still within the closet, trying to identify themselves with something or someone as they find their real sexual identities during the process...perhaps, Brokeback Mountain would be the main bridge to do it...  <br />
B000084T18|2.0|But he definitely is. I'm not saying he doesn't have talent- he does, and I'm not saying he's unintelligent- he's not, but he's not Tupac, nor is he Eminem.<br /><br />\\"How To Rob\\" was hilarious, very well done and clever... this stuff just isn't.<br /><br />The featured article about this album says \\"He's been shot nine times. Incarcerated. And stabbed up and down. And that's only what's happened on 50 Cent's down time.\\"<br /><br />I wasn't aware that being shot, stabbed and thrown in jail were accomplishments. I thought you were supposed to AVOID those things. Plus, he's been shot THREE times (once in the jaw, once in each leg); nine bullets were *fired* at him- not that it really matters.<br /><br />Now, I like Patiently Waiting, and Poor Lil' Rich, but the only reason PW is worth anything is because Eminem is astounding on that track... better than almost anywhere else, and he makes 50 Cent look like an idiot by comparison.<br /><br />50 Cent's problem is that he thinks so much of himself (\\"My chromes cost more than the crib ya momma raised ya in...\\"), and seems to think he's the toughest thing ever to hit the streets- he's the only rapper I've ever heard who thinks a bullet to the head won't do him any harm. Everyone else at least acknowledges that he could be killed at any moment.<br /><br />I've never heard  him say anything positive- unlike Tupac, say, and he raps about the same crap on nearly every song... \\"I tell the hoes whatever they wanna hear;\\" about money and hoes.
0307276902|3.0|Although I rated this book as OK I still could not put it down! The author's use of capital letters to help us understand the rage and intensity of his feelings was very effective.  I work in the health care industry and am faced with helping those with addictions on a daily basis.  If I gained nothing else from this book, the feeling of being in the body of an addicted person raised my awareness of what a seemingly insurmountable task it is for these poor humans to break free from addiction.  I believe this book will help others in different ways, depending on why they came to read it in the first place.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|We rented this movie because it was highly recommended by people we knew as a romatic comedy. It was cute, but definitely not as good as the hype.
B000BMSU68|4.0|while it was nice to see the extras on the dvd, and to see and <br />hear the stars of the film talk about the movie, onequestion <br />remains! whatever happened to mia sara! whwn you consider that she was the third of the stars of the movie, why no updated <br />interview with her? has she fallen so far below the radar that <br />they did'nt even to include her? still, all in all, an enjoyable <br />edition to an enjoyable film
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is STILL the greatest film I've ever seen.<br /><br />But I especially like the people on this page who complained that Citizen Kane wasn't presented in it's \\"original wide screen ratio\\". HELLO! 4:3 IS the original ratio. There WAS no widescreen yet. (Gosh, I hope they were just playing around...) T<br /><br />his film is as fresh, exciting, and great today as I imagine it was in 1941. If you haven't seen it, you haven't seen what great American film can be.<br /><br />But, seriously, have a little fun, read the one-star reviews. They're entertaining. I especially like the one where they guy said to go buy \\"Cops and Robbersons\\" instead. I think they're having fun with us.

This book provides easy to use strategies for creating systems and working strategically on your business.   <br /> <br />Many business books can get a bit dry, all charts and graphs, and stories of huge corporations, but this book focuses on you, the small business owner.  It challenges you to think differently about your business.  As a woman I'm also very concerned about my time because I have many other family responsibilities; this book helped me get clear on my priorities.  It was an easy and enjoyable read.  <br /> <br />The E-Myth Worldwide website has a new online community for business owners that I also really enjoyed.

0316168815|4.0|I don't know why it is but I always read the literary classics that are known to be classics such as Les Miserables(way too long), or Lord of the Flies(good one) or Animal Farm(cute and well-written). Well on the back of this book, one review says that Lovely Bones is a literary classic so I thought let's check it out. It's a good read but it's not really a page turner like what happened to me and Memoirs of a Geisha or Animal Farm.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is 14 and she's narrating the story of life for her family. Only catch is she's dead, raped and murdered by her neighbour George Harvey and she's narrating the story of her family grieving and dealing with it from beyond the grave in her heaven. Here she sees her sister deal with it as well as finding love, the boy Susie liked and the bitter breakup of her parents.<br /><br />There's a book by a Canadian author named Thomas King called Medicine River where each chapter has an event in the past and the present and they have some kind of theme in common. Lovely Bones' structure is similar with Susie mentioning a past memory but they tend to come very random and it's hard to tell whether she's speaking in a past tense or narrating the present and once she mentions the words murder or my body you go \\"oh ok\\".<br /><br />You can tell there's a talent at work when she writes as she's not plodding or meticulous in the language so that it's hard to tell what's happening(something I hated about Tolkien books) but her writing style's easy to follow without being grade 6 material. An event very late in the book concerning Susie pulling a body-snatching is nicely written but it's awkward story-wise.<br /><br />The book is apparently being made into a film with Peter Jackson directing so it'd be nice to see what he does with it. But in book form, it's a good read.
0156027321|2.0|I found this book a total bore. Another example of the death of writing. I have read better cereal boxes.
0385510454|3.0|Grisham is first and foremost a good storyteller and for that he deserves credit. It's a dying art because it requires humility in a writer. Usually Grisham builds up the suspense perfectly until there's a big ending, but in this book the build up really didn't pay off. It was well written and quite descriptive but then....not much.  Not bad, not great, but not up to his usual abilities, I'm afraid.
0553801503|3.0|There are a three clearly dominant fantasies in today's markets as measured by raw sales: Jordan's Wheel of Time, Goodkind's Sword of Truth, and Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Critically, Martin's work is by far the superior. Yet the problems that plague Jordan and Goodkind seem to begin to infect Martin. Jordan's work is (occasionally) well written and interesting yet the series is impossibly sprawling. The proposition of a 13+ book series with its current scope is more fit for an encyclopedia than a tale and the concept of it surviving in any meaningful form is after the current wave of sales is absurd. Goodkind is like a halfway decent song set on endless replay. In order to encourage sales the series gets longer, digressions more pronounced, every battle more bloody, every torture more painful, and every rape more profoundly immoral. Occurrences of the \\"Very Long Fantasy Novel\\" (or VLFN coined by Tim Wagner) is polluting the genre and exploiting its most ardent fan base. Martin's work is beginning to betray these same symptoms of exploitation and decline. The storylines and \\"major\\" characters are breeding and multiplying. An end is no where in sight. The overall speed of the plot is slowing in a long, deceleration curve as the plotlines breed. What began as an intense and excellent fantasy series is quickly lapsing. Whole sections of the original tale have been virtually abandoned: Bran and Rickon since Book 2, Daenerys since Book 3, and now Jon Snow and The Wall in this Book 4. There really is no good reason or excuse for this. Editors should exist to stop this. Publishers should take the long-term approach and avoid these problems rather than aim for the easy dollar. Publishing more than necessary means a lot more short-term money in immediate sales but these are books that could have survived many editions and many generations of readers if done properly. If Martin cannot get back on course on his very next book-and by that we essentially mean end the Song,we worry for the legacy of the entire work.It may already be too late.   <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />A Feast for Crows launched in to the market on the bestseller lists immediately. Obviously, a great many people who like fantasy series like George RR Martin and have eagerly anticipated this publication. Martin is satisfying those cravings set in motion generations and decades ago by Tolkien and he has no serious rival in contemporary publishing.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Two questions here: can we recommend this book as a \\"first read in the series\\" for people who like fantasy? No, certainly not. This book is part of a true series and cannot be read alone. Oddly, this is the first time we've said this about A Song of Ice and Fire; we think each of the first three could probably be read and enjoyed on their own. This book-all of its great moments-are given that greatness based upon the power of prior books. The second question: can we recommend this book to people outside the genre of fiction and speculative fiction in general? We're not entirely decided yet... but probably not. While earlier books, when they concentrated on character and historical parallels held great possibility to winning converts over to works of fantasy, the series' length is trapping it in the paradigm of everything that is held in contempt by those outside of the genre. In short, unless you are already an initiate in this world that Martin is creating, you should probably avoid this book or at minimum seek earlier publications.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
0307276902|3.0|Take it from a REAL recovered drug addict--I didn't spend my time reading books when I was in the depths of addiction.  Don't waste you time thinking this book is going to help one addict seek treatment since they're all to busy either searching for or enjoying their next high.  This book is a good example of how adept addicts are at conning straight people; take it from me, I was an expert at spinning tales when I needed cash for drugs or sympathy.  Once you catch an addict in a lie (or series of lies), odds are better-than-not the whole story is a lie--except for the self-admission of being an addict (works every time).
0440241588|4.0|If you're a Grisham fan - you'll enjoy this book. However ....  <br /> <br />I found this book enjoyable.  It kept me entertained on a few long business flights.  A constant crescendo from the beginning of the book, it all made sense, kept me turning the pages, descriptive characters, believable plot, etc. The ending seemed rushed and abrupt.   <br /> <br />Maybe it's just me but many of Mr. Grisham's books leave me scratching my head at the end and wanting more. <br />
0307276902|2.0|I read this book and I liked it.  I liked it because some of the things he went through seemed so unbelievable, but it was not a book of fiction -- that amazed me! The shocking first page -- waking up on the plane, covered in blood, no memory of what happened -- I was AMAZED! I kept thinking -- no way that could have happened -- they wouldn't let this guy on the plane, but this was a memoir!!  Was the story regarding his dental work an \\"embelishment\\" or did it really happen. It was fascinating because it was true...now it's just over-the-top writing.
1400032717|2.0|With sincerest apologies to anyone who is autistic, this book is horrid.  First of all, the murder of the dog is solved halfway through - all that's left is a bunch of ramblings by the author about the autistic child's different way of seeing the world.  Nothing new here.  But, I've known autistic people who speak and write and who don't start 42 consecutives sentences or paragraphs with the word \\"And\\" .... as did happen in this book or at least until I got tired of counting them (there were more).  In the last 40 pages or so, I only got the feeling that the author was trying to hurry to finish it and get to his next book.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks. Anything with Tom is a safe bet. This movie is no different. The movie has a great story line that real fresh and interesting. The movie really makes sense in todays world where kids loose their Christmas spirit at a very early age. I think this is a good movie for kids and adults.
0440241413|5.0|Although I am typically a dramatic fiction reader, this book nearly made me roll on the floor laughing at times!  I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's light, humorous style of writing, and am happy that there are several books in this series.  Definitely an entertaining way to spend an evening!
B00005JNX0|4.0|This movie is a good movie, I enjoyed it, as did my wife and daughter. I say it was a good movie because it had a well rounded cast of actor including Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, and Jada Pinket Smith. Although it was good it didn't stand out above any other animated movie of the last 10 years. It seems that everyone is on the wild animal, jungle kick. Well it is about time to move on. I like this movie, but the story line and characters are worn out.
B00005T30L|5.0|Nevermind what ma and pa kettle said. This is a wonderful movie. I've always assumed that if you don't \\"get it\\" then obviously you're one of the people the film mocks.  <br /> <br />Thora Birch is pitch perfect as Enid, the sarcastic, vulnerable and often times immature heroine. It's great to see a character so flawed but still so lovable. She is exactly like all the alienated girls from my high schools; alternating between moments of profound wisdom and profound stupidity. <br /> <br />It's called being human. <br /> <br />The story meanders a bit which seems to echo the characters' meandering so I didn't mind it. <br /> <br />The moneyshot performance is given by Illeana Douglas as the cheesy, summer school art teacher. She embodies the role without winking at the audience, totally playing it straight. <br /> <br />Buy this movie. Trust me. You'll watch it a lot.
6302719631|2.0|The only good thing about this film is that, at 90 minutes, it is relatively short. The acting was so bad I felt embarassed for the actors. The costumes were amaturish and laughably hideous, as if the actors were in some sort of competition to see who could be the ugliest. But the soundtrack---the soundtrack was in a league of its own. Strange Enya-like synthesizers! A saxaphone that sounded like it came right out of \\"Careless Whispers\\"! And a voice solo that reeked of Ariel in Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" (Ahh ahh ahhhhh! Ahh ahhh AHHHH!)After the first thirty minutes, my roommate announced she was going to bed (it was 9 o'clock). As this left me alone, with no one to make sarcastic comments to, the movie instantly became pointless. The only way one could enjoy this film is if one was simultaneously enjoying large quantities of alcohol or illicit, preferably hallucinagenic, drugs. For my part, when the credits rolled I stumbled away from my television with scorched retinas and the tragic knowledge that the hour and a half I'd just wasted could never be regained.     I'm rating it two stars because I figure it is still (slightly) better than \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space.\\" The book is wonderful and hilarious and would make an excellent movie--sort of a \\"Scream\\"/\\"Clueless\\"/\\"Cold Comfort Farm.\\" I hope some competent director/actors/production company/costume designers/casting agents/key grips/gaffers (really, blame for this travesty on celluloid must be shared by all responsible) will make a lovely adaptation someday. Then we can buy up and destroy all remaining copies of this version, like Cat Stevens tried to do with his albums, after his conversion to Islam.
B000002E5J|5.0|Back in the day where Shakira was real and had a unique style, I should know since in Colombia everyone has watched her since day one. I remember the first time I heard this wonderful album... It was like so personal, poetic, philosophical and UNIQUE... At this time Shakira was hardly known, she was not famous at all. But soon in Colombia her style was being recognized. I declare that the most artistic stage in Shakira was with this album. It really set her apart, now as you hear new albums of the modern Shakira.. You are like where is this girl I once had known or at least I thought I knew. Everything was fine even when DONDE ESTA LOS LADRONES came out, after that all her work in my opinion has been worthless, is like she has lost the person she once was, the typical Colombian girl dreamer... I mean she forgot her roots... You can see it in her songs... It's just sad... In Colombia she is remembered for PIES DESCALZOS album.. She is loved for it, now see for yourself and ask for Shakira.. They will say: We love old Shakira, this new one she is pretending to be in the past years, we dont know about and want nothing to do with it. I state that my favorite album of all times in general even including other artists is PIES DESCALZOS, you have to hear it attentively and relate to it, to truly understand it's meaning, that new songs just dont have it. <br /> <br />~ Stephanie ~ OLD SHAKIRA'S FAN, GIRL WE WANT YOU AS REAL AS YOU STARTED, DONT LET YOUR LIFESTYLE CHANGE THE DREAMER, FULL OF HOPE FRIENDLY PERSON YOU ONCE WERE... IT WILL REFLECT IN YOUR SONGS...
0307276902|4.0|Just in the beginning, he is is a plane with his 4 front teeth knocked out, a hole in his cheek, and a broken nose. He is taken down and finds his parents, and his mother in tears. She just can't stand to look at him. They send him to a help center, where it is to help him stop drinking and stop doing the drugs. Don't you think that they would help him stop smoking too. But instead, the people working there just smokes with him.  <br /> <br />If you are not good with blood, and getting sick type things, this is not the book for you. He ends up getting \\"sick\\" everyday. He goes to the bathroom, throwing up blook and some of his stomach every single day until later on.  <br /> <br />He does end up having problems with some people at the center. Also, when this happens, sometimes he can't control himself and fights back. This one person complains that the bathrooms aren't clean, and he starts cursing at him, he gets right into his face choking him.  <br /> <br />If you have been reading this article lately, you probably know that this book is not right for kids. It is too gross, and also, the curse words. In the first few pages, there are at least 20 curse words common. If there is a fight, there is usually 10-15 curses on a page.  <br /> <br />If you have been looking at the news lately, you have probably seen that the author, James Frey, has been lying about all of this nonsence and craziness. Now we know that all of his continuations will not be true and we can't trust him. I don't care if the book is true of false, I still read it if the book is interesting. Nothing is in my way to stop me from reading it.
0307276902|3.0|Before the Smoking Gun, I was skeptical about all of Frey's escapade stories. I took them as coming from the mouth of someone who was drugged up most of the time who seemed to be addicted to getting peoples' attention.  <br />As fiction, the book is a page turner with the descriptions of getting off drugs and alcohol, dental surgery without pain killers, rejecting the 12 step philosophies in the rehab and leaving. The stuff about his girlfriend Lilly is overdone and gets annoying after a while. I was hoping she would have left rehab earlier so we could focus more on the other interesting characters (the bald man, the judge, the boxer, the van driver, etc). There is also a tendency for the book to use shock value and there are a few episodes near the end where almost any former user would have relapsed. The dialogue is very hard to follow at times as one has to take a double take to figure out who is saying what. <br />The biggest controversy to me is Frey's assertion that he quit alcohol and drugs by conscious choice without 12 step groups or the assistance of a \\"higher power.\\" The continued failure of rehabilitation and his assertion should also be talking points besides the controversy over the authenticity of this novel. <br />I'm giving it 3 stars for how it works as a fiction piece BTW.
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul McCartney's post-Beatle work has been very unpredictable. On his first few records, like McCartney and Ram, it seemed like he hadn't really gotten the knack of being a solo artist--though the latter had its moments.     Then in 1973, he released what was by far his best solo work in Band On The Run. He continued producing solid work with Wings; at least until this band ran out of juice with Back To The Egg.     Most of his 1980s material was forgettable--the lowlight, of course, being his disastrous movie, Give My Regard To Broadstreet with the accompanying soundtrack. While he made a diligent effort at a comeback with Flowers In The Dirt, that record never really captured the imagination of music fans, even if it did have some good songs on it. The follow-up, Off The Ground in 1992, was simply more of the same, and really didn't seem very inspired.    In other words, it really seemed like Paul was just going through the motions.    Which is why his involvement with the Beatles Anthology in 1995 was just what he needed. Maybe it was recollecting his glory years with the Beatles, or recording with George, Ringo and the late John. Whatever, his next solo effort, Flaming Pie, was the record his fans had long hoped for, and wondered if he would ever produce again.     From the folksy \\"Song We Were Singing\\" and \\"Calico Skies\\" to the rocking \\"If You Wanna\\" and \\"Young Boy\\", to the very Beatles-like \\"Beautiful Night\\" (complete with Ringo on drums and backing vocals), there is something for everyone. I have to say, though, Paul really is at his best when it's just him and his acoustic guitar--namely on the aforementioned \\"Calico Skies,\\" and the album's closer, \\"Great Day.\\" \\"Heaven On A Sunday,\\" which features a guitar duet with his son James, is also a solid number.     However, I only give Flaming Pie 4 stars instead of 5, because 2 of the songs really drag down the whole record. \\"Really Love You\\" is touted as the first song he ever co-wrote with Ringo Starr. After listening to it, you understand why. It just drags on and on, the same beat, and nothing really happens. Simply put, a rock and roll song should never make you want to go and take a nap, but this one does. (Paul and Ringo must have had a short conversation afterwards. Paul: \\"Let's never do this again.\\" Ringo: \\"Uh, yeah.\\")    Not quite as bad, but still something of a letdown is \\"Used To Be Bad,\\" a bluesy duet with Steve Miller. The collaboration is nice, and Paul's guest is certainly up to the task. But hearing Paul sing how he \\"used to be bad, but I ain't gonna be bad no more\\" is just lame--especially coming from the guy who sang such wishy-washy numbers as \\"Another Day,\\" \\"Wonderful Christmas Time,\\" and even \\"The Long & Winding Road.\\" Unlike Miller, he is simply miscast as the rough and tumble dude who's trying to change his ways.    Thankfully, those two lackluster efforts are the only blemishes on an otherwise fine effort. This is clearly Paul's best record since Band On The Run, and well worth your investment.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Although many of my friends ar Firefly enthusiasts, I've only seen a select few episodes of the series; however, I still enjoyed Serenity for itself, although I acknowledge that there're probably many things I'm missing.<br /><br />For its slim budget, they came through with some pretty impressive graphical effects, and is definitely a quality action movie in addition to all the other things it is (\\"space western\\", \\"opera\\", \\"comedic drama\\", etc).<br /><br />Some of the subplots may not be as developed as you'd hope, but there are several interesting deleted scenes in the special features that you'll just have to see for yourself.<br /><br />An enjoyable movie for Firefly fans and non-fans.
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is most succinctly described as being seven parts sublime and two parts above average. More often than not, the various shorts of this feature rise to the occasion in splendid fashion, with only a few tarnished spots that very slightly dampen the overall shine of this production.<br /><br />To begin with, the animation in The Animatrix is brilliant. To those looking for eye-candy please look no further. Nearly every short features some of the most astounding visuals that have ever been seen by any fan of the animated medium. What's more is that there also exists an astounding degree of stylistic variety from feature to feature. The moving artwork here exists as sort of an animated smorgasbord, from which even the most discerning otaku will find something to his/her delight. The action from both \\"Beyond\\" and \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" would please the most hardened action fan, and the formalistic elements used in the animation of \\"World Record\\" are inspired. I for one will certainly carry some of the haunting imagery of The Second Renaissance within my psyche for a good time to come. The only exception to the mostly excellent visuals, in my humble view, was the animation in \\"Kid's Story\\", which just felt a bit sloppy when matched against its stately brethren. However, overall I cannot say enough great things about the general animation quality of The Animatrix.<br /><br />One might be inclined to think that, since the average running time for each of these short films is only a mere 9 minutes or so, that character and plot development would naturally suffer. Often enough one would probably be correct, but certainly not in this case. In reality the most powerful surprise of The Animatrix is just how much it manages to cram into so little a package. The scope of each piece is usually limited enough (unlike its mother feature, namely the theatrical Matrix film) that a full and satisfying story can be found in an impossibly short span of time. In addition, since the continuity in which these films play has already been established, they are mostly free to explore the niche-like peculiarities of the matrix universe. In fact, the only two shorts that were lackluster in plot development were \\"Program\\" and \\"Matriculated\\". The plot of the former served mostly as an excuse for an admittedly entertaining adrenaline-laden fight scene, while \\"Matriculated\\", though conceptually interesting, was poorly executed. It left me wondering whether or not the feature really had any meaning at all or if I happened to eat some bad mushrooms prior to my viewing. Despite these missteps, though, the plot movement was unexpectedly strong.<br /><br />The characters of each short are also by-and-far ingeniously planned. Every action taken and every word spoken lends itself to the understanding of the motivations of the players within each story arc. The characters of each minor anime flick are additionally quite easy to sympathize with, despite the brevity of their screen time. Indeed, I was very intrigued by the purpose and demeanor of the leads in \\"World Record\\" and \\"A Detective Story\\", as well as being touched by the final tenderness between lovers in the \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\". Again, considering the length of the various individual features, the characterization cannot usually be described as anything but exemplary.<br /><br />Very few viewers would not be impressed by The Animatrix. It seamlessly blends an assortment of unique and dynamic perspectives into an anthology that is so close to flawless that I was left in near-awe. Virtually every component of this viewing experience lends itself considerably to building an atmosphere of electrifying excitement and profound intrigue. It belongs in an elite category of animated features that deserves to be viewed by all willing anime fans. Aside from very minor mishaps, The Animatrix is plainly worthy, 'nuff said.<br /><br />If you really don't like sci-fi or the Matrix films I would drop a star from what I have rated. But really I think if you hated the film due to confusement; this will explain a bit more.I would drop a star from what I have rated.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|I used to have this on vinyl, good piece of work from the least respected Beatle I thought. The whole album is just amazing and makes me wonder why he didn't get more air play back when they were fab. It opens with the title track and moves on to That's What It Takes, sounds a lot like ELO, but still sounds pretty good, remember Jeff Lynn helped him with this project, so it will resemble a little bit. I love Devil's Radio, awsome, just like I would imagine it for this ex-Beatle. Wreck of The Hesperus, good. And of course Got My Mind Set On You, a little bit of 50's influence there. So pick up this gem, and soon George can tell you When We Was Fab, his own way.
0307276902|3.0|I read this book having been told, oh this really happened.  While I give the gentleman credit for a great writing style and ingenius dilagoue, I feel like he made a cheap million off of me and my closest friends.  He lied to sell a book.  That's what he did.  And the reason people are upset is because he lied to sell a book.  He made me feel sorry for him.  And now I doubt he did crack or anything else.  Having seen his picture and knowing some of the facts behind his case, I imagine he was a spoiled college kid who's parents didn't spend enough time with him who later found out he drank one too many cocktails and, like so many other rich college kids, had a bag of cocaine lying around.  Then they paid for rehab. <br /> <br />A great book, read it as fiction.  And someone, please, put pressure on these publishers to put books where they belong.  This is most definitely a work of fiction, with real life consequences.  I don't believe no one was hurt by this.
B000005IU2|5.0|Yeh people you can argue all day long about this being the beginning of punk, and you can also argue that this beats the Stones, the Velvets, or even Paul on the White Album, but that's not going to change my mind on how I like this particular album, it's just sweaty good rock and roll to the bone. And I can honestly say that I don't think they were trying to impress any certain crowd, so shut your pie hole. This album sounds rebellious as an angry step child should sound after getting his feet smashed by an hammer with LA Blues, good little riff on the Loose number, and Down On The Street a good little jam session. Dirt, a little more relaxed. Yes you can hear a little influential Jim Morrison here, but not so much to get your knickers in a bundle. So just get ballistic, enjoy this little album's Fun House.
B0002S947K|5.0|I found his lyrics and voice beyond words. The entire album has powerful lyrics and you can feel the conviction in his voice when he sings. By far the best new artist breaking out. Can't wait to hear more from him in the future.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm still really butt hurt that Layne Staley death was sudden, and all we\\"re left with are memories of good rockin' 90's music, when it was the best, cause lets face it, it sucks right now. Now lets get back to this album, Dirt, brings back high school all over again, did I mention HIGH. Yes folks that is what this album is about, but we all knew that, hopefully we grew out of it too, but still this album is good to listen to, all the way thru, no slowing down here, just a complete musical rush from point A. From Them Bones to Would?. And the in betweens like Sickman, Down In A Hole, and of course Rooster. I also like Junkhead, good little ditty even though what it speaks of. So put yourself back to 1992, hopefully not a bad memory, and enjoy a memorable album by a grungy band from Seattle called Dirt by one of my favorite bands from the 90's, Alice In Chains. R.I.P Layne.

Together, they become an unlikely crime-fighting duo as they go after a quartet of gorgeous Brazilian criminals who look like they just stepped out of the pages of Vanity Fair or Vogue (quite possibly the least believable criminals in movie history).  And if this synopsis doesn't sound like the setup for a cinematic disaster to you, you obviously have a much lower threshold for movie comedy than I do.<br /><br />Trapped in a vehicle that is practically a blueprint for how NOT to make an effective comedy, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon have nothing to do for 97 minutes but exchange witless one liners in between highly preposterous and ultimately very boring car chases.  Although the two lead actors try their best with what they've been given, they're eventually overcome not only by bad writing and by-the-numbers direction but by a bunch of supporting actors who give uniformly dreadful performances (including a sadly misused Ann Margaret).<br /><br />What COULD they all have been thinking of?
B000002UBB|5.0|And I can say that too because I was 2 years old when this album came out and my uncles had it and I can say I still like this album from the get go. The Space Intro puts you back into the nastalgics all over again which is not offered on his 1974-78 greatest hits compilations, so you're better off just getting the original album anyways. Fly Like An Eagle, even though they the death out of this number on the radio, I still seem to like it. Love the India-type music on Wild Mountain Honey, Serenade is a good little ditty to groove to. Merury Blues which was covered by many is pretty good here to but of course the anthem that should be for FM radio stations accross America Rock 'n Me, hard to believe I used to have this on 45. Anyways the album sounds pretty good and almost like a psychedellic album, but close enough spacey, good album to get if you like Steve Miller. I would also recommend Book Of Dreams, and his Anthology which covers his 60's solo effort, which also has a couple songs on which Boz Scaggs played with him on, I would though stay away from his 1974-78 greatest hits compilation, it's so incomplete and the songs are diced up on that album. Go out get this gem, it's worth it.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Every single person that is a fan of rock and metal should have this CD in their collecton. Not only is it the best AC/DC release, it ranks up there with my top 25 albums of all time. This album is super heavy, with the title track being the heaviest song that they have ever written. Its raw and full of energy. I really miss Bon Scott to this date, as Brian Johnson did a pretty good job filling his shoes (Back in Black is amazing) but the band went more into a pop/rock groove with him, then with Bon. I really dig every AC/DC album with Bon, but I believe this is the best..ENJOY
0783226063|3.0|I'm writing this review mainly as a placeholder so I'll remember later to go back and read all the others.  Reading reviews is one of the best things about amazon.com!    Dune (the book) is an outstanding SF classic which was followed by a series of inferior sequels.  So powerful is the original, that despite their lesser quality the sequels have attracted a loyal fan following to the Dune brand.      In constructing the world in which most of the story's action is set, Frank Herbert appears to borrow heavily from anthropological or possibly historical sources (a guess, I haven't confirmed this) but I consider this a strength, not a weakness.  The book is one of a few early examples of successful extension of SF speculation from purely hard science disciplines into social sciences.    The movie doesn't do justice to the book by any means, but how could it?  The single-film format just doesn't fit.  PJackson took the right path to interpreting LOTR; similarly Dune demands two-part treatment (at least).      I can understand why people who hadn't read the book hated this movie.  So much was left out!  Not extraneous stuff either, but info central to understanding the story & why it is worthwhile to attend to its telling.  Dune is about political intrigue, personal challenge, and messianic religous fervor.  You can't reduce that to a series of thrilling action sequences; backstory is all.    There are several minor flaws as well - although I consider one of them a most grievous cinematic sin.  A pet peeve of mine is directors who demand that I suspend disbelief & accept a reality in which intersteller travel & \\"magical\\" abilities are commonplace - and then, when the script requires screaming & hollering, treat me to a closeup of decidedly mundane silver dental fillings.      As often happens, I didn't like the movie's versions of key characters either.  Paul is WAY too old and the Baron WAY too one-dimensionally satyric/moronic, and as for Lady Jessica!  How reduced inpurpose and complexity!  Her pretty movie persona is actually BORING!    One characterization did impress me however - that of Piter de Vries.  The Baron's evil majordomo was not especially interesting until I saw the movie, but now I envision him as a head house slave in the Ottoman style, his competence immensely valuable and therefore, immensely threatening to his master.  Consequently, he is half mad with anxiety a good deal of the time.      The movie made me understand Piter's desire for Lady Jessica, which struck me as arbitrary and jarring when I read the book.  Twisted as his intention may be, Piter's interest seems inevitable when their positions in the two feuding families are compared.  Jessica is his \\"light side\\" counterpart.    To sum up, this movie is a favorite because it was a brave attempt to do what still is worth doing - bring a great classic SF novel to a wider audience.  I hope someone will take up the challenge more successfully.  But meanwhile, if you love Dune the book, Dune the movie is worthy of your attention.    (Plus there's a fun bonus - watch Dune, then check out the desert scenes in Star Wars.  Coincidence????)
1590710487|4.0|Most if not all of the facts of this book will not be new to John's fans.  Especially those who have read the eight-or-so books already written about or by him and his friends and family.   <br /> <br />And, title aside, it is not really a biography; it is an oral and pictorial history.  But that is its strength.  The voices of those friends & family come through, showing their love for the man.   <br /> <br />But the interesting thing is, as awesome as some of the stories may be (especially to those who haven't read them before); the pictures do an even more excellent job. <br /> <br />Some of the photos were previously seen in SAMURAI WIDOW and WIRED, but most are never before published.  And in them, you can see the buildup from Belushi's boyhood through the first three years of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  Then the explosion when that show, ANIMAL HOUSE, and the Blues Brothers record all hit at the same time.   <br /> <br />And then the fallout.  Visually, I think you can mark the moment when the road turned hard for John; it's in a full-page picture, on page 172, of him in costume for 1941.   <br /> <br />It's in his eyes.  Look at most of the photos that precede this one, and there is a light in them, something that's growing, some kind of spark.   <br /> <br />And though it's probably too simple to say that Hollywood stunted that growth and killed that spark, it's also, probably, accurate. <br /> <br />Because in most of the post-1941 photos, that spark is gone, with only a brief resurgence in the pictures taken during the filming of CONTINENTAL DIVIDE. <br /> <br />This was apparently a happy (if not always fun) time for John, and the pictures reflect that.  Unfortunately, more so than the movie, which is enjoyable but instantly forgettable. <br /> <br />The key picture here for me is on page 222.  It shows Belushi wrapped in a blanket, sitting on some cabin steps in his stocking feet.  He's just sitting, and staring, and thinking of god knows what, but the image has an apparent vulnerability that the photogenic John rarely showed in pictures.  He was a man who always seems to have known where the camera was and how to keep its eye on him.  Not here.   <br /> <br />But CONTINENTAL DIVIDE flopped, and in the photos that follow, he mostly looks wasted.  I don't mean that with the drug connotation, I mean that spark was being denied again. <br /> <br />A note at the end proclaims, \\"This book is not objective,\\" and it isn't, so bully for them for admitting it.  It's an attempt to bring a loved one back to life by talking about him.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Three of the best films of all time are available on DVD for the first time, along with a plethora of Special Features and the same great fun that made them so popular almost 30 years ago. I cannot say I belong to the original Star Wars generation, but I did see countless times the ORIGINAL trilogy before the 1997 re-release, and even after numerous big-budget sci-fi films I've seen, the story, effects, and feel of the original trilogy have so far been impossible to improve.   Yes, if you're a die-hard purist, you're better off with the VHS edition; if Greedo shooting first is such a big matter to you, you're either a complete geek or simply a person with poor criteria; as for everyone else, this is a perfect buy.  Now, the special features in the extra DVD could hardly be better, including character creation and lightsaber featurettes, the usual trailers and (multiple)TV spots for all 3 films, including one for the 2 week re-release of \\"A New Hope\\" and for the 1997 trilogy re-release. Also included is an entertaining \\"Battlefront\\" game demo for XBox and a \\"Making of\\" for the Episode III videogame. There are still more features but it would be unnecessary to list them, the sheer weight of the movies is enough to warrant a purchase.  It is in fact doubtful that the new computer sequences and the added and restructured scenes do anything more than improve the movies aesthetically, but if you don't have a problem with a CGI Sarlaac, then by all means, buy now!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|One of the best bands ever(Axl pissed it away) so why not a greatest hits. I have no idea why I bought this album I own everyone of their albums. But if you don't own any GNR and like them buy this because well it pretty good. I wish Axl would come out of hiding and release the 10000 hours of music they have done.
0393317552|5.0|Well written, very enlightening concepts, and highly recommended.  I later saw the PBS series, which was a treat after reading this.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Well Korn has always been one of those bands where everytime I listen to there CD it seems to sound better. Through the changes that they went through this last year this is a pretty good album it sounds like the korn of old. It kicks the crap of there last album \\"take a look\\" which I like some of but never really got into it. I really don't see this being a big hits CD it is a good CD that is sold all the way through.
0307276902|5.0|I understand that no one likes being lied to and I don't condone it, but I cannot believe how upset people are getting over this.  When I read this book initially I found it in the recovery section of a bookstore and assumed it was fiction from the beginning. I found out it was considered non-fiction after I had finished reading the novel. It didn't affect my opinion of the book at all, it's still a great read. And any time that I ever recommended it to anyone, I never once mentioned that it was a true story. I only said that it was a great book and I loved the writing style. I don't understand people's anger with the \\"embellishment\\" unless this book made you lose your job, caused family conflict, or forced you to make a decision that affected your personal life in a negative way. Our President lies to us on a regular basis and I've never seen this much coverage on it. If it's fiction then it's a great piece of fiction! If you're looking for a true story to mirror your life after then I'm sorry I guess this book isn't for you.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A was the first Radiohead album that I had ever heard, and the first time I'd heard any of their music other than the songs \\"Creep\\", \\"Karma Police\\", and \\"No Surprises\\" on the radio.  From the very first song I was intrigued; by the end of the second, I loved it.  It has since become one of my favorite albums (Kid A one of my favorite songs).  Tracks 1-4 make up one of the most intense and rewarding music experiences I've ever had, and in my limited music knowledge one of the strongest album-openings I've heard.  I've since come to learn that not everyone loves this album, and I am not in the least surprised as it is certainly not the band's most \\"approachable\\" work. But for those who know Radiohead, or for those who love songs that \\"take you somewhere\\", that weave and twist and float and dance into your head, and absorb the listener into themselves, into the music, and into the art of the musicians, you'll appreciate this album.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Bale has to be the best actor with enough charisma to become believeable as a super hero.  Even so I had a few negatives:  Holmes didn't add anything to the movie.  She was okay, not annoying but not memorable either.  Too bad since the rest of the cast was great.  Also some of the fight scenes were filmed up close so you couldn't see the action. I know this was deliberate but I found it confusing.  Othere than that I liked the movie and thought it went back to the orgin of Batman in an original manner.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|I walked out after an agonizing 30 minutes.  OK so the special effects are more modern; the rest is junk. The so-called tribe on the island were strictly 3rd rate the actors are unknown to me- no one with a reputation wanted to be in it or was the budget that low? It did nothing for me. By the way  Cheaper be the Dozen did not do it either. Was I having a bad day?
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Nowadays it seems to me that a lot of Indie is overhyped.  I mean seriously...think about that for a second.  Whether your a sudo-indie lover or a newcomer emo kid, there's constantly a new up and coming Indie artist that's being pushed on you as the best thing since \\"Bright Eyes\\" or the next huge underground act.  When really, it's not that much different than the literally thousands of other indie bands that liter the thousands of other indie labels.  Sure, every blue moon and one in a million an Indie band comes along that actually meets expectations.  DCFC, The Pale Pacific, and maybe even Cursive...  Those are a few Indie bands I think deserve their hype.   <br /> <br />I have actually gotten to a point where I rarely check out a band just because of their hype, especially if they're indie.  It's probable that I'll be throwing my money away on the next DCFC ripoff coming straight from Seattle: The indie/emo capitol of the world.  But for some reason, The Arcade Fire was different... <br /> <br />I first discovered this band just surfing around amazon, the same way I discover most bands now.  At first I just played them off as yet another ubiquotious indie act.  They didn't appear to have any redeeming quality.  Sure it looked to be a good rocker and had quite a bit of rave reviews, but I didn't bother. <br /> <br />But alas, The Arcade Fire persisted.  I kept coming back to them, sometimes by accident even.  So finally, the suspense got to me.  I needed to know if this band was all they were cracked up to be.  And so I purchased \\"Funeral\\" <br /> <br />It's a journey.  That's about all I can say in one word.  They're just great.  In so many ways.  The album tells such an isterestingly beautiful story through a veil of passion, emotion, and just all around great music.  It's amazing to me that although this album has an obvious overall feel of sadness and depression, it makes me feel good inside...  Almost in a manor reminescent of Connor Oberst's songs.   <br /><br />The CD cranks up with the rousing medium high tempo'd \\"Neighborhood #1\\"  From the moment I heard this first song I knew I was going to like this band.  They have great rythm, a nice group of musicians, two singers to die for, and that U.K. brit-pop feel to their music.  While this is no doubt indie music...I'm positive it sticks out from the rest. <br /> <br />Most bands rely on one of three things to produce emotion.  Instrumentation, singing, or lyrics.  The Arcade Fire manages to use all three in succession.  You'll be feeling almost scared over the building up of violins and Cellos.  It's literally head spinning how many styles and genres they can make work together.  I might even go as far to say that this album is life changing.  I could listen to these songs for days and still be entertained.  They have that much depth.  I have about 3000 songs on my mp3 player right now with so many different genres it's mind numbing.  I think I've listened to this CD more than any of them.  Yet, I haven't even started to encompass the grand scale of these songs.  Perhaps eventually I will begin to unravel the mystery behind this band.   <br /> <br />So really, I'll get to the point.  You need to buy this.  I don't care who you are and I won't go into musical interests but that's all you need to know.  Just buy it.  This should have been the album of 2004 hands down.  It just frikkin rocks.  I can't wait for their next release.   <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|That being the case. I will always love the 1995 BBC mini series. I could not wait until Keira Knightley's version came to America. However, I do agree that it was shorter and left you wanting.  It was over too quickly and you felt sort of cheated.  I must say I thought the actor that played Mr. Wickam was much better looking than the Mr. Wickam of the mini series. <br />Also, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine lacked character and was not a very good role for her so I was very disappointed. I'm a fan of Judi Dench's. And I really missed Colin Firth. Oh no one plays Mr. Darcy like Colin!  NO ONE.  So, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as far as I'm concerned still rein as the only true Lizzie and Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />I might add my sister is a great fan of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. She also was just getting over a treatment of chemotherapy for breast cancer and my niece and I decided to have a Pride and Prejudice Birthday party for her.  It was wonderful.  We all dressed in long skirts or dresses, white gloves, hats and we each brought a beautiful tea cup and saucer to the party.  At the end we drew numbers and whatever number was on the bottom of the saucer that matched ours we got to take home.  My sister was overwhelmed and very happy that we did that for her.  We also blew up a photograph of Colin Firth (whom she loves) signed it and framed it for her.  We put that beside her place of honor at the table which was ladened with scones and tea cakes, muffins and teas.  It was great and we plan to do it again this year!  It doesn't have to be anyone's birthday to have a Pride and Prejudice Party!  Step out of this world and into Lizzie's! <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This CD is so soothing.  After her last release, I wanted more, and this CD delivers from the first track to the last.  Don't waste your money on Madonna's disaster and try this CD, and you'll see how good it truly is.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|An interesting film on arms trafficking, but too pedagogical in many ways. It tries to prove too much and it misses the real point.<br /><br />The real point is not the horror of these tribal or neighborly wars.<br /><br />The point is not the corruption of all the little warlords in Africa and other areas in the world.<br /><br />The point is not the domination of arms trafficking by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.<br /><br />The point is not even the rottenness of the politicians of western countries, of developed and emerging countries.<br /><br />The point is the hyena that lives in the human heart. The idea sure is present in the film, but not shown the way it should be shown.<br /><br />There is no escape from this basic idea that the human being is a predator against his own species, hence a cannibalistic predator, one of the very rare animal species that has this characteristic. Somewhere this film tries to save the human side of that predator.<br /><br />There is no saving of that human side because there is no human side. The human side is nothing but an illusion projected by hypocrites to hide their tracks and footprints. That's what the film should have shown in the most realistic way. Unluckily it did not dare. It tried to save humanity and show it is manipulated by the few predators that would be living in our midst.<br /><br />But these are not a few. As soon as a human being, especially in a group, a band, a gang, or whatever collective structure or party (all meanings of this word intended), has a little piece of power, that human being is going to turn predator. The trade-unionists in a strike will kidnap and keep hostages the engineers or managers of their business. The minority students will block their universities to force classes out and they will speak of a strike and pretend their diplomas and degrees must not be retained from them as a payment for their strike just like a worker loses a day's pay for one day's strike.<br /><br />Professors or students will sell university diplomas to foreign students (maybe to French ones too) to make their week-ends comfortable. A cop will release the evidence of still not yet tried case to hurt who knows who and the public will not see the denial of the rights of the defense but plain information for the public to know. A bunch of hooligans will kill someone in public and in front of a camera just out of rage, when it is not a five year old boy who kills a five year old girl at school or some individual who starts shooting in a school, on a campus, in an underground station, a supermarket or the street, not to speak of terrorist attacks and suicide bombers. There is no end to that horrible human nature. Sainthood, saint-dom or saint-ness not to speak of sanctity do not exist on earth.<br /><br />Maybe in heaven but after death only. In this film it is more or less asserted that some cops are honest though impotent, that some people hate violence, crime and guns, that some people may prefer poverty in purity rather than wealth in blindfolded innocence. I do not believe it. There is no right side in no conflict. The working class is in no way better than the capitalists. If they get power they turn terroristic, they open and manage some gulag, or whatever procedure to eliminate the other side.<br /><br />There is no guarantee that any one human being could be in any one way innocent. Better get used to that fact.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUe.<br /><br />Professors or students will sell university diplomas to foreign students (maybe to French ones too) to make their week-ends comfortable.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is my favorite film so I'm sorry to the people who hated it.  Its meant as a surrealistic excercise, much more than a conventional dumbed down Hollywood movie where you can guess the ending by the first scene.  As someone who has been through it, whether intentional or not Eraserhead captures the world of schizophrenia and psychosis.  The unbelievable imagery cropping up, such as the scene where Henry is asked to serve dinner and encouraged to \\"cut up the chickens like regular chickens\\" and they suddenly start bleeding. Yet he is in front of his girlfriend's family so he has to pretend everything is okay.  Things pop out of nowhere, suddenly a litter of puppies, the baby he is forced to take care of is a grotesque monster that he must destroy, the asexual mother like \\"radiator lady\\" that suddenly redeems him. As well, Eraserhead captures the spirit of the times, dark, industrial and depressing. A crumbling society where everything is dehumanized and degraded as where Henry is literally turned into erasers.  This vision of a dark and bleak world was lifted by everyone from Matthew Barney to Guy Maddin to Begotton to James Fotopolous. There is no other David Lynch film like it. Aspects of Eraserhead surface in his later films but none are as bizzare or experimental.
0307276902|3.0|Couldn't put this book down, it leads the reader through every emotion which makes for a great read but was very disappointed at the ending, even mad. Mr. Frey didn't take responsibility for any of his actions, which he clearly states he wants to do. He writes 22 pages of things he's done wrong to people and he only has to confess them and then burns it?? I have a challenge for Mr. Frey, why not take all this money your making from the sale of this book, take the time, effort, expense to find all these 22 pages of people you did wrong and sit with them and give them the opportunity to share with you how what you did affected their lives! Sounds like another book to me, how 'bout it Mr. Frey? and yes i will admit i read the book before all the fall out but feel better knowing \\"parts aren't true\\", and doubt if any of it is true. I watched the Larry King Live interview, I've not met any drug user that has been using as long as Mr. Frey says he had and yet has the vocabulary that Mr. Frey does or a rehab hospital that is ok with their patients making up their own treatment plan. Soo, if you want to read a good book go for it, if you want the truth, go elsewhere
B000BVD460|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, Em will most likely go down as the most influential hiphop artist of our time.  <br /> <br />And I don't care what you say, \\"When I'm Gone\\" is worth every penny you spend on this CD. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. Gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it.
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds of Love is Kate's best release. Just like Aerial, Hounds of Love is broken into two parts, \\"Hounds of Love\\" & \\"The Ninth Wave\\". And just like Aerial, the first half has a series of songs with absolutly no connection whatsoever. But \\"The Ninth Wave\\", if you look hard enough, has a theme to it. <br /> <br />\\"Hounds of Love\\" is the first half of the disc. It has her best single, \\"Running Up That Hill\\" plus the catchy title track, \\"Hounds of Love\\". She has many different themes in this album. It goes from kind of a Bruce Almighty aspect of \\"Running Up That Hill\\" to a murderer trying to run from the law with his mother's help in \\"Mother Stands for Comfort\\". Although the first half of the disc is kind of fluffy and light, it is still a really good disc. <br /> <br />\\"The Ninth Wave\\" has a very serious theme. It goes through a woman drowning. From \\"And Dream of Sheep\\" to \\"The Morning Fog\\", the woman (and the woman being Kate herself) dies and is brought back to life by doing a good deed. Let's start from the beginning. \\"And Dream of Sheep\\" tells of a woman with insomnia who finds the need to go skating in \\"Under Ice\\". Only the woman skates over a patch of thin ice and falls through. You hear her calling out for help with no reply. \\"Waking the Witch\\" tells of the woman trying to survive the freezing conditions. Eventually, she dies and her spirit is trying to comfort her husband in \\"Watching You Without Me\\". \\"Jig of Life\\" is her trying to be brought back to life but all efforts are in vain. \\"Hello Earth\\" has an angelic theme with her trying to help sailors in a storm. Eventually, she does save the sailors and is returned to her body. \\"The Morning Fog\\" is her celbrating life anew. <br /> <br />Although this album is wide open to interpertation, it is still a great feat on Kate's part. From start to finish, Kate delivers a flawless performance of style, orginality, and grace. Kate is one of the greatest artists in existance. And this is an incredible album in her collection.
0307276902|1.0|James Frey's publisher shows disrespect, even contempt, for readers by publishing A Million Little Pieces as a memoir.  To justify it, she is trying to redefine the whole genre as one in which the author can distort the truth at will if it satisfies some larger narrative goal.  But since Frey originally shopped this book as fiction -- and it was rejected -- she reveals her own cynicism.  Would this book have gotten the attention it did if it were presented as fiction?  I don't think so.

B000001ES9|4.0|Rush often get tagged in their first few albums as being little more than a Canadian rip-off of Led Zeppelin.  The Zep influence can certainly be heard, but the album is more energetic and raw.  It is a worthy addition to any Rush collection, but more for its historic value than for it sounding as Rush does 30 years later.  This band progressed so fast over its next few albums, that this one seems left far behind; but still plenty of fun to listen to.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Some here have spoken against Johnny Depp, and how some of the facts in the film were wrong.  I am a long time fan of both Depp and \\"Peter Pan\\".  Also, the characters are real, and the play is real and the story is, in the majority, true.  I'm not sure which facts the other reviewer thinks were fudged.  However, the play, Peter Pan, is wonderful.  Although I knew that the inspiration for Peter Pan was a \\"real boy\\", I didn't know he was one of the talented DuMaurier family.  Besides showing the story of how Peter Pan was written, the film gives a quick history lesson on the life of women at the turn of the 20th century.  Kate Winslett's character is left penniless with four young boys to raise.  Still she resists the demands of the mother, who helps support her family, by allowing James Barrie to become part of their circle.  She realizes that he will contribute the male presence that her children need.  She also sees that her grieving children seem happier when they are with Barrie.  Barrie has his own problems with a career which started with a blaze of glory, a recent play which flopped and a wife who is more interested in the reflected glory she thought he would give her than trying to understand her husband.  The quixotic Depp, as the Scots playwright, includes the sparkle that he has shown in such films as \\"Chocolat\\" and \\"Pirates\\".  You may not like him, but you have to allow that he is extremely talented.  Dustin Hoffman is his usual wonderful self as the theatre producer who doesn't understand the new play, but goes along with it on the strength of Barrie's past inate theatre sense, as exasperating as it is.  Julie Christie, aging with grace and beauty, also gives a marvelous performance as Winslett's mother.  The boys are wonderful, and let's not forget Kelly MacDonald in her cameo role as \\"Peter Pan\\".  She makes me wish that she would become involved in a real stage production of Peter Pan and take her place alongside such as Maude Adams and Mary Martin inthe pantheon of actresses who have played the boy who would not grow up.   <br /> <br />I can't find anything not to like about this film.  It is a true story about the writing of a fantasy.  If you don't believe in fairy tales or fairies, simply don't clap when asked to and go find something more realistic to watch.
B000002AS3|5.0|Up until 2005- this album has stood as the quintessetial Oasis CD.  The songs are solid throughout and delivered with a very real swagger.  This CD announced that straight ahead rock was still a viable music form just when rap and grunge and rap/metal seemed poised to make \\"regular\\" rock n roll disappear forever.  The Gallaghers are characters and their sniping at other bands through the years has been entertaining (and most times they are right).  You gotta love the \\"who gives a @#$%!\\"  attitude from these guys.    This cd is loaded with great songs, live forever, supersonic, up in the sky being the highlights.  What's the Story is a bit more Beatlesque than this one, but this cd certainly gives its fair share of homage to the fab 4, the who, the stones and the rest of the original British Invasion.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This CD is much better than I expected! I liked the singled I'd heard on the radio and took a chance on this impulse buy. Normally my impulse buys are a huge let down, but I honestly LOVE this CD! Highly recommended!
B000B86S1Q|5.0|I like this book.  <br />Other than Holly's perspective of going through the grieving the loss of her husband, we also see from Gerry's about his worries of how his dear wife is going to cope without him. The series of letters he has prepared during his last days, instructed to be opened month by month, is to help her to go through the difficult times after his cross over. The moment she opens each letter at the beginning of the month never fails to make her feel that Gerry is only a breath away.  Holly also discovered more about her distant brother, Richard, whom she considered a nerd, and who has never clique in conversation and character with her, was trying to help her out in his very own way. Of course, not forgetting all her dear friends who have never fail to be there for her. <br /> <br />This book makes you laugh and thugs your heartstring, and wells your eyes with tears.
B000002J09|5.0|Led zeppelin's fourth album is in my opinion the greatest hard rock album ever recorded along with PARANOID from BLACK SABBATH.This album is excellent value for money due to classics like BLACK DOG,ROCK AND ROLL,STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN and WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS.Very highly recommended.A MUST BUY.

In a few pages you will experience, joy , sadness, fear...and almost every single emotion known to man.<br />All characters are very well developed throughout the novel, you can almost touch them and imagine them as your friends or enemies.<br />The setting of the novel is no less than Barcelona, one of the most beautifull and mystical cities in the world, in a time where life was dangerous yet simple.<br />If you have a couple of bucks for one book, do not look any further...this is the one!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Just when I had given up on Madonna, the queen of pop comes back with a killer disco album. In my personal opinion, Madonna's last two albums have been less than spectacular. I was a bit wary of \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" but I was proven wrong big time. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is stellar collection of disco-influenced tracks that makes me want to dance. I only had my copy of this excellent dance album for a day and it has been getting a lot of play time in my stereo. The first single \\"Hung Up\\" is addictively catchy with that ABBA hook. Got to love that world influence on \\"Isaac\\". It is a good blend of Middle Eastern and modern dance music. I almost felt like I was listening to a DJ Cheb I Sebbah track instead of a Madonna song. My very favorite song on the album has to be \\"How High\\" with its contagious beat. I definitely could hear remnants of Madonna's older songs on some of the songs here like on \\"Push\\". I could hear a bit of \\"Like a Prayer\\" on that song. I definitely can hear the similiarity to \\"Fever\\" on \\"Like It or Not\\". Lyrically \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is a lot better than the dreadful \\"American Life\\". All the songs are great. There was not one song on the album I didn't like.
B00003CWPL|1.0|When people asked what the worst film I've ever seen was, my answer is invariably Eraserhead.....and that's even an understatement.
B000067JQR|5.0|It's a tie between this and \\"Bark At the Moon\\" for my favorite Ozzy album (hey, I've been an Ozzy fan since 1984, in the days when people called me a \\"devil worshipper\\" for liking him.  Nowadays, those same people, along with everyone else, have jumped on his bandwagon).<br /><br />\\"Diary of a Madman\\" is one of those CDs you can put in the player and just enjoy from beginning to end.  I like every single song on this CD.  Legend has it that this and \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" were material he couldn't get onto Black Sabbath albums.  It's just as well because the songs sound better as solo material as opposed to how a group would perform them.<br /><br />While corporate radio constantly plays \\"Over the Mountain\\" and \\"Flying High Again,\\" I like the tracks that get the once-in-a-blue-moon airplay: The title track, \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\" (\\"You can't kill rock and roll, it's here to stay\\" is a simple sentiment but it's kept my love of rock and roll strong all these years), as well as \\"Little Dolls.\\"<br /><br />Ozzy's songwriting coupled with the late Randi Rhodes's out-of-this-world guitar playing make \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" an Ozzy essential.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|This is in all respects, including casting, acting, and direction, the fullest and most faithful rendition of Fitzgerald's original.  The reviews which call it a clothes and sets show are simply misapprehending.  The seeming clarity of the deservedly classic book is all surface, sustained only by the incredible invention of Nick Carraway, who carries the enigmatic and terse narrative like a sort of moody jazz age song.  Beneath that surface is a yawning cavern of distrurbing emptiness, symbolized by the \\"valley of ashes\\" and keying in directly to T. S. Eliot's \\"The Wasteland.\\"  To go beyond a suggestive surface is to risk plunging the whole project quickly into heavy darkness, which this film carefully avoids.<br /><br />The brio of the direction shows in a cluster of marvelous choices, some very fleeting:  Sam Waterston as an impeccable Carraway; the too-carefully accented, stumbling diction of Redford who truly reflects -- as he is supposed to -- one who acquired his speech from \\"how to\\" books; bringing Klipspringer, the pianist-guest who never leaves, fully to life; the twinlike, dancing lesbians at the party; giving the heavy, Tom Buchanan, at least the benefit of being comic relief.<br /><br />All of this, however, is only to make way for the central bold choice:  casting Mia Farrow as Daisy.  Her shallow interpretation and apparently hysterical, ditzed-out performance spoils the film for many, and perhaps always will.  However, in my view (which is certainly open to question) this simply unmasks the central enigma of the book which is not fully apparent at all on paper, and never could be.  Why this obsession?  It is what drives not only the surface action of the book but also the symbolic understructure.<br /><br />One shakes his head, says, \\"There must have been more than this.\\"  I think not.  The key is in Gatsby's pregnant, odd observation, \\"Her voice sounds like . . . money.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps such a thing simply cannot be filmed.  However to me, the film adds a marvelous dimension to an American classic not achievable in any other way.  It lays bare a small, sheer void, around which the turbulent world of Gatsby swirls.o an American classic not achievable in any other way.

0684824906|2.0|I heard of Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals, when I saw her give an interview promoting it.  I was so impressed by her interview that I rushed out and scooped up a copy. <br /> <br />But, as I read through the first few hundred pages I was dismayed to find that a great deal of the book fixates on what I feel are inconsequential details of the daily lives of Lincoln's cabinet, while scant attention is given to things of immense proportions.  For example, several pages about midway through the book are given to the subject of the marriage and living arrangments of William Sprague to the daughter of Chase, and all of two paragraphs are given in description of the battle of Gettysburg.   I was disappointed to find constant references to Mary Lincoln's redecoration of the White House, or her demeanor at parties, and yet find little real analysis of racial tensions in the North.  Not to mention the abysmally scant attention Goodwin pays to Lincoln's suspension of Habeus Corpus and the New York riot over the institution of the draft. <br /> <br />While it may indeed be interesting to delve into the personal contrivances of each of the principal players in the Lincoln cabinet, I was under the impression that Lincoln's political abilities and policies would be the main focus.  Instead, I was treated to an interpretation of Lincoln's life and cabinet that read as if it was written for People magazine. <br /> <br />While I admire the amount of research that must have gone into writing Team of Rivals, I deplore what the research was aimed at: reducing one of the most perilous and important epochs of American history to a collection of humorous anectdotes and pat answers to legitimate criticisms of Lincoln's administration.  It is quite clear that Goodwin is an admirer of Lincoln, and she goes to lengths to sooth the reader's unease in regard to his more controversial decisions. <br /> <br />The concept of Team of Rivals is ambitious.  After all, this is a quintuple biography.  However, the details of the lives of the cabinet members detracts from rather than adds to Goodwin's goal of describing Lincoln's political and interpersonal savvy.  As I was reading the book, I became aware that I was skimming through large portions of the text to get to information pertinent to Lincoln's political life. <br /> <br />Why am I so hard on this author?  Because I expect an academic, such as Goodwin, to present me with original thoughts on historical events, not merely a report of what was done by whom when.  Any history textbook can give me that.  What I want is analysis, not a catalog of witticisms and familial details, which is what Team of Rivals predominantly tends to be. <br /> <br />Still, Goodwin has whetted my appetite for a good biography of Lincoln and renewed my interest in America's slavery era.  Yet, she did so in spite of herself. <br /> <br />Serious students of history and politics should try to avoid Team of Rivals.  However, if accounts of marital squables of the rich and powerful trip your trigger, then by all means, have at it.
B00005ATQD|3.0|This is Stanley Kubrick's unfinished toy, not a coherent movie.  In that sense it has much in common with Kurosawa's final film, Dreams -- another startling collection of scraps and experiments, some brilliant.  Kurosawa's finale works better because it makes no pretense at telling a coherent story, just constitutes a box of unrelated dreams put on film.<br /><br />There is of course much brilliance in evidence here.  Certain scenes are simply as great as anything Kubrick ever did -- the dead patient's daughter attempting to seduce Cruise at the deathbed; the poolroom argument about the dead girl; the show-stopper deadpan comedy (a rare treat from Kubrick) of the costume shop.  And also, even in some deplorable scenes, one will see incredibly lovely photography and composition as anyone has ever put into movies, from the man who, it should be pointed out, started out as a Life photographer in the 50s.<br /><br />For those who prize the work of Kubrick, as I do, the film shoud be seen.  It is very instructive of both his strengths and his difficulties (which perhaps should not be over-emphasized since death deprived him of the all important final cut).  But what I see in a lot of the reviews is \\"Say it ain't so, Stanley\\" -- a refusal to acknowledge than even the greatest of artists can lay eggs, even late in their careers (which of course ignores Beethoven's \\"Wellington's Victory,\\" Tolstoy's \\"Resurrection,\\" and countless other turkeys now only historical footnotes).<br /><br />The fact is, to see some of Kubrick's weaknesses so exposed only ought to make one appreciate him more.  The embarrassing part, however, is an obsessiveness coupled with a voyeurism fully worthy of Hitchcock at his worst.  The sometimes brilliant Kidman, who by all accounts gave her heart and soul to Kubrick in this film, is woefully misused as nothing more that a t & a show.  Her pivotal \\"seduction\\" scene is a terrible joke; yet so carelly made in trademark Kubrick style it looks like a massive self-inflicted wound where the heart of the movie is supposed to be.  Much better is the light comedy of the 2 girls flirting with Cruise at the same time -- another successful late life experiment by Kubrick in the pure comedic that looks uncharacteristically fresh and unstudied for this director.  Indeed, the workmanlike Cruise -- the Western world's least favorite major star -- does a lot to prove his mettle in this movie, against great odds.  But all the king's horses can't save the heavy dark nonsense of the secret sex club, which brings the whole disaster crashing down.  It looks like a ludicrous X-rated shot at Darth Vader/Star Wars stuff, something for sexually exhausted over the hill audiences rather than the teen crowd.  It is so bad it might send you running for the exits (even from your own living room) before the closer.<br /><br />I note that I have failed here to analyze the plot, much less even discuss it.  The fact is, I do not have the slightest clue what this movie was about, even what \\"happens\\" in it.<br /><br />Truth is, Kubrick's filmic success was in almost every case based on a grand bow to a novel or book, with a very careful and attentive respect for authorial intent rare for modern directors.  Barry Lyndon, Lolita, Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket all follow this formula.  By transposing a Freud era psychodrama from Vienna to modern New York (and for that matter, to a facsimile of the Big Apple created at Shepparton Studios because the aging director had grown too eccentric to fly)  was a late life break out of a self-imposed cage that, perhaps, had finally driven him nuts.  So he got spectacular fireworks and a fine montage of still pictures, but no coherent product. One thinks of the tragedy of the aged Tolstoy, running away from his beloved country estate and his wife in his last days, to be dragged back and die.  Whatever the result, Kubrick like Tolstoy died in harness to his art, and if his vision cracked in the process his effort isnonethless worthy of careful attention.  But every Kubrick fan should by now have encountered the director's Olympian detatchment and objectivity, in his best works, and so I suspect he himself would not have endorsed attempts to over-praise this enigma or inflate it into something it is not.his effort is nonethless worthy of careful attention.
