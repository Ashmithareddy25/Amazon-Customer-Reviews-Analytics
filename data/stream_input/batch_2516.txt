B004G0DN7W|4.0|One of the dozen or so films that deserves re-watching, in my opinion.  We have seen it a few times since its first release, but not in the last ten years.<br /><br />And, we watched it partly in memory of Yul Brynner.  There will never be another actor of the same charisma.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|It is a great story about the times when men were men.  I have no idea who else I could send it to

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan but Sing you Home was by far my favorite.<br />I just loved the characters of Zoe and Vanessa and could most definitely hear the music in their<br />voices and their story.  I highly recommend this book. Therese Plummer is an excellent narrator and her voice was so lyrical that she brought Zoe to life... Mia Barron was good too! I could listen to it forever.  I also recommend the CD that goes with it if not listening to it on CD or some other audio source.  Sing you Home and Ordinary Life go a long way in<br />making a way for same-sex relationships and how normal they are...
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I shouldn't like this book as much as I did, because every character began life right out of the big book o' fantasy cliches, parts of it sound as if they're trying to document a tabletop RPG campaign, and the plot arc isn't exactly highly original. But I did, because somehow Sanderson managed to breathe life into each character, elevating Vin and Kel in particular far above their stereotypes, and the world that's built and a bit too exhaustively described really does break a few molds and leads to some interesting, exciting action sequences. It is a rather raw, brutal book, but it doesn't dwell on sadistic gore or sexual imagery, thankfully.<br /><br />Sanderson is far more deft than most at great, funny dialogue unique to each character, and despite the extensive world building, he's content to let it evolve throughout the novel instead of grinding to a halt to exhaustively detail some aspect every dozen pages. Vin's training was the only time I wished it would hurry up. He might not have the poetic imagery of some, but he keeps everything moving at a good clip. There is an obligatory twist ending and sequel hook, but the novel easily stands on its own and doesn't just end hanging. It feels quite satisfying when done.<br /><br />I was especially pleased with the way that Vin continually reflects on who she is and what her place is, without delving into the endless irritating angst that so many teen fiction heroes have, nor does she become a superman that single-handedly wins without support. She comes to understand that she is neither her former life nor her current one, they're just a series of roles that she plays, and allows herself to drop the mantle of guilt that could have become so irritating. She's never really given the chance to discover just who she is, but there are sequels, so we'll see.<br /><br />The others of the gang are both loyal and fractious, doubtful and hopeful, and prone to dumb mistakes nearly as often as successes, giving the story a more nuanced nature than the usual formulaic fantasy. Some are more bloodthirsty, others more hesitant, and while each has excuses for their actions it's up to the reader to judge for themselves. Vin may be a great Hero, but the supporting cast from Lord Ruler down to the one-off skaa breathe life into the world. The real villains left a real pit of dread in the belly, much more so than the clownish nobles. The weakest might be Elend, who never gets enough screen time to become less two-dimensional, so his role as a love interest doesn't quite work, especially for someone as jumpy as Vin.<br /><br />One interesting aspect is that most themes are revisited multiple times in different ways. Thieving gangs, noble sex with skaa, messiahs, plans and plan Bs, torture, and of course the mist and ash. Each of them ends up playing important roles for all of the characters.<br /><br />Definitely give this a chance if you're at all interested in the genre. It might not be the greatest fantasy book, but it is one which pushes the genre, as well as being a rocking good story.nuanced nature than the usual formulaic fantasy.

B007PVHMCG|3.0|Ordered this for my son's 11th birthday.  For $50, I expected to get a nice size box of Minecraft Legos, as pictured on Amazon.  When the package arrived, I was surprised to receive a 5&#34;x5&#34; cubed box!  This SMALL box contains over 400 TINY Legos.  I understand Legos are pricey, but for this particular product, OVERPRICED!

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I consider myself a harsh critic when it comes to futuristic films...most just rehash the same old story over and over. The movie \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is rather unique. It not only teaches us about our short-comings (racism and greed) it shows us what can happen if we do NOT change these short-comings. The film was so visually beautiful I found myself WANTING to understand the plot more and more, which meant having to turn on my English subtitles whenever the film wandered back and forth to the future. Infact, that was my only criticism...the broken-style English was a bit too futuristic to understand. I must not end without mentioning the fantastic job Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and the others did changing characters...had to look three times to see that Halle Berry was the tatooed slave girl...award winning make-up job.

B00847KFDS|4.0|Ive only been a fan of John Fogerty for a short time now, as im only 15, but so far I can only say great things about this album. Obviously the songs cant beat the original, but what did you expect. This is a collaboration album, and thats what happens on collab albums.<br /><br />Ive actually been waiting for this album since march when Eric Clapton's new album \\"Old Sock\\" was released. The preview track \\"Down on the Bayou\\" wasn't my favorite. I have no interest in Kid Rock, but I was willing to give this album another chance. When it was released on Pandora last week I listened to the album all the way through twice and loved it. Some songs (\\"Lodi\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\") have a certain element that is missing and is missed, however most of the album is fantastic and I reckon you listen to it for yourself.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I just finished book five....it was an epic read, I mean that I made it through. (There are no plot spoilers here.) I'm a big fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Herbert, even Rowling and I was excited to find another author who wrote the BIG fantasy stories.....but I found that unlike those mentioned, there was no nobleness or goodness in any of the characters - unless they were to be killed off or physically maimed in some horrible way. By the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to any of those who are ...still alive or may be alive or at least are not dead.... the plot was so twisted it was difficult to know. I actually had thought of starting a \\"family tree\\" project to keep track of the characters...... but this is only a book and I'm not planning on spending any more time with them or on future offerings. I am sorry this was not the next BIG fantasy writer I have been looking for.....guess I'll go back to the above mentioned authors and enjoy a read that makes me appreciate the goodness of their humanity.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|Take a minute to think about Rush out of context. They are a trio of old farts that have been peddling largely the same, inaccessible progressive rock/metal sound for thirty-eight-plus years now. So does that make them a band that is fresh out of ideas? Absolutely not -- you should have known better than to think that! Somehow, even with band members that are well into their sixties, they still manage to sound fresh and innovative. And their instrumental prowess still manages to blow minds, even if it isn't QUITE as godly as it was when they recorded, say, \\"2112\\" all the way back in the mid-Seventies. Add to this exceptional musicianship a batch of drummer Neil Peart's most imaginative and inventive lyricism (his lyrics usually adopt a concerted sci-fi feel), and the end result is \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" the nineteenth (!) studio album of the band's influential career, and quite possibly their best effort since 1981's \\"Moving Pictures.\\"<br /><br />Lead single \\"Caravan\\" elegantly pins a catchy, bobbing guitar hook against a bed of deft, technical, warbling bass lines and soaring melodic vocals. It also makes room for one especially memorable chorus, too. But if this song is very good, then the next track, \\"BU2B,\\" is positively great! It is a huge highlight on account of it being easily \\"Clockwork\\"'s heaviest song, and also one of the heaviest tunes of Rush's whole career. It has a weird, proggy intro, sure, but it then storms back with massive, thunderously pounding (and actually quite crushing) riffs and funky, slapped bass lines. The next handful of tracks, however, find the band's rhythm section taking over, with the title cut and \\"Carnies\\" (a raucous romp) adopting an almost Motorhead-worthy, punk-derived bass tone that drives the song forward with more really clever fills and riffs. (But only the former of these two cuts is also highlighted by some more excellent melodic vocals, tasty, harmonic guitar solo work, and a really proggy, unplugged guitar-break, where the acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly.) And \\"The Anarchist\\" is also highlighted by a particularly noteworthy rhythm section, with a bouncy, propulsive drum intro that flows into muscular, bass-driven territory.<br /><br />Frontman Geddy Lee's exceptional bass work also comes into the spotlight on some later tracks. Take, for example, \\"Seven Cities Of Gold,\\" because it marries an excellent bass solo (in its intro) with memorable electric guitar riffs, a crashing drum beat, and memorable vocal patterns. Some strong, jazzy, stop-start bass lines coarse throughout it, too. Elsewhere, \\"Halo Effect,\\" a proggy acoustic ballad (and a fairly brief and compact one at that, as it clocks in at just over the three minute mark), \\"The Wreckers,\\" which features some more colorful acoustic strumming, heavy bass lines, and a really big and memorable, sing-songy chorus, and \\"BU2B2,\\" an 87-second long interlude-type track that finds what sounds like a violin accompanying Geddy's clean, soulful singing, are a few other standouts. But it is \\"Headlong Flight\\" that takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle. It is a surprisingly up-tempo and hard-rocking, nearly seven-and-a-half-minute long epic piece that is highlighted by an excellent (and really deft), four-second long drum solo/fill from Neil, and a totally air-guitar-worthy, shredding solo from Alex.<br /><br />Challenging (both for the band and the listener), lengthy (its total playing time is 66 minutes), brilliantly-written (it almost never adheres to standard verse-chorus-verse structuring), and impeccably performed, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" embodies pretty much everything that progressive music is all about. Therefore, this album just might be the best prog rock/metal release of the year (2012), and it certainly is one heckuva way for a band to begin their fifth decade of existence. Indeed, if this isn't the sound of a band that is aging gracefully, then I don't know what it is!acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly.)

B000FA675C|5.0|A lot has been said about Dan Brown's lack of craftsmanship but I have thoroughly enjoyed each of his books. I started reading his work with the Da Vinci code and have been hooked ever since. If you're looking for a fun read and are willing to except less than perfect writing, this book is a must have.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|A 2012 USA/UK production \\"Les Misérables\\" has lots of songs and rhymes, but has little sense of rhythm and flow. With fine production design and powerful performances from some players (if not all), the film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the Victor Hugo classic novel is not boring, but the pace is too fast, even rushed, while the film is always striving to be emotional.<br /><br />You know this is a famous story about Jean Valjean, a man who stole a loaf of bread for his sister's children, the story that was made into a movie in 1998 with Liam Neeson as Valjean, and a TV mini-series with Gérard Depardieu in 2002. Did I find something new and original in this new version, except the great music, of course? Not much.<br /><br />There is one thing I couldn't understand about the latest version of \\"Les Misérables.\\" Director Tom Hooper of \\"The King's Speech\\" fame somehow decided every single line had to be sung. Yes, I know this is a musical and I haven't seen the stage, but on screen it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Finally, a few words about the cast of \\"Les Misérables.\\" The cast is impressive, but some of the players' performances are not. I don't name names. Hugh Jackman is very good. I only add that among the many well-known stars, Samantha Barks impressed me most as tragic Éponine, the only character I cared. She is the real star of the film to me.
B005HSL626|4.0|The game is totally fun, but I just wish it gave you more time to play the rounds! FUN FUN
B009LRE040|5.0|Many reviewers made great reviews. I won't add mine here. Let just me say that's an awesome movie that should have won the Oscar for the best movie. And all the actors did a great job. Don't miss it.

B002QS5OQ4|5.0|Many people have compared this offshoot of the Stargate franchise as a Battlestar Galactica wannabe. Since I've never seen the newest BSG series, I can't compare it myself. So, I'll just say that I loved this newest SG installment and wish that it hadn't been cancelled after Season 2. However, even though it was cancelled, it was just so much fun. Now, the stars are off doing other series. However, if I ever win the Lotto, I will personally fund a TV movie or another season of this show. I miss the characters and would like to see them again.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This show is amazing.<br />Any fan of sci-fi needs to this.<br />I've never been more intrigued.<br />My favorite tv show to marathon!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I rated this book 4 stars because it sucks you in and brings you into a whole new world. I read the entire series in probably 4 weeks because I could not put the book down. The only I didn't like is how it made me cry. It's so sad at parts but still really juicy. I don't know what book that would be good compared to this book.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I'm not a fan of classic movies, but this one is a good movie. I would recommended to anyone out there.
B005CA4SL0|5.0|De Niro at his creepiest. Nolte and Lange giving solid performances, as well as young Juliette Lewis.<br />Scorsese's take on the classic thriller is packed with entertainment and homage from beginning to end.<br />Any De Niro fan should own this!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I think I read The Hobbit decades ago and don't remember the story, I saw The Lord of the Rings and enjoyed it, though I wouldn't say I am an avid fan.  In The Hobbit I recognized the faces of many of the leads and greatly like the actors but the story didn't engage me.  The Hobbit isn't presented as a stand alone story, in my opinion, the audience really has to know the back story to enjoy it.  I don't remember the back story and so wasn't able to enjoy it.  Visually the sets looked so lush and the colors so vivid, as to make the movie seem especially fake looking; I also disliked the swooping shots from the sky.  Didn't hate it, just didn't care for it - was unable to sit through the entire movie, watched the first act maybe, then fast forwarded to about 15 minutes from the end.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This show is amazing.<br />Any fan of sci-fi needs to this.<br />I've never been more intrigued.<br />My favorite tv show to marathon!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun way to pass the time.  I think the game could be improved upon. Starting from the beginning every time you crash becomes a bit repetitive, tedious and I lose interest.  Create a checkpoint past which you don't have to return to the starting line. A little variety on the character would also engage the customer more.  Overall good but could be so much better.
B000I9U7EM|5.0|Action packed, great stunts, cars and trucks, cool underground headquarters. special government buildings. Our six year old son has watched it 171/2 times in the past three weeks.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The background information made the book a very compelling read! I plan on buying a hardcover to pass on to other vets I know to enjoy.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is well worth watching, whether you're just starting or have been following it since the beginning!  It's just the right amount of drama, without being too cliche or obvious, and will totally suck you in!
0988178532|5.0|A suspense thriller that never lets up. The characters are easy to identify with and the mystical elements did not disrupt the pace. You can almost feel the spiritual connection between Nate and his brother. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read, beginning to end.
B009ZG6YQO|5.0|...is difficult to leave it aside!!! even when I have work to do!!!! Well writen...so interesting...takes one to magic places!!!<br />It is ot easy for me to read it...I need the dictionary every now and then since I speak Spanish...but I love the Druids and all that part of the English history since I was little at school!!!<br /><br />Magic...the gift of Sight...

B00APUYWYA|5.0|We found this movie very funny, the shy quite Asian was making us lol she reminded us of someone we know. Not a bad movie to see if you like silly
B004A7QOUE|2.0|Fast paced. Seems more suited to very fit and people<br />used to working out a lot. Some of the exercises seemed unsafe as<br />a lot of pressure is put on the belly. It also lacks specific guidance<br />through each exercise, something to help you position your body<br />in a better way.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|The Mission: Impossible movies are a good time - and this one is no exception.  We enjoyed the action as well as the humor.  If you are looking for deep, emotional and thought provoking - look elsewhere.  If you want a few hours of fun escapism this is your ticket :-)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not too difficult a game but entertaining. The puzzles were a bit simplistic, but the graphics were good. I would play other games by GS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its fun, my grandchild loves the game!! she is 3,and plays the game like a pro!! fun to watch her play and nice to hear her giggle!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|An honest look into a tragic event.  It seems she has worked through her feelings and has really dealt with her problems, but I was disappointed just a little at the end.  Didn't seem like she gave it closure, but then again, after something like that happens to you, how can you have closure.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I found this movie to be one of Tom Cruise's best performances.  I am not usually a fan of his as his acting is sometimes too stiff but he did a good job in this film.  I also liked Helen (Rosamund Pike) who is the sultry lawyer trying to defend a man obviously guilty of multiple murders, or is he...<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a tough as nails ex-military officer an ex-military policeman.  He arrives to find and take care of Jimmy Barr who is accused of killing 5 people with a sniper rifle.  He had promised Jimmy many years before that if Jimmy killed anyone that he would come after him.  He and Helen link up and she convinces him to help prove Jimmy guilty or innocent.  There are lots of violent bad guys, fights and action chases.<br /><br />Overall the movie was good but there were a couple of scenes that were pretty silly.  Particularly the fight in the bathroom was ridiculous.  My wife and I liked the movie and we found it entertaining.  I rate it as a 4 star film.
B0027MJU00|3.0|If your depressed or have anxiety not a great read.  Great story teller, but the ending disconnected.  No chance of figuring \\"who done it\\" as only introduction of character in ending... Give: Gone Girl, a try by Flynn, very consuming and you'll wish it won't end.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Some technical material but very readable explanation of how the universe evolved.<br />I appreciated having something like this to read.

B00B8WXG9G|5.0|This is a great cd and must for everyohne to have. The people who sing with him on this or added eclectronically to it are fabulous. I love every song and the collection is the best. I bought this one also for my sister she loved mine so much.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|With an interesting storyline, fantastic graphics and puzzle after puzzle to unravel The Room will pull you in from the first minute. Completely unique and eerie in the best of ways, the only let down was that it was over so all soon; I never wanted it to end. I wait (impatiently) for a 2nd part hopefully soon.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Being a long time fan since Facelift, I was thrilled that AIC was able to spark a comeback in 2007.  Although they are not the same band without Layne Staley, they have come a long way with William Duvall.  It's hard to read the comments about how the album sounds like a third Jerry Cantrell solo album. Since he handles a bit more of the main vocal duties now, of course it will sound that way and on top of it William is not trying to sound like a karaoke version of Layne, so kudos to him for bringing his own style to AIC.  This album is a solid rock album and is a must have for any fan of the band.  I was impressed by the first two singles (Hollow and Stone) prior to the album coming out and the rest of the album has not left me disappointed. In comparison to the Layne years, this album could be the Dirt of the present.  I hope they continue to release new music and continue to be one of the greatest rock bands of my lifetime.  Some EPs along the way would be a nice complement in between albums, just like Sap and Jar of Flies were back in the day.
B000002V07|5.0|This might be one of the sexiest albums of all time.  Many folks will recognized &#34;Fade into You,&#34; but the rest of the album is great as well.  Beautiful lyrics and singing, and solid guitar playing as a bonus.  They have such a sexy sound, without being overt or explicit.  Definitely worth owning!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|It may have started off a little slow but I enjoyed the movie.  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence complimented each other well!
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|My family just watched this on a whim, & it turned out to be a very good movie, with an intelligent script & no stupid parts.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie is great for kids and adults alike.  Uplifting and confirmation that Santa, Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy DO EXIST!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Its an interesting twist on an already interesting concept. The confluence of origionality and tradition left absolutely ready for season 2.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|It was quick and simple to rent this movie.  I was able to watch this movie in 2 - 3 minutes
1572815108|5.0|The cards are excellent quality and easy to use.  They offer an enjoyable experience for the tarot reader.  I love the artistic renditions.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is more melodic than the Red Hot Chili Pepper's previous outings, but is still fueled by their signature funk and punk style.  The lyrics are also more touching on a couple songs, but are still mostly about sex; Anthony Kiedis even mocks his own image in \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\"<br /><br />Guitarist John Frusciante left the band after this album, not to return for several years (and after a long period of addition and rehabilitation.)  Consequently the band never sounded this good again.
B001O5LVPI|4.0|The movie is great.  Funny, heartwarming, etc.  I cried at the end but that's normal.  The social worker threatening to take the child away is a very serious and scary thought.  Beware and watch it WITH your child in case you need to address some questions.  Be prepared.
B00026WU7I|5.0|While Bob Dylan has had many fine albums since this; this is has last truly great album.  Almost every new album he releases is called \\"His greatest since 'Blood on the Tracks.'\\"  The songs are mostly longer ballads, which sound like heartfelt confessions (though Dylan denies that's what they are.)  As always they're filled with his cryptic imagery which leads the listener to his own interpretation.<br /><br />This is a solid album throughout including some of his best tracks, \\"Tangled up in Blue,\\" \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome,\\" and \\"Shelter from the Storm.\\"  A couple tracks on the album are over long, but that's almost to be expected on a Dylan album.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I loved this book. I never realized that Ian Fleming had such a rich history to pull from for his Bond novels. He's as fun to follow as Bond himself! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves history, suspense and battle.
B00000K2UX|5.0|The sound quality is great and the songs are as good as the movie.  The music is very up lifting
B0037WP83M|5.0|Loved every minute of it. I originally bought the special features - extended edition when it first came out, but after a few years it is now too scratched to watch. Decided to go with completely digital copy of this movie because I love it. Sad about my old copy and having to buy it all over again, and it's not the extended edition, but I am a fan and I was happy to watch it uninterrupted.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Was looking forward to having this on blu-ray. We enjoy these shows immensely and are happy with the product. No complaints.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|It's okay and had a cute story line, but overall it wasn't the best movie out there. It wasn't entirely bad and I'm glad that I got to watch it with my kids, but it probably isn't my goto movie to entertain my children. (8 and 12 year old girls.) Maybe my children are too old for it, I'm not sure.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Love the packaging, and of course the shows! Nice to have it all on BluRay now! No complaints at all.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I say surprisingly, because I didn't think that anything could top The Lord of the Rings, but I think they kept very close to the story line that existed and loved the new spins that it added. Looking forward to more!
B004GFN11A|5.0|I love that I can access my blog from my Fire without all of the extra of logging on to a computer and its a great alternative to my phone!
B001V58BUY|5.0|You need to watch it to understand.  My kids loved it.  Although they love the original (Disney) more - this is a given since the first time that they heard the story was through Disney.  But they all give this version a two thumbs up.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a great easy listening CD!  Love to listen to on a Friday evening after a long week at work!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Saw it when released- just as good the 2nd and 3rd time- a keeper- well written, great direction and acting
1400052181|5.0|Well written book about the interesting and morally ambiguous subject of cell collection and cloning. A great book for book clubs and the intellectually curious.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I'll always give Andrea Bocelli a 5 star. I think he's one of the greatest singers of our time. His music is so soothing.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Jack Racher is a movie about an army cop and an investigation. So if you are a fan of police shows, or just like to figure things out with your brain, you will like it.
B00013M6NK|5.0|The battery bought was brand new and original. It was the same as advertised and it works perfectly. I recommend it.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Not sure what all the hype has been about - this movie was terrible!  I was bored to the point that I fell asleep watching it!  What a waste of money!!
B0014GVCI8|5.0|The humor is so great that the more you watch this film the more humor you find. If you love quirky, you will love this film
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|Don't waste your money it's not worth it. I found it not all fun and entertaining very boring game the worst.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I didn't want to watch this movie, but my brother talked me into it and I am glad I did. I hope they come out with another one it was great!
B00B4804KS|5.0|The benchmark by which wholesome family entertainment should be measured against. The film that spawned a generation of wannabe paleontologists and has not dated at all despite being 20 years old.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|There was too much speculation and not enough action in this thriller. Some of the logic of the plot was murky. Not up to the usual Scarpetta standards.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun game helps out when your bored. Also gives you a challenge every now and then. I liked it and im sure you will too.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing someone suggested it to me and I loved it I'm totally recommending this book to my friends and future family
159463176X|5.0|As anyone who has read Hosseini's previous books knows, he is a profoundly capable writer. It only takes a few pages into this book to realize how much better he is than the last few writers whose books you read. He weaves amazing stories, and so touchingly that you can't help but shed some tears.<br /><br />His earlier works, \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", were more focused and stayed tighter to the central story. This novel strays across multiple families and multiple stories. Each is well told, and at every stop tears are jerked. But the center is lost a bit. Some threads appear, force a tear, then disappear.<br /><br />The basic story is of a sister lost, then finally found, but a little too late. (This isn't really a spoiler, because it is repeatedly hinted at.) Over the course of the novel many variations on loss--or failure to ever have--are recited. Always touchingly, but not always necessary to the central story.<br /><br />This would have been a better book if the story was a little tighter. Rating it is hard. It falls a bit short of his prior novels. But should he be held to so high a standard? Compared to most writers this is still an amazing book, an accomplishment that few writers could ever hope to equal. So five stars on the universal scale, while thinking four stars on the Hosseini scale.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This film presented Lincoln as a real person and how he really felt about the state of the country at that time. Also, what it took to have slavery abolished and the real depth of hatred for Negro people(by some). Lincoln had some really difficult decisions to make and this film brought them and the times in which he lived to life. A master piece! An all star cast. See if you can spot who some actors are without looking at the cast credits! Daniel Day Lewis earned that Oscar. I just don't know how they do it! They truly brought history to life! Tommy Lee Jones, always gives a stellar performance.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Pitch Perfect is a cute movie and well-sung/casted.  I was hoping it would have more laugh-out-loud moments for those of us who don't l-o-v-e singing movies.  If you saw the trailer, you saw 80% of the funniest moments.  The rest of the movie felt like a Teen Romantic Comedy/Glee mash-up.
B00006674X|5.0|elvis is the best hear elvis does it again with his music he is one of the best i know
B002QE3CTY|5.0|\\"The Maze Runner\\" is about a boy named Thomas who finds himself with near-total amnesia, only able to remember his name. He wakes up in a place called the Glade, whose only occupants are a small group of teenage boys. The Glade is surrounded by a massive maze whose walls shift every night, making it nigh on impossible to navigate. The boys expect Thomas to be no different than the other boys, who had arrived throughout the prior two years. However, they soon find out that Thomas's arrival heralds changes to, and the end of, their life in the Glade.<br /><br />I think that kids who are 12-16 years old would enjoy this book. Boys would probably like this book more than girls would, but I think many girls would enjoy it as well. My favorite part was Thomas's first night outside of the Glade. I liked it because the action really picked up at that point in the book. Up until that point the author focused on setting up the world and the major characters, but starting there the plot really gets moving. I give this book 5 stars - it is very good.<br /><br />Review by Robbie M., age 15, Metropolitan Washington Mensa
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|great movie i like helen hunt she does a great job in this movie i like the way it is presented
B000QCS8TW|4.0|One quick point, I wish I hadn't seen Season 1 of the TV Show before I read the book.<br />From now on, I am done watching it on HBO.  It's just straight novels here on out for me.<br /><br />If you've seen the show, there's not much new here.<br />If you haven't, it's a hell of a read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book! The main character, Jamie,is so wonderful & charming.  Ms. McKenna tells the story using the Irish brogue. It only adds to the personalities of the people & the place. She takes you there.<br />You feel so sorry for Jamie and his futile attempts at love and companionship.But there is an unexpected twist at the end.<br />Very enjoyable read. Perfect for summer! Don't pass this one up.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Typically great Taramtino dialogue.  I've always been curious why he only wrote this movie and never directed it.<br />Don't let that influence your decision to purchase it however.  It's a great story when great performances and I personally cannot recommend it enough if you like Tarantino's style.<br /><br />The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is, quite frankly, a classic in every sense of the word.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Will leave you guessing til the end! I LOVED IT!! ABSOLUTELY THRILLING! Im soo ready for Book 3; Counting the days...
B005723JSQ|5.0|I am still smiling after finishing this book! Funny banter throughout the whole story. Really adorable ending! Best kinsella book I've read! :)
B008476HBM|5.0|Really, this book is a little unfair to all man living. The portray of Mr. Darcy in Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice leaves every women wanting so much more of their real life counterpart. This really is a classic worth reading and reading again.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this little game is just so cute and I think they need to make more of these kind of apps because it is adorable
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It's short and the sort of tale that can't be put down. It was wonderful. The way it takes hold of you and doesn't let is crazy. Love it very much
B005MMYPIE|5.0|This is a group to watch!  The tempo in their songs starts out kicking you all over the place and doesn't let up.  Great songs Hunger and 1,000,000 Light Years are great, and the &#34;love song&#34; Amaranthine is still stuck in my head.  Great group, great music!
B009IA3O2O|5.0|This album does not disappoint. It retains its old Kamelot flavor without falling into stagnancy. The new singer, also, is very good. I would describe his voice as &#34;Disney prince gone rogue&#34;. While I miss Khan as much as anyone, Karevik was masterful, and definitely a worthy successor,
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I am an avid fan of Mr. Buble because I love his style and his selection of songs.  It is an album you can put on repeat and enjoy it while doing other work at home.  I hear it a lot on the radio now as well so that is a test that it satisfies us fans.<br /><br />I recommend it if you like good lyrics and performed by a seasoned singer who knows how to get the most out of the written music.<br />Even if you are not a fan, I would certainly give it several listens.  Keep up the great work, Michael Buble!  I am already in line for your next album.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Awesome movie! Ending stunk though.other than that it was a really good movie. Will defiantly give it a total of five stars.
0385738781|4.0|A sad book: sad, both because of the story line and because the author did so little with the emotional potential he had here.<br />Plot: 4/5 Very mysterious and full of internal debate, but sometimes I found myself a bit bored.<br />Characters: 3/5 This book could have been really intense, but Dashner is not very good at handling emotions and as a result his characters end up a bit shallow and they don't mean as much to you.<br />Setting: 3/5 Post-zombie(well, sort of)-apocalypse.<br />Writing style: 4/5 Once you get used to the Glader's slang, it's a little easier to like, but the fact remains that Dashner doesn't really know how to handle grief. Also, there are a few curse words in here, which is a disappointment because one of the things I liked best about his first book was that it didn't use profanity.<br />Total: 14/20 A pretty good book, but there are definitely better ones. Also, don't just jump into this series. It won't make sense if you don't read the first two first.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this album is as good as hybrid theory, these guys rock. i'm in my 40's and always have some lp close at hand.
B00BJDARGO|5.0|Although Whitesnake had their heyday in the 80's, the powerhouse combination of David Coverdale, and guitarist Doug Aldrich prove once again that they are still as relevant as they ever were, if not more. I love this release but prefer &#34;Live in the Still of The Night&#34; because of the songs performed.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|i love lp, and have for years. this album is no exception, glad to add to my collection. always in the mood for som lp
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|only draw  back is  i  can't  find it  as a PC  version or  on  xbox live app. other than that it's great
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Enjoyed watching this Dvd, very cute. A great halloween movie for the kids, would probably watch again.I know the kids will.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I recomend the purchase because the item is like shown in website and its a great quality item. Thank you.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Fantastic movie with star studded ensemble cast who unimaginably work superbly together.  My girlfriend and I watched this movie after being recommended by some friends and now we cannot stop recommending it.  This film is a must see that will leave you wanting to watch it again and again.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I recomend the purchase because the item is like shown in website and its a great quality item. Thank you.
B000JMKO0A|3.0|I thought that this was likely good work for his journey and process. It didn't make for great reading. Hopefully it paves the way for more Aleph and Alchemist type books.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great characters...Really good storylines...Very engaging. The dynamics between characters makes this one of the best series on television. Looking forward to the next season.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Great movie and great actors!! Loved them all especially Ryan Gosling!!!!! He is superb!!!! Great action scenes! Worth the rental fee!
B009AMANBA|1.0|Excellent, definately worth having in one's DVD collection for all time.  Interesting.  Historical. Great story line, Cast is exceptional! Bravo
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|It was entertaining.....by no means was it an award winner. I liked the 2 actors that played Hansel and Gretel. Graphics were good!
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|This is definitely one of the better kindle &#34;action&#34; apps out there in almost every regard - graphics, gameplay, usability. Unfortunately though it's one of those &#34;leech&#34; games - in order to do anything much beyond try and muddle through it keeps pushing you to spend money to buy in-game cash, and much more intrusively than many others: every time you finish a &#34;scene&#34; (they're too small to be called &#34;levels&#34;) it tries to get you to buy some upgraded weapon for real money, and you have to actively decline to do so I would not let a child anywhere near this unless you feel like having your bank balance rapidly depleted.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This is exactly what I expected.  My husband described it after seeing it one evening, and knew I had to find it.  I am very pleased with the condition and speed of arrival.  It is everything expected.  My husband watches it over and over.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|This might be Ben Stiller's Magnum Opus. Robert Downey Jr. turns in an even better performance.  The rest of the cast was exceptional, too.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game can't stop playing very interesting almost like the movie but better you destroy the evil and keep nature safe and its free rodent get any better
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read! Loved the structure of the story and the twist kept me wanting to learn more. The back and forth narrative was a compelling way to tell a crime thriller.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Just not the same without Matt Damon, he played the normal guy better, not everyone wins every fight and this is getting to be more like James Bond than a clandestined operative.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A pretty fun game over all, I did spend the money to get the full experience out of it and do not regret my purchase. Two or three hours if you play it straight through.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|As a 41 year old, it was good - a bit long (could have cut out about a half hour) but still a good moview :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Wife says I need to read the other books- I may do that! Great action and story line. kept me riveted to screen!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My kids (6&4) and I loved this movie. Many laugh out loud moments. It has the comedy and message suitable for both groups. My kids watched it twice in the 24 hour rental time.
859037985X|5.0|Just read the other highly-rated reviews.  Then buy the book to support the project - they deserve it.<br />It's a classic for programmers of all levels.
0385344228|2.0|The ONLY reason I stayed with this book is because I wanted to see \\"whodunit\\".  I was totally blindsided by the ending of this book and did not get the ending at all.  The book dragged and dragged and dragged and then it seemed like someone held a gun to the author's head and told him to finish the book in an hour and that's what he did.  I have never read this author before and probably would not again.  But in all seriousness, can someone explain the twist at the end to me?  *SPOILERS AHEAD, DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW***  What was the whole ridiculous island trip at the end with the girl's  disappearance.  Was this to explain that Jacob really was evil and had indeed killed Ben?  That little inuendo I can kind of see but I don't get the mother twist at all.  And the Mom is the one who threw the knife in the lake?<br /><br />Thanks ahead of time to anyone who can shed some light on this for me!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I really love this cd, and so does my grandson!  It is &#34;fun&#34; and makes me feel good listening to it.  Very fast delivery and in perfect condition.  Thank you so much!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great! I love playing with with my brother and sister on multiplayer, I recommend you buy it, it's so worth it
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Really fun game will give five stars if there was a way of getting free coins not that you have to pay
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is great. I play this game 8 hours straight before. I love it you should real get it also get the third. It is also fun i play that more than this one so have fun bye.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I really do get caught up in these books so far and they are fun to read but I read them in a day.  What's the point in making it a trilogy when it feels more like  a cliff hanger.  These books seem so short and I feel like I'm left wanting more....so why not make it a whole book and make it longer.  I don't know, just ranting,  I'm just a person who wants it all at once and hates cliffhangers.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to see  the weather. Very accurate on how the day will be. Love when they say 75 degrees Fahrenheit. 5 year old can work this.
0425252868|5.0|the book was a great read, amazing story, it shows there's no real animosity between those that are really fighting<br />the battles, we saw this even in america's civil war, is like brother against brother willing to help or save one another<br />if its possible to leave the govermnents or leaders out of the picture
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book brought me into a world I had not given much thought.  I am thankful for the insight into this world.  The book was well written and I was interested to the very end.  Thank you.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|Another Amorphis Masterpiece.  I had to force myself to take it out of the CD player after I listened to it multiple times in a row.  There isn't anything that could make this album better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like to use this ,and do everything everything with it .So handy to use, Because I take my kindle with me everywhere.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Jonathan Franzen's 'Freedom' (2010), like 'The Corrections' (2001) before it, uses the lives of one family to tell the story of an age. Just as the earlier novel explored all of the possible meanings of the word \\"correction,\\" 'Freedom' is all about \\"freedom.\\" In the land of the Bill of Rights and Route 66, freedom is invariably positive. Not so, however, for the Berglund family.<br /><br />Walter Berglund, the environmental lawyer, finds himself continually at odds with his neighbors' ethic of individual liberty, which leads to loud noises, dead birds and a Bush in the White House. His son Joey, the rebellious Republican, finds that the free market he extols is really a rigged game. A number of characters must weigh the security and support of monogamy against the freedom of its alternatives.<br /><br />The structure of the novel is a bit misleading. It opens with a chapter about the Berglunds written from the perspective of their neighbors, somewhat reminiscent of the communal narration of Jeffery Eugenides' 'The Virgin Suicides.' We then get three chapters of an autobiography written by Patty Berglund as a psychotherapeutic exercise. I expected the book to continue with these creative narrative approaches, but it instead settles into a more conventional approach, with most of the remaining chapters told from the third-person limited point of view of the different characters. Franzen revives his earlier conceits near the end with another chapter from Patty's autobiography as well as another chapter from the perspective of the community.<br /><br />The Berglunds are far from a typical family, yet their story expresses something universal about life in America between 9/11 and the Great Recession. These two crises bookend the main action, in which the national drive for physical and financial security underlie everything. 'Freedom' is an important document of life in the Aughts.<br /><br />This review originally appeared at www.PopMythology.com.<br /><br />Matt Hlinak<br />Author of [[ASIN:B009CHLY84 DoG]]
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this,so nice to have.I can use it for everything I need.Don't know how I got along without it for so long.I use it daily.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|I love The Walking Dead, and, I think a lot of what does it for me is the music.  I'm blown away by the artists chosen.  I'd add some more, but, I imagine it'll be time for a Vol. 2 soon!  Cannot WAIT!
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein isn't a stylist. Her sentence at the opening of Chapter 12 (\\"The Capitalist ID\\") is about as close as she gets to stylistic writing: \\"On the day I went to visit Jeffrey Sachs in October 2006, New York City was under a damp blanket of gray drizzle punctuated, every five paces or so, by a vibrant burst of red.\\"<br /><br />No, she's not an English-language stylist. She's a Canadian journalist. And a damned good one, at that! And one who'd put a lot of journalists -- assuming they'd not simply been told to look the other way on the possible cause of a virtually worldwide financial crisis -- to shame in papers like The New York Times and The Washington Post, not to mention in magazines as august as The Atlantic. (Let's not even mention the networks, shall we? They're better at expounding upon popular trends and telling tragic doggie stories.)<br /><br />Could it be that the party (for many, though certainly not for all of us) here in these United States was just too long and too good from the end of WW II until now? Even Eisenhower -- a conservative if there ever was one -- publicly recognized the arrival of the military-industrial complex. Is this new brand of disaster capitalism really anything more than the \\"logical\\" evolution of that complex?<br /><br />I have a confession to make: I of course knew the name `Milton Friedman' and something about his reputation; I also knew the reputation of the University of Chicago (albeit more for its History Department than for its Economics Department); I, myself, am a graduate of the Philosophy Department of Columbia University. All of this notwithstanding, I was absolutely ignorant of any of this economic shock treatment -- from Chile and Argentina, to Poland and Russia, then on to Asia, to Iraq (where our behavior has been beyond despicable) and the Middle East, and back home again to New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />I owe Ms. Klein a humble vote of gratitude. And it was only thanks to a fellow Greek writer, whose own country is now on the verge of financial collapse, that I even found out about Ms. Klein's book.<br /><br />Don't make a comparable fool out of yourself through similar (and similarly unpardonable) ignorance. Buy this book and read it cover to cover! Yes, we're talking history here; but we're also talking current events -- events that could bring not only the entire developing world to its knees, but also these hallowed United States and our gracious neighbor to the north. And all because of one man, one misbegotten ideology, one group of prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, acolytes, disciples -- and yes, I'll say it -- intellectual toadies known as `The Chicago Boys.'<br /><br />And the IMF and the World Bank, many of whose policy makers are obvious lackeys in the service of that same `School of Chicago' ideology if not to something even more sinister? Pfff!<br /><br />One caveat to all of the above: I've never read the original works of Milton Friedman. Nor did I ever attend any of his classes while he was still alive. I trust Ms. Klein to have reported as accurately as she has documented. If not, shame on me for being so gullible and impressionable.<br /><br />And one last thing: we all know the wide gulf that exists between the original teachings of Jesus and the way Christianity, through various churches and sects, has chosen to interpret and propagate those teachings over the centuries. Would Jesus Christ call himself a Christian by today's standards of Christianity? Karl Marx once famously said he was no Marxist. Would Milton Friedman, given the demonic evolution of his economic theory, still call himself a Friedmanite? I fear, given his comment in the Op Ed section of The Wall Street Journal as recently as September 15, 2005 (p. 410) that he would.<br /><br />The news in the concluding chapter (\\"Shock Wears Off: The Rise of People's Reconstruction\\") is good: all is not lost. Let's hope that Ms. Klein's optimism is not as much in error as my original ignorance. Let's hope that society -- and Rousseau's original concept of the social contract -- are not yet lost.<br /><br />RRB<br />05/28/13Let's hope that society -- and Rousseau's original concept of the social contract -- are not yet lost.<br /><br />RRB<br />05/28/13
4871878309|5.0|As fresh as in 1945 and applicable to other kind of problems like programming, puzzles or real-life stuff.<br />Totally, loved it.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that loves Maroon 5 and also to all the newbies that are just finding Maroon 5.  Great CD as always from them.  Might want to get the clean version though for the kids.
B0087X728K|5.0|a dab will do you with this stuff i love amazing product. i will be buy more of this for times to come
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I really enjoyed this comical movie. I waited a long time until I saw this movie and it was worth it.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|OK first off the controls are easy to learn and are very responsive. The graphics are really good and the games \\"touch\\" is close to perfect. This is as Indiana Jones as it gets without getting dirty.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This has to be the best movie I have ever seen!  It will leave you spellbound and in awe. Great storyline matched with beautiful cinematography. I waited a long time to see this film. It was a long film but if you were attentive, it went fast in time. I truly enjoyed it immensely.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|I am sure there are those out there that will love this game.... but I am not one of them... I have already uninstalled it from my Kindle. Every time I make a selection the match I was going after changes... this is fun for some but frustrating for me.
B005UG53NS|4.0|Thought, it seemed to vary a little from the book, I thought it was a very well done movie.  Worth the price I spent, and especially watching the first and second one together.  Makes the story line flow that much better.<br /><br />I am a big fan of action in movies, and this second part really put the action into play.  The events unfolding, the running and the showdowns that came.  It made it all worth while to sit down and watch this one.<br /><br />The whole series was a good read, and was enjoyable to watch.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I enjoyed this game but it is not the type of game I can relax too and I only play games to relax. If you enjoy puzzles and simple rules... this is your game.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|I probably would have given this movie high marks had I seen it as a 12 year old boy. It has a comic book flavor like that flick where Angelina Jolie was a pilot with a patch over her eye which I thought was ridiculous. So if you fit into either category you should watch this movie.<br /><br />But from an adult perspective it is absolutely pathetic.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is just delightful and funny as hell. Always puts me in a good mood. Only watch if you like joy and happiness in your life. Perfect cast.
1442337966|5.0|I experienced a 180 degree change in just a matter of a couple of months after listening to this book. I was cutting my grass with an attitude (as usual) and decided to listen to the power as I did this chore. I soon realized exactly why I had been experiencing so many challenges, from love and relationships to finances. I had been focusing on negativity on my life rather than loving and being genuinely thankful. Even though I have always been a kind person, inside I was still angry at people and situations from my past. I also didn't believe in myself the way I should. Literally 2 months later all of those things have been repaired and I feel GREAT. I am loving the people and blessings in my life and forgive anyone who had wronged me in the past. My lawn has been looking much better and when it's time to cut it I do so joyfully. Even my skin cleared up.<br />I highly recommend this audio book for anyone who is going through a challenging time and can't figure out why. I attribute Rhonda Byrnes, Lisa Nichols and the lady who wrote \\"If Life is a Game These Are the Rules\\" with my transformation. I'll spread word of The Power to anyone who seems open. Thank you Ms. Byrne, I LOVE YOU!
B0089IGUP4|5.0|This CD is great.  I love every song on it.  The songs are fun, and well written.  Liike all gaslight anthem songs, they tell a great story.  Highly recommend!!
B002RXHW6S|1.0|Great fun for my 2 1/2-year-old for a week or two...until it falls apart. First one split at the seam joining the floor to the wall after two weeks. Returned that one, paid $10 shipping for a new one--lasted three weeks and split at the same seam. Returned that one, paid additional $10 shipping for a third one--split at the same seam after three weeks. I'm done with this product. The manufacturer was cooperative in shipping a new bounce castle each time, as long as we paid $10 shipping, but the product just doesn't have any degree of durability. My son only weighs 25 pounds, so he is well within the weight limit. This is just a terribly cheaply made product. Not only do I not recommend this product, I strongly recommend against buying it. Put your money into something else that lasts longer then three weeks.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I've seen better from Green Day in recent years, but this album was still pretty good. Best track by far was &#34;Nuclear Family&#34;
1608871452|5.0|OMG :)<br /><br />This book is the essential keeper if you love supernatural!<br /><br />It has everything, plus extras such as notes, pull outs, clips, etc. This is a very well put together coffee table book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so funny.  It was great...I love that it was from the male POV and that it was written in such a way that the male lead is talking to the reader.  Such an interesting way to write a book.  I found myself smurking and smiling throughout the book and many time I literally burst out laughing.  At one point it's 12:30 a.m. and I am upstairs in the living room by myself trying to finish this book before I made myself go to bed (couldn't put the book down)....I literally dropped my ipad I was laughing so hard (on the Martha Stewart comment, btw).  I had to cover my mouth while I was in hysterics or my teenage kids that were still awake downstairs might have come upstairs to find out if their mother had gone crazy.  So if you need something light to read laced with some good sex scenes and some funny funny lines along with likable characters...yes even Drew was likable, you've got to read this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never considered myself much of a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction before -- it seemed a genre that was too depressing for my tastes.  But I had heard good things about Hugh Howey's \\"Wool,\\" and was all the more intrigued to hear it began life as a series of self-published e-books before gaining popularity and a physical print edition.  And seeing that so many high-profile writers had good things to say about the book seemed promising.  So when our library got the omnibus edition of the book (the first five \\"Wool\\" novellas), I knew I had to take a look.<br /><br />I'm rather glad I ventured outside my comfort zone with this book.  It's not only a good post-apocalyptic sci-fi novel, but it's a phenomenal book period.  And I believe even those who don't like science fiction will enjoy it.<br /><br />At an unspecified point in the future, the surface world has been virtually destroyed -- by what or whom, no one remembers.  Humanity now lives in an underground complex called \\"the silo,\\" over a hundred and forty levels where people are born, live, and die without ever seeing or even thinking about the outside world.  Any thoughts of rebellion are not tolerated, and even mentioning the outside is a crime punishable by \\"cleaning\\" -- being sent outside, where the condemned will live just long enough to clean the windows of the silo's topmost level.  When the silo's sheriff is sent out to clean, the mayor chooses Juliette, a mechanic from the lowest levels of the silo, as his unlikely successor.  Juliette is reluctant at first, feeling she understands machines better than the silo's politics, but soon she comes to realize that there is something very wrong with the world of the silo.  And when she tries to understand why the previous sheriff was executed -- and begins to fall for a young IT worker named Lukas -- she uncovers information that some would rather see hidden... and inadvertently sparks a rebellion that could destroy the silo.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has invented a unique and believable world, one that feels all too plausible and workable.  The self-contained world of the silo feels logically described, as if it could really function with today's level of technology.  Many science fiction books require the reader to willingly suspend their disbelief and seem to operate on \\"Rule of Cool,\\" but \\"Wool\\" feels as if it could actually happen... which is a scary thought but makes the story all the more believable and gripping.<br /><br />Also unusually for a science fiction book, the characters in this book are fully-realized, fleshed-out beings rather than two-dimensional clich&eacute;s.  They have their own quirks and flaws, fears and dreams, and it's easy to grow attached to them -- to the point where it can come as a shock when a favorite character dies.  Juliette, in particular, is a well-done character, and I found myself both cheering her on and fearing for her safety as she faced horrific trials through the book.  Even Bernard, the head of IT and the book's villain, is a complex character with his own reasons for doing what he does.<br /><br />Finally, I love the author's writing style -- it's neither bland and workmanlike, nor overly flowery and \\"purple.\\"  I've read plenty of books where the writing, while competent, is nothing special, and plenty of books where the author becomes overly descriptive or uses so many strange words I find myself reaching for a thesaurus every paragraph or so.  Howey hits the right balance, with just enough description to bring his world vividly to life and a writing style that keeps the reader turning the pages.  It reminds me of Stephen King, in a way -- the word choices are unique but appropriate for the situation, and bring his world to life.<br /><br />Quite possibly one of the best books I've read all year, this is a book that even those who don't normally read science fiction will enjoy.  A combination of a unique plot, strongly built world, richly realized characters, and a masterfulwriting style make it a great read.  Here's hoping it finds a spot as a sci-fi classic, right up there with \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" and \\"The Stand.\\"g style make it a great read.  Here's hoping it finds a spot as a sci-fi classic, right up there with \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" and \\"The Stand.\\"
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|This game is fun and has great artwork as well. A very good adaptation of the board game. Occasionally you must tap the screen multiple times before it registers when you are trying to do something.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I installed this app because it was #1 in the store. I had read the reviews and thought that it might be worth the 500+ Mb of extra space on my device. So I got it all downloaded and started to play. It was somewhat slow on my original Kindle Fire, but not too bad. The game itself was kind of lik Iron Man Temple Run... but not really. Today I opened up my notification bar only to find that I had 2 notifications from the game that I really don't want there. I guess if I were a big Iron Man fan this game would be worth it, but to me, it was just okay. I think I'm going to uninstall it so that I can free up some space.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|I bought this as soon as I had gotten my Kindle Fire. I have problems falling asleep and thought this  would be good with the white noise. Believe it or not this would come on my Kindle and play all by itself. I would shut my Kindle all the way down and it would come on. My husband nor I could remove the program. After telling people at work, their answer was \\" didn't you see the movie White Noise with Michael Keaton? Get that s*** off from there\\". We finally called up Amazon and they said there was something wrong with my Kindle. We exchanged it and if I want to relax I find a station on the Kindle radio that has some relaxation on. If you don't believe this I wish you luck.
0062024329|5.0|I bought this book for my son's 11th birthday, as I really wanted him to know this story.  I had tried reading the novel with him last year, hoping he would be as interested as I was, but he was wishy-washy about it, so when I discovered the graphic novel version, I knew that was the answer - and I was right: he can't put if down!  Highly recommended for younger readers (although, I should clarify, he reads well beyond his age group) and also for those, who, like me, read the novel & appreciate a more artistic interpretation as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was well written and understandable even with the medical terms used.  It clarified for me a long held idea that we are in control of more than our present circumstance.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Good graphics & sound, very enjoyable, fun & challenging puzzle game with a different twist. Got it FREE, but would recomend it even if you have to pay.
B00BPA6XUK|4.0|Great soundtrack box set.  Excellent music composed and structured very well. Love it!!! Enjoyable even if you are not a Halo fan.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This seems like a simple story, that of a child who goes to war. But all wars are fight by the youth. While the old send them off. This is Cards best book, one I can always find time to read. It deserves a place on every science fiction readers kindle, or bookshelf. I'm excited about the film and hope it will be half as good as this book. If you haven't read it, do your mind a favor and do so. I'll say nothing else because spoiling this book four a first time reader would be a sin.
0307887448|4.0|An extremely fun book, particularly for the forty-something set who came of age during the 80s--and especially for the geeks who played (or still play) D&D, video games, and had or coveted a TRS-80, Apple II, or Commodore 64.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I had started watching this series on Season 3 and now can watch it from the very beginning so I can see all of the episodes.  Thanks
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|I thought it was something like GostRecon. I was wrong, but like to play it. I hope y'all could fix the missions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun! I love how you can get in competitions and how you can win horses. The only problem I have with this game is that it takes forever to get your energy up. Over all, this is a great game to play if you are into virtual pets.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hi I'm Im Jay-bug and I absaloutley love subway surfers I play it almost everyday especially when I'm board it is so addicting. My mom will call me and I will be playing it and she will actually have to yell at me to get my attention and I mean yell. And she will be mad at me cause the next day she will be horse lol...I also have a really cool idea with the game is when ever like you get enough coins you get to goto another country like this is Tokyo and when you like get enough coins or something you go to a different country like England.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's great - for work &amp; personal devices,  including my Kindle Fire!  I'm still getting the hang of this,  but so far,  so good.  Evernote really does sync across all platforms:  iPad,  iPhone,  desktop,  laptop,  and my Kindle Fire.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the neatest calculator app, EVER!!!! The buttons are big and the number display is easy to read!!!! A must have!!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was an intense emotional journey with this family. The acting was great from everyone; the special effects so realistic. I cried and yelled at the screen a few times too. What an amazing movie and an incredible story.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it! Hate running out of energy, The game is so fun or it has awesome graphics! This is a fun and great application
B00BHMF578|4.0|strong cast, affleck a litle too pondering, but quality acting and a good (true) story. worthy of hte best picture oscar it won
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Good music but overall a yawn.  Cruise plays a good indulgent rockstar.  Alec is great as always but overall I would not watch it again.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a really great show eventhough there are a few things (namely Greg and Tamara) that I don't like. But I really love in the end of the season, we find out Peter Pan is a villain and the boy he's been looking for is Henry. And Baelfire was transported to the Enchanted Forest. I am looking forward to the third season and the spinoff, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Like most I had thought the essential 007 was Sean Connery.  Sean is now my second favorite after Skyfall convinced me daniel craig now has taken the James Bond legacy to a new level.  Gritty, physical, and fast paced it is a true 007 flick.  While it has a couple of gadgets one of the points of the movie is to point out not to rely too much on technology and the new Q points out that a trigger has to be pulled every now and then.  While Craig is no spring chicken he keeps himself in amazing shape and I understand he may be booked as Bond for the next 10 years.  Nice work if you can get it.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great car chases! Great action and just the right amount of comedy.  It had me cherring from the very start.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Very well done production where you care about the characters and lots of twists.  Totally different take on classics we grew up with.
0425252868|5.0|My husband was in the Air Force and loves reading anything connected to flying.  He really enjoyed this book and wants me to read it too.
B00BF123WG|4.0|If you don't walk away from this movie frustrated at our government's redtape and politics, but inspired by what a single minded person can accomplish when they put their mind to it then check your pulse.  When the actual mission kicks in it appears to be going in real-time and a little slow, but otherwise the movie keeps a decent pace and Jessica Chastain plays the part perfectly.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Pretty good culmination of the series. Felt like she was trying too hard to wrap up the series. Slightly disappointing but would still recommend - some decent twists.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is a great App!! You won't be disappointed. Try it for yourself. It's on the go music and it's a blast!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Such an incredible twist to the classic fairytale - I love this book! It is definitely in the top ten greatest books I've ever read!
B0016K40KY|5.0|What more can I say about the movie that hasn't been said?  I had the tape for years, now I have it on DVD to replace the tape.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you like the movie, you will enjoy the soundtrack. Clearer versions of the movie tracks. I would recommend this CD.
B00AG297GK|3.0|Some amusing points in a rather boring movie with lots of attempts to shock or piss off a culture I know little about. If anything some of the jabs at American society were pretty spot on.
B002V9PEUE|4.0|enjoyed it even more on blu-ray, Stallone is always going to be one of our fav action heroes, no doubt.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|The Waldb&uuml;hne amphitheatre is built alongside the Olympiastadion, the venue for the infamous 1936 Summer Olympics.  The Waldb&uuml;hne achieved notoriety itself in 1965, when the damage caused by a riot at a Rolling Stones concert necessitated a complete renovation.<br /><br />But on July 7, 2006, the Waldb&uuml;hne hosted a much more joyous event - a Friday night concert performance by Anna Netrebko, Rolando Villaz&oacute;n and Placido Domingo.  It was a prelude to the final game of the 2006 World Cup, which was played at the Olympiastadion the following Sunday.<br /><br />In this crowd-pleasing, popular collection, Domingo justifies his legendary status and all three performers justify their superstar status.<br /><br />It takes Netrebko a little while to warm up, emotionally, but when she does, she sizzles.  In fact, the emotional intensity of the performances is what most distinguishes this concert.  The previous year, Villaz&oacute;n had performed Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata at the Salzburg Festival, opposite Netrebko as Violetta, and there is an obvious chemistry between them.  Here, in the 'Brindisi' from La traviata, Villaz&oacute;n must share his character with Domingo, in their wooing of Netrebko's Violetta.<br /><br />Throughout the concert, Domingo, at 65, is simply astonishing.  But it is Villaz&oacute;n that shines brightest, and his performance of Rossini's La Danza is the highlight for me.  It is a miracle of breath control, apart from anything else.<br /><br />The Orchestra der Deutschen Oper of Berlin, under Marco Armiliato, is excellent, and the orchestral overtures and entr'acte are perfectly chosen.<br /><br />The concert was certainly a lot more fun than the World Cup final itself, which is chiefly remembered for France's Zinedine Zidane headbutting an Italian player.<br />[PeterReeve]
0385344228|5.0|As a criminal prosecutor myself, I'm pretty burnt out on anything having to do with the law - fiction books or otherwise.  Plus, I've honestly never cared much for John Grishim or anyone else in the genre.  Fortunately Defending Jacob turned out to be more of a psychological thriller than a legal potboiler. It reminded me a lot of [[ASIN:0062119044 We Need to Talk About Kevin tie-in: A Novel (P.S.)]], but not so much that Defending Jacob seemed like a rip off. There is definitely a whodunit to Defending Jacob, but it's much more creepy than what I associate with similar books.  Definitely recommended!
1574214276|4.0|I have used this all over the world.  It is very visual; not language required.  All ages enjoy participating sharing the fun.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Having read Gone Girl, after all the hype surrounding it, and being impressed by it I knew I definitely wanted to read more by Gillian Flynn.  I have just completed Sharp Objects in just a few days and enjoyed it very much.  There are books that are ordinary that you can't wait to finish, books you find a pleasant read and enjoy, and then books that you just can't put down and totally draw you in.  This is the latter.  I found myself so drawn into the creepy world the author has created with all her disturbed characters.  It is an absolute page turner, and once I started reading, had trouble stopping.  I felt like I was living the strange and creepy life of the main character Camille.  I look forward to reading Gillian Flynn's other book, Dark Places.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|A friend recommended it and I didn't expect much. I was soooooo wrong. it is great!! I cant stop playing. luv it!!
1608871452|4.0|This book was really great if you're into Supernatural, it gives some information that can clear up any confusion you may have had over the series (up to season 7). Some of it is a bit repetitive but it comes with posters and stickers.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This is a great movie and I have shared the DVD with several friends.although my 50 year old daughter didn't like it at all. :(
B005OYKI1I|5.0|One of the best Fast and the Furious movies. Can't wait to watch Fast and the Furious 6. Loved it!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Loved it and shared it with several friends. Haven't seen the film yet but I don't think it could be any better than this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Anyone who has watched season one can't wait to see seasons two and three available at Amazon.com.  I need say no more.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I was so surprised to hear this was a flop in London. I was so looking forward to seeing it on  Broadway. Loved it!
B000FCK65W|5.0|Excellent read. I could relate to her growing up years in a city. It was insightful, poignant, and so truthful. I read this as a Book Club choice. We all enjoyed it tremendously and shared many ideas about the story line.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Love the story and characters! Loved how they brought the story to a close. Full of surprises. I must see.
193700788X|5.0|I love the books of Charlaine Harris. I love the story. And the covers are great, I like the style.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is not very interesting. It is the old Solitaire.  It needs to be more challenging. It is hard to write fifteen words on this.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show.  Didnt really know about it when it was on tv, and completely regret not giving it a try when it was new. I love sci-fi and this is a decent X-File replacement.  The good part is now I dont have to wait to get through the summer before watching the next season, bad part is there are only so many seasons to watch.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie was not bad. I personally did not like it. It was an interesting concept but could not make me laugh.
B0000542D2|5.0|When this movie came out, my friends & I went to see it 17 times. I also own a copy of the original script. This DVD is wonderful- picture clear & crisp, sound & music clear & beautiful. I felt like I was back watching the movie with my friends again.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was a pretty good movie. Denzel is a great actor, and I love him in his movies. This movie had me guessing a little bit. I am glad that it ends the way it ends. I don't know if it was supposed to give a message about lying and alcoholism, but it does and I think that is good.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|This is perhaps the best movie made about B-17 Bombers in WWII. The first half is a little boring with lots of character build up, but the last hour is action packed. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone interested in WWII or Warbirds. It's getting hard to find, so don't dawdle.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|It wasn't really a terrible movie. But it definitely was not what I expected. It's not funny at all which is what I was hoping for.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|It might not seem like a big deal, but it is, depending on what you are recording with. Be warned.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is not at all what I thought it was going to be. I will be honest, it is kind of a weird movie. It was very enjoyable though.<br /><br />It bounces between stories which I had just seen in another movie. In the other movie the story line jumps were confusing and the movie felt like it was moving too fast. This movie was completely different. The jumps kept the story intriguing and exciting. All the stories link together in a fashion that can be best described as a quilt of stories. Each segment in the story was a good story by itself. The did not rely on each other to make the story, but when everything came together it was awesome. This does make for a long movie, but I was locked in and the time seemed to fly by.<br /><br />The way each story relates to the next is mind boggling in a great way. I instantly went and read the wikipedia page after watching it to get more information about the movie. I also felt the strongest of urges to watch it again. When I did, I saw new things, made new connections, and even formed some hypothesis about characters and their links.<br /><br />A thing I found very unique, was that the actors and actresses were used many times throughout the movie. When I first realized this I had this thought. This is either going to be genius or its going to fail epically. At the end when the credits ran, I saw actors had played parts I didn't even realize they were in. It was incredible. It was more than genius.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this movie and wanted very badly to see it again, which I did.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This game took over my kindle. I couldn't exit. My only choice was to delete it. Not even worth it for free.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This is a good story, and will continue to be a good story. I am a history buff though and some rights were taken in some of the information that was portrayed in the movie. Interesting though.
B0089XH38M|4.0|Just loaded up AVG on my cell phone last night. Haven't had a chance to test it. The loading was very prompt, it showed problems with one app that I had, so I removed it.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Everyone is giving this rave reviews. I did enjoy it, but it's not my favorite. It's a movie that's worth a try.
1451613512|5.0|The history that I learned in school and that most Americans believe today is so full of poisonous lies that the truths divulged in this book makes me feel sick. I have to stop after every chapter, every paragraph and every footnote to reflect on why these facts were buried so deeply that I, along with millions of other soldiers and Marines, risked my life for my country for reasons that were not heroic, noble, glorious or even honorable. As Marine General Smedley Butler writes, and I totally agree, we in the military were and still are  \\"a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers . . . a gangster for capitalism.\\" This book should be required reading in every high school.
B00BESM14U|3.0|This would not have been my first pick as far as movies go. But after watching it with some friends, it was interesting and had some twist that made it an average movie.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Real good one. It's fast paced and has suspense, action. Another good one from the author. Looking forward to read more.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's a fun, addicting game! My kids loved the original and they love OmNOM! Whether they are playing the game or watching the short movies, it keeps them occupied while I'm out running errands.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Great mystery, love the main character, would love to read more Michael Connelly is a good author, always keeps you guessing
B005PK57NU|5.0|Possibly the best show on television (besides Grey's).  Great characters, great acting, and the story is relatible.  It keeps you interested and entertained.
B00CW665VI|5.0|As an avid reader, you get used to \\"romance\\" books in the typical style.  This no-so-typical romance is written from the POV of Drew, a self-proclaimed womanizer.  Drew meets Kate, and is determined to change his ways.  His thoughts (and the ones he says out loud) are hilarious!  I enjoyed this book from the second I started reading, and I had a hard time putting it down.  I have put this author on my own watch list, and can't wait to see what she writes next :-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First, has anyone beaten a score of 26,341,087? Second this is a GREAT APP! Perfect for kids and Great for the youngies!!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of trying to get 3 stars on each game. It doesn't take a lot of strategy, just a good memory and quickness.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Having this new equipment obviously made all the difference!  At the time when the service rep suggested this, I didn't think it would make a difference---but it did and I couldn't be happier!
B00A3OSXVG|4.0|This collection has some hard to find goodies on it (Too Much To Dream, Dirty Water, Moulty, Run Run Run, Lies, as well as a few others.)  The only negative is like most compilations, there are a few songs that I have never heard of . Some are pretty good and others I hope to never hear again.  The download is worth the prive
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought the mouse as a replacement for my Logitech G500 after the wire went bad. I wanted a wireless gaming mouse but the were to expensive. So I saw this mouse had good reviews and figured if I don't like I can return it and seeing it was an Anker and I know these guys have amazing customer service (I bought an external battery from them and contacted them and they were more than helpful).<br /><br />So after using it for a while I can honestly say it is good mouse. The feel is nice and ergonomic and quite comfy buttons are laid out in predictable manner didn't feel out of place. The wights are a nice feature and I was happy that they where there and it was one of the factors that made me choose this mouse. However, the wights feel cheap like they are parts that fell from a car or something and they are all the same weight unlike the G500.<br /><br />The cord is long and has the rubber at the connected end of the mouse which if the G500 had it would have been still functioning. The mouse has a macro button where you can program inputs from the same mouse buttons. I wish it had the possibility to record keyboard inputs, it would have been more useful to me.<br /><br />The software that came with it is really nice and easy to navigate and easy to get the gist of. One of the thing I like about you can set up different profile settings and chose how much DPI for the mouse. From 200 all the way up to 8000 with 200 increments.And it has some funky stuff like changing the color and breathing speed for the Anker logo.<br /><br />Honestly if I had known about this mouse before I got the G500 I would have got over it.<br />The down side of this mouse is the wights are not different and probably would have liked to see a wireless version or small travel case as an option maybe cause I use this mainly for my Laptop computer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an AWESOME app.<br />You will never get bored of it. Even if you unlock everything, you can still try beating your high score!<br />Great app!<br />(and it's free!)
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie never gets old. Such a classic and a great movies for all ages!  The animation and vibrant colors are beautiful.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best racing game for your kindle ever!! I love it and its awesome. You never get bored and its easy to learn. Thanks Fingersoft for making such an awesome game!
0802473156|4.0|I enjoyed the book, it had lots of great ideas to strengthen your marriage.  It was easy to read and understand.  Lots of examples to make it easy to put the ideas into practice.  I passed it onto a good friend to read.  I would recommend the book to anyone wanting to have a good relationship.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is definitely their most unique album (compared to their previous ones) and a lot more eclectic and pop-y. Songs are catchy and definitely a lot more experimentation with the ranges/sounds of Hayleys voice. &#60;3
B005HSL626|4.0|Haven't spent much time playing it but it seems like there are plenty of levels and difficulty to keep me busy for a while
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I enjoy watching The Good Wife... can't wait to see the next episode. There is always something interesting to look forward to.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|I love this album. I think Imagine Dragons has a unique sound, and I love that each song on this album sounds different from the last. I received the vinyl edition of the album for Christmas, and I think it sounds particularly great on vinyl.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|Clear, concise. Bobbie Brown is the best! She explains everything so even if you don't know much about applying make-up, you will know how, after reading this book.
0857685570|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2A4ABG1Z2KQFR]]I really love this book.  It has a large quality and variety of movie poster artwork.  It's got a bunch of full-page artwork from some of my favorite movies: Star Wars, Back to the Future, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harry Potter, etc.  There is also some of Drew Struzan's personal artwork included, that was very interesting to see as well.<br /><br />This is the second Drew Struzan book I have owned.  Here was the first, which I also highly recommend (although both books do share a decent amount of the same artwork): [[ASIN:1848566190 The Art of Drew Struzan]]
B006M4F67A|5.0|i love mahjong of any kind. this one was great.keep up the good work. i am looking for more types.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|What a wonderful book. It  has been a true pleasure.. A great joy to read.. Congratulations to mr. Eben Alexander and his family
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Awesome, heart-wrenching series that delivers an authentic portrayal of the emotional aspects of war. Absolutely love it. Once you start watching, you will not want to stop.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Originally described a a fictional 'romance' when first published by Herbert George Wells in 1894, this 2002 film version, although it refers to also be based on the 1960 David Duncan screenplay, differs in a number of details from the original screenplay & novel.<br /><br />It begins in 1899 New York instead of Wells' beloved Richmond, England. The Time Traveller, Alex Hartdegan (debatedly cast Guy Pierce), is a Mechanics & Engineering professor at Columbia U, and, though he has a love interest, Emma (Sienna Guillory), is bored with the present. Something terrible occurs, & Alex begins work on a machine, so that he may travel back & prevent the accident. During four years, this is unbeknownst to his friend Philby (a barely registering, nor concerned, Mark Addy), or his housekeeper, Mrs Watchit (Phyllida Law).<br />Unable to change the past, Alex throws himself into what the future holds. He stops for a brief look in 2030 at the Public Library's human-like hologram, Vox (Orlando Jones), but in 2037, he witnesses the Moon breaking apart, raining down meteors. A quake buffets him, & unconscious, he unknowingly races into the dark & then changing-climate, far-future landscape. Finally conscious though delirious, he stops in a forest: July 16th, 802,701 A.D.<br />A young adult human female, Mara (Samantha Mumba), revives him & realizes he speaks in a long dead ancient language, which the Eloi (polynesian-appearing), as her people are called, occasionally learn to know more about the few odd ancient library ruins near them. Mara & her young brother hesitate to explain why they all live on high cliffs, but relent & reveal there is danger from the underground race called the Morlocks.<br />On a day excursion, she & other Eloi are attacked from below - Alex horrified as they disappear with the beast-like Morlocks. Alex puts into motion a rescue attempt, but meets an intelligent, more human Morlock leader (Jeremy Irons), a telepath, who understands Alex - & his fears. The dangerous encounter finds a wounded Alex on his machine, racing into the far future. Emerging from a time-worn mountain, in the year 635,427,810 A.D., Alex, stunned, finds a red, scarred, moon-like wasteland, far to the horizon. And, in the distance is a line of biped beings, walking slowly.<br /><br />Seeing this future, Alex realizes there are things he must do - including for himself.<br /><br />The CGI effects are very effective in depicting time travel, and with the original Traveller's<br />reference to optics in the novel, seems to make the Machine itself much more realistic.<br />Obvious early questions re being-in-the-same/previous-time-&-nearby-place confusion slows the film's pace briefly. Guy Pierce more than adequately evolves his character from an academic to a courageous hero. Wells' great-grandson, Simon Wells, actually began the directorial duties, but was replaced due to exhaustion by Gore Verbinski. The effective & beautiful symphonic score is by Klaus Badelt. The film's trailer reveals a few frames of a more beautiful & bucolic end-future.<br />The original Philby in the '60 movie, Alan Young, makes a cameo as a florist in 1899.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app saved my sanity.  After fighting for hours to load my email and google calendars, I read a chat recommending the product.  It was easy to load and did everything I wanted it to do.  I like the way it sets up my schedule.  Thanks,  Terry Luke
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is my second go-round. I had enjoyed the game- but seemed to have completed all the rungs. So I took a break and now I'm back.<br />Georgia654
B008KYOCA2|5.0|While a few features are not available unless you purchase the upgrade,the basic, FREE, app does all that I need.
B000002G7G|4.0|With the loss of John Cale, Lou Reed became the major voice in the band. It is audible, the album sounding much like Reed's early solo work. Although it boasts some great tracks, in particular, What Goes On, which Bryan Ferry covered on [[ASIN:B00002DEB7 Bride Stripped Bare]], Some Kinda Love, Pale Blue Eyes and Beginning to See the Light, it is not as strong as the succeeding albums. Worthwhile.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Suspenseful? Yes. Interesting from an historical and political perspective? Yes. Great acting? Not really. Best picture? No way. Glad I watched it. Glad I didn't pay movie theater prices to see it.
B00022M518|5.0|Like the successor, [[ASIN:B00015TOCY Taking Tiger Mountain]], this album is full of silliness, humour and good music. Brian Eno made a huge impression with these two albums, before devoting himself to ambient music, much to the detriment of lovers of good rock.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It's been a long time since I've watched a movie that I didn't want to end. Thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing with an unexpected twist at the end for good measure. Great movie to discuss with friends -- which &#34;story&#34; do you believe?
B00005MCX0|5.0|This is the second album by space rock pioneers, Hawkwind. It is a radical change of course from their first album and determines the direction of the band's subsequent work. It reached 18th place on the British charts and remains one of the band's classics. This is music of excess - hard, psychedelic and electronic - that aims to expand the mind without chemical aid. Find out if it succeeds! The bonus tracks are nice additions, notably Silver Machine.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I recently discovered the Fire and Ice series. I ordered the 4 volume kindle set and the 5th book separately. I agree with the other negative reviews. The first 3 books were amazing, I loved the action and character development. The 4th book ended rather abruptly with many unresolved issues. The authors note indicated that he decided to split up his final book into 2 and focus on some characters more in each book.  I just finished Dance With Dragons and while I have grown to know these characters well, I was disappointed in the lack of any plot resolution or even any plan to the story. It meandered around from one character to another without saying much, generally leaving you hanging and completely unsatisfied. I also dont understand the need to add even more new characters to the book when there were so many interesting ones already in place. i felt it diluted the overall story too much and lost any cohesion to the plot.I agree that perhaps Mr. Martin has given his best to the first 3 books and has lost his path for these last two. I may buy the next one as I'd really like to know how it all turns out in the end, but fear I'll be left still bored and with unresolved questions.
B00004XQJX|5.0|Beethoven's Diabelli Variations are even more highly regarded by most experts than Bach's popular Goldberg Variations. I would agree. Bach wrote the Goldberg Variations for an insomniac patron, while Beethoven wrote the Diabelli Variations in response to a kind of wager or proposal. He created this master work, laying aside other monumental projects, in order to work on it. Some suggest that Beethoven might have felt belittled into participating in such an unworthy project, that he wished to demonstrate his compositional prowess by lavishly outdoing the proposal's conditions by completing a full 33 variations. Whatever the reason, Beethoven gave us this marvel for solo piano and Pollini offers us his interpretation on this disk.
B00076RT24|5.0|I have had this movie on VHS since it came out new. Over the years I have slowly been updating them to DVD this was the last one I needed. Now my collection is complete. Good movie I think the third one is better though.
B000001H00|5.0|This music is some of the most celebrated Bach wrote, if not the most. Milstein recorded it at least twice; this recording is his final version. This is a must-have album. Heavenly!
B00AEFXEZE|5.0|What a hunk!  In spite of the rumors that he is &#34;bi&#34; he is one sexy guy!  It was interesting to see his vulnerability with Lauren Hutton.....saw the movie when it was originally released.....still holds up after all these years.
B001NE81FI|5.0|Legendary can be said of much of what Captain Beefheart recorded. It certainly applies to Safe as Milk! Without exaggeration, this is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. It is bursting with classic songs and sounds as novel today as it did in 1967. Of the bonus tracks, Trust Us stands out particularly. Essential!
B000000XB9|5.0|Outstanding!  Loved them when they first appeared on the Johnny Cash TV show.....love them just as much today.  A most unique sound....
B0000009RT|5.0|Frank Zappa parodied the '60s counter-culture that he was so critical of on this album. He succeeded so well that the album has come to stand for flower power, despite the overt goofiness, sarcasm and potent social criticism.
B000BZIST4|5.0|One of Gene Hackman's best.....such a truly great actor.....just wish he were younger and could make more movies.  He is the best!  Always convincing and believable in the roles he assumes.
B0000256KE|5.0|Roxy Music's early albums were ground-breaking and remain essential items for collectors of rock. Bryan Ferry has not yet developed his famous voice, but the album sounds Bryan all the same.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Great performances by Kennedy and Newman... Classic scenes... Classic lines... Classic characters...<br />8 more words required? Sheesh, almost there... yea
B000001GRZ|5.0|This is one of Bach's (many) can't do without albums. Deutsche Grammophon's Legendary 'The Originals' Recordings are just that. Watch for them!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game. But I think the characters are a bit to high priced. It's very hard to get the characters I want to get. Other than that it's a good game.
B00359Y054|4.0|One of my teenage favourites, this album has some good tracks, in particular the title track. The band had not fully developed their sound, as they would on their terrific subsequent two albums.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great Tarantino; stylish violent and funny. Great job by all cast members most notably Christoph Waltz. You should see this movie
B000000Y1H|5.0|This album could easily qualify as Thelonious' best. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was added to the US National Recording Registry. This is my favourite Monk album.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is absolutely great. I like that my Kindle can be in sleep mode but the alarm still goes off. It also has a few great features but I like that its simple. Nice app.
B00359Y05E|4.0|This is a favourite from my teenage years. I still like it. This and Vol 4 were their best. Classic rock.
125000098X|2.0|I have read most of Archer's work and have always looked forward to the release of his next book. This book is his poorest . Such a shame for such a talented author. He gives the reader the feeling he is writing for the money  and has really lost interest in telling a great story.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|This album, like [[ASIN:B00026WU82 Highway 61 Revisited]], is from Bob Dylan's best period. It includes the classics, Gates Of Eden and It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, in particular, and many more. Recommended.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie.  It had a good story line and a nice twist to the ending.
B00015TOCY|5.0|It's about time that this masterpiece of 1970s rock was remastered. The absurd lyrics, electronic treatments and instrumentation by members of Roxy Music guarantee music of exceptional and enduring quality. This is a most enjoyable album with humour, silliness and class.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Really good....this is the first book I read that was from the man's point of view.  I had to check to make sure this was actually a woman author.  Yes, it is that good.  From start to finish I was hooked.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I was initially critical of this dance-metal band, but decided to pick up their first four albums, given both the astonishing worldwide acclaim for a group that sings almost exclusively in German, and the sensational and not to be missed live concert video, [[ASIN:B000KRN2I0 Volkerball Live]]. For a native speaker, German lyrics are a treat, but the overall quality of Rammstein's songs surprised me. There is not one track on this album that is not outstanding! Although die-hard fans seem to prefer [[ASIN:B00005AAFS Mutter]], I would suggest that this album ties with [[ASIN:B0000057C5 Sehnsucht]] as their finest.<br /><br />Each of Rammstein's albums deals with morbid or objectionable themes on a few tracks. As they stated in an interview, the hardness of their sound demands it. It's true. It is uncomfortable being seduced into tapping one's toes, singing along or dancing to songs about the auto-erotic pleasures of a hermaphrodite, cannibalism, torture, rape and incest. Notwithstanding, Rammstein has enriched the rock canon with remarkable music of lasting merit through their brilliant and catchy lyrics and unique sound.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Love everything about this show! Even though I'm very late in watching it I enjoy all I've seen so far.
B0009QZ4CE|5.0|This is the first of the three greatest Van der Graaf Generator albums. The bonus tracks are muffled and lacking. Still, this is one of the best.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really liked it.  Just enough hints to keep you from getting to frustrated. I will buy future versions...but I will not use the hints so often.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Miles Davis' Bitches Brew defies description. To call the music jazz is a stretch, at least insofar as what most of us expect. This is not to it's detriment, however. To the contrary, this music appeals to a wide audience, not just to a jazz one, but to a rock audience, too. If you want to hear something different, give this album a try.<br /><br />I chose this version of Bitches Brew instead of the 3CD [[ASIN:B003M0H4NG Bitches Brew (Legacy Edition)]] because I didn't feel that the extras, mostly live recordings, were worth paying more than twice as much for. I have never been keen on live recordings. If you feel otherwise, you might choose differently.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|Great price. Fast shipping. Arrived early. Packaged well. This product was installed in an QNAP TS-469 Pro Turbo NAS<br />with 1GB initial memory. After installation the Server reported 2.93 GB and have had no problems. Saved me some<br />money. What else needs to be said.
B001TIQTFC|4.0|This first Bad Seeds album marks a departure from the earlier Birthday Party material. The album lacks, perhaps, in discipline. Nevertheless, it has Nick's passionate rendition of Leonard Cohen's Avalanche. I also particularly like Cabin Fever, Well of Misery, From Her to Eternity and Wings Off Flies. There is much worth hearing on this good debut album. The DVD contains some more gems, including In the Ghetto. Get it to round out your collection of early Cave.
B0087X728K|3.0|I haven't noticed anything that makes me feel that it is superior to other thermal pastes.<br />It is adequate. XXX
B000001FOL|5.0|This is the first of Nico's albums. Apparently, she was not happy with the producer for having added strings, which diluted the gothic rock sound she strove for. As a result, it is unlike her subsequent masterpieces, reissued on [[ASIN:B000M06SV8 NEW Nico - Frozen Borderline 1968-70 (CD)]] and [[ASIN:B008RYN5YE End: Expanded Edition]]. Nevertheless, the album retains Nico's sombre outlook and presents an overt beauty rarely heard in her later work. It is a classic that is not to be overlooked.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Aside from my terrible, quippy title, Sanderon's The Way of Kings is one of the best fantasy books I've read in years.  5-star characters. 5-star plot. 6-star world - the world is extremely creative, consistent, and credible.<br /><br />The biggest question is, will Sanderson die before finishing the Stormlight Archive, necessitating some upstart to co-author a less-than-ideal conclusion?  Pray to the Heralds he does not!
B000007VKZ|5.0|I waited a long time to get this album. It has lost nothing in more than ten years since its original release. This is an album, no less than [[ASIN:B000003RCY Herzeleid (Ger)]], [[ASIN:B00005AAFS Mutter]] and [[ASIN:B0002XDODU Reise Reise]], to play over and over again. This is real rock, pounding and raw, but captivating and original, in no way generic. The lyrics, albeit sometimes shocking and offensive, go with the music. There is not one song that is not sensational. This music doesn't wear out. As a bonus, this album includes a cover of Depeche Mode's Stripped. Don't expect a limp-wristed rendition like the original. Rammstein have recorded the definitive version.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|At first I thought this is going to be silly it started slow but then the characters really took on and it was hard to put the book down, it's well written sometimes very funny but never boring
B0000041BX|5.0|Schubert's String Quartets are exquisitely beautiful and the Quartetto Italiano do them justice. This is very emotional music that will appeal immediately. Do yourself a favour!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book..it was so easy to follow..I loved the shifting of the stories in time by the chapters..i loved the characters and the fact that they were flawed  because they actually mirrored life itself..<br />It . was truly a learning experience for me on so many levels..I learned about the foster care system I learned about trust and betrayal I learned about  how one  can pick themselves up and become whole again ..I learned that one should never say NEVER..I learned about the meanings of flowers and how they speak to people  BUT  .the most  important  thing that I learned is that love can truly help to make a wounded person heal if they open their minds  and hearts to it<br />I definitely  recommend this book. It's ..fast reading and  hard to put down
B0000033WC|5.0|With this album, the Velvet Underground have successfully transitioned to a more accessible song format. Lou Reed continued in this vein as a solo artist. Many fans lament the laying to rest of the earlier Velvet Underground, with it's intoxicating distortion and drone, but this album can boast a wide-reaching appeal, with classic numbers like Sweet Jane, Rock & Roll and Ocean. This set includes an alternate album of early versions and 13 bonus tracks that add significantly to the album. Get it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had this on ipad after my baby was born and it had nice soothing melodies. I dont know if it really helped my baby to sleep through but music is very pleasing to hear and I liked that you can select and mix sounds. After using it for 3 months overall its a great app and definitely would recommend to any newly parents for their newborns.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Southern rock has a certain appeal. With the songs, Tuesday's Gone, Simple Man and Free Bird, it really was simple, man! It is a nice addition to my collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|cute and fun<br /> I like this game.. my grandsons enjoy it as well.. l love watching the kids play this game. thank you
B000001GXB|5.0|For the longest time, my only experience of Beethoven was through his symphonies, [[ASIN:B000002RRB Symphonies 1-9]]. I decided to broaden my experience by exploring his piano sonatas. Pollini is wonderful, simply wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great read. Great plot. Great characters. Couldn't put it down. Do yourself a favor, block out a weekend, and settle in for a very enjoyable ride through sci-fi at its best. A definite 5 star rating.Thanks Mr. Howey
B002JIEYLW|4.0|I first got this album when it was released in 1972. I had reservations about buying an album that I listened to as a teenager, but I have already played it dozens of times. I still love it... Wheels of Confusion, Tomorrow's Dream, Supernaut, Snowblind and Under the Sun, in particular. Quiet songs were never their forte. This and [[ASIN:B00359Y05E Master of Reality]] are Black Sabbath's finest. Get them both!<br /><br />It is true that there is a noticeable drop in the volume of the right channel at 4 minutes 52 seconds into Wheels of Confusion. It never bothered me. Could it be that I had it cranked up too loud? I suppose I'll have to live with it, but you don't. Get a different edition.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Alice in Chains have released what could be, for me, one of my favourite AIC albums. TDPDH is a slow burner. It displays a muffled rage and a mellow sadness that seeps under your skin without you knowing. Times have changed, our society has grown cold and hard, emotion is a sickness people do not display and both DuVall and Cantrell know this. We have here a record that will quietly bury itself into your psyche without you recognising it. You are only aware of it if you pay attention - and so my opinion is that this record not only has a great deal of replay value but it's worth buying.  Some people will complain about Layne's absense. Some people will complain about song length. Some people will say Black Gives Way to Blue is better. I also see people complaining about the mastering. Also, yes there is a lot of harmony to the vocals. I wouldn't have noticed it and it didn't bother me until I read people's thoughts about it. My thought is, if it's good enough for Cantrell then it's good enough for me.  So, firstly, while we can never get Layne back, Cantrell is the oil in the machine that is AIC and always has been - DuVall is a suitable replacement for not just his real singing ability but his ability to lull you into a comfort zone, then bluedgeon you with statements that you wouldn't have recognised they are as powerful as they are, albeit with maturity. Had Layne been singing, you'd have felt the quiver of his voice and heard it through the emotion he was able to convey. But Layne is dead, all that remains are the ideas that AIC strived to portray in their music. AIC are not trying to repeat the past, just carry elements of their music along with them to the present and future. Relationships, religion, anger, sadness, the passage of time and states of discontent. They are relevant to all people.  AIC do not make one-hit wonders. They make albums that will stay with you. Go back and listen to Black Gives Way to Blue and you grow more fond of it the more you hearit - TDPDH is the same - but dynamically a better album. I recall certain songs from BGWTB that really stood out. Here, almost all the tracks stand out, although you will need to use the replay button over a long period to actually figure that out.  I don't need to explain the songs in detail, I'll leave that to you, but briefly: Hollow, Pretty Done, Stone, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, Lab Monkey & Phantom Limb are all the slow burning rockers on this album. The rest - Voices, Low Ceiling, Breath on a Window, Scalpel, Hung on a Hook and Choke are the slightly softer melodic tracks. At the first few listens of course, they 'sound the same'. Although AIC are not amateurs. There are nuances, hooks, melodic choruses and melodies placed smartly that give each song a particular character, which is addictive.  As for song length... well this is a legitimate grunge band. This is not Yellowcard, Greenday, Nickleback. They are not a one-trick pony relying on riffs or just melody. They are creating an atmosphere that's meant for you to be immersed in. The shortest song comes in at about 4:20 or so without having the track lengths in front of me. For me, AIC have done something that, in my opinion, Soundgarden failed to do with their comeback. They lost no energy. They confidently approached the present keeping the past in the past. Then they bought something new to it all and didn't try to appease everyone or sell-out. They stayed relevant and true to their sound.  In terms of mastering, well I am listening to my copy ripped from the disc, at 320kbps, with good Sony earphones and on an iPhone with a 'Rock' equilizer. It sounds fine to me and I don't know where the issue is. If you are a fan of the album, I'm sure you would find a way past whatever perceived audio issue you have otherwise. 'Brickwalling' or whatever terminology these spoiled kids use when they complain about the stuff they download illegally isn't something that should bother you unless you operate a sound studio and own a thousand-dollar set of audio cans.  Lastly, the album title, 'the Devil Put the Dinosaurs Here' (or as I jokingly refer to it as The Devil Put Them Bones Here) of course refers cynically to the basis of organised religion and those who would otherwise use the spiritual, metaphysical aspects of religion to segregate, espouse hatred and abuse people's innocence. Fitting, since one of the Layne's last songs was 'Get Born Again'. AIC might be pioneers, but they never lost their sense of reality or humility; they stood for the common people who believe in honesty. And their musical product is honest. They aren't delivering a polished turd pretending to be gold, rather a humble piece of silver that, with the right set of eyes (or ears) reflects their real value.  Buy this album and appreciate one of the few remaining true rock bands around.
B00026WU82|5.0|This album, like [[ASIN:B00026WU9Q Bringing It All Back Home]], is from Bob Dylan's best period. It includes the classics, Tombstone Blues and Desolation Row, in particular, and many more. Recommended.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|It plays more like a docudrama, which I liked.  I found it exciting though my action-driven teenaged son wanted a little more in the way of fighting.  Damon is more subdued than one is used to after the Bourne series but I thought he played his character very well.  Overall a good entertaining film.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Superlatives are wasted on Rammstein. How many times 'very' would convey how strongly I recommend their albums? Mutter is one of their best, along with [[ASIN:B000003RCY Herzeleid (Ger)]], [[ASIN:B0000057C5 Sehnsucht]] and [[ASIN:B0002XDODU Reise Reise]]. Just get them all.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|I've seen the original series, which my son had not.  There were certainly some references from the first series but it didn't make a difference to my teenage son's enjoyment (he's 16).  I found the movie ridiculous but it was bearable.
B000003RCY|5.0|Masses have rated this album with five stars. Could I rate it otherwise? Of course not! I was amazed by the mature and committed musical direction of this album, the band's first. Most bands take an album or two to find their voice. Not so, Rammstein. They had it right from the get-go.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|One of my favorites. Natalie Portman and Jean Reno are outstanding, and their relationship makes this the great movie that it is.  Danny Aiello as the understanding Don and Gary Oldman as the corrupt cop round out a top notch cast.  I can and will continue to watch this movie regularly: it's the perfect mix of action, drama, excitement, and gun play that makes for a really great movie.
B0018RWD5O|5.0|Crescent is a more relaxed album than what jazz legend John Coltrane was later to offer. It was recorded in 1964, preceding [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]]. Mighty fine!
B00942XS04|4.0|As far as sequels go, this one was really good, kept the characters the same with same voices and same personality, had a fun story line, introduced some new fun characters, but just wasn't quite as good as the original.  Mater is really the star of this one and while I always like him, I feel like his character shined more in the first movie then in this one.  But it's still cute and entertaining so I will definitely watch it again.
B000002C2E|5.0|Bob Dylan is a brilliant songwriter, most certainly, but I am not so wild about his albums. Sure, I have and greatly enjoy the early 1960s folk classics, [[ASIN:B00026WU82 Highway 61 Revisited]] and [[ASIN:B00026WU9Q Bringing It All Back Home]], but his other albums seem bland. Boy, has Time Out Of Mind surprised me! It is a return to his early genius, the genius rambling, poetic ballads that I longed too long to hear again. Perhaps it is Daniel Lanois' touch? Should I hear [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy]]? I might discover another timeless masterpiece, for Time Out Of Mind is, without dispute, Bob Dylan at his very best.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|This movie put forth some interesting concepts, and the telling of the story across multiple timelines/lives was an interesting idea, but the execution failed to bring all the stories and lives together in a meaningful way in the end. Really not acceptable given the great cast and long runtime.
B000002UAU|5.0|What can one add to nearly 1000 other reviews? As a footnote, John Lennon was apparently an admirer of Captain Beefheart. Compare Sergeant Pepper's with  [[ASIN:B001NE81FI Safe As Milk (7 Bonus Tracks)]] to gain an understanding of the approaches that made the sound of 1967. It's getting better all the time!
B00BESM14U|5.0|The unknown actors really did a great job and Emma Watson perfectly hides her british accent to play a believable American teenager.
B004KX5KQC|5.0|Cave's early masterworks period is behind him. A more straightforward rock sound is now in evidence on this album and on [[ASIN:B004KX5KOO Murder Ballads (Collector's Edition)]]. Nevertheless, these two albums may still be considered essential. Of particular note are Do You Love Me, Loverman, Jangling Jack, Red Right Hand, I Let Love In, Thirsty Dog and Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore. The album is full of good listening.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a very gun game you play when you have some time to burn. It is also a great way to distract children in boring situations.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album, along with [[ASIN:B000002G7C And Nico]], are the Velvet Undergound's masterpieces. White Light/White Heat has superior sound quality and is more polished, yet the trademark distortion and feedback remain and are used to full effect, particularly on the amazing Sister Ray. Classic VU!
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Very instructive and nice to read. It is definitely a good guide. If you are curious about how our decision process works, this book is for you.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This album is stronger than [[ASIN:B000BK8FH4 Rosenrot]], although perhaps not as strong as Rammstein's first four studio albums, but I like it more with each listening. I miss the toe tapping dance rhythms and the catchy sing-along lyrics that were the hallmarks of Rammstein's unmistakable sound. While this album offers some of each, the industrial techno-dance aspect is not as dominant as on the earlier albums. The standout track is Haifisch, based on the famous Brecht-Weill song, Mack the Knife. While not essential, the extra disc on the deluxe edition has a few good songs worth buying. This is very good metal rock that transcends clich&eacute;d adolescent metal.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A fun ride fueled by nostalgia.  If you are an 80s kid who loves video games and cheesy movies this book is for you!
B000000XB9|5.0|I had the singles of every one of these songs, except the last, as a teenager. This was great music then and is still as great today!
B00782O7IY|5.0|I've been meaning to buy this film as it was, and finally had the push to make it official.  It's a good starting point for anyone who wishes to experience the magic of silent film, as it is clever, funny and endearing, despite the initial fears of no dialogue.  It truly shows the talent of all those involved as they had to rely on a different style of acting.
B000001GXF|5.0|This album boasts classic recordings of two of Schubert's most beautiful works. There is no reason to hesitate in picking this one up.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|This is a great movie and is the start of the whole series! Introduces all the characters and a great story.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I love this movie great movie to sit and watch with my younger sister she loves it to and watches it with her friends
B002SRQ214|5.0|Everything about this CPU is great other than the fact that the default fan you get when you buy<br />this thing is extremely loud ! I play alot of games like bf3,cod,minecraft and if you dont wear a<br />headset this fan will drown out the game so loud that you won't be able to hear anything. I<br />recently got a new fan that cost about $30 and it runs so much quieter now ! I do recommend this cpu but<br />I also recommend buying another fan for it !
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|This is a great book. Anyone can learn something from it. I've read most books on mixing that are out there and they don't really give you much useful information. They are just filled with useless opinions and technical information that no one needs to know. But this book is exellent. I have been mixing in small studios for years and still got a couple good tips out of it. Especially now that I have moved completely to the digital realm. I wish this book was out years ago when I was starting out. There would be a bunch of bands with better sounding albums:)
0399226907|3.0|This book is a great book, and I bought it for my nephew's first birthday because I thought that I should share my love of reading with him at a young age. However, I'm incredibly disappointed with Amazon.com's shipping practices. I ordered this book on May 25th thinking that a week was enough time for it to ship for my nephew's party on June 2nd. However, it's been two days and the thing hasn't even left the Amazon warehouse yet! I'm ridiculously nervous that it won't get here in time. Very disappointed. I understand that the warehouse for Amazon is very large, but if this doesn't come in time, I'm going to be very distraught.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This is the last of the series and Mr. Archer has maintained a constant, very high level of tension, intrique and knowledge of the subjects.  All have been extremely well written (a special treat as so many authors do not seem to know the English lanquage very well).  The plots weave round the characters - drawing the reader into the lives of the people populating the books.
1592407889|3.0|I found it very interesting re her life etc. but certain parts of it were almost pornographic.  I didn't need to know all the physical details of her sexual life. I wouldn't want to give it to a friend for that reason.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I always think of David Tennant as my favorite Dr, but watching all of the Christopher Eccleston Dr Who's in a row made me wonder. The 9th Dr is so full of fury and pain - Eccleston plays him as the man tormented by his past that he truly is. Much darker and more serious than the 10th Dr - but with that sense of humor and sudden action that hints of a fascinating insanity. If you like your Dr on the moody, introspective side, Eccleston's your Dr.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I haven't read it yet, so therefore I can't give a review of the book. I'll start it when i am finished with others I am reading.
0316067598|5.0|First and Foremost, Thank you to all that are serving or served!  Secondly, this is an amazing story and well written book that reads much like a story and not like a research paper.  I am not a very emotional person but this book was very difficult to read without experiencing all ranges of emotions....there were actually a few times where I caught myself on the verge of tears.  I am very glad that I read this book and I will always be indebted to all military personel who have given their lives for our freedom.  This book is a great way for civilians, as myself, to get an inside look into the elite military.
B000SEITDI|3.0|I went to the magnolia bakery on a trip to NYC and could not help fall in love with it! So when I realized that there were books with recipes from this bakery, I bought all the books, I even preordered one of them. However I now realized that all 3 books are THE SAME maybe 1 or 2 different recipes, even the insert photos are the same!!! Its really dissapointing to know they did this! If you want buy one of them but not the 3 like I did! Now I'm stuck with these books! :( i feel cheated!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Worked very well with my Kindle Fire. I already have this cable cord but it works well with the Power Fast charger.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|No way my grandkids could follow this game!  I deleted it!!  Maybe show what age of children this will appeal to!! Very disappointed!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Received on the date they said I was getting it. Recommend buying from seller in the future. Great deal. Well done
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Can't play this game until you buy things to play with it....  STUPID!!!!  I deleted this game!!!  Worst download ever!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The 1st episode of the season kicks off with a bang and a ton of action. I've heard some people say the 1st and 2nd season were better, but I am just as impressed in the 3rd season with the focus on the character development and the unfolding story line. I noticed Rick is alot tougher and more decisive after all the loss of life and sacrifices the group has had to make, so as the leader he is forced into total survival mode and is less concerned about &#34;feelings.&#34; So far it rocks!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I've read so many positive reviews for this book, but I think it was overly long & excessively drawn out. I think 200 pages could have been cut without losing any important content from the story. I do realize that Gillian Flynn is a fledgling novelist; however I also feel that those writing the glowing reviews of this book should try books by authors such as James Patterson, Harlen Coben, David Baldacci to truly know what a great book is all about.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|the scenes are very vivid and the story plot is very good<br />recommend this movie.<br />if you like cartoons, it is a good movie for both adults and children
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is one of the greatest.  I've loved &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; ever since I saw the restored version in theaters in 1988.  I was startled when the intermission came after almost 2 hours, because I was so engrossed in the story it felt like very little time had passed -- and I'm generally not a fan of long movies.  It's wonderful to have this top-drawer film in a glowing doubly-restored blu-ray.  If you like movies and haven't seen &#34;Lawrence&#34; you should get this blu-ray for the best experience of it outside of a theater.  If you have seen &#34;Lawrence&#34;, why don't you already have this blu-ray?  :o)
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great film. Helpful for anyone in a relationship.<br />Separates essential from trivial.<br />Bravo!<br />I will watch this film again and recommend it<br />to all my friends.
B006FE83UE|5.0|A great book made into a great movie.  How often does that happen?  This is one of those stories you have to read in high school but, unlike some of the others, can come back to it again and again over the years with renewed pleasure.  The film does the book justice and that's all I need to say.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|A terriic movie with good action.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|I enjoyed Iron Man 2 more than I thought I would.  The plot is looser and less well-thought-out than the first film, but it's still entertaining and I took pleasure in the interactions among the characters.  I expected a shrill and unpleasant Pepper Pots because of another review I'd read, but actually found her just as likeable as in the first picture.  She's sensible, patient, and quite forbearing, considering Tony Stark's off-the-rails antics.  All in all, a solid popcorn summer movie.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|A must buy for any music lover.  I love all the songs. Still into you is my favourite as well as fast in my car.  The whole album is quite different but you can hear the paramore in it. Enjoy!
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|I will always love this movie no matter how old I get. Just a great concept and I love the sets that were created for this movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging and thought provoking! Short but worth playing. Puzzle lovers will really enjoy this game.  Great graphics and creepy sounds.Can't wait for more Rooms!!!
B005L38QHA|2.0|I just returned this mouse after using it for just over a week. I am a female and despite the fact that I have long fingers I found this mouse too large, heavy and bulky to use. I think this mouse was definitely designed for a man with \\"man hands\\".<br /><br />It does not work well with Macs. Every time I restarted my iMac I would have to redo the color settings. Not a huge deal but still irritating.<br /><br />I did enjoy being able to use extra keys with my thumb and therefor am getting a Razer Naga Hex - Laser Gaming Mouse later today and will write a review on it next week.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006W3ZXEW Razer RZ01-00750100-R3U1 Naga Hex - Laser Gaming Mouse]]
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen in some time. It's definitely a must see!! Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence should be a couple that's how great the chemistry was!! Please see it If you haven't!
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The movie starts out good but the ending could have been much better.  It is an okay movie that could have been great.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Exceptional musicianship displayed in this one, Jerry Cantrell is the man! I could listen to this from start to finish over and over, which is what I'm doing right now! Guitar solos really shine in this album, especially in Hollow, Pretty Done, Low Ceiling(I get chills baby), Phantom Limb and Choke. Personal highlights include The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, Low Ceiling, and all the rest... Couldn't help but miss the late great Layne Staley, I can almost imagine how extra great a song like The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here would have been with him singing on it, still this album is killer and Alice in Chains is one of the greatest rock bands that is active in these times. Thank you guys for the great new music!
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|This movie is much better than the reviews it originally got. It is a complex plot that touches on the idea of your life resonating across time and space. You can look at it from many points of view and that is why I think it did not do well at the box office. It requires a little thinking and self evaluation. This movie will redeem itself once people understand that like most things in this world worth having, it takes a little effort. Tom Hanks and everyone else gave fantastical performances. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to discover a little bit more about themselves.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|The predictable but happy ending is the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1. I feel like I paid 5.99 to watch a family scream at each other for 2 hours. Super depressing!
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Really nice overall:<br /><br />1. Battery back cover fits perfectly like it was designed by Apple.<br /><br />2. Lasts long enough. About a week for me, used 4-6 hours a day.<br /><br />3. Rechargeable just by putting on a pad? Awesome.<br /><br />Here are a few things that I would recommend:<br /><br />1. They should make the pad larger and make it be able to be used as a mouse pad. That way, you can charge your mouse and use it at the same time.<br /><br />2. Add replacement batteries. I mean, that's customer service :P<br /><br />That is all. Really nice overall. I would recommend this for anyone with an Apple Magic Mouse who replaces batteries about once a month. Go green!
B003MXD694|4.0|Children (ages 11 and 10) love it. Have seen it a dozen times, so finally I gave in and watched it them. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny and visually appealing.
0307474259|5.0|If you want a book that combines numerous scientific studies eloquently but is not written in a way that requires degrees in micro biology to understand grab this book.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|The thing I hate is that if you want to play the  tournament you have to have a Facebook. What if don't have one! Please if I were you give 1 star.
B004TI1WME|4.0|The in-line display of the series of calculations is very good and permits a review of the what is being evaluated.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|this game takes up like 700 mb id have to delete all my games to be able to get it on my kindle fire
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting story with unexpected twists. This is akind of bok where you enjoy every page. I'm going to buy the Shift trilogy now!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Some of us are destined for greatness. This is the story of three siblings who make their mark on history, each in their own way. More than they could have realized, in the end these representatives of the great among us are shaped by the forces around them. I found the most powerful concept of this novel to be the unexpected parallels between the seemingly opposite siblings. Reading this book was an excellent way to spend a rainy weekend.
B000069HJL|5.0|If you like Supertramp you are going to love this album.It is so good,even though I have all the songs on CD'S,I had to have this one.When I listen to Supertramp,this is the one that's in the tray.
B00B5AP7NY|3.0|Pretty dark for preschoolers. The humor in Lego Star Wars was great...need something like that to lighten Lego Batman up a bit. After all it is a Lego version.
159562015X|5.0|This book is amazing! It was so interesting to see my strengths in writing and learn how to use them. Also fascinating to learn about my co-workers. Very helpful to know what their strengths are and how to use them as well. I'm blown away in a very good way.<br /><br />Juanita
B00BEN0V8S|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it was first released.  I think it still holds much of the same emotion and production value--perhaps because it was [smartly] filmed in black and white.  There are better films out there on the subject, but this is still very well done.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Definitely a fun game and challenging. Wish there was talking in it though would rather hearing stuff than having to read it all.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|There are numerous well made tracks on this release; however, I think they outstay their welcome a bit. Believing in the less-is-more approach to editing, I could do without Touch, Motherboard, Doin It Right, maybe even Giorgio...which are all fine tracks in their own right. I think its a bit overreaching  and trimmed down, their modern take reviving a much-needed style injection could be just the high visibility kick start we all deserve. We can all hope.<br /><br />That said, the Nile-robot combination works well. Upon first listening, you'd think you'd stepped into a shag carpeted time machine, and then R2D2 starts lamenting and you remember its 2013 ! All props to DP for that.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I was born in a shoe town.  All the factories are now hollow and the workers are well into their dotage.  This movie celebrates workers and reminds us that people are deeper than they may seem to be.  When the boss/owner finds out that the company's shoes aren't selling he's goaded by a worker to look for niche markets.  The niche turns out to be sturdy, stylish shoes for drag queens.  The workers want to work with pride, the drag queen wants to design, women workers get to put in their two cents on what is sexy and what is not, and there is the beginning of a new era for all.<br />As I watched I mourned the empty factories in my hometown and the generations of children who've had to leave it to find work elsewhere.<br />This is a film to savor and discuss.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Have read all the Jack Reacher books and enjoy the mystery and amusing events in them. Very good writing by Lee Child.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Great{ Always love all of Michael Bulbe's music. He is a true artist. I have all of his cd's and love them all. I am looking forward to his next cd.
B007SGM084|5.0|Did not care for the first book, but after reading the entire Trilogy realized I would not have fully understood where the author was going if I had not read them in order.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I loved the way the story threads through the lives of people who seem unconnected, but through a consequence of another persons actions, their lives become interweaved.  Khaled Hosseini  leads you through the lives of these people and you feel like you somehow know them and the stories that make up the sum of their lives.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Long time fan of Baldacci. This book was fresh and the characters interesting. Baldacci has a gift in creating the pictures in my mind with his words. Who needs movies!
0061854549|5.0|Ever bought a book and thought it was the greatest thing ever?<br /><br />Ever buy a second copy of that same book?
B00C061I3K|5.0|The best album I've heard in a log long time.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Songs are so elegantly put together.  Listen with headphones and you'll hear layers of different sounds.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|not really my kind of book.  writing was fine but plot was not interesting.  ending has a twist but even that did not salvage the book.
0385340540|3.0|This book seems to be more about Grisham showing what he learned in immersing himself in the culture in Italy than in creating a compelling story.  After spending what feels like forever and a day submersing himself in the culture, the title character leaves the country, and all of that study is utterly irrelevant.  The bad guys swoop in right to his location, and the hundreds of pages of his challenges to learn a new culture are wasted.  He leaves the country, returns to the States, and the entirety of the book to that point is for naught.  The end is rapid and shallow, as if Grisham had much more story in mind but the deadline caught him off guard, so he threw something together in a day and sent it in.  Very disappointing.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|This is one of the most pretentious and boring movies I've seen in years.  I'm a Paul Rudd fan, but this is his worst movie in my opinion.  The movie is disjointed and jumps from one theme to the next without  continuity.  We discontinued watching  with forty minutes remaining in the movie.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|Love the film -- the actors are wonderful, the music fantastic and the setting delightful to explore.  As for those who think that this is somewhat unrealistic, I will add that it is not.  The thing that rings true for me is the fact that this girl is so bright, so curious and willing to do the work to get where she wants to go and not one of the adults in the film is truly concerned about it; they are all using her to achieve what they want and trying to send her on the path that they want her to go (either a rehash of their own or their fantasy).  That's the really creepy thing about David -- he's the most straight forward of them all about what he wants from her.<br /><br />Also,  I love the desperation David shows when he sees Jenny out growing him so quickly.  Jenny's father is played so fantastically and I love that honesty they finally have when he points out the fact that she played a role in deceiving her parents and that it hurt them that she'd do that.  If anything is unrealistic about the film, I would say it is that conversation (though, it's a film so I love that it's the fantasy version of life, too).<br /><br />Creepy seduction is something a young girl will put up with -- happens all the time.  It's a sad fact that it's still one of the only ways that a girl has access to some of the most interesting segments of society.  Walk into a room with a powerful or rich man and display half a brain and the crowd will eat you up and spit you out like a ripe cherry -- but it's fun, exciting and you'll eat good food, listen to great music and have fun while you're there.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book so much. To comment on it, would be to dilute it's greatness.<br />I hope the movie does it justice...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great Irish story-telling.  Such a sad and realistic book but so enjoyable.  I didn't want it to end but couldn't wait to find out what happens.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|i had the series of books growing up so it was fun to see this as a movie-- loved it
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is the best one I have read yet form John Grisham. He never let's you down the plot is great. I would recommend this to anyone who is a John Grisham fan.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|big waste of money the alarm is so low its like a whisper? has two faces sorry big waste of 99 coins
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game but when you bingo multiple timesin one game you do get as many chips as you spent. It is a very good game to play.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|It works as describe. I had to go in the website to get the latest rev. on software. The quality of sound is not the greates but it is acceptable.
B001DEXDNI|4.0|This collection has all the popular songs.  Admittedly we were not huge lennox fans, but have always like the songs play on the radio.  This seems to have them all.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Saw the movie - loved it!<br />Ordered this CD the very next day.<br />Went out of town.<br />Came back to have it waiting for me to enjoy - over and over!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This was a good move and story line.  You get to see how the world was lost to the apes.  the action was good and the story moved at a good pace to keep you interested.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out (1987) and loved it.  I have since watched it a zillion times on TV, bought it on videotape, and now decided to add it to my DVD collection.  It's not perfect (nothing is!) but overall I found it very entertaining with likeable characters.<br /><br />The coming of age story set in the early 60's was sweet.  I liked how Baby was intrigued by Johnny from the moment she saw him, whereas his reaction to her was the opposite - he barely noticed her, basically dismissing her as just a frivolous rich girl vacationing with her mommy and daddy (Johnny never made any reference to her sister, Lisa).<br /><br />Johnny was vehemently opposed to Baby filling in when Penny was unable to dance with him at the Sheldrake, but he gave in and reluctantly agreed to teach Baby to dance.  However, as they spent more and more time together, Johnny  gradually came to feel that there was something special about Baby. She had depth to her, something he felt that he lacked.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me (being one who wants a concrete happy ending for a movie of this nature) is that the ending seemed to be left open, up to interpretation.<br /><br />Did Baby and Johnny just have a summer fling at Kellermans and then go their separate ways?<br /><br />Or was their impact on each other's lives stronger than that, as the words to the song that Johnny chose personally for their final dance at Kellermans might suggest?  Did they fall in love and have a future together? I'd like to think so!<br /><br />I was left wondering where Johnny was going to take Baby at the very end of the movie when he took her hand and was leading her out the door of the room where the final dance had been -- before they intercepted by her father, whose admission to Johnny that he had been wrong about him (about Johnny having been the one who got Penny \\"into trouble\\") was rather lame.  Her father could have been more direct about it, especially because he had been very direct and open with his distrust and disdain toward Johnny throughout the movie.<br /><br />All in all, I found this to be a wonderful heart-warming movie.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This was a stocking stuffer for my wife.  I set down (begrudgingly) and watched it with her, and i really enjoyed it.  It was a good story and had to great actors.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game. Good story. Loved the hidden objects games and solving the clues for the mystery. I recommend this game.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|really just an awsome chess app. I highly recomend it. I love chess and could not find a good app for it until this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Never had any trouble with yahoo before...now have comcast and yahoo....like both very much and will continue to use both
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is a very creative idea.But it attracts kids to much.if it attracts to many kids the world will be junk.kids don't get out enough with this game.But I do really like it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is like no other and really brings back memories from Jurassic park genesis. I really hope more sea creatures get added in. Best game ever.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Fairly pedestrian plot with few surprises.  Ending wasn't bad, but a lot of lecturing on police procedures to get there.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you like Omnivore's Dilemma or Fast Food Nation, you'll love this film. The filmmakers do a great job of letting the grisly images speak for themselves.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Very interesting and informative.  But very heavily opinionated, the arthur is obviously passionate about his point of view, which is fine, it's his book.  But it gets to be pretty heavy handed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Since I downloaded this app I have not been able to put it down. Great for all skill levels. I recommend this game to everyone who loves puzzles.
B008MIMWOO|3.0|Rewatching these movies, they are simply not as funny as I remember them being the first time around. That said, the price is right and they're fun to watch if you've got nothing better to do!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Prime quality is top notch as always. Now we need season 4 to be available. one two three four five
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD tremendously and it arived on time and in very great shape. I will purchase here again.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app.  Best quality I have found. So many options. Good UI. Easy to work with.  Cant say enough good things.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Cut the rope time travel is a great little game that's great fun for passing the time. The game play isn't too tricky to learn and while you might grow tired of it after a time, it certainly has enough longevity for you to finish it's levels.
B003L77FYS|5.0|thumbs up  i  do not get to watch the show at it's time slot , because of my work schedule
B009FZFONO|5.0|TWD may well be one of the very best written series in the history of television. The story line is compelling, the acting realistic and honest and believable, given the apocalyptic setting and the special effects are of Emmy winning quality. Even without the zombies, it's a winner.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Great read about our food system. It really opened my eyes to how much bad stuff goes into processed foods. Its kind of crazy how much money and research these companies put into getting us hooked when they could be doing better things with their resources.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|It was a bit young for my liking and would probably suit a college audience.<br />The back and forth drama and petty fighting never really gets resolved and instead relies on a &#34;Love you / Hate you&#34; for every second page.<br />It was written well but as someone over the age of 25 this was all a bit childish. The only thing that stops it from being in the young adult section is the language and sex scenes
0525425772|3.0|This book, I say at once, is better than its predecessors. Grisham still treats young readers in a rather patronising way, but the style is not, as it was in the first three books, \\"the cat sat on the mat\\". There are moments in this volume in which one can detect something of the Grisham who writes rather good thrillers for adults.<br /><br />I do wonder, though, whether teenagers are going to be attracted to the book in droves. Young readers, on the whole, tend to like fast-paced action stories. This is far from being that. Almost nothing (except an irrelevant incident involving a snake and a boy scout) happens in the first half of the book. Instead, we are gradually told about a plan, using compulsory purchase powers (known as eminent domain in America), to build a by-pass around Theo's town. A farm belonging to the grandparents of a friend of his is to be bulldozed. A massive road will run within 100 yards of an elementary school and close to ten soccer pitches. There is a hint of shifty behaviour by a property developer client of Theo's father. But there is nothing remotely exciting until at least half way through (when there is a short interlude of action).<br /><br />Grisham simply wants us to admire the goody-goody, politically correct thirteen-year-old hero as he gradually realises he must become an \\"activist\\" and campaign against the evil businessmen who, can you imagine such depravity, put their own profits ahead of the well being of the town. It is all very black and white. Although we are told that some decent people want the by-pass (because of congestion on another street), it is made pretty clear to us that they are in error. All the intelligent, good people are opposed to the plan. But there is a danger it will go through because the businessmen who support it give large donations to the politicians who have to make the decision. Can Theo, and the hundreds of other schoolchildren he recruits to the cause, make a difference? The end, perhaps not surprisingly, is pretty obvious from a very early stage, but I'll leave you to work out what it is.<br /><br />My own guess is that the real problem with this series is that Theo is just too good. Ironically, we are told that Theo's favourite book is The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. If you wanted to find a character more removed from Tom Sawyer than Theodore Boone, you would look long and hard (and probably not succeed). Theo is never naughty (if he gets in trouble it is someone else's fault - never his). He is a tremendous bore when on the subject of the law (which is most of the time). Why his school mates don't beat him up daily is a complete mystery.<br /><br />And then, how horribly twee it is, there is Animal Court! This strange, and unbelievable, institution features in all the books. Grisham invented it, I suppose, in order to give Theo a right of audience in a law court. But It really does not work especially when, in this book, the court actually has power to imprison people.<br /><br />I wonder whether it would not be a good idea for Grisham to drop this series and attempt a new one, with a child hero who is more red-blooded and likeable than Theo?<br /><br />Charlesisingly, is pretty obvious from a very early stage, but I'll leave you to work out what it is.<br /><br />My own guess is that the real problem with this series is that Theo is just too good.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've never seen an app like it. It has so many options and the sound is beautiful! Love the combinations of sounds you can play. I highly recommend it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I gave this one a four because I ran a cross one puzzle in Frenzy series that is missing a corner.  The bottom left corner to be exact.  I normally put together all the border pieces first and work from there and since this one allows you to select only borders if you want, imagine my surprise at emptying the pieces to the board and one was not there. A bit of a disappointment.  Other than this one little hitch  I would give this one a five.  I have spent many an hour working the puzzles.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Bought this for my Audi A6, 2010.. and it worked like charm. On the same day it arrived, attached a 16gb USB drive to upload 750mb songs to Juke box.. it took around 6-8 minutes to upload.. but it worked well.. I haven't tested it yet, with higher capacity drives (more than 100gb). but I will update my review once I test it for higher capacity drives.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It reminds that 12 years ago I finally found my safe haven. I was an abused women that finally found true love and safety in the arms of a wonderful man. That is exactly what this movie is all about. Happy endings and I loved it.
0670026638|5.0|I will begin by saying that I am not a fiction reader so much as I am a non-fiction reader. I came across this particular author, Ruth Ozeki, while reading an article in the Shambhala Sun magazine. The article piqued my curiosity, so I purchased the book. Let me just say, A Tale for the Time Being has to be one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read quite a few. I love the way Ozeki weaves in and out of time, yet remains consistently inside the layers of time itself. Illusion. Perhaps the best illustration of time being an illusion. She pulls from both reality and imagination, and in such a way that the line is blurred, or perhaps the reader chooses to blur the lines in order to be as connected as Ruth desired to be with Nao. I was pulled in from the very start. I felt as though I, too, was a part of this journey, this puzzle piece that Ruth so desperately tried to put together; a part of Nao's challenges and triumphs. Most excellent read!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Enterprise ship looks cool being remastered. Spock looks joyful in playing his harp and Uhora sings. The acting was out of this world!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I guess just not what I expected. Very informative. There were some great parts but the movie seemed to drag.
B0091REZMW|3.0|hard to follow on how much of everything you have....power, money, etc.  other than that it is fun loooking for things.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is wonderful, ambitious, and heartwarming.  As I was reading, I was filled with a range of emotions.  Having taught 5th grade before, the story and character behaviors are plausible and well-written.  I love how the author chose to use different voices to tell the story, so the reader is seeing the plot from a variety of angles.  This made the story more engaging and complete.  Everyone should read this novel to learn and/or be reminded of what it truly means to be kind to others.  I will carry the main character with me for a long time... such a beautiful story.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I'm glad its not timed or this game would sucked. you have to go so slow to keep from flipping. It is kind of funny.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|It started out as \\"eh, not so bad\\" but turned into a total waste of my time. I loved watching the real Dark Shadows as a kid, and now the DVD's as an adult. This didn't come close to the original, and the only part that was interesting to watch was when the original actor who played Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid--not too long before he passed away) was in one short walk-on part. If you liked the original Dark Shadows, you may want to save yourself from this disappointment. I always thought Depp was a good actor, but I'm starting to think that all he's done lately is plaster on new make-up, because it always seems like the same guy in a little different costume.
0765367351|2.0|Normally I don't read tie-in novels, so I can't comment on their quality on a larger scale. However, I absolutely loved the original Bioshock (haven't played Bioshock 2 or Bioshock: Infinite yet), and playing the game made me want to learn more about the characters and the city of Rapture before its decline.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was excited to hear that a book was coming out claiming to do just that. It slipped under my radar for one reason or another, but I was excited to see it for sale in a bookstore I visited while on vacation. It took me a while to actually get around to reading it, and while I don't regret doing so, I have to say I feel extremely underwhelmed.<br /><br />The problem with this book, in my opinion, is it tries to do too much at once. The scope of the backstory of Rapture is massive no matter which way you look at it, so rather than getting one full, cohesive story we're given points of view from different characters during pivotal scenes in Rapture's creation, rise, and fall. I understand this isn't an entirely uncommon storytelling device, but it just doesn't work here.<br /><br />The book is at its best in its early stages, before it becomes too entrenched in nudge-nudge-wink-wink moments that either quote the game outright in dialogue or description, or serve as nothing more than 'fanservice' bits for those who played the games. There's nothing wrong with either of those if handled well, but it really wasn't done so here. There just isn't enough focus on any one aspect of Rapture to get a true feel for things, and a lot of the characterization is dire-to-nonexistent.<br /><br />Why didn't I regret reading it, then? There are bits and pieces, mostly early in the book, where the writing gets its act together and really brings across the feel of Rapture, and the middle and end portions of the book read pretty well when not trying to methodically fill in the Bioshock Prequel Checklist.<br /><br />Ultimately, I feel this book would have been better as either a short-story compilation telling individual, self-contained stories of different people along the Rapture timeline, or a novel told from Andrew Ryan's POV illustrating his mindset, and his own personal rise and fall.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rods newest CD is very good if you like the old Rod.  Most of the songs are similar to many of his past hits.  This is not a knock as I really enjoy his music.  Just do not look for a different Rod on this CD!
0811879542|5.0|children and adults of all ages enjoy  kids think it is magic they read without thinking that it is reading
B0086213XW|5.0|The previous reviewers said it all. And yet, there is more. This is such a French film, in its lack of fear to present genuine and entirely human situations, to its skillful focus on consequences, to its rich casting of perfect choices; this one is a gem. Alone, the photography is spectacular: its movement, color, its telling the story visually, especially when the story is being so well told directly by the characters. Not a false note. I was half expecting something to fall apart, but it didn't. The truth of what we are watching glows. My admiration for Michelle Williams knows no bounds. She is a creature made for the big screen, and a tragedy she will never have Heath Ledger in her life or screen roles again. Seth Rogen's performance is a revelation, similar to Jim Carry's portrayal in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". Both are comics, and yet, they understand nuance and human pain so well, and convey it to the screen as others cannot. In fact, the whole production and cast feels fresh, so creative in telling a rather common story, I felt I was witnessing something I didn't know anything about. And yet I really did. A truly special film that should gather acolytes as time moves on. At the lighthouse in about 30 years.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Addictive yet more depth than shooting birds through a giant slingshot. Although there is quite a bit of dlc you can play enough to win it.
6305428425|5.0|This is one of my favourite goofball movies. It's got some moments that everyone who's gotten out of High School can relate to SPOILER: (like wishing the snobby brat of a popular chick winds up with a jerk cheating husband lol).
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this so much that I purchased the audio version for my daughter who does not have time to read but listens to books on tape in her car during her long commutes.
B00466HN6S|5.0|My son loves this movie, but I think the moral of it is lost on him - hopefully he'll get it in time.  It's a very cute kids movie =)
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Like the neon' the sounds and the concept. I have other versions but this one is mucher better. Looking forward to more packs.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is great if your job depends on weather. It is very deep. But all I needed was just the basic weather report. I now use weather bug. Amazon has alot of great free apps to experiment with.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great! movie....was worth the price. IT was great tome spent.....and accessible through my computer didn;t have to travel to pick up the movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a very good book. Couldn't put it down. Read it all in one day. Can't wait to read another Harlequin book!
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|This is where it all starts! You have to watch it to understand the beginning of the whole series! Watch it and you'll love it!!!
B0018OFN1S|1.0|Bad plot, bad story.  After hearing so many good things I guess my expectations were set too high.  Lots of unnecessary sexual content.
B008J34466|5.0|I love her music and her! She is such a powerhouse!!! I will warn you though a lot of her songs have curse words in them!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great,thanks mojang for making minecraft.  It be great when they add me and buckets but still it's a great game.  One last thing; JOIN THE DIAMOND ARMY!!!!!
B000N6U0EC|5.0|I love this movie. It will inspire one to never give up no matter what! Never ever stop believing in yourself no matter how tough it gets, Stay focused and always remember your why!
B000957O7S|4.0|Love, love, love Will Smith and paired with Doug from King of Queens makes it even funnier! Kevin James, thats it!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book, but it's so freaking long! Besides that, it's a very dramatic book, and it kinda gives me the feelings of the 1800s...to say the least.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game, lots of fun puzzles. Cool premise and creepy images. Excellent help function. Not too hard but a decent challenge for a fun time!
B006LA6IW2|2.0|Not very much detail at all. He is no doubt a hero and should be. I have read many better sniper books though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the graphics, the story plot and background music. If you love puzzles and mysteries this is the game for you. I would play it again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great gameplay but the buying of swords requires real world money and I don't appreciate that.  its not uncommon with gameloft.  production value is tops.  extortion rate is offensives but acceptable
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This had more twists and turns in it. I never saw any of them coming. It held my attention and had me coming back for more.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I like the two main characters, the plot holds my interest and I know the writing keeps me guessing.  I thought the Navy was my favorite branch of the service, but this Marine has me hooked.
B0036RCVJW|2.0|This was very tedious in parts especially in China. Nothing like the Wallender books, I struggled to get through it. Parts in Denmark good but in the end one really didnt care about the characters at all.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|Maybe they were working with a poorly written script, bad directing or a tiny budget (or all of the above). Have seen some of these actors in other movies/roles and they were good and/or funny. Maybe I just expected too much?! Not sure what happened here, but within about the first 15 minutes I knew I'd wasted $4.99. My 16 year old daughter liked it and it did have some cute moments, but from a big picture perspective (pun intended) it failed to really entertain a grown up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun and challeging, completed game in a few hours. Cant wait for more chapters. Graphics are really good and feels like your really in front of it.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|The DVD is REGION 1 and then I can´t play it because I live in Europe (Region 2).<br /><br />Be very careful about this, because the information in the web is wrong.<br /><br />Greeting from Europe.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is very good and fun for kids, you can play this whenever, like my daughter was playing it on holiday
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|this is one of the best series I've watched on TV and I buy all the DVD collections to watch them over and over. Had to see it end with this year's season. Merlin and King Arthur have never been done better. Great casting, costumes, scenery, plots. Love it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I wish there were an offline version so the kids could play this one in the car. Personally I don't like games that ask you to buy stuff to play. This one wants you to buy pearls and stuff to advance the game faster, but we have a strict rule against this. Other than that the kids love it. I like that it does sort of teach them about the basics of how reef components work together, so it's not completely mindless. It's a fun game.
B00821OX98|5.0|A modern &#34;War of the worlds&#34; Well done  Too bad that it did not go longer  Good twists and general plot
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so entertaining.  It had it all, love, sex, battle-of-the-sexes, boy-meets-his-MATCH!!  The author did a fabulous job in writing this from the male's perspective, right down to the 'Guys don't do 'closure' stuff - LOL!!  I found myself laughing out loud while reading it and not wanting to put it down!  It is so funny hearing what Drew is thinking, too, and the way the H talks to the readers during the story is novelty.  I really think this is a great read and hope to see more from this author!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Been watching bond flicks since childhood and Daniel Craig is no bond in my opinion. He reminds me of an ex-bantam weight boxer, with very little (if any) of the panache and style displayed by Sean Connery and Roger Moore in their renditions of 007. The movie itself left quite a bit to be desired as well. I'm guessing the masses would probably be satisfied though. Car chases and what not generally keep em happy, no?
B0058OUJA4|5.0|One of the few games I've paid for.  It ran smoothly on my dated device unlike a lot of games.  I couldn't get the leaderboard, forums or anything to do with 'OpenFeint' to work, so I shared my solutions on zdefensehints since I couldn't find anything else to help with the challenging levels, and there are plenty of them to play!!!
B006RXPTNM|3.0|Didn't care much for the ending. Still have doubt as to whether the priest was guilty of what he claimed. Good subject matter and handled well. Thought acting was pretty good.
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|I love Anita Baker's voice.  She can sing anything and it would sound great.  Every song on this CD is excellent.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Love the film, love the music.  They are taken directly from the film, not just recorded songs in the studio.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie is an iconic 80's flick and would watch it over and over, it give's eveyone a good laugh!!
B00190OHD6|5.0|Great movie.  Although I am not the biggest of Hillary Swank fans, she does really well in this film.  Plus you have Ireland and G. Butler...
B00111WSNO|5.0|Was more than thrilled to buy this.....my son taped it for me and even at my age I still love it :)
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this box set because so many people said the packaging fell apart, but the packing they described is not the packaging I received.  When these arrived I freaked out because they were British releases and having already made the mistake of buying the wrong region DVD's in the past, I was worried.  However, they work just fine.  All of the intro and menu screens are different than I am accustomed to on my older DVD versions of the same films.  With this price point, you cannot go wrong picking up these blu-ray versions.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is just spectacular . I love it!!!!! and i haven't had to spend any money!!! even tho it is an option
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is so much fun.everyone should get it.u know y because first of all it is easier and better than cut the rope.second of all its just awesome. GET IT!
B008IJT0CE|1.0|It says there's a problem parsing the package. Oh well, so much for the free app of the day today.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma's hysterical view of a playboy's road to love is a must read.  I laughed my way through this love story. I fell in love with Drew just as Kate did. Read this and and it won't disappoint.
0345529057|5.0|Buy these books. I admit they are a bit long but I think you'll find them worth it. Starts out strong and slowly gets less interesting, but all in all best I've read in a VERY LONG TIME.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Be sure before ordering that you understand it only plugs into a USB port.  You need an adapter to plug into a wall plug.
1582701709|4.0|my friend recommended it is a great read and the book was in perfect condition! very beautiful hard bound book.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It came pretty quick. It came before it said it was suppose to. I am perfectly happy with that. The discs were not damaged and everything worked perfectly.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is basically an old school Bejewled rpg.  I know that doesn't make any sense, but play it and you will see what I am talking about.  The music could easily accompany any 8-bit cartridge out there.  The upgrades are simple but give you something to earn which adds the rpg element.  Took me about 3 hours to beat. Easily worth it for short money.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The disc set was great. I love how fast they shipped to our place. The box was a little damaged but that is OK, and happens. The discs were still in good condition
B004EPYZPI|4.0|Michael Connelly's 2005 novel, The Lincoln Lawyer, garnered critical and commercial success. The film adaptation stays loyal to the novel, and is very entertaining.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey portrays the main character Mickey Haller as a kind of lovable, bad boy. Haller is a lawyer who has made a career of representing criminals and outcasts. He runs his practice out of his old Lincoln, and drives around town looking for his next case. Early on in the film, we are introduced to his ex-wife, played by Marisa Tomei, with whom he has a young daughters. It is in these moments that we get to see the softer side of Haller.<br /><br />The story really gets moving when Haller is called to represent Roulet, a high profile, Los Angeles playboy who is accused of murdering a prostitute. Despite a bad gut feeling, Haller knows that this case could be the high point of his career. With the help of his own investigator Frank Levin, played by a show-stealing William H. Macey, Haller soon finds a connection to a previous case that has haunted him for years.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a great mix of action, intrigue and comedy. McConaughey's everyman persona really helps Haller to be relatable and an effective protagonist. Ryan Phillippe is surprisingly effective at staying in the grey area as Roulet. The real star of the movie is Macey, who's appearance is cut short way too soon. This movie effectively captures the essence of Connelly's novel while still adjusting to the new medium. While this adaptation is pretty black and white, it is still very entertaining.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|Barbra hasn't done a lot of acting over the last 15 years or so, but you couldn't tell it by &#34;Guilt Trip&#34;! Actually, painful as her long vacation was for us fans, it seems to have been great for Ms. Streisand. She is relaxed and better than ever! She is wonderful in this role! And critics- don't say she plays the role of a Jewish mother so well because she is a Jewish mother! Joyce Brewster and Andy live on opposite sides of the country and rarely see each other. Barbra and her son, Jason, live near each other and see each other on a regular basis. So we have two entirely different situations!<br />When reading articles about the movie before and during filming, it seemed the movie was about Seth Rogen's character, that Barbra was in the co-starring role. I got a little irritated  more than a few times, when interviewers questioned Seth about how he felt about starring opposite Barbra. Questions like, &#34;Is she going to sing?&#34; had obvious implications. However while watching the movie it becomes very obvious that this movie is Barbra's!<br />When the movie finally premiered (after 3 or 4 postponements), I was not only thrilled to see Barbra on the big screen again, I was amazed at how great she looks and once again reminded of just how immensely talented she is! It's wonderful to have our Barbra back-I hope she won't 'ever go away again'!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Too short, not very exciting. Really no plot. This should be called \\"twilight zone: a short story\\". Sorry Mr king. I won't recommend it
0061906220|5.0|this book is excellent with lots of videos on youtube, children read loud and playing musical  instruments.<br />my son is 13 month and he will get his own shoes by himself when finished the book, so i always read it before going out.
0143119680|5.0|Discovery of Witches is a great story about two highly educated professors finding an old book and trying to find its meaning. Throwing the paranormal into the mix you have a very exciting tale. Diana is a witch, but since the death of her parents as a young child she has refused to embrace that lifestyle. No matter how much she pushes her witch skills aside it's very clear that her powers are special. When she is the only one who can open an important document it attracts all kinds of creatures. A very interested and sexy vampire, Matthew, who's an Oxford professor, witches, and daemons all start coming out of the woodwork to see what Diana does. These creatures live among us with careers and are aware of each other but the one cardinal rule is they don't mix with each other romantically. When Matthew brings it upon himself to protect Diana she quickly falls in love. The two can't be together because it's upsets the Congregation which is a council set up of vampires, witches, and daemons.<br /><br />I enjoyed the love story and became Team Matthew! Diana is very interesting because she's honest and straight forward. I love when they go to France to protect Diana from her own kind, the witches who are out to get her. I loved the castle they stay in, Matthew's mom, their servant, and the horses they ride. It was all magical and lovely.  The relationship between Matthew and Diana grow quickly. The Congregation comes to put a stop to their growing relationship and threatens the lives of those they love.<br /><br />Diana goes to spend time with her Aunts in New York to  better understand her kind. Her Aunt's house is alive and very temperamental with ghostly ancestors living there too. With some very exciting events the book ends with everyone having to go different ways. I look forward to finding out what happens in  book two, Shadow of Night, which will mix my two favorite genres, historical and paranormal. Deborah is an excellent writer and I think everyone who loves a good story will enjoy the series.a good story will enjoy the series.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|As the primary narrative of this magnificent looking film moves from the improbable to the impossible, a more credible alternative is offered in a closing monologue of such length one wonders why it is not illustrated in any way.

0743454537|5.0|I read this book in two days; I simply could not put it down. I loved every bit it. I think it was very well written It was as though the characters were talking to me, and I got pulled into their world. I got roped into the book right away. This is the kind of book that makes you think and wonder: What if this was me or my sister? And that is exactly what a book should be! Amazing story written by a woman who is an awesome crafter of words.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I bought it but it never showed up on my Kindle so I don't know if I like it or not really. How can I get it on there?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome. I absolutely love it. I recommend to get it even if your 16 years old. I'm 14 and I LOVE it.!!!!!:)
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|didn't care for this game, I will be deleting this game , kind of boring I think it was meant for children
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Not many books keep me so hooked that I can't put them down. Ms McKenna has written well developed characters. The juxtapositon of the current day fun with the past horrors at the orphanage tells a compelling story of cruelty versus kindness and caring.<br />If you love stories set in Ireland and the cadence of their speach you will love this story and understand the reason these horrible institutions of the past were finally closed down in the 1990's.<br />Great read!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is one of the most addictive  stories I have read. I finished the book in a day and have a stack of neglected paperwork on my desk to prove it!  The emotional rollercoaster is as raw and seductive as the sex. Definitely a must read!!!  Looking forward to part two as soon as supper is cooked and kids are in bed! ;-)
0634022296|5.0|A friend turned me on to this book and I've been working with it for some time.  I think it's good for beginners and intermediate players.  The songs are generally in the key of the way they were played on the albums, but some songs may be played easier/better in a different key with a capo.  This purchase was the second time I bought this book for the express reason to bring it to Staples to have the binding cut off and a spiral binding put on so the book can lay flat.  Believe me, it is worth it to spend the extra $10 or so to have this done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting it's so hard to do but so fun to play with your friends or complete the missions
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this because it is light weight and yet very sturdy.  I am getting another for my husband. (But in a different color for him) :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its great... love the game, but it tricked me into using $16 us card dollars. Might want parental control when playing the game, and if you do I highly recommend getting this game, if you love horses, I use to be a big fan of horses, so I got this game and its really realistic, except I have a unicornn! Also I expecially recommend horse world 3D: my riding horse FREE, BECAUSE its more realistic and uncapable of being minipulative! Haha thanks!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is very similar to simcity but better because no tornadoes. or mass fires. cant wait for more updates<br /><br />  fun.  very fun
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have a new Kindle Fire HD, every app works wonderfully, Facebook does not. Soooo slow! Just use the browser on your kindle. It is faster.

B0026WNGBA|4.0|When I started running in 2005, primarily for fitness, I learned very quickly that there was more to running than mileage and marathons. This book gets to the center (pun intended) of the grander effects of running on your body, mind, and spirit. If you're new to running or an old hand you will still benefit from the teachings in this book.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|This movie is boring.  All my friends told me to get it b/c it was so good.  It was slow.  I turned it off after an hour.  Do yourself a favor, and save the $10 bucks for a drink at a real strip club.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|The God Delusion is impeccably reasoned and very well written.  I learned a lot about myself and my beliefs as a result of reading it.  As it turns out, I am an &#34;Einsteinian Atheist,&#34; along with Carl Sagan and Steven Hawking.  We believe in a universal life force that drives all things to evolve -- becoming their better selves -- through a beautiful and orderly process.  We choose to call that universal life force &#34;God,&#34; and Dawkins admonishes us for &#34;misusing the word.&#34;  He defines &#34;God&#34; as a personal God, and then goes on to berate everyone who believes in a personal God.<br /><br />It's fine to define your terms as you see fit to allow you to reason your argument and to write your book.  In fact, I agree with him wholeheartedly about personal Gods and organized religions.  However, I get to define the terms of my belief -- as did Albert Einstein, Sagan and Hawking.  We see an amazing and awesome force in the universe working towards the betterment of all things.  I'll call that force &#34;God&#34; and be proud to know that it exists.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Love the music---to me, a cross of blues and folk music, exquisitely played.  Outstanding piano, percussion and of course, hands down, guitar!!!
B00CWV8X04|2.0|This movie was slow and boring. The characters were dull and lifeless. The main stars of this movie must have lost a bet to agree to do it.  A waste of my money!
B002O2THRO|2.0|Terrible lighting, abrupt cuts between scenes, bad acting on several accounts.  Not worth the time.  I watched this movie to try and figure out why all English teachers force this garbage of a story down our youth in high school.  The story is dreadful and not something for young impressionable minds.
B00APKIN1I|4.0|good music, although i was a little less then thrilled by some of the songs, this is nothing to do with the seller! heard one Cut ona a late night show...
B009O2XY12|5.0|Very addictive game. Some have written that it's irritating that you can only play a few games and then you have to either quit for awhile until your energy is restored or buy more energy. I think that's great! Otherwise I would be playing all the time. This forces you to put it down and have a real life!
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|I used this bulb, which gave out a good bit of light for the claimed 6W of power consumption, and was satisfied. Then one day a few weeks back it simply stopped working. Since one of the reasons to use LED bulbs is their near-immortality, this was a disappointment. Up until the day it died, it was a solid performer.<br /><br />Update June 2013 - I contacted the vendor regarding their 24 month warranty, and they apologized for the issue and sent me a replacement bulb. Raising rating from 1 to 3 stars because of the positive warranty service experience. I am still wary of the quality.
B00448VST6|4.0|There's no doubt the comics are better but this movie still was quite enjoyable to me. Rent it before you buy it, you might just like it!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Following on the heels of one of the greatest superhero films (The Avengers) ever, Iron Man 3 had the daunting task of being the first film to initiate Phase 2 of the next set of Marvel films.  Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3).  Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance.  By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects.  At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications.  Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related?  The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy.  A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.<br /><br />Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role.  Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin.  Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.<br /><br />Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy.  He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience.  It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot.  At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing.<br /><br />There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists.  The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly.  What's a superhero to do?  The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs.  Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections.  Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.<br /><br />Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1.  There's a certain finality in the way it ends which makes one wonder how will they do another Iron Man film.  This is Downey's last contractual Iron Man for now and it would be a shame to deny fans another go at a fascinating character especially with The Avengers 2 in the not too distant horizon. And yes, do stay through the lengthy credits for a brief but amusing scene and cameo.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I liked this game, it's fun to play and helps your memory. this game is worth the time and money.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins.  In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action.  As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory.  It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.<br /><br />Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within.  Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without.  In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet.  At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess.  The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war.  Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways.  It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.<br /><br />As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism.  In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel.  There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected.  Tribbles, anyone?  And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's!<br /><br />Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment.  We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes.  There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments.  You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond.  There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, \\"the needs of the many...\\"<br /><br />Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary.  Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.<br /><br />The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city.  The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps.  Where does Harrison come from?  Anybody check his blood type?  Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded?  And what's the deal on those torpedoes?<br /><br />Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers.  The film has a memorable climax that will ring déjà vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional.  It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind.  To say any more would spoil things.  A third film in this installment would be hard pressed to surpass the energy and sheer acumen he demonstrates in this sequel, but Abrams has proven he can followup a directing gig by remaining the producer with another talented director taking the reigns and still achieve spectacular results (see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol).  For the man who has been chosen to take over Star Wars franchise, the sky's the limit.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have all the seasons and thay never disappoint. This is just as good as any of the other seasons, loved it.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Although Jerry Cantrell has led the band from inception, Layne was a key ingredient to their unique brand of grunge.  I was not all that impressed with the first offering after Layne's passing, 'Black Gives Way to Blue'.  I had high hopes that they would manage to continue the magic, but was disappointed with this CD, as it appeared their brilliance had died with Layne.  However, upon a single run through of their latest effort 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here', I'm convinced they've found their groove again.  This is great music, pure and simple.<br /><br />The vocals are primarily combined harmonies, as opposed to a single, crisp, singular voice complimented by such.  In the early days, they used the 'combined vocal harmonies' technique and used it to supplement Layne's haunting vocals.  While they've not managed to attain that particular vibe with this album, the songs are still quite enjoyable.  In some respects, I'm glad they've not tried to replicate the unique sound they managed with Layne, but have in fact established a new, more subtle vocalization to compliment they're instrumentals.  I'm glad I did not give up on AIC, as I feel I've been rewarded for sticking with them.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very unique and innovative idea, great characters, wonderful suspense, and fantastic plot! I can't wait for the next installment. This was a very entertaining book that I could not put down once I started. I would recommend it to readers of almost all ages from adolescent up!
B0061QD82E|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my 2 year old grandson and he loved the dogs!!<br />Their animation excited him immensely!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the way she tells the story from each person's perspective.  I found this one hard to put down.
B003B02O14|5.0|I read this book when it first came but read it again because I love John Gresham.  It is still good and a sad ending.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|If you want to waste some time with mediocre sci-fi, this is one way to do it. Did I mention there are great visual effects? And some really impressive sets? Oh, and the effects are something else, as are the sets and the visuals.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|An interesting addition to this range of &#34;fun&#34; games.  No great demands on the old brain to make it function, but it does make you reconsider ways to reached maximum score on each level. How can you not like something that is for free? Well worth the inclusion on your Kindle Tablet!

B001HNE3NO|4.0|I loved one of the stories, Sarah's story was super well written.  The other part in modern day, I could have done without.  It was a good book and had me reading non stop till the end.  I would recommend it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I am a radio personality in Los Angeles and have found that most parents, teachers, pastors, and educators don't know how we get what we have gotten in life. The book, &#34;Nikolai Tesla&#34; by Sean Patrick, gives great insight into several of the correct answers. Glen Curry, Los Angeles
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I like the characters they are nicely developed. The sets and costumes are distinctive to each throne... very cool.<br />The disregard for life, health, family.... not so different from todays world.<br />This program is very gory and sexual motivated...such content could be offense.<br />Other program...Vikings...Lord of the Rings
B004FP1WX0|2.0|Nothing unpredictable except how gullible these guys are. Of course it was going to end the way it was all leading up to. Watch if you're new at online dating and put a lot a trust into what people say. You might learn something.

B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical Reacher, even though it is a formula, and they are very similar in plot, I love the Reacher series. Even with Tom Cruise, the Reacher series will be worth seeing.
1435122968|5.0|What a gorgeous book! This book is a prime example of why I don't do digital reading. The colors, the pages, the density, I love it! Not to mention that it contains the stories of one of the most imaginitive and visionary authors of all times! If you haven't read his collection of poetry, &#34;The Ancient Track&#34; do so! A whole different side of Lovecraft!
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I really enjoyed this new album and thought it was a step in a totally different direction for the band.  Great combination of strings and electronics and Jared's vocals are really up front!  Loved it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|While this season isn't as strong as the first, it's still an amazing show that I would recommend to any, even those that consider themselves not interested in &#34;period pieces&#34;.
B000WMA6FA|1.0|I am not happy with the reviews that I am seeing for this DVD. Was going to get the newest version for a gift, saw the reviews and decided to try an older version (to maybe avert the defective disc issues) and ended up with the very same reviews for any version (by Date) that I tried to access. This is not helpful. I have noticed this problem before. I want to see reviews for the particular version that I am looking at.
B0084ANCBC|2.0|I wanted to like this book, as I am a huge fan of similar stories (e.g. pride and prejudice), but found it a bit slow paced, and the author really means it when he says there are no heros... which would be fine except that none of them are especially interesting either.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Nice little app to challenge you in between meetings or when you have a few minutes to spare. I'd recommend it!

B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Was meaning to read this book for years. It bored me to pieces. Was greatful for the audo feature on my kindal, which helped me get through it. Everybody told me how deep it was and how much I would love it. Its as deep as a puddle. And boring.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|U think you're good at this but the puzzles r excellent. I totally enjoyed the first room. Can't wait for the next puzzle.<br /><br />.
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|and just that.... nothing more.<br />'this is war' will forever be their greatest album. I thought it would live up to half its hype, and it did just that. half.
0765325950|5.0|It was excellent!!!!  If you read all the books you know it was a perfect cumulation of growth for each character in the story.  The transition from the writing of Jordan to the writing of Sanderson was seamless.  Sanderson did a fantastic job!  He never lost the flavor or momentum of the story.  Each character matured in their own right and the Last Battle was the momentous, catalysmic event that each book built up too.  If I have any disappointment I would have liked to have known that Elaine's twins were born and what sexes they were, but she didn't die and we can assume they were born well.  Maybe their lives are for the next set of books?  Also, the sudden appearance of the Sharans threw me for a loop, but overall, I like the way the story evolved, especially showing the necessity of men and women to work together to survive and save the world.  Having read all the books and some of them twice to remember all the story, I'm lost.  I can't believe I've come to the end.  As a lover of the Sci Fi/Fantasy genre, I must say the Wheel of Time is one of, if not the best story I have ever read, including Tolkien, Brooks and many others that I can't think of right now.  I know that after a while I will have to start the entire series again because I will miss the characters.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star rating is that the ending of return of the jedi was changed from the original. The end shot showing the 3 ghosts were not the original shot from the original picture...it was changed...other than that...everything was great!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The storyline is a bit textbook yet compelling enough to continue with the series. Only hope raised that expectations will be delivered...
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a well produced movie, was funny, and the clarity of the movie was insanely crisp and clear. I would let any family member watch this movie. Even though it had animated characters, the message and tone of each character was inspiring and made me think out a few things.<br />The whole combined experience of this movie was great!

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent fast read highly recommend, getting the one for children.  Hopefully it helps my marriage. Thank you take the time to read
B0009UC7H0|5.0|This movie is everything an action/adventure movie should be - fun to watch, exciting, funny, good effects and good acting and writing. I can't figure out why people have been critical of it - I am a fan of the Cussler novels and I really enjoyed this movie (even though it is not a perfect adaptation of the book - so what, it's good in its own right). I thought it was fantastic, and it's one of the few movies I watch often.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and all the stories within the story have been drawn out so well. Khaled Hosseini tells his stories very well.

B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Simon Collins joins the world of prog with Dave Kerzner and their band Sound of Contact.Dimensionaut is a killer conceptual album of great music and top notch playing.The first 4 songs are wonderful prog music.Even the couple songs that are less proggy music are Really good.The music is a great mix of sounds and influences of<br />Genesis,Phil solo,Marillion,Pink Floyd and Porcupine Tree.12 kick ass songs in all that will please you in every way,from some quieter moments of depth and thought to some excellent prog jamming,2 instrumentals and the album ends with the 20 minute pure prog epic Mobius Slip that will knock your socks off!Pale Blue Dot and I Am Dimensionaut are songs that feel like what Genesis would and should have sounded like if they had stayed truer to prog and less of the pop.Simons voice is very good and yes very reminiscent of his father Phil's but Simon uses his voice his way so he doesnt just try to copy his dad.As for drumming skills.watch out Nick DV,here comes Simon Collins.Man can he play those drums and the sound is great and again not a copy of Phils playing but you can hear the influence.This album i might dare say could very well be better than Genesis last 4 albums and defintely blows Invisible Touch and Genesis(self titled)away.Great vocals,great keys by Dave,some really nice quitar,bass,bass pedals,violin and cello and outstanding superb drumming by Simon.Phil,you gotta be very proud of your son.Track 7,Beyond Illumination also features the wonderful voice of the beautiful Hannah Stobbart.Grab this album,crank it up loud and be prepared for take-off,its stunning.The album of the year.5 plus 5 stars..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bough this book for my grand daughter to read on my kindle while we were visiting in another state. She had not read a whole book since the first Harry Potter series. The book kept her interest as she finished it in a few days. What a relief to NOT hear &#34;I'm bored&#34; for a few days. Since then, she has asked me to get the other two books in the trilogy. I am quite happy to do so.

B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I fell asleep 2x (which is not an easy task for me) I thought it would have more action scenes. Maybe even show more on the moments leading up to his assassination. Just 2.5 hours of congressmen calling each other names. (wow, a lots changed since 1865) *sarcastic smile*<br />On the plus side everyone's acting was very well played.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|it is a funny game that gets slowly more difficult. It stays fun and i want to finish all the levels
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|We have downloaded this game on our tablet, Kindle and iPad.  We are all addicted to this game!  Highly recommend it.
B0000714BP|4.0|I love this movie because of how much these men stress in the importance of beauty.<br />Although there are some things I don't agree with, the major point in the move is about<br />knowing how to be a real lady.  The movie is hilarious and adventerous.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I purchased this mouse as my first dedicated gaming mouse.  It has some nice features, but has some problems associated with the fact that this is Anker's first real gaming mouse.  First of all, the right side of the mouse, where the fingers sit, has a slick, smooth surface, which creates a very poor gripping surface.  I actually solved this problem by placing masking tape in the area, which gives good gripping strength and is relatively immune to sweat (as well as removable for when I return this mouse).  The size is rather too large and heavy for my fingertip grip style, even though I have rather large hands.  It would work extremely well for a claw or palm grip.<br /><br />One nice feature of this mouse is the thumb buttons: these actually work with the fingertip grip such that they don't really foul aim when pressed.  This is a rather remarkable feature as I've never been able to use a thumb button while trying to do precision tasks.  I also really like the lights, which show you which DPI profile is active.<br /><br />In the end, with the DPI set right and a few weeks of practice, I was able to have almost as much control with this mouse as with my cheapo Microsoft Intellipoint mouse.  Consequently, I purchased a Kone Pure, which weighs in at only 90 grams (36% less), and saw an immediate improvement in performance.  That mouse is an excellent fingertip grip mouse, but costs almost twice as much and does have the lights nor the easily used thumb buttons.<br /><br />In the end, the only reason I don't like this mouse is that I need to have a fingertip grip style, which it isn't really designed for, and the slick surface on the right side, which is a pretty big oversight.<br /><br />Edit: Due to their customer service being excellent, I am increasing my review from 3 to 4 stars.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As an adult reader, this was easy to digest.  The story flowed well and Collins wrote with sufficient detail so that the imaginative reader could find their self immersed.  After reading the book, I was interested enough to rent the movie.  I prefer the book.  The movie changed a few things which are relatively important foreshadows.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Like many others, I have been a big fan of the &#34;Dash&#34; series for years. I was thrilled to see this as a recent Free App of the Day, and looked forward to playing through all 12 restaurants as I assumed would be the case. Unfortunately, Playfirst's nickel-and-dime techniques have reached an all new low for me. After foolishly deciding to &#34;update&#34; this game, I can now only play through 6 of the restaurants and are being asked to pay 99 cents EACH for the remaining ones! I have paid for Playfirst games in the past, despite their money-hungry antics, but when you offer something as free only to remove half of it and demand money for the rest, then it's over for me. I'm no longer giving any of my money to this company.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Very good show,  Made me laugh and cry.  Covered many  differant areas of life.  Clint is still my main squeeze.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|My teenage kids loved this book so I read it.<br />Not much of a story, shallow charcters, constructed like fabricated by a copy writer: 'Lets produce a best seller which we'll than make into a movie with Emma Watson and some other hot shot actors&#34;. in other word safe investment.<br /><br />Seems like the auther needed to load all the drama of the world on this one poor character who isn't very belivable in the first place.<br />There is a kind of underlying tension which kept me going but it never really amounts to anything so when finally something does happen  the whole construct had become so phoney that its just the peak of phoenyness .<br /><br />As big a s a waste of time this book was it still isn't half as bad as the movie.
B00CHVJODE|3.0|It's Ice Age but with humans.<br /><br />Every 10-15 seconds, someone will fall, get slapped, or bang into something.  Typical in these types of movies.  I guess they think it will keep the kids laughing.<br /><br />As stated previously, the movie feels like it has been done before.  Not much new here, although there are a few laughs and some interesting animation.<br /><br />;)
B000FCK42M|5.0|I read somewhere the this book is incredibly well researched.<br />That's what convinced me to buy the book. I had a hard time putting it down in fact it made Don Winslow my favorite new discovery.<br />I love his style. There so many facets to his characters.<br />Entertainment at its best, never shallow or constructed.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It wasn't bad, but maybe too long.  The first hour as the two main characters were establishing their relationship went quickly, but the last hour dragged as the story line began to explain just why the young woman was on the lam.  The ending seemed rather contrived after the young woman's husband was dismissed from the Boston PD.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is my first mic of this this type and its working very well. Am using it with a sony voice recorder and will do likewise when I get a video recorder with a mic input.
B005544V6A|5.0|I really love this show!  I wish they had Season 2 available on Prime too.  Now I'm HOOKED!  Please make season 2 available on Prime!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|IT'S TOO CLEAR CLEAN AND CRISP! THE SETS LOOK PHONEY AND THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE,TO MUCH ARTISTIC LICENSE TERRIBLY DISSAPOINTED
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book tells an incredible story of an incident in Germany on 20 Dec 1943, where a crippled American bomber was escorted out of Germany by a German fighter.  There are a lot of  pages devoted to telling of the war career of the German pilot, and those pages are of only ordinary interest.  But the account of the incident on Dec 20, 1943, is of huge dramatic interest, and I found it highly poignant.  Also the account of how the two pilots over 40 years later actually got in contact with each other is bound to be of astounding interest to any person who is interested in research and war stories.  The German pilot if what he did had become known during the war would have been in deep trouble with his Nazi superiors, and one is appalled that even forty years later there are Germans who conider him a traitor, even though one would think that any thinking person should be glad that Hitler did not win the war. This is a highly dramatic incident and seems to have been carefully researched.  I do not see how anyone could help but be much moved by parts of the book.
B00797MB0O|1.0|This movie is literally painful to watch. Don't waste your time. We kept waiting for the movie to actually begin but it never did.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Not full of special effects but a well written well acted movie. We need more movies like this which focuses on the story and characters
B005I64U5C|5.0|Ryan Reynolds is always eye-candy and worth a look in this comic book farce.  We recommend it to anyone who loves a good time.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums in glorious high def. Bonus material worth checking out. Live cuts were awesome too.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|That is, if you have a 3D capable player and TV.  This is a landmark in 3D movies.  You don't want to miss it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|First 2 movies are definite classics. Exhaustive behind the scenes and supplemental material. Worth checking out Alien 3 for the new cut (although Fincher had no input).
B00AJMQSP0|4.0|This is a great metal album. I'm some what new to the band, so I can't speak to the continuity of this album to anything but their classics, but every song except track 7 kills. That one didn't need to be recorded. Of you like power metal this album holds up.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is my all time favorite book, and I loved the stage and concert versions. I am very familiar with the storyline, but even the novice to Hugo's story can enjoy this beautiful story of redemption in this film version. They really captured the essence of the book. My only complaint is the strength of the singing. I would have preferred a soundtrack for better sound. Still, a timeless classic, and this version will bring in new fans.
0895292211|5.0|This book points out what so many are just now touting.  We must return to a more natural, unprocessed way of eating.  This book is very informative and shows/informs one how to eat correctly so we can regain natural health.  The body wants to be healthy but we have bombarded it with highly processed food that chemists dabble with to create great taste that will encourage the shopper to buy again and again.  Unfortunately, nutrition values always seem to suffer.  The chemists isn't concerned whether their product gives you back your health, they have to answer to bosses that answer to shareholders who want dividends from their stock in the company.  We need to take command of our health and eat what comes from the earth in it's virgin form.
0696019973|4.0|I was making a quilt for Christmas and needed some ideas for it.  This book has some good quilt square patterns.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a great story.  Helen Hunt was wonderful and made a complicated person and her work, believable.  John Hawkes was adorable and the premise of the movie was very touching.  I would watch it again, but not with my kids in the room.  Grown-ups only!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a wonderful app that allows you to relax to your own creation of sounds. It has defenitly helped me relax through the stress of my life.<br />Although I did get this when it was free I would never pay the 2.99 it asks for.
0689835604|2.0|Shipping time was great!  But the &#34;Good&#34; rating for the book I purchased for my daughter...the pages were very rough and coming unglued...and many of the lift-flaps were almost torn off!  This is a VERY used book...
B00CATSONE|4.0|Good read.  Short on details for the scientifically inclined but there were enough details about how Tesla was subjected to the tyranny of monied people such as J P Morgan and Thomas Edison who had a large stake to lose if Tesla was successful in his theories.  Tesla was a special person, like Einstein, gifted with theories that are still being proven and probably secretly used by governments around the world.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story is  a good read with easy to like characters. I'd recommend it for in-between those epic  novels..to which nothing can really compare.<br />Enjoy!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|AWESOME!!!!! This book was right were i wanted it to be. For me it is always hard to read a final book but this one wrapped it up great.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen! I loved the first one and everything about it. Every part of this movie is crap. The acting is pathetic and you can tell that the director only thought about his own opinions. Watch the special features if you happen to get stuck with it for the night at someone's house. The director is a jerk and I can't believe he did the first one. I compare this movie to a rotten stool!
B000000I0G|4.0|Mike O'field is one of my cousin's favorites. When I heard it I thouroghly enjoyed his style of progressive rock sounds. It catches your attention like the CD cover.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I love these. They make bike riding a blast. They illuminate the road a little, sure, but that is not really why you get them. You get them because they let drivers/pedestrians see you...and most of the time they're yelling &#34;Those things are awesome! Where did you get them?&#34; Yeah, they ARE awesome. EASY to install - 10 minutes maybe (for each wheel -- though, be careful, mine were definitely sold as ONE wheel a pack, so I had to by 2) and I'm still on my initial set of batteries after a few months, so...they've got cheap upkeep. LOVE these, they're just fun :D
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Great store, picture is clear and clean sound is sweet, this movie never get's to old for me and the grandkids.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This game was so amazing but it was super short I really think that it should have been free because it was so super duper short
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This video is great to watch on a day your stuck in the home the little monters and you got a nice sound system, but it is clear and sounds great, no skipping nor jumping.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was apprehensive about this book, as I'm sure everyone else was. I am now very content with the outcome. Although it did not end as I had once envisioned, I see now that this was the only way it could've ended properly. So thank you Charlaine Harris for giving me countless hours of Sookie bliss. I am sure that I will start back at the beginning in a year or two!
159463176X|5.0|This story describes the beauty and essence of Afghanistan that makes us all fall in love with the country. Hosseini explores the relationships between parents, their children, extended family and friends in such a way that no one else can. I immediately fell in love with these characters. I sympathized with them, celebrated with them, and explored their relationships with them. I really enjoyed this book and can't say enough good things about it! Hosseini's writing style is elegant and beautiful. He brings beauty to a country that has been consumed by war and violence for so many years. I love reading his books because I learn a little more about the culture every time, and I find it very fascinating!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded part one of this story for free and with low expectations. To say that I was COMPLETELY blown away by Part One, would be an absolute understatement.<br /><br />Very rarely do I \\"purchase\\" e-books, because there are so many free ones out there. Admittedly, this method makes it hard to not be inundated with mediocrity to the point of becoming jaded...<br /><br />But WOOL is very much a PERFECT book. Story-wise, one cannot find another in existence that appeals to EVERYONE. I have many friends who only read biographies and books steeped in reality (opposite of me) and even they came around to reading this book and thus falling in love with it (I did badger them to read it, however: I did not badger them to love it, to which they did).<br /><br />WOOL really does have something for everyone. I will say this though...it is not a happy-go-lucky novel. This is as real as one can get without actually living it. The characters are so genuine, that one cannot help but be drawn into their plight.<br /><br />Characters I thought I would despise until the end of the story, I grew to like and even commiserate with.<br /><br />There are very few times that I have become, momentarily, emotionally destroyed while reading. Usually it is brought on by an action from a character I like, leading to a consequence for said character that I do not like. In this story, I was almost brought to tears because I felt so moved by a character I had spent most of the story hating.<br /><br />Say what?! That doesn't happen! One is supposed to have a clear sense of Character A \\"good\\", and Character B \\"bad.\\" But with WOOL, nobody is really all that \\"bad\\". They make choices that one may not approve of, but at the end of the day, they are not \\"bad.\\" And I loved this refreshing take on humanity and literary characters as a whole.<br /><br />The action and suspense are enough to give one palpitations. I will not give anything away, but the ending was well done. Some many \\"OM*G\\" moments that I want to give away, but will not.<br /><br />For those series-phobic people out there: this IS part of a series. That being said, WOOL was rapped up in a nice little bow. Lacking a cliff-hanger ending did not stop me from purchasing the rest of the series, it encouraged me to do so. A real ending to a story that makes one want to continue are very hard to come by. Most authors have a cop-out ending just to get the reader to pay for a book that really isn't worth anybody's time. WOOL is, gratefully, an addicting part of the series that can stand on it's own without further purchasing. Although, I don't see how anyone could not buy the entire series.<br /><br />If I had to complain about something, it would be the e-book formatting. This, of course, has nothing to do with author. SO AMAZON: I like having actual page numbers. WOOL is very much 3 books in 1 and it's a little frustrating to read over 100 pages and only be \\"35%\\" done with the book. That was the only thing I found disheartening about my WOOL experience.<br /><br />Other than that, I have nothing but highest praise for WOOL. I have recommended it to everyone I know. For those who choose this revolutionary undertaking, PLEASE read the Q and A with author at the end. No spoilers, it's quite amusing.I want to give away, but will not.<br /><br />For those series-phobic people out there: this IS part of a series.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|It's a perfect game for example you can discover special levels,travel to new planet's and solve levels in this cool game!
B00003CXRM|5.0|A real favorite of my whole family.  We have watched it dozens of times and find something new each time.
B002R88G5E|4.0|I just finished reading for the second time I treasure this book because I have learned many lessons from it recomand it to people who by reading books of different cultures learn from them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wonder how much lost sleep must be put to the account of this book!  I can certainly add to the hours on that one.  It is just so impossible to quit reading until you pass out.  The hard part then is getting up the next morning.  So my recommendation is to start this book in the morning on a vacation day so you can just read and read and get lost in this experience.<br /><br />I am going now to check out other books by this author.  If they are even half as good, I am be finding some more good reads. :)
B001HBYHFA|5.0|It is a fitting and satisfying film for firefly fans.  Also a great into to the series for those new to the franchise.
B008R6MI8G|5.0|I have seen Michael Collins more times than I can count.  It looked amazing on my Kindle Fire!  Will probably watch it again!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I had heard this was a great series and it exceeded all my expectations. Great cast and writing!  Give it a try, you won't regret it.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I like this movie alot, good action but a good plot as well, and its Mark Wahlberg.... hello I'm in!
B00006J3T4|5.0|Outstanding album and never-dying music. My favorite musician. Magic fingers, superb guitar sounds. I have completed my Knopfler's music collection.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I read this on my kindle while on the treadmill, and the time passes quickly because the book is so absorbing.  Doesn't exactly follow the series, but close, and has many intricacies not revealed in the series.  I've been following the TV series, but wouldn't miss reading the books!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|hill climb racing is a very addictive game but fun as ever so I suggest that if u get it find a cumfy place to sit cuz u will be here awhile
B005PK57IK|5.0|For an Amazon Prime series, this is incredible.  I hated to go to bed each night because I couldn't wait to most &#34;next&#34; episodes. But I fear that -if there are follow up seasons, they will be &#34;for-a-fee...&#34;
B00001MXXH|5.0|One of the classic comedies. On my list of 10 favorite movies of all time. Too bad the seller (flahertymalls) was awful. But the movie is great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is amazing you should get it I love it the pc moble and xbox version a new update is going to be amazing
B003F3NE1Q|2.0|The 1st 2 dvd's--I had sound but no picture.  I wouldf have loved to have seen the entire series. Boo :(
0241951593|5.0|I'm about halfway through the book, and it is very different, yet alluring at the same time.  The main character is obnoxious and pretentious, but the book is written so wonderfully that you can't help but continue reading.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not what I really expected for a read that would keep me on the edge of my seat for a book
B004J4WN0I|5.0|my cousin suggested this series while we wait for the next book in the dresden series. I enjoyed meeting Atticus and Oberon, decided not to worry about the name pronunciation and was thrilled to find the irish pronunciation guide!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Too simple story, characters need to be complex to develop the true underlying motives for their actions, love does not explain it all.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The acting was superb, and the story line great.  Not your usual love story, but enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on this show! I can't wait to see the 4th season and own it on DVD.
B00CW665VI|5.0|There is nothing more sexy than reading a book from a man's pov. I am totally in love with Drew and his comical thinking. So sexy and charming. This is a must read!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Work like to see labels on goals with prices otherwise it's fun....don't like all the extra sales to move ahead in the game
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is my favorite show ever! Whenever i want to laugh and relax, I watch this. this season was good, although some episodes seemed like a repetition of other previous ones.
B00B769XB8|4.0|I thought the story, 3D and acting was top notch (cept for one person).  The lady playing the lead bad witch was terrible and not convincing at all as a bad witch.  I was very disappointed with her acting.  If you've seen her as the Phoenix on the X-men live action movie, well that's her here also.  I'm starting to think she is not a good actress.  It was cool to see witches flying around on brooms and the character named Edward was a nice touch.  I'm big on the fairy tale stuff and found this to be one to buy on 3D, BD.  They have cussing in this and it wasn't even necessary cept to get a R rating.  The cussing is out of place and feels tacked on.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey fans will not be disappointed ! Can't wait for the next one .Very pertinent to the times we live in, as we'll as a fun read .
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Was a good game to play just wished it was a little bit longer finished it in two hours good graphics good story line
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|The steelbook exceeded my expectations. It looks phenomenal. The quality of the actual movie is about equal or a little less than equal to many of the transfers you would see for 1989 movies. Nothing to complain about, but wasn't stunned.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|I had to use the walkthroughs to solve so I guess I wasn't patient enough to tinker around with all the back and forth.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so happy to see it. I missed it on tv, did watch season 3 on tv, so I wanted to see the entire series, thanks to Amazon I was able to see it.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Interesting story. I would have preferred it more if not written from the perspective of the child but it is a very interesting concept and a story worth reading for sure.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is very interesting. It's very different but in a good way. It gives you a taste of what the future could be like. It has more than just modern technology. It shows you the dictation that a society could have. If you're into things like society in the future than I recommend this book to you. :)
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I read this book after seeing a segment on Shin on 60 Minutes. The book is well-written and researched.  It helped me understand just how repressive the North Korean regime is.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Watched this movie with my four year old Step-Daughter on Friday night.<br /><br />I believe she loved it, since she wanted to watch it several more times throughout the weekend.<br /><br />A very funny movie with a great lesson - more so for parents though.
B002RXHW6S|2.0|This Jump-o-lene Castle Bouncer I believe is rated for children ages 3-6. I purchased it for my daughter of 18 months old who loved it. It inflates in 6 separate partitions which I inflated to specifications. She weighs less than 25 pounds and this product lost air pressure in the foundation, towers & floor in about a month. This product is supposed to be able to withstand the play of up to a 6 year old but sprung several air leaks from the wear and tear of a 1 and 1/2 year old. BE ADVISED . . .
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A friend suggested this book and I couldn't put it down.  While the story took place long before my birth, I grew up in Tupelo Mississippi and could relate to much of what was happening as far as how they were living in the quarters.  As difficult as parts were to read, I felt it was probably pretty accurate and true to life then.  Highly recommend as a great summer read.
B0070BG10U|5.0|When I finished hearing this CD, I had tears coming out of my eyes.  I found it strange, since I was never a classical fan.  I just couldn't get into the music itself, although I am a Bee Gees fan.  Something in this haunting beauty of the music, voices (including Robin's of course) just got me.  I keep playing this today and it puts me to sleep very easily.  This CD just draws you in.  I am now a fan of classical thanks to Robin Gibb.  I love Beethoven & a little Mozart.  If I wouldn't had heard this beautiful album, not like the other Robin Gibb solos, I don't know if I would had ever loved any classical or opened my heart to it.  Keep listening to it, and after it is over you want even more and you will repeat the full cd, I know, I have done it.<br /><br />Kyrie, In Paradisum, & Libra Me are just 3 of my favorites.  The whole CD is off the chart, but these came to mind while writing this review.
B006LUCV4Q|5.0|I fell in love with Agnes from first listen. I would love to hear her do a score of a movie. She is such an amazing musician.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|My wife and I just saw F&F6 and both enjoyed it very much.  Whereas Fast 5 was all about the brawn and the brain 6, while certainly similar, keeps the brawn and puts in more heart.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't going to win any sentimentalists over but where Fast 5 felt like it was ripping pages out of a Superman versus Shazam slugfest of a comic book (which I loved; Fast 5 was over the top in a good way and was a terrific time at the movie theater and while F&F6 is a worthy successor Fast 5 edges it out in pure entertainment value) 6 really wraps its enormous arms around the family motif.  Now that doesn't mean that the action is on the severe decline as there are some fun action pieces but they are evenly spaced around a lot of moments that the characters from the series (all return excepting seeming brothers Tego Leo & Rico Santos) get to share as they try to figure out how to stop a bad guy and get Dom's girl back.<br /><br />Now the being true to the family motif has run throughout this series but what I liked here (and you get this in Fast 5 as well but not nearly as well executed IMO) was how this group of tight individuals have grown into a family and it's not all about bloodlines and they are also willing to die for each other (which one character does).  Another character is also assassinated and the deaths of both of these characters were surprising and drew gasps from the audience.  And I doubt that they'll be returning!  So this movie has a bit more heart but it is still a slam bang roaring actioner.<br /><br />What else can you expect from the movie?<br /><br />> A ripping car chase<br />> A ripping car race<br />> Cars versus other...vehicles<br />> The gang of bad guys now are the good guys<br />> Some shots of nice cars<br />> Some shots of hot women dancing around nice cars<br />> A couple of hand-to-hand fight scenes (but, sorry, no Diesel v. the Rock round 2)<br />> Muscles<br />> A couple of surprising deaths<br />> Death-defying stunts<br />> Gravity-defying leaps of logic or story inconsistencies<br />> A huge airplane runway (and I mean that thing must be more than a few miles long--you'll know what I mean after you see it)<br />> A grab you by the throat set-up for the next movie<br />> Attractive stars and locales (London looks simply incredible)<br />> Some laughs<br />> Very good pacing<br />> Brightly lit and colorful...even at night<br />> A good time<br /><br />What might you be surprised not to find here?<br /><br />> Long, near salacious shots of cars<br />> Computer graphics of ignition or other firing systems...being, er, fired<br />> Eva Mendes (pity, that)<br /><br />4.5 stars.br />> Gravity-defying leaps of logic or story inconsistencies<br />> A huge airplane runway (and I mean that thing must be more than a few miles long--you'll know what I mean after you see it)<br />> A grab you by the throat set-up for the next movie<br />> Attractive stars and locales (London looks simply incredible)<br />> Some laughs<br />> Very good pacing<br />> Brightly lit and colorful...even at night<br />> A good time<br /><br />What might you be surprised not to find here?<br /><br />> Long, near salacious shots of cars<br />> Computer graphics of ignition or other firing systems...being, er, fired<br />> Eva Mendes (pity, that)<br /><br />4.5 stars.
0307271080|4.0|Late in AMERICANAH, the new novel by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, one of the secondary characters says of America, \\"You can't write an honest novel about race in this country.\\" Adichie's book is an attempt at just that: an entertaining analysis of race relations in the United States, as perceived by a young Igbo woman whose native Nigeria had military dictatorships to contend with but no concept of racial conflict, as least not to America's extent.<br /><br />Ifemelu came to the United States to pursue her studies. She has a humanities fellowship at Princeton, even though she does not have a graduate degree. She received the fellowship in part based on the popularity of her blog, \\"Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known As Negroes) by a Non-American Black.\\" This blog contains snarky but astute observations about American life and features titles such as \\"Not All Dreadlocked American White Guys Are Down\\" and \\"Traveling While Black.\\"<br /><br />Ifemelu likes Princeton for its \\"delicately overpriced shops\\" and for the fact that, unlike most American cities, it has no smell. But she doesn't like having to travel all the way to Trenton to get her hair braided. She goes to a hair salon at the outset of the novel in anticipation of her return to Nigeria; after 13 years in America, she has decided to go back to her homeland. Family still live there, as does a man named Obinze, the boyfriend she left behind.<br /><br />While she waits for the women at the braiding salon to work on her hair, Ifemelu sends email to Obinze to inform him of her plan to return. They had been a couple for many years in Nigeria, but shortly after her arrival in the US, she started to ignore his emails and texts. This was due in part to frustration over her financial instability and shame over a one-time sexual liaison with a tennis coach to earn badly needed funds.<br /><br />Obinze, now a property magnate, is riding in the back of a car when he receives Ifemelu's news about returning to Nigeria. His driver is taking him to the gated mansion in which Obinze lives with his pampered wife, Kosi, and their baby daughter, Buchi. Obinze has become so rich that he can afford to pay school fees for a hundred children in his village. \\"I do what rich people are supposed to do,\\" he tells Ifemelu during their eventual reunion. But he is not happy with his life as a rich man. Years earlier, he was an undocumented immigrant working under an assumed identity in England. Now he is wealthy beyond his dreams, but unfulfilled. He had made himself forget about Ifemelu, but when he receives her unexpected text, he allows himself to hope that they might be able to rekindle their love.<br /><br />AMERICANAH spans a decade and a half and introduces us to dozens of characters, many of them Ifemelu's and Obinze's parents, aunts and cousins, in America and Nigeria. The structure of the novel is episodic. Adichie chronicles Ifemelu's several romances, her jobs, her family conflicts, and the long discussions she has with lovers and university professors about race in America and the rise of Obama. In its mix of domestic drama and detailed analyses of world politics, the book is a hybrid of Naguib Mahfouz's Cairo Trilogy and the more overtly political works of Nadine Gordimer.<br /><br />Your appreciation of this dense and ambitious novel will depend on your feelings toward domestic dramas that have large casts and are heavy on romance. One person's sprawling saga is another person's soap opera. But there's much to like here, especially Ifemelu's observations about life in America and the blog posts that appear throughout the second half of the novel, posts about Obama needing to become \\"the Magic Negro\\" again after Reverend Wright if he wants to win, or how an \\"American Non-Black\\" can still be racist even if he or she says \\"I have a best friend who is black.\\" Ifemelu's posts are a powerful reminder that, for all of our advances, racismhas yet to be eradicated in America.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michael Magras
B001NHNG64|1.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher books. They are all great. This one is right up there with the best
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I hated having to wait for the Kindle version, but it was worth the wait.  This book is about the last battle and all the characters I care about played major roles in this final book.  Brandon did a great job of bringing this all together and taking twists and turns that were unexpected.  It was sad to see this series come to an end, but it was a great journey and I would recommend the whole series to anyone.
B00000ILGL|5.0|This is one of Giorgio's best electronic albums. I love the way his music changes the soundscape to the journey the music takes one's mind.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|I bought it because I liked the movie. I liked some songs in particular. I like the work of Danny Elfman.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|After many years of being my number 1 western, Unforgiven has now slipped to number 2.  Django Unchained is loaded with action, suspense, and humor.  People who are sensitive to profanities and violence may have difficulties with this film.  The script is saturated with the N word, and Tarantino's gun fights are full of blood splatters and exploding flesh. The acting is a collection of superb performances by a stellar cast. Christoph Waltz, as Dr. Shultz, creates the suspense and mood for this entire film.  As a supporting actor, Samuel Jackson delivers an incredible performance as the despicable &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; antagonist. For the old timers who like singing westerns, there is a bit of Cat Ballou sprinkled in as well.
B00B7IJDMA|3.0|When I saw the review and buy the songs. Expected to bring the most action and original soundtrack movies. I hope there is a second edition better compiled.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|A fabulous collection that represents the breadth , scope & power of Stills long & distinguished career. The book is also great ,lots of nuggets & notes
B002WV5A9G|5.0|When I heard this was being made I was skeptical, but the finished product speaks for itself; genius. Remaking a classic is hard, but unlike the Great Gatbsy, which ruins something beautiful, this film takes something smart and original and changes it, not for the better; but for more possibilities.<br /><br />The plot is smart, acting believable and the new world captivating. A much watch for Trekkies and those who just enjoy a good film.
0525478817|4.0|I don't typically read books that are sad and depressing.  I wanted to read this one because of all the great reviews. This is a good book with great characters, but it will be awhile before I read this one again.  The story pulled me in and I love when a book does that.  Be ready with some tissues though.
B008YJFDQK|5.0|We have a lot of Ben harper, and love it all this &#34; By My Side&#34; is as great as all of the rest of our collection.<br />Love..love..love !!!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Since their comeback with 2009's Black Gives Way to Blue, Alice in Chains have been riding on a wave of resurgence in the music world. Many fans including myself wondered if they could actually make music with the incredible voice of Layne Staley, but those doubts were firmly laid to rest when A Looking in View was released and revealed that the band could be on-par with their past musical outings. William Duvall holds his own and it's great to see this band alive and well again. As for The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, the band has exceeded my expectations and delivered a masterpiece. Where as BGWTB was an excellent album as well, despite some production issues, for some reason after years of repeated listening and taking in the later-half of that record doesn't stick out very much in my mind. For this reason, I came into TDPDH with some reservations. The first singles released did not disappoint, just as before. But the true gems are throughout the entire album. This is one of those albums that you can hit play or drop the needle down and just take in as a whole. Every song has something to offer, every member shines. The production is much improved from the last record, and perhaps is the reason I can enjoy this album a lot more than the BGWTB. The band have out done themselves and you can tell they really worked on this album. If you're a fan of Alice, I can't recommend this album enough. Classic Alice!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Great surprise !  Thanks to all those reviewers before me, I decided to take a chance on an unknown to me ..Now we will collect Joe's works !!  Really loved this one (An Acoustic Evening at the Bienna Opera House).
B00B4804KS|5.0|I sat my grandchildren down to watch.  Since they had seen it they didn't want to until the opening scene and then they were hooked.  Very good 3D with no interruption of the movie.  I hope the other two are coming in 3D.
B002ZCDR88|3.0|We  have many of Natalie's earlier works.  This one(Leave your Sleep), was kind of a let down for us.  We expected her usual style, but this one didn't hit the Natalie Merchant spot for us !!
B00563M11M|5.0|To say that Terry Pratchett has done it again would be wrong on so many levels.  What he has done is jumped down from his usual brilliance and quite literally run circles around it.  This book is amazing.  It is well worth a second, third and even fourth reading.  All I can say is &#34;Thank you.&#34;
B00B2166BS|5.0|The best thing about this is that any time stress is applied to the cable it comes off - without potentially damaging the ports.  I found the magnet to be strong enough and the product is of good quality.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|addictive for sure! downloaded it and couldnt put it down. Downloaded it to my wifes phone also! highly suggested for puzzlers!
B000056NX5|5.0|I like both productions of this movie. I had a vhs, but wanted it on dvd. Interesting portrayal of Jesus and his disciples.
B009A87X80|5.0|Such a beautiful person, excellent guitarist and a pure soul touching beautiful voice.  Her recordings are a treasured gift to us all.
B000031WBV|5.0|His rendering of Chopin's work is really outstanding.  I like Chopin and have discovered that music stores in our area no longer carry classical music.  Weird.  So glad I got this CD.  Sue
1451695195|5.0|Well written and articulate account of his experience.  I am thankful that he shared it!  The fact that he is a neurosurgeon should make it more believable to skeptics.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We have been watching Big Bang Theory just recently and fellin love with the cast and their great performances and the very funny dialogue.  We find this series worth watching over and over.
B00A89ITZG|4.0|just when you though you had enough. The next chapter gives you more. Brian goes deep to give you the knowledge and tools needed to perform.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Just as the other seasons, we have found this one just as fun. We recommend this entire series for a very entertaining time.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|this is the Rock Record of the year, the record Aerosmith should have put out instead of the crap they did. Really Great Music!
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love this series so much that we watch it while having dinner.  We find that the cheerful atmosphere lends a positive note to the evening.  We have been watching from season one and have enjoyed every minute.
0425252868|5.0|It has just enough battle scenes to keep the military folks interested without going over the top for us non-military readers.  My husband and I fought over who got to read it first and once we started into it, neither of us could put it down!  Love this book!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|We have been watching Big Bang Theory from season one and find that as time goes on that the series is maturing.  We are enjoying the occasional cameo by celebrities and especially Wil Wheaton who brings a lot of fun to the series.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really could not be happy without it now I am used to having it. I did the free trial and as soon as it finished and my keyboard reverted to normal I was lost.<br />I immediately paid the very reasonable fee and am now restored to a delighted user.<br />Congrats to the team who made such a useful App.<br />Thanks so much !
B000W91RUG|5.0|Season one is really a must have season.  We have really enjoyed seeing how the Big Bang Theory series started and this season introduces the cast in a very entertaining fashion.
B00C1BU8G2|5.0|I have seen this more than once but like it each time. I am sensitive to people getting eaten by dinosaurs so it was a bit violent for me the first time. There is well-timed subtle humor that moderates the intensity of impending danger.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Speedy delivery!  Excellent!!  I was very pleased with the item which I ordered.  I did not have any problems with this order.  Thank You

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy download, bright screen. Was very easy to set up, and app. has several options for alarm sounds. I also like that there is an option to keep kindle plugged in. (Night stand mode)
B00BWI3RTA|4.0|It is a good album but it does not have the same deepness of her previous CDs. It has this dance songs, but nothing like Grafton Street, Thank you or Northern skies.<br /><br />Good but not excellent.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|excellent product highlights design is very elegant and I loved it and the brand recommended to me a friend and I bought
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|THIS APP REQUIRES MONEY AND IS MORE LIKE A CHEESY FACEBOOK GAME VERSES A ROLE PLAYING OR FIRST PERSON GAME. NOT HAPPY COULD BE WAY BETTER

B004EPYZQC|4.0|This is the best of the series in my view.  I particularly liked the role Dwayne Johnson played.  The tale was very well told and really surprised me at the end with the lead to Fast & Furious 6.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|I expected the movie to be better, it was ok, it's just that it needed something else. I would recommend that you rent it not buy it.
B00011CZRE|4.0|I truly hated watching this movie because it was so well done.  I have been trained as a profiler and have a background in counseling.  I can tell you that Kevin Spacey is a great whacko.  Good view.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoyed this game since the first run. Much like Temple Run but better. You should get this game now.
B009MO57H6|4.0|As a rule, I am leery of multiple sequels (consider Rocky).  And yet, Milla Jovovich does such a good job as Alice that you not only want her to win, but to win big.  Great series and good yarn.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun and really good at keeping your attention. I dont think i will stop playing until the map is full.
B009IK5UJ4|5.0|I have all of there cd's and this extended version goes deeper into their music. Wish they would record again! Would shop with this vender again.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very entertaining best game should get must have great game no trouble very fun not boring its a great app
B00280LYIC|3.0|I had really high hopes for starting this series. I had heard it was really good, and the Amazon reviews were reassuring. It is in a genre that I really enjoy as well. However, the book did not live up to my expectations. I had heard that the book was similar to Harry Potter and that was a big plus for me, but upon reading it, the similarities were too great. The entire beginning of the book seemed like a copy/paste of Harry Potter: kid with strange abilities finds out he is something special and part of a world that is kept secret from regular humans, kid is sent to a place where kids like him hone their abilities and are kept protected from the outside world, kid finds out he is even more special than all the other kids and must go on a quest that only he can do to save the entire world. The two stories were so similar it frustrated me.<br /><br />The narrative style was a bit irritating. Listening to Percy's inner thoughts was a bit ridiculous. He just isn't very smart and makes the same mistakes over and over, and it seems this happens just so exciting things will occur once he gets himself into trouble. Maybe I'm just a little too old for this book to appeal to me?<br /><br />The Greek gods weren't really very familiar to me, and they seemed to just be thrown in willy-nilly, like name dropping. I think the gods and mythos of the story could have been better explained.<br /><br />To conclude, I just couldn't get into this story. It was too similar to Harry Potter in the beginning. Towards the end when it got into its own unique storyline, the narrative just wasn't very compelling. I had been looking for a good series to keep me going for awhile, but sadly this wasn't it.

0670026557|2.0|What is common sense for some people is not common sense for other people, thus it is difficult to write a book that appeals to everyone. This book is written for an audience that has had its common sense diverted from what is common sense among ordinary people. (Maybe MBAs with strong elbows?) So it is about rediscovering a basic message. Still, there is value to some of the stories, but certainly not most. What about the following: If you are 25 years old and talking to 50 year old people, do not emphasize your formal education. Instead show humility by saying that you don't know everything. Good advice? Sure, but is it novel/insightful? If you answer yes, my advice is to buy the book straight away.<br /><br />I have no problem with the message of this book. However, I am really annoyed by the dumbed down style of writing. (Is this really the reading ability level of managers and MBAs?) Why is it that the choice today is between reading ten academic research papers or a dumbed down management book (we don't even get proper footnotes)? I would have loved to read an intelligent book that is more strongly based on the author's (and others) research. Instead we get endless stores about how cute the world can be when everyone learns to be nice to each other. I dislike both the cuteness and the simplifications.  Why is it that so few people write for a thoughtful audience? My advice is to read the author's HBR article and pass on this book. However, the book has some good examples of how you can be a giver.<br /><br />I don't like the book, but I want my review to be constructive. If you enjoyed [[ASIN:0374203032 What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets]], you probably would like the current book too. Topic is different but style of writing and underlying message are similar. Books like this tend to be published when the economic climate is not going too well. I suppose people are a little bit receptive to critique when times are not so good.<br /><br />And isn't it ironic that all the people that give this lonely review negative feedback has not understood the book's message. Please buy the book if you are one of those.'t it ironic that all the people that give this lonely review negative feedback has not understood the book's message. Please buy the book if you are one of those.

As for the advanced functions, I know nothing, don't need to, don't want to, but for my everyday use it works just fine. It's quick and easy to operate, is easily accessible, and is almost always near me. What else could I ask for? I like it.

Everyone who brought pizza or hot dogs, everyone who gave an actor a ride to work, everyone who's dog barked during filming, and especially those who sneezed , are listed.  Personally, I could care less who even acted in the thing. The credits at the beginning are saying &#34;after people see this they will not want to know our names.&#34;.  They were probably right.

I did however begin to lose interest when the plot turned and it became OK for the characters to take the law into their own hands and execute the main bad guy. Bad things happened tot he main characters, but it does not make it OK to do whatever one wants in the name of revenge. Having a priest lie in court to aquit the main characters was over the top!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game is truely the only game I've ever played all the way through. I have zero patients for games that take years and you have to have strategy guides or other nonsense to complete. This game is straight foreword. Journey. The soundtrack is amazing and so are the graphics! Purchase this game if you want a total body experience.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie, action, and follows the story line nicely. A good follow up to Lord of the Rings! Peter Jackson does Tolkien right.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|They need to put clash of clans for 99cance or 2$ and they would make bank<br />On it and who is with me
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Wow this game is amazing! I think that it's interactive gameplay makes this game beyond creative and the choice of characters is nice because you always need a certain warrior to help you. I recommend this game hugely so get it. Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is the best purchase I have ever made! The story is so fascinating and has so much wonderful scenery.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A terrific and fun movie to watch with the family.  The singing is awesome and Rebel Wilson is a crack up.  Happy ending along the lines of the Sister Act series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A continuation of Seasons 1 and 2. You will love it! I could not stop watching it for wanting to see what happens next.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I love all the Bourne series of movies.  Liked seeing parts of the movie filmed in the Philippines and re-living the typical Manila traffic.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|We are huge fans of One Republic.  We have seen them live 3 times.  My teenaged daughter is probably Ryan Tedders biggest fan.  As parents, we are happy with the songs One Republic makes.  They are a very talented group musically, and the vocals are outstanding.  Every song is different.  All of their songs are appropriate for people of all ages, with no vulgarities or sexual overtones.  This is pop music as its best.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Having never read the book, my first time seeing &#34;life of Pi&#34; was a very moving and surprising experience.<br /><br />The story is wonderful, and the effects, acting, and directing are first class.<br /><br />The visuals are mind-blowing! This will be the movie I use whenever I get a new TV to test how much of an improvement it is over my previous set. Tons of re-watch value for the whole family.<br /><br />The combination of the visual effects, moving story, and superb acting/directing make &#34;Life of Pi&#34; one of my favorite films of all time.
0738737909|5.0|I received my beautiful cards today. The cards are vibrant with a wide variety of colors. They fit into my hands quite easily. The gilded edges are absolutely beautiful. The book, that accompanies this deck, has color photos of each card. The explanations of these cards are detailed and easily understood.  The box may be magnetized because the flap stays in place when the box is closed. The box is a masterpiece in and of itself. The pictures don't do justice to this deck.<br /><br />I am VERY happy with my purchase.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be very uplifting personally.  It speaks to the questions within all of us regarding what happens to us after death.  I found it to be well written, carefully thought out and presented very clearly.  A great read for anyone who has ever wondered what happens next.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I downloaded a big app and it took up all my space then I deleted it and didn't have any space then I saw this online for my kindle fire and works great THANK U THANK U THANK U I thought my kindle was done for

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|hard to get glue coins but still addictive! highly recommended for someone looking to pass the time for a few days
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is fun.  I enjoy any kind of card game and challenge.  Keeps me entertained for a long time trying to win.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book does an outstanding job of putting together what is known to help us all understand why children do and do not succeed and the ways in which so many of our efforts to help are based on false assumptions and doomed to fail.  A worthy read for anyone who cares about equal opportunities to learn, live and succeed in America.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I just love listening to and watching the Piano Guy. one two three four five six seven eight more words.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This movie was scary from the beginning to the end and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout!
B0012NO4WO|4.0|What's not to like, in the end Jeff Daniels is killed, along with Dennis Hopper.  My favorite line, when asked how to handle a difficult hostage situation&#62;  Keanu immediately replies &#34;Shoot the Hostage&#34;!  Which he later does when Daniels messes up.  VERY good and plenty of humor mixed with SWAT team drama.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The show takes us further along from the first 6 seasons.  Each episode as Dexter finds love and discovers things about himself to comprehend in his own mind who he is and how he defines himself.  Yvonne Strahovski is delicious.  Plays her character really well.  Dex's sister admits a couple of things.  Retirement for Sgt. Batista.  More close calls as people in Dex's life almost discover his secret.  Yet, it all about wanting to know or simple ignorant bliss.  People are not what you perceive them to be.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|A parody on self-help programs, I've done my share, and hilarious.  Jim is great, and so is Terrance Stamp.  Check it out!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Freaking hilarious.  A guys movie with guy language and personas.  Guys still have that inner kid in them no matter what the situation on dealing with life.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|i just read Rolling Stone magazine's review for the reissue of WOA. the idiot who reviewed it is dismissive of the Denny Laine number on the album, remarking that peopel probably went off to the bathroom on a 'smoke' break. on the contrary, denny's songs are all great, a cover of his old Moody Blues song, Go Now, a cover of Paul Simon's Richard Cory and the third is a collaboration with Macca called Time To Hide (easily one of the best songs on here.) The Beatle songs on here sound ok, I've Just Seen A Face sounds particularly good. A lot of songs that he rarely plays these days are all on here: Rockshow, Spirits Of Ancient Egypt, Hi Hi Hi, Soily. Folks, this is the best live Mccartney out there, GET IT!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|so intersting. You have to use my brain and also good graphics and animations. I really recommend this game 4 sure
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I've never watched foreign films because I didn't want to read the subtitles BUT this one is worth watching. Don't let the subtitles keep you from this movie.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I had always wondered about the BEST classic rock band OF ALL TIME!!<br />This documentary covers all the things you ever needed to know about the Eagles!<br />IMPORTANT: Don't watch around children! There is a scene or two where naked women get on the stage at one of the concerts!
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|I sure hope the movie is better than the book.  Rather than a story this book is question and answer going all over the place.  To be honest I haven't read the whole book.  I've read about half of it but so far it's boring.
B00CW665VI|4.0|It's not my my favorite, but it is cute and has some very entertaining moments.  It was cool that the story was from a guy's point of view. I can definitely see most readers enjoying this story.

B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Solid tile matching game with strategy mixed in.  Works flawlessly on my Galaxy S3.  Reserving the 5th star for better graphics.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was a truly fantastic movie.  My husband and I both liked it, so you have to appreciate that.  It's a slightly off-kilter love story but much more than the chick flicks produced by the dozen today.  And if you like Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence before seeing the movie, you'll really appreciate their acting abilities afterward.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I were late to the TWD game but had to purchase season 3 after watching seasons 1 and 2 on netflix.  Well worth the purchase, can't wait for the fall and season 4!
B00CBKLO52|4.0|it fun to play with it is was free not to glichy enjoyed laying the game to pass the time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love nature documentaries and i am glad I ordered this one. I bought another to give as a gift and the recipient loved it.<br />The version with David Attenborough is MUCH MUCH better
B001AQQR2S|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought is was going to be one of those silly, rude and boring movies made for kids by people who think kids are dumb. I was wrong. This movie is beautiful, praises reading, learning, knowledge and makes a great statement on the meaning of parenthood in a fun and heartwarming way.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Short story that is a great way to spend an afternoon. I do question if it is appropriate for children. I remember being assigned this in middle school.
B00C70FG2S|4.0|Of all the virtues possessed by melodeath bands, a long shelf life isn't often one of them. For most bands it plays out one of two ways: either they stick to their guns and become derivative, or they discard their entire core philosophy in favor of jumping on trends, often burying the ideas that led them to prominence in the first place.<br /><br />Swedish Gothenburg/melodeath godfathers Dark Tranquility have flirted with both outcomes at times, but they remain among the best of the bunch due to their dedication to a shared vision, and their consistency in executing it. Their 10th full length, Construct, doesn't change the blueprint much and generally consists of slower paced to mid tempo crunchers, but the band does their damage in enough ways to keep things varied and maintain your attention. One of the key themes is an expanded emphasis on the airy, atmospheric side of their sound. \\"Uniformity\\" is laden with excellent keyboard work from Martin Brändström and benefits from Mikael Stanne's impeccable baritone vocals. It lends of sense of stoic grandeur to the track, while sounding like their take on Katatonia's patented brand of atmospheric metal.<br /><br />Speaking of which, \\"State of Trust\\" is dominated by clean vocals that very much capture the vibe championed by Katatonia frontman Jonas Renske, or perhaps Steven Wilson. It certainly stands out within their recent catalog. But of course, melodic metal has always been the band's forte, and yet again they do not disappoint. \\"The Science of Noise\\" boasts a downright catchy chorus which is followed up with some great winding melodic guitar passages; if this isn't the album's best track it's certainly one of the top two or three. \\"Endtime Hearts,\\" with its twinkling keyboards and driving guitar passages, is reminiscent of Children of Bodom song, while \\"Weight of the End\\" boasts some of the album's best headbanging sections.<br /><br />However, those looking for something fast and visceral would be advised to lookelsewhere. \\"Apathetic\\" is one of the fastest and most aggressive songs the band has penned since 2005's ultra aggressive Character. It's anchored by Anders Jivarp's pounding drums and a kickass solo, but unfortunately it's the only real screamer Construct has to offer. The only song that noticeably falls flat, curiously enough, is the opener \\"For Broken Words.\\" It does feature a nice verse riff from guitarists Niklas Sundin and Martin Henriksson, but its attempts to focus on atmosphere are somewhat awkward. It features several passages consisting mostly of just the bass, drums and vocals, but it's too slow to develop, and feels entirely too tepid and unsure of itself. As for the bonus tracks, \\"Immemorial\\" serves up more catchy metal while proving the band still has some grit, while instrumental closer \\"Photon Dreams\\" feels like it should have been a little more fleshed out.<br /><br />As always, the instrumentation is first rate. There's not much about any of the individual performances that really grab your attention -- rather, the focus is on demonstrating how each part of the whole works together as one cohesive unit. Stanne's vocals are full of their trademark bubbling, sneering wrath, and he has shown great improvement in his clean vocals. The lyrics, meanwhile, are typically glum and moody, delivering a darker undertone to the project as a whole.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with the band's output following their 2002 album Damage Done won't find any major breakthrough or revelation here, although Construct does come at a pivotal time in the band's career. It sees them picking themselves up and re-energizing following 2010's We Are the Void, which notably lacked punch and seemed to be the first major sign of lethargy and monotony setting in.<br /><br />Dark Tranquility have managed to adjust and make alterations to their sound over the years without sacrificing their credibility, and there's good reason they remain one of today's most viable and well respected metal bands. Construct excels at upholding one of the band's innermost principles of consistency along with catchy and well constructed songwriting, and can stand ably in the band's catalog alongside Damage Done, Character, and Fiction.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I haven't read such an amazing book in a long time. Drew Evans pov is absolutely perfect. I haven't read  a male pic better. I love that the female lea  isn't weak or whiny...she brings just as much to the table and the relationship ..I loved this book..Will reread..buy in paperback and recommend to all my book loving friends. 5 huge brightly lit stars!
B008D30K7E|4.0|Well written and funny.<br /><br />Ridiculous and highly unlikely plot but yet seems possible for the 100 year old man, brilliant!
B007CHUPHC|2.0|The first two books story line were very good. This third book story line ending sucked, went down the toilet. I really thought it was<br />going to be a good ending.
B0076NKLRQ|1.0|The movie itself was wonderful, however Amazon Instant Video has recently developed a problem with stopping play mode every few minutes.  I have an iPad and have watched movies successfully for several months until the last few weeks.  This undoubtedly will effect sales for Amazon so I hope they resolve this problem very soon.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I always considered it LOTR before LOTR. Warwick is an awesome actor for being only really know for his work in Leprechaun. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a different kind of fantasy movie.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Loooooved this book. I couldn't put it down. It is a love story that will have you in tears. Great read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game!! Except when I'm at the last couple puzzles &amp; I can't figure them out, like I've been for the last few days!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book!!!<br />Can't wait to see what they do with the movie! Going to start<br />Mockingjay next!<br />A must read-
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I've already heard parts of the newly remastered version of WOA. The sound quality is improved greatly over this album's last appearance on compact disc. My only complaint is that the cost of getting the edition that has the previously unreleased tracks is priced way too high. That's why I ordered the standard edition. I would have paid a little more for a bonus disc. I'd have even paid about $27-$33 for a 3 CD set with a DVD. But I won't pay $100 or more for the deluxe edition.<br /><br />WOA has a good selection of songs, mostly from the \\"Venus And Mars\\" and \\"Wings At The Speed Of Sound\\" albums. I'm always happy to hear \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" from this album, as well as \\"Live And Let Die\\". I'm looking forward to hearing \\"Band On The Run\\" from this album, since Paul really can't hit those notes anymore. At least we get one live version where he can. I'm also getting psyched to hear \\"Hi Hi Hi\\", even though I don't get \\"Hi Hi Hi\\" anymore!<br /><br />At last I'll be able to throw my very worn out WOA cassette tape away!
B0014H32MG|4.0|This short, gem of a book is a fun grown-up alternative to The Hunger Games. Collins obviously took many clues from this book about a man who comes from nothing in a dystopian future and sacrifices his future to compete in a fight to the death on TV that will bring his family riches.<br /><br />The competition and strategies employed by Richard are inventive and brutal, and King offers some engaging ideas about money and our society and what we give up to be passive members of said society. The end of the second act trudges on a little slowly, but the 100 short chapters that count down to the end of the book offer a fun way to feel the impending climax.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I absolutely love games where you can build parks and zoos and stuff, so I really love this game. I'm glad it's free, and I like the animation and graphics, so I would uhh of recommend it for everyone. Top notch, Gameloft!
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|This movie was decent. You can see this is one of those drastic-grabbing at straws-last ditch effort kind of movie for Arnold. I wouldn't buy it. I regret renting it for $4.99. It's entertainment, if you've watched everything else worth watching already, but I'd wait for it to be $1 rental
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I'm very satisfied with it. This is a nice, sturdy case.  The color displayed is exact and it was received in excellent condition.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|My wife loved this movie, and I agree that it is a watch anytime type of movie. Its got the comedy, drama and well casted. This is certainly not an academy level film, but its worth seeing. I recommend this film for anyone looking for a fun, relaxing and romantic story line, and is looking to laugh throughout. The most memorable part of this movie is Olive's (Emma Stone) parents, who we all wish we had. They are so laid back and fun...<br /><br />Overall, Check it out! The reason for 4 stars is because it is predictable...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book relates to a singular experience that is extraordinary given the situation that the characters were involved. It is a story that we could learn and respect. If these men could find a way to respect life as enemies and become common friends as veterans.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Great condition, just what I ordered. Had no problems with it and it worked the way it should. Thank you
193700788X|1.0|Sookie and especially Eric deserved a better send off than this book. I am very confused why Charlaine Harris decided to focus this last book on so many ancillary characters that I had trouble remembering. I remember devouring the first several books in this series and true there has been a decline, but I hoped for more from the final book. It was confusing, there really was no interesting plot, and Eric was such a complete and utter let down. I don't remember the last time I wrote a review, but this was so awful I felt compelled. Totally disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book because it had parts that were romantic and parts that were action packed and parts that were sad. If you like fighting and survival you will like this book.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This is great! I'm listening while typing. All the folks on this album rock. John Fogerty STILL ROCKS!! I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the most awesome cool fun addicting game ever and I recommend this game to everyone I know and it is always a new adventure it's all also super fun to everyone
B004TI1WME|5.0|Excellent for budget work! Still need to figure out how to change a tape item.  I can see several uses for this app.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|All three books of this trilogy were very entertaining from the first page.  I could not put the book down until I finished it.  Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is such a good game! I would recommend it to anyone very addictive and a must play! Go download it now
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I seldom purchase movies but I was so impressed with this movie when I originally watched it that I wanted to have a copy .
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I have this game on my iPod and it's really fun but then I got it on my Kindle. Not so fun. So yeah it is recommended to buy this on your Apple device.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Not a bad application. The newer version has nice features, but I get tired of waiting for it to load on my Kindle Fire, and I have super fast turbo Wi-Fi. I'll shop around some more. Still, I'll give it 4 stars.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I liked.this book because it was funny and  it made me laugh non stop. My favorite part was with baby Alfredo.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Love it! Recommended! Like the other three movies Lord of the Ring! It help understand the first movie. Go and rent it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|As soon as I got this app I was thrilled, and I was attached to it. I have fun building large towers and rooms for my friends. I highly recommend Minecraft to people with a creative mind. This is perfect for children 9 and over.
B005D6O0IO|5.0|I have a pair of crocs already and was not sure I needed another pair but these are fantastic - very comfortable from first wear. They smarten a pair of jeans and are prefect for drizzly days. They do make a slight 'fart' noise when you walk if your foot is not positioned correctly in the shoe (it's not loud and I'm sure no one would notice). A great buy and I would definitely recommend them. They are quite wide, so I went down a size and they fit perfectly. If you have long toes and narrow feet you might struggle with this style, definitely for people with short toes and wide feet!
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie is action from beginning to end! I loved how they took this fairy tale and gave us &#34;the rest of the story.&#34; Kept my attention the entire movie. Here's to a sequel!!!
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer are outstanding in this film about who can out do the other in this war time movie.  Plummer playing a Nazi General and Peck playing an Irish monsenior in Rome. Peck who plays a priest smuggling out POWs and Jews from Italy during WWII, while Plummer is constantly on his case to find evidence he is doing so.  The movie has a great cat and mouse action between the two.  My only complaint was the movie was a bit LONG and yet the directors continued to up the ante as to how to get Peck out of trouble.  This movie is a delight to old and new.  The scenery was shot in Rome and was beautiful.  Great movie!
0060922583|5.0|I've read so many other books, and countless times there were references to this book. So I had it in my Amazon Wish List, but I kept putting it off........... but I finally bought it with a few others I wanted to get the free shipping and read it. Wow! Much more &#34;Scientific&#34; then I had imagined........... It all makes sense, it's just so had to rap your arms around........... Is this whole Universe, just God's Dream??
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game! Best of all, it is free. U cant ask for much more than that! Thank you amazon for finally adding Hill Climb Racing.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Eat and Run provides great motivation for anyone looking to take up running and considering a change in their nutritional habits. Mr. Jurek's discussion on the connection between the food we eat and how well we perform is critical. I also appreciated the discussion on the transcendence that running brings to the mind and spirit.
B001KWN6ZS|1.0|Do not purchase this item.  Not playable in United States unless you want to purchase additional equipment or downloads.  Or spend several hours trying to add additional &#34;zones&#34; to your computer.  Waste of money
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I love the album. It has a different sound, but all of their albums are unique. I found it highly enjoyable.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent work. Excellent cast, music, scenerio, landscapes.  This is a great movie.  I give it two thumbs all way up.
B0058YPG1G|1.0|I received to package and opened it ready to watch and the there was nothing in it!!! There were no discs in the box! I was ripped off!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I saw that the game had good reviews- so I got it for my kindle. I ve only played it for the day so far; but its surprisingly addictive! even my two year old likes it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|[Warning: Spoilers] Many other reviewers have done an excellent job noting the (many) problems with the storytelling side of the book.  But there are also moments in this novel when you have to wonder why somebody-- a friend, a copy-editor, a proofreader, anybody-- didn't sit Charlaine Harris down and really get her to rethink some pretty vile images in this book when it comes to a not-even-so-subtle racism and homophobia.  For example, in one of the main scenes in Dead Ever After, Harris actually has a black character waving a gun around and screaming-- I kid you not-- \\"I got the HIV!\\" Then he says things things like \\"She dead.\\"  This scene could have been written by some elderly white guy who's only contact with an actual African-American was having once seen \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and a single blacksploitation movie from the 1970s.  My face turned red just reading this section-- whatever on earth compelled Ms. Harris to write it? I mean, \\"I got the HIV\\"?  Seriously? As bad as she's gotten with the social commentary side of the Sookie books in the last few years, Harris should have stayed about 250 miles away from any reference at all to anything like HIV/AIDS-- she's simply not up to this kind of stuff anymore-- but putting this in the mouth of a highly racialized character who talks like a stereotype of a caricature of a stereotype-- it's simply indefensible.<br /><br />And its odd to talk about homophobia from an author who pretty much based the whole context of the Sookie Stackhouse series on elements of the gay rights movement (\\"coming out of the coffin\\" and all that-- handled much, much better in the first few novels).  But what on earth has happened to Harris in the last few books?  She literally makes the climax of Dead Ever After a scene in which Sookie is hoping two characters will gay-bash a gay character because it might let her escape.  Think about that for a second.  Would Harris have written a scene where Sookie was praying for characters to engage inviolent racism or anti-Semitism because it would conveniently let her escape? Would she have made the final villain such a racialized or stereotypically Jewish figure-- as Claude is a gay one-- in the first place? (Well, maybe she would, considering how Harris handles the above-mentioned scene with Tyrese, but the mind boggles that nobody would have stepped in to say \\"uh, Charlaine, that might not be such a good idea\\").<br /><br />And for the second book in a row, the ultimate supposed \\"surprise\\" reveal of the big bad is (one of the entire Sookie series' only major gay male characters) Claude.  Harris has betrayed a lot of her characters in the past few books, making them do some seriously grotesquely out-of-character things-- Alcide, Amelia, and Eric, for starters-- but turning Claude, once an arrogant but sometimes oddly sweet character, into such a villain is maybe one of the most offensive things in the whole series.  Why?  Because in a whopping 13 novels of a series where Harris seriously co-opts images of the gay rights movement throughout (and where, BTW, Harris owes a major debt to a gay man, Alan Ball, for promoting her works into the stratosphere of popularity, fame, and money), pretty much every single gay male character (and there's only a few of them) Harris has presented in the Sookie series has ended up either a villain or a (violently) dead victim, the same two \\"only either bad or tragic\\" dangerous stereotypes that critics like Vito Russo were protesting and satirizing even as far back as the 1980s.  Someone should point out to Harris it's 2013.<br /><br />The single real exception-- if you can call it that-- is Mustapha, who may-- or may not-- be gay (Harris perversely refuses to say one way or another, though let's note that while readers likely end up feeling like they know every single miniscule aspect of the relationships of heterosexual characters like Tara or Kennedy Keyes, likely down to what's their husband's favorite brand of peanut butter, Mustapha and Warren's exact relationship is left as an enigma). And, yeah, sure, there's a token lesbian along the way (usually those like India, who have absolutely nothing to do in the series but pop up for maybe a paragraph as if to say \\"oh, yeah, here's a lesbian, now let's get back to six paragraphs describing what brand of diapers Tara prefers and what tv shows Jason and Michelle like to watch on Thursday nights\\").  But Harris crosses the border of offensiveness in this final book, particularly with that \\"gay bashing turns out to provide a convenient escape for Sookie\\" scene.  It's more than lazy writing, it's seriously out-of-line.<br /><br />If Harris can't write gay male characters who aren't preening villains or violently murdered victims, fine, but then maybe she shouldn't have borrowed so much from the LGBT rights movement for much of her series' major obvious metaphors and simply left gays or other minorities she just can't handle out of things? Someone suggested the last few novels were ghost-written and I'd sure like to think so, because, otherwise, Charlaine, what on earth happened?
B005OYKI1I|4.0|Lots of action and gorgeous fast cars.  If that's your thing you'll love this movie. Glad they kept many of the original cast and Dwayne Johnson is a good addition.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. It was suggested to me in a very critical time in my own marriage. It helped me to refocus on what had been missing and how to fix it. I would suggest that anyone in a relationship should read it, the sooner the better.
B009D7CP2M|2.0|I bought this book, and I am not really happy with the story. It was awful. The organization than sold me the book was however very good and are a good place to buy books.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is amazing how much this movie also reflects what is politically  happening today....but the ideology of the parties in the present are reversed compared to the Republicans and Democrates during the era of Lincoln.  The acting is superb. An oscar worthy performance by Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones.  The chemistry between Daniel-Day Lewis and Sally Field is matched by none!  I watched it twice!  I couldn't get enough!  I may watch it again.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was right in line with all the others Vince Flynn books.  Nice job look forward to the next one. Vincent F.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Although this book was promoted as a business book, there are so many ideas that can be applied to all succeesses in life that it should be required reading for any business, sociology, psychology and anthropology student. Better yet, make it required reading for high school AP classes.
B005HSL626|3.0|The game is fun and entertaining, but it locks up-a lot. I thought maybe it was just a fluke, so I reloaded it. Nope, there's just a glitch in the program. But hey, it was free right?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just love how the three books in this series tie together. I was a little skeptical at first but the author made a believer out of me. This book has everything I wanted. I liked it because it shows the true love between Christian and Ana and because everything came together in the end the way I wanted it to. I love that in a book!
1400069807|5.0|The book arrived quickly and was packaged well.  A very informative book and one that can help many to understand what the food industry is really doing.
B005HSL626|4.0|its a fun game but you cant do everything you can in the paid version so take your pick id rather pay a $1
B009AMAJVO|5.0|A great thriller, rapace and farell are fantastic and if your into their films or a good crime film then see this movie
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have used this a couple of times.  It is a visually appealing app and it does the basics.  Nothing fancy but is good for what it is.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It was a very good movie and the video and sound feed were perfect.  I suggest you buy it in HD as the source material is HD.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a good basic calculator.  The visual design is easy on the eyes and makes it easy to use.  Have not done anything fancy with it.  Just basic calculating.  For that it works.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Downloaded tdpdh on amazon sound cloud. Alice in chains will melt your face off. Look at the cover very carefully! The dinos head is a reverse almost invisible dublicate. It looks like the devil :O
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Pi is a precocious Indian boy from Pondicherry, India.  His family owns a zoo.  In that zoo is a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  Pi is also a spiritual child, rebelling against his rationalist \\"New India\\" father.  In his spiritual journey, Pi melds Christianity, Islam and Hinduism in his effort to find and love God.  A cynic might interpret this as a touchy-feely globalist literary prop to make the movie more likeable to a broad global audience whose members are actually locked in post-enlightenment zeitgeist of religious war and tension.  That same cynic might also add that the true god of Corporate Globalism is a one-out-of-three unholy trinity of Migrants, Mammon, & Moloch.<br /><br />The political situation shifts in India and Pi and his family sell the zoo and transport the animals on a Japanese freighter for Canada.  On the ship they meet a rude French cook, a kind-hearted Japanese sailor and look after their animals.  One night there is a terrible storm and the freighter sinks, Pi is the only human survivor.  On the lifeboat, which is half covered by canvas, is an injured zebra, an female orangutan who has lost her baby to the sea, and a vicious hyena.  As the shipwrecked zoo progress on their journey, the hyena kills the zebra, than the orangutan, and then suddenly , Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger leaps from under the canvas, killing the hyena.  Pi is then alone, with a vicious tiger.  Pi must tame the great cat and use his wits to help them both survive.<br /><br />In an epic of surreal filmography Pi and Richard Parker drift across the Pacific, during one storm Pi sees Almighty Providence, when he tries to show the sight to Richard Parker, the tiger is seized with fear and must duck under the canvas.  In a delirium, Pi and Richard Parker wash up on a strange island-a garden of plenty by day but death by night.  Eventually, Pi washes up on a beach in tropical Mexico, and the tiger returns to the to jungle without looking back. Pi is then rescued by natives.<br /><br />At this point, the viewer is left with an unsettled feeling.  Pi's more important journey with God is soul-less, globalist nonsense, his reconciliation is nowhere near as believable as Lieutenant Dan's Jacob-like wrestling with God while tied to the mast of a shrimp boat during Hurricane Camille.<br /><br />However cynicism drops away and the entire meaning of the movie changes in retrospect with a subtle plot twist. Pi speaks to some Japanese officials in a Mexican hospital.  They are investigating the shipwreck as part of an insurance claim.  They don't believe his story.  He tells a different story-one of a dying, kind-hearted sailor, a resourceful and Darwinian French cook, and his scared mother in a lifeboat.  This story is darker, more emotionally taxing, and involves murder and cannibalism.  Without letting on which story is true, Pi mentions that the tiger Richard Parker was much like his Id, his will to survive, his inner-evil.  During the storm, when Pi sees The Almighty, Richard Parker can only tremble in terror.  This, second story takes the movie to a higher level.  It is a story that sticks in the mind, causing one to think backwards about the nuanced, subtle details in the story.  A viewer then picks at the suddenly real, suddenly rich, and suddenly colorful spiritual symbolism.<br /><br />I wish I could give it six stars.tives.<br /><br />At this point, the viewer is left with an unsettled feeling.

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, romantic and thrilling. I would recommend this movie to all ladies out there. Great tear jerker.
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|3 and a half stars if I could.<br /><br />When I saw \\"Thin Lizzy\\" in Fall 2011 I knew I wasn't REALLY seeing the Thin Lizzy of my youth, but something in between a Thin Lizzy Tribute Band and the real thing.<br /><br />An original member, an almost-original member, and a short timer plus some \\"all-star\\" guys with decent resumes of their own, especially Damon Johnson who has been a self-proclaimed Lizzy fan his whole life and puts out good stuff of his own, check out the Brother Cane Discography, not a lemon in there.<br /><br />So fast forward to \\"Thin Lizzy\\" writing new music, I was as against releasing it as Thin Lizzy as most other Lizzy fans. It's one thing when there are 3 ex-Lizzy members in a band playing Lizzy songs live and doing them justice; quite another when you're down to one ex-member. Also, as we ALL know, Phil was the main songwriter and sound of the real deal, it would have been a disservice to release any new album as Lizzy.<br /><br />Now something happened behind the scenes to convince them to NOT release as Lizzy, you may want to believe the altruistic version of \\"it wouldn't have been right\\" or you may believe somewhere along the line some lawyers and money got involved. Who would get what from a new album released as Lizzy vs. releasing it as a different band name maybe ? That's what I'm more inclined to believe.<br /><br />Anyhow, to the album itself. Obviously it is aimed at Lizzy fans, almost as if they got an assigmnent to \\"write a Thin Lizzy album\\". Ricky does a decent Lynott impersonation vocally. The twin guitars are there. A celtic-sounding song. All the Lizzy trademarks. Well......not quite all.<br /><br />I'm not a musician so I don't know how to put it in musical terms but the drums are just wrong. I don't know technically what Downey did, but it had a huge impact and there's just \\"something\\" about his playing that fit better than what is going on here.<br /><br />Also, there's no respite here, all light, no shade. Just 11 straightahead mid to fast rockers. No \\"Southbound\\"-type songs to break up the tempo a bit. All the great Lizzy albums gave you a few minutes to breathe and throw you something a bit different halfway through. There's a bit of \\"saminess\\" all the way through to \\"Blues ain't so bad\\" which might have been better suited somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />I'll go see them if they play my neck of the woods, but next time (and I hope there IS a next time) it would be nice to see if they come up with their own sound or if they will write another Lizzy album.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I only saw the 1st episode as I am saving the rest of it for a long flight, or kids-away weekend.<br /><br />Very well scripted based on 1 episode.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />--------------<br />After watching the next 6 episodes, I am still impressed by writing and the twists.<br /><br />Hannibal seems to be involved in every killing somehow.  NBC has the episodes free, and so does Comcast and Verizon.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|yes friends... I'm dissapointed.... BGWTB was a very solid return of the band and when I heard the first two singles from TDPDH I thought that this one would be even better... unfortunately I'm pretty much dissapointed. Album sounds like the third solo release of Jerry Cantrell, musically it's very similar to those records, but the lyrics lack depth and the overall drive is weaker... Highlits: Stone, Hollow and the title track. All the rest is like one big mess. I'm going to listen to this album for a while, just to check if it will grow on me, if it will I'll be really happy.<br />One can't compare BGWTB with AiC Classics like Dirt or Facelift, but it was a very good album on it's own and sounded much more like AiC album than this one... really sorry to say that....
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is just a great family film.  Just enough danger to keep the kiddos on the edge of their seats and a lovely parable about kindness, family, and karma.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|A little slow at first and I had trouble getting into it. It definitely picked up towards the end. Good enough.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Extremely suspenseful and a real tearjerker.  I cried through the whole movie and I am not much of a crier.  Thank God for the happy ending!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|get this app! it's like relieving the wonderful movie that is finding nemo, the background music is so relaxing it's almost therapeutic, and its FREE!
B009MYARIK|1.0|Could not finish, ridiculous, contrived and tedious. Glad I did not pay for it..ebook from library...sending it back tonight. What a waste of time.
030758836X|5.0|So, I was late to the Gone Girl party! I've had it since last summer when it first blew up, but I just never got around to reading it. I recommended it to my hubby on our most recent vacation, however, and he became so deeply engrossed, that I felt compelled to know what all the fuss was about! I was not at all disappointed, but it did not quite live up to the hype for me (but then what does? When there is this level of excitement around a book, it can rarely measure up). I did find it to be spectacularly well written, and more significantly, incredibly well-plotted. It is not often that I read a book that amazes me in its imaginativeness, and Gone Girl did this for me. It went well beyond what I could possibly conceive, and I loved it for this alone. The only complaint I had was the ending. I won't spoil it, but it was infuriating! I think it was the perfect ending, but it definitely left me with so many thoughts. I was mostly just happy that my hubby had read it as well so we could discuss at length. Gone Girl is not the best book I've ever read, but it was a very good book, and I doubt that you'll be disappointed, even if you are like me and it doesn't quite live up to the hype.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|IMO, this was kind of a sad attempt for a movie. This movie is to great movies what a paint-by-number kit with five colors and the fifth one missing is to great art. Arnold looked tired, old and worn-out. His accent actually did him no favors in this movie. He seemed incredibly out-of-place. The movie itself was overly formulaic-- even the formula itself was overly formulaic. Most of the actors seemed to be barely going through the motions in that \\"I'm just doing this because the director has my balls in a sling\\" kind of way. I did find it interesting though how the people's heads splattered more when they were shot than the cart full of watermelons did which were shot with the same weapons. I'm trying to think of something positive to say about the movie, but I'm drawing a blank. All this is sad (to me) because I have always enjoyed Schwarzenegger movies, even when they have been over-the-top and campy. But this one didn't have any of that feel or flavor. It just came off as a weak attempt to re-ignite Arnold's movie career and just seemed kind of sad. I DON'T wish Arnold would hang it up though-- I just DO wish he would find a better movie vehicle with which to stage his come-back. This one just wasn't it. If you like watching people's heads splatter all over the place though when they get shot, this movie might be for you.
B009R659L8|3.0|Assuming as I have that MHC's best books are long behind her, Daddy's Gone a Hunting, made me happy for the first time in many books that I had not given up on her yet. I felt like this was a slight break from her very typical mold - thank goodness the killer wasn't a potential beau or I would have lost it! It was a good mystery, and just different enough from the cookie cutter stories of late, that I was happy to read it. I take issue with complaints regarding the number of characters and their seeming lack of connectedness - do you know whose book you are reading?! If this is not MHC's style, then I don't know what is! I always know that every character introduced will have some purpose in the story. My reading taste has become much more refined since I started reading MHC, though I think I would still enjoy her early great attempts in a way that I have not enjoyed her more recent attempts. Assuming you know what you are getting into, you won't be disappointed. Just keep your expectations in check! It's a good, easy mystery read that can be breezed through in a less than a day.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The kids loved this movie! It was exciting and had fun action scenes! It is a family friendly movie with 80's feel!
193700788X|1.0|I was a latecomer to the Southern Vampire Mysteries (after I started watching True Blood), but my, how I loved them! I eagerly devoured all of the published books once I started reading them in early 2011. It never got any better than it was when I read the first ten books. The last three books have been a terrible disappointment, and Dead After Ever was the best example of all as to how far this once wonderful series has fallen. I had a sneaking suspicion after Deadlocked that there was no possible satisfactory end to the series, but I still held out hope! ***SPOILER ALERT*** I was always a big Eric fan, but I could have dealt with a Sam ending had Charlaine Harris done anything to indicate that might be a possibility before the ending of Deadlocked. The end of Sookie and Eric felt sloppy and unfortunate, as did the many continuity errors and lack of any meaningful plot. Ms. Harris should have had a better plan when she initially chose to extend the series, and she never should have extended it beyond ten books if this is all she could offer. Usually I really enjoy a foray into Sookie Stackhouse's world, but not this time. This time, I just felt really sad.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love how this is similar to other popular books but not as intense. A great book recommended by a friend :)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As noted by many other reviewers, you have to suspend disbelief to read this book. If you can't do that, then don't bother. That said, since I was able to do so, I enjoyed this book in the setting I read it - on a beach vacation! It was an incredibly fast read, and it kept me engaged. The biggest critique I have is that I had no idea where it was going, which I loved, but once all the pieces fell in, it felt more than a little anticlimactic. That said, while The Racketeer was nowhere near the old school Grisham's works, it was one of his better attempts in recent years.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Home and work in the past year or green eggs in the same thing as a Joel on the same thing I have been<br />Yahoo years ago you can tell the same thing as j on word is vital that the first time roll business huh n roll out the first to get john
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED this whole trilogy!! This is a wonderful love story with suspense, drama, and plenty of heat!!! I would love to read this trilogy from Christian's point of view!! The little bit at the end was amazing and would love to see more.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is THE reason why I have a Vita, I just decided between the 3DS and Vita because of this game.<br /><br />IS FUN<br />IT'S REALLY LONG<br />HAS CHARISMATIC CHARACTERS<br />HISTORY SO WELL DEVELOPED<br />IT'S A JRPG (Which I adore them)<br /><br />GET THIS GAME ASAP!<br /><br />PD: Y U NO P4G YET?
B00319ECGK|5.0|This movie is so awesome that I try to give it to all my friends so if my wife ever kicks me out of the house from watching this movie too much, I can stay at their house and watch it.  I don't tell them that though.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great plot, great acting, relevant and quick paced. Any episode could have been taken from today's headlines, yet it does not come across as banal or superficial. A rare achievement for television.
B004LWZW88|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!:  The egg character repulsed my wife to the point that we will not watch this movie again.  It certainly was no Shrek but if we aren't talking about the movie, but instead the actual discs,  they worked flawlessly and looked really sharp in the box.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|This DVD gets kind of boring toward the middle of it. Lots of spicey stuff at the beginning and the end.  Some new stuff, but a lot of this kind of stuff is fairly common knowledge.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|If you are only ever going to see one Mel Brooks movie.... well watch Blazing Saddles but after you finish that, check this one out.  It is poignant, irreverent and thought provoking.  Oh and it is funny too.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|an exciting end to a series of books i couldn't put down. and a little bit of a surprise at the end definitely worth if you like the wheel of time
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the story and the cast, but it is obviously aimed at a teenage audience. (Yes, I should have known before, but I never really looked into it before I watched the movie.) The completely controlled arena kind of disappointed me. Like, if they could generate a pack of wild dogs, why couldn't they just make the nightshade berries disappear? Overall, it is worth watching, and I will probably watch the next one too.<br /><br />May the odds be ever on your side. :)
0553801473|5.0|Had to wait for this book but it was worth it.  Having to wait for the 6th book and may have to reread Book 5 because it is taking so long or I may lose interest.  We will see because it has been a long wait and I am still waiting.
1594203334|5.0|I love this book. I love it for many different reasons. It's funny, well written, and an easy read. When I finished reading the book I didn't close it thinking \\"I should go back and highlight passages to further research and implement into my own parenting style\\" instead I went and drank something...and then nearly shot it all out my nose recalling her story about delivering her twins with the nurse declaring her hatred for her job.<br /><br />The author does a great job of backing up casual (what she sees) and formal observations/research (interviews, etc)with studies and citations. But it's not distracting. As an American it's fun to read what other people in the world are up to and how they handle the day-to-day. It's why I love the movie Babies. I just want to see what they do and maybe get a bit of an explanation of why they do it. But I don't take it personally or to too deeply to heart.<br /><br />And I think that's what a lot of people who have a problem with this book miss. It's just information about a different way of doing things. It's not telling you to do it. It's not telling you it's the best. It's just telling you something different for you to think about.
1401907725|5.0|The Angels Oracle Cards are guiding me daily on my new journey.  I'm amazed how accurate they are, when you approach the Angels with sincerity and respect. They will deliver  the positive message you need to help you make decisions.  Furthermore, they help set the tone for the day and I pull a card before I go to bed.  They are inspirational and can be used as a tool to stay in the moment and truly know that no matter what is happening, everything will be alright.  In addition, I also gave the Angels Oracle Cards as a gift to a special friend who will soon retire.  She is enjoying them as well.  Thank you, Doreen.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Our granddaughter, age4, got this for her birthday.  she loves the fairy movies as would any little lady would. they ar wonderful.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my son before he was even born. Once he was here he loved it. I liked it because in the middle of the night it is much easier to find a pacifier attached to a monkey than one that is all by itself. Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours. I have put it in the washer and dryer many times and it is still good as new.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|We watched this when my children were little.  They loved it then. It was not so with our 4year old granddaughter.  She needs some action to get her interested.  It starts out slowly.  I'm sure she'll like it when she's older.
B003UMW62A|5.0|another Adam Sandler Movie, and it is way to funny, a great story line, and the kids can watch this one
B00B2LFUGA|5.0|I hope this show keeps going. Sometimes (a lot of the time) it's like they're only talking in one-liners, but the characters are amazing, and I have grown to love them. Please keep it going! They've been renewed for a 3rd season, right?
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|A typical american life style, keep up with the neighbors, this is a great story, Spacey does a great job in this flick
B00C8SBNMG|5.0|Best rock CD of 2013! Third time is the charm! The first 2 CD's were stellar, but this one(as the name implies)is epic.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|this is the best one of the Vacation flicks, a Christmas classic, this is so funny, it will make your sides hurt from laughing so much
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think this would be considered a new classic. Frank Herbert's Dune Saga spanned five decades, and is an impressive work in every sense. I think Card taps into some of those greater themes as well. We don't get so wrapped up in our main character that we lose focus of the bigger picture. Those themes are expanded on even more in Card's other novels.<br /><br />This is the second time I've read Ender's Game. This time, knowing that a movie adaptation is coming soon, I wanted to imagine the story again through my own imagination, before seeing it through the eyes of someone else's.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a definite must-read for any SciFi lover!
B000TGJ80I|5.0|All Four of the Underworld flicks are awesome, action packed, and a great story line, even the way it was shot is pretty cool, sort of a surrealism
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It comes in very handy which allows me to carry all my camera equipment which is necessary for to do my photography work doing wedding etc.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This movie moved me from the music to the scenery to the storyline. A tragically beautiful tale, based on a true story.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I've used this device serveral times and the lighting is fantastic to say the leaset.  In fact, shooting with this flash enhences  the entire scope of my  pictures.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Unique writing style that I really enjoyed and I liked the good strong mature characters for once. Worth the read:)
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|Excellent! Great music and acting. Captures the late-60's young adult culture and brought back my /high school-college days! Well worth the reasonable investment.

B000HF0ISC|4.0|Older movie made in 1996. Good actors in the movie as well. Very well put together. Good for male delinquency interest.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|The story was one to always remember. Like a good book it just picks the brain in just the right ways. Which makes it a really weel developed movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Could not put it down. Had a late night reading hangover the next day at work. So much better than the movie.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great, long read, keeps you guessing 'til the end, and even then you'll never get it right. I want to start over and re-read it now that I've solved the mystery :)
B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|So to start off, good news - definitely helped with my sleeping patterns.  Bad news, they made this one a two part series.  Felt like a waste of time and just an excuse to make money off of nothing significant.  Boo hobbit for your senseless movies.  Don't quit your day job!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Star Trek First Contact really brings the cast into the 20th century just on the edge of the 21st century for us. It has great dramatic scenes and good action!
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Waste of money and time, complete rip off!  Hate Amazon for even having this movie for a video on demand, didn't even finish it nor will I ever want to.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I'm a huge pixar fan, and this film is no exception. It's a wonderful family film, but great for all ages! It's wildly creative and pulls at the heartstrings, but doesn't fail to deliver a very happy ending. All around a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good film to watch on a night in.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|What can I say about this cd that other reviewers have not said. This is the first cd I purchased of Kenny Wayne Shepherd and after listening to it I was struck by the thought that someone would be carrying the flame of the blues into the future. Not only do you have a cd of great blues by bluemen and women (some no longer with us) but also a dvd that is pure heaven. Kenny Wayne did actually travel the backroads to play and speak to these fine blues performers and thankfully shares with us his remarkable trip. He has done his homework and knows and feels the blues. There is not a track on the cd that I did not take pleasure listening to and as for the dvd, I was glued to my television screen from beginning to end. Congratulations Kenny Wayne you have participated in a blues project that is the envy of any blues musician. To all blues fans this is a cd/dvd that you must own for it is a landmark recording of the highest order.<br /><br />John Walsh

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is to die for. I LOVE IT!!!! For kids who long for a horse of their own now you can not to mention (for parents) ITS FREE!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is now one of my favorite apps. its very relaxing and it customs to your comfort. I listen to this very often. Best app I have!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use FB on my Kindle fire, my desktop computers and my phone.  I like how the experience is the same across different platforms. Solid app.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Nice game, but when playing longer the specific colors and design start making the whole screen difficult to operate. But it's very challenging game overall.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|the flying experience is unique. I really enjoy the challenge of flying using the RC controls instead of the usual flight sim controls.  The ability to change to other RC simulations is great.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Smart & clever fun for everyone at any age! Working flawlessly on smartphones and tablets, old and new ones - love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Is awesome,  fun, and hard at the same time. The games are fun, but a lot of them are frustrating and annoying. They are really fun though, five stars!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|this is a rather slow book...but worth the read..good storyline and great charachters...i would recommend book if u want an easy read
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is the best app ever but if you have seen the movie 700 times like me truest  me  you would love it
B007B8EX9I|5.0|Yes, I've completed Season 2, and I must say, it is quite exquisite!<br /><br />Continue to watch the show, it gets better and better. Will not say any more ;D<br /><br />With Love,<br /><br />Arden
B00488SU02|5.0|Great movie it just goes to show you that some things aren't what they seem.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good drama!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Having been raised as a Christian Scientist, much of what Anita shared in this book was not a surprise to me.  Yet in many ways it reinforced my recent feelings that any specific dogma is inane of itself at the root of the limitations in our human existence.  I will read this again and I will share it with others.
0399160450|2.0|After Clancy's last debacle of a book, I swore I'd never waste the money on another and so waited to check this one out from the library.  Unfortunately, it's no better than the weak previous efforts.  It's all about money at this point - Clancy puts his name on the cover, a minor talent of a co-writer pumps out the bulk of the novel and the readers get deceived that it's truly a TC novel.  Although the characters will seem familiar and the plot line is well developed, it's not a book worth reading.  There are better writers out there now, many of them independent authors where you can enjoy their work for 20% of the cost of something like this.<br /><br />At this point, for me, even free from the library isn't going to get me to read any more of these so-called collaborations because it's not worth 3-4 days of my time.
1449437524|5.0|The Oatmeal is great.  He says what I'm thinking in most cases and puts it in the most hilarious fashion possible.  This is a little outside the norm for him, it's tender, touching, hilarious, and heartbreaking.  It sums up our relationships with dogs incredibly well (at least good relationships) and though obvious, still gives us something to reflect on.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|Love this version of Romeo and Juliet.  Catchy soundtrack, interesting camera work and great performances make this a surreal telling of the classic love story.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Simply love it. Lively, creative, lyrically a cut above. If we could wear out a CD, this one would be well on the way to its end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I typically avoid reading books that get caught up with entertainment trends/movies (Twilight, Harry Potter etc), but after enjoying the movie and my wife's insistence that I read them I gave in and bought the kindle version.<br /><br />Definitely worth the $5, as I could not put it down. I finished it in about a day and half and am about to wrap up the last in the series. To be honest, I find myself hoping that she will somehow continue to the story.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|i got this book (from the library e-media, which is wonderful thing) because it has been on the best seller list for such a long time.  totally undeservedly, in my opinion.  i guess the writing style is supposed to be after austen, whom i read many many years ago, but the writing is cumbersome and confusing.  for someone who enjoyed jane austen but is not a particular fan of the genre, i find myself continuing to read the book because i am interested in the \\"whodunit\\" aspect of the story, but not enjoying the reading.  pronouns with uncertain subjects drive me crazy.  i don't know the characters, and apparently that's a handicap, but i have to admit that from this book, i just don't care to know them.  i'm at kindle 77%, and find myself reading just to get to the end.  if the reader is not familiar with austen's characters or doesn't enjoy trying to figure out who mrs. this and mr. that are when 3/4 through the story, i would not recommend this book.  glad i didn't pay for it.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I sure wish it had the option to have multiple players so that kids of different ages could go at their own pace.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|This game never loaded to my andriod tablet so I never even got a chance to use it! Poor Product
B001DTA8QS|5.0|Schiff has been refining his interpretations and performances of Bach's keyboard works for some years, and recently he has performed whole series in Europe and the US.  So these recordings, most of them from the 80s, are out of date.  But still they are wonderful, engaging, informative, brilliant.  For the price, how could one complain, other than to express some regret that music is becoming less available on CD.  Oh, and my wife and I wonder at the rather camp picture of Schiff on the cover!  Really?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a family favorite.  You can't go wrong.  Lots of color and motion, great for passing the time while traveling.
B00CW665VI|5.0|5 stars all the way. This book was a fun read with a lot of sexy. I enjoyed a relaxing rainy day reading this entertaining book. This was sexy, romantic, and funny. Pure enjoyment!!!  :)
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This game was really not what I expected. The game play was boring since it consists of doing practically the Sam's thing with almost no alteration and didn't really have a plot. Got really boring and was really limited to what you could do. I only give this game 2 stars since it was playable.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Pretty good book. I would recommend it.  Very chilling at times.  Lee is pretty physco.  I was waiting for more of a twist but it was still pretty good.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|This game was more amusing than expected. It had the typical layout that you would imagine but it is quite fast paced at times and for being quite basic it has you playing for a good while.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|I love to listen to all different types of music and after my son saw Buddy Guy in Denver and said he thought the concert rocked I decided to get a couple of CD's and listen. Very nice!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This is a great series we got hooked on while it was on Netflix.  Season 5 however wasn't on there- Of course Amazon had it, came as advertised and promtly.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Very moving music which made me want to dance. I enjoy her voice and the accompaniment she has on the CD.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I enjoy watching British movies. Each player was exactly right for the part. I look forward to watching similar  movies in the future.

B00C70FH7M|4.0|I'll be honest; I've found Tesseract's debut 'One' a little weak. I thought it was a little overrated compared to their fellow young progressive musicians, Periphery, Animals as Leaders and Between the Buried and Me.<br /><br />But 'Altered State' is simply one of the greatest albums of the year, if not the greatest. Tesseract has cemented themselves as one of the most innovative bands out there today. If you're a fan of polyrhythms, sudden changes in time signatures, breathtaking guitar tones and clean vocals, you'll love this album.<br /><br />I rated it not 5 stars but 4 because I am kind of disappointed in the vocal department (although I would rate it 4 and a half stars if Amazon allowed me). While O'Hara certainly has a talent for high range singing, sometimes it feels a little abrupt. Nevertheless, the astonishing instrumentals more than make up for it.<br /><br />Get this album. You won't regret it!<br /><br />P.S. For all Between the Buried and Me fans like me out there, if you buy the album, it comes with the instrumental version of the song, 'Nocturne' that includes a sweet little solo by the legendary Paul Waggoner.

B00COGY2P2|3.0|Most people I know do not like Tom Cruise. I liked the movie and most of his movies have lots of action, this movie was a combination thriller with lots of suspense and action mixed. Good plot and the movie flows so your not bored watching.
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|My 7 year old son loves it, of course. The one minus it gets from me as a kid-friendly time-filler is that the villain's character design is on the scary side (not that my son cared).<br />Otherwise, it utterly failed to charm me.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love this show, I was so sad to hear that it is no longer on the air. Bring Back!!!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book is different from the general trend. It is the one which will instruct you step by step and will teach you why Start-Up are not comparable with running businesses. To be successful while running a Start_up, a new &#34;science&#34; had to replace the old MBA programs.<br />I found support for many personal understandings which were not in line with recommendations of successful entrepreneurs who belong to different time slots. As the market and investment possibilities change in just a few years, a real theory, like the one described in this book, is required to be prepared to react on current challenges with updated strategies instead of using old and no more relevant tactics.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Best alternative to the Razer DeathAdder<br /><br />~Scroll wheel is more sturdy than the DeathAdder and appears will not wear and have the buggy scroll issue that all Razer mice get after little use.<br />~More customization than the DeathAdder.<br />~You can customize the 4 DPI settings for on the fly changes.<br />~Polished software and driver compared to the buggy Razer software and driver.<br />~A few extra buttons compared to the DeathAdder and all the buttons are customizable.<br />~The buttons can be programmed to execute combos of keys or media options<br />~The mouse is my opinion is more comfortable than the DeathAdder.<br />~Easy to access customer service phone number and support email address (located in software, contact card in box, and website).<br />~18 month warranty with 100% customer guarantee. If you do not believe this, than read all the comment manufacturer replies to one, two, and three star reviews.<br />~Excellent price.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for quality at a good price and not wishing to keep sending away or buying replacements for Razer mice. You might ask why not logitech? Well as much as I like Logitech, their mice can be over priced and the customer service does not have the best reputation.<br /><br />You really should give this mouse a try. This is a low risk and high reward purchase.
B003UESJF6|5.0|If you like rock, sarcasm, and guys with big blue heads - this movie is for you. (not to mention the fantastic fish). This movie was well done. It's just a fun romp through an imaginary city full of regular folks, and oh yeah - a super hero and a bumbling villain who can't get it right, but has great style. Twists in the story make it interesting for even the adults.
0385349831|3.0|I approached \\"Manuscript Found in Accra\\" with limited expectations because I only knew of Paulo Coelho from reading \\"The Alchemist\\". I expected wisdom in the guise of narrative, and the sublime in conversation. Beyond that I read with an open mind.<br /><br />What I encountered was timeless wisdom, something not unlike an apocryphal Book of Proverbs. The setting is a diverse city under siege by Crusaders at the end of the 11th century. The city's culture is likewise under siege, as the inhabitants make preparations for either defense or to flee, and a sage known as the Copt begins to speak where Christian, Muslim, Jew and others have gathered to fret and worry. The Copt gives words of quiet and peace, and calls those gathered to listen to a spiritual message on the calling of this life.<br /><br />I will admit I was not in the right place to have read these words of comfort and of strength, though I think that many who read this may find resonance in the sayings. Though there is narrative it is just thick enough to carry the weight of the conversation, which is mostly from the Copt. As such, this is no novel or novella but rather a spiritual work, certainly metaphysical without being hierarchical. It is religious in the loosest sense, and perhaps conveys Coehlo's own personal spiritual beliefs. Though fictitious, rather than being a work of fiction, I would consider it simply an offer of comfort.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|I needed a good laugh and got it.  Robin Williams is an amazing actor and entertainer.  I heartily recommend this film !
0596805527|5.0|This is not an &#34;easy read&#34; kind-of book that you can just breeze through, but it contains a wealth of useful information if you're really serious about understanding the JavaScript language.
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|It was a very moving story about survival and life. I read it for a book club and we all were very touched by it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story line that keeps you coming back for more! A must read, going to start on the second book now!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking Up Married encompasses the cliches of romantic comedies. When you read the book, you find a lot of details that are very recognizable among this genre. What I look for in these types of books, are the other details that adds to it or makes it stand out.<br /><br />The main couple of Connor and Megan really made this story. Considering the whole book revolved around them, they have to be written in a way in which the chemistry between them is believable. Otherwise the whole book would fall flat. Fortunately, Conner and Megan were very charismatic characters. They had great repartee that was enjoyable to read. Conner especially oozed charm. At times, he really owned a scene and made it work.<br /><br />The start of the book was a little slow and took awhile to get to the heart of what the story is about. But when it finally hit its stride, there was a fluid pace to the story. The writing was good with some humour and nice dialogue between the couple.<br /><br />Overall, Waking Up Married is what would come to mind when you think of rom-coms. It has what you have come to expect from these types: the awkward getting married in Vegas, 2 stubborn people who have trust issues leading them to give up on romantic love, etc. But it doesn't sell itself as anything but a fun, sexy, romance to indulge in for a couple of hours. If you are looking for a cute, fun read then Waking Up Married delivers on this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm completely hooked on this show.  It is exceptionally written, beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes.  It is definitely worth the time.
B003UMW69I|3.0|The actual movie was hit and miss.  If it played out like the trailer it would have been great but all it seemed was the movie used the best cuts from the entire movie and used them in the trailer leaving very little of entertainment left throughout the movie.  It leads you into a false representation of how good the overall movie really is overall.  I liked it but it was definitely not worth what we paid for it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great story.  I love reading it to my husband.  the title does not do it justice.  I will def read  ore of Paulo
B00000JNOJ|5.0|I had almost forgotten how wonderful the blues can sound like coming from Muddy Waters. I listen to him going to and from work and it sets the tone for my day. What talent!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|I have never flown anything so real.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to fly.  Great price also
B0084IPVOU|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful book, though the language is dense and some readers may find it difficult to navigate and obtuse. I quite enjoy the narrative structure.  In addition, much like the acclaimed television show, it is packed with sex and violence, though it doesn't detract from the story! All in all, as long as you're an adult and not entirely squeamish, this is an excellent read!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Using for the anon EOS Rebel T3 camera with the 18-55m IS II Lens.  Fits perfectly and snug.  The two side pockets are perfect for storage the lens cover when in use and the wall battery charger.  Zipper placed nicely for easy access to the camera and quick storage.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad just gets better and better.  The acting is superb and the storyline keeps bringing you back for more.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|Love this new album from Avril.  Thoroughly enjoyed her music through the years but this one is great.  Not too much rock, nice blend of different sounds.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Great workout in only 20 minutes. I will definitely stick with this program, because I absolutely believe it will deliver results.
B00CDGUOJQ|5.0|Wonderful tasting recipes, many people don't even know it's vegan.  Great base recipes for branching out and doing your own thing as well as fancy cupcake recipes to tackle.  I would recommend, my only hardship has been finding pure flavored extracts.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Great action movie, tuns of fun. Good acting, good story, good, coherent action scenes. One tiny squabble is the digital blood, id rather squibs, but its still a 5 star.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Wow. My husband and I rented it hoping for a supernatural action movie. Instead we got teenage movie-of-the-week lameness. If you are over 15 years old, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
B000H7J9R6|3.0|the movie starts slow, and finishes slow. takes forever to get the storyline going. glad I didn't pay full price for this movie.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|After the 1st hour it was really drawn out. Should have been made a 75 minute move and it would have been better.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Spent an entire day trying to download.<br />I am tired of trying If it EVER loads I sure hope it's worth it..

B009RX7IX8|1.0|Let me know when I can get a copy for $5.00.  As far as this fan is concerned series should have stopped a the final chapter of season 4. Will she? Won't she? And I should care why?
B00992CF6W|5.0|please lower the price even $4 is fine just something not so much money I just think 7$. please lower the price
B007ZXK08C|4.0|this is a fast paced book with gripping story.  I found the ending a bit disappointing. Good light holiday reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Liked the movie, loved the book!! I couldn't put it down, until I was done reading.  Definitely much more exciting than the last two in the series.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Has most if not everything that I need for searching information and website. Google is a great American company. I wish Facebook and others will be the same.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|I decided to purchase this album because I think they assembled a nice track layout. I wanted most of these songs, and thought it would be better to purchase this album rather than having to buy all the songs separately. Other songs that I like, I just purchased separately.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|My biggest issue with the ipad is the very, very, very limited storage. With all of my apps and a few magazines, the memory is full. I've been looking for a nifty solution to the problem without having to buy one of those wired adapters. I finally found it with the Kingston Digital MobileLite wireless reader.<br /><br />Using this handy device (which runs on batteries, you don't have to be plugged in) I can watch my videos in the car while on road trips, listen to music through my ipad at home and access my huge library of pictures no matter where I go. All I have to do is carry this little reader, along with my external memory, and I am good to go.<br /><br />The app has worked flawlessly for me except for one problem: the app crashed the first few times I tried to connect to the wireless. It hasn't had the problem since, but it just goes to show that nothing is perfect.<br /><br />As a charger, I find this to be underwhelming. It will do in a pinch to charge your phone (though then you will need to charge the reader if you want to continue using it, so...) but it will not do much good for charging my ipad. That's ok, I have oodles of options for charging on the road, so just using this as a reader is all I need.<br /><br />And as a reader, it is wonderful. Set up is easy (charge, plug in, download the app... done!). Connecting has been a breeze, no trouble (except the initial app crashing) and the connection is quick enough to stream movies with no lagging or hanging. Excellent. Battery life is just as predicted.<br /><br />I've used it on my phone a few times, but I probably won't do that too often. Really, this is nice for tablets - that's where it really shines.
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this novel at least once a year and will do so forever.  Romantic, beautiful characterisation and a lost world of manners.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Not sure where the breakdown is between kindle and adobe, but it is very inconvenient, very slow and often won't load properly.  Have to load things several times.  Adobe is good, kindle is good, but they don't mix well.
B00C4QPYJU|4.0|Ah, this movie takes me back.  Classic 80s style, with the obligatory soundtrack that can at times have nothing to do with the film itself.  (You can almost hear the meetings of putting together the music that accompanies the film with each lyric and note played.)  But, I'll take it.  It's unapologetically simple and nothing more.  If you grew up during the 80s with Rocky and Rambo, and are a Stallone fan, then this movie fits the bill.  Much better than his other outings--I'm looking at you Cobra--and follows the David and Goliath them that Sly's popularized in cinema.<br /><br />I will admit there are about 3 songs I do like from this movie, but the rest just ooze Hollywood factory processing at its best!
B00B2064IY|4.0|But I had to put four stars, because of the posthumous nature of the album. Though I love the music on it, especially the full album studio version of Villanova Junction at the end. It makes me realize, well, I was born after the sixties, and the 1960s' WAS long ago in the twentieth century. Sure the twenty first century is young, but this music has that wistful effect on you.
0399159347|5.0|Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret--something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .<br /><br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all--she's an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia--or each other--but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband's secret.<br /><br />In alternating chapters, we peel back the layers of each woman's life.  Cecilia doesn't read the letter right away, but before she does, we meet Rachel and Tess, and see how very slowly their lives are already intersecting with Cecilia's in Sydney, Australia.<br /><br />Tess's marriage is in disarray from an unexpected source.  She has fled from Melbourne after a betrayal.  Rachel is still grieving a long ago loss.  Yet the three women keep finding themselves at the same places as the others.  And when the connections between them are fully realized, one can ask what if life had taken a different turn for each of them?  Would their lives be better or worse?<br /><br />The characters in [[ASIN:0399159347 The Husband's Secret]] were completely believable and I could relate to them.  I liked how each of them had philosophical internal monologues that revealed their thoughts and feelings, as well as their conflicts and dilemmas.  In the epilogue, the author plays a little game with the reader to show how some of those alternate lives might have played out.  A quirky tale, but with lots of heartfelt angst, rage, and love.  Very human emotions that remind us that life is not black and white, but full of ambiguity.  As each woman experiences her world, we see the ordinary moments as well as the complexity of the issues with which she is dealing.  Through it all, we can see how the numerous facets of each woman's life has brought her just what she needed.  Five stars.full of ambiguity.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love the characters. Abby and Travis seem to be made for each other. There is a lot of twists and turns in this book that keep you guessing. But in the end it was wonderful.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|We absolutely were mesmerized by this story.  Denzel is such an amazing actor and the plot had so many good stories within it.  I would recommend this movie for a couple -- it has the suspense and the good story.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Seriously!!!!!!!!!! Bruce , time to sit back and relax a little. There was to much missing in this movie. writing was a stretch in this movie. Tell Hollywood to let me know if they need my help.
B00CL50LEC|1.0|Jack of all trades movie. It has a little action but not much. A little funny but a lot of SLOW spots. A love story but really weak. After watching this movie my friend and I looked at eachother and laughed at how bad it was. Now when we see another bad movie we say, &#34;at least it was better than Warm Bodies&#34;.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book is so boring. It's written in a childish style and the entire contents of the book could have been summed up in a few paragraphs. It's just great to know that this neurosurgeon was working for years in an alcoholic fog. Maybe this should have been the theme of the book rather than finding a life after death theme. Don't waste your time or money on this book. If I never hear \\" My son, Eben the fourth \\"again, it will be to soon.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|My grandson enjoys playing all Angry Bird Games. He was so excited to see that a new game came out.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Having been late to the party and seen the movie first, I ask<br /> \\"What were they afraid of?\\", when they changed the ending? Too bad, I think we the \\"public\\" are sophisticated enough to be able to deal with a stygian climax that makes us all ponder the \\"meaning\\" of it all.<br />I enjoyed both immensely. And will again and again.
B00BZA3I0I|1.0|Wow, this lacked all the creative, slapstick humor of the original... I was expecting the same type of jokes, heck  even the same jokes, but they just didn't come...
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The is a great southern blues album. It is old style blues. I would recommend this to anyone that likes blues.
0062119044|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it. But as amazing as the movie is, the book is a million times better. You get much more depth and character development. Things that could only be vaguely alluded to in the movie are made real in the book. Everything is so much more fleshed out. An excellent, powerful read.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|While it is set in an alternate universe, and it is explained as such, it keep the life of Star Trek alive. Great film!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Grandson having trouble with fractions, this impressed a nine year old!<br />I tried it out and was pleased with the design, very useful.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really enjoyed this story it was very thought provoking and touching and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I would thoroughly recommend this book to others
B00B89WXYS|4.0|Pretty good CD.  Didn't like some of songs.  I like other CDs by One Republic better.  I received CD promptly.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|It starts to drag almost from the beginning, and like most independant movies there is no payoff at the end.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I have only seen the first episode, but this is right up my alley.  I love muscials and new york city!  Now I just have to find some projects for my man, so I can squeeze in a few more episodes!
B008Q08EV8|4.0|The movie takes place during the height of the Roman Empire in England during their push to conquer all of Europe. The casting was done well and Michael Fassbender is great. I hate giving spoilers so all I will say is I liked the ending and found it to be a better executed movie than The Eagle which takes place in a similar setting and has a similar plot.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This is a great feel good movie.  I would expect nothing less from a Nicholas Sparks book.  Made me love Julianne Hough even more!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Once again Brandon Sanderson has created a new world that intreagues the reader. This was a great story that went by too quickly!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is an extremely charming mix of modern day London and classic Jane Austen.  Humorous and enjoyable from beginning to end.  If you are into Darcy and Pride & Prejudice, you have to watch it more than once to catch all of the references.  It was a mini-series of four episodes in England, so it is longer than a movie.  I would recommend it to Jane Austen fans who may find this spin on a true classic as delightful as I do.
B002IJQ3EI|5.0|But it was not a picture disc ,came on standard vinyl , I'll give the album a 5 star but false advertisement gets 1 star
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have all the videos and I watch them with my grand daughters on girls night.  We have worn them out.
8866137960|5.0|I love the Moleskine notebooks, nice and compact, excellent paper quality strong binding, and a huge bonus is it came in my favorite covers
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I like the game but would like to see the numbers disappear after you have found them. The different scenes are good.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|I didn't understand why people were obsessed with this series when it was on TV but now that I can watch it on my own schedule I have become part of the followers. A little late but glad I took the time.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I love it I just ordered season five and I will soon order seasons 6 and 7 cant wait . dvd were new
B0070DOHQS|2.0|I never got the app to work with my computer. It probably would have been useful, but now i'll never know.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Super cute, fun for the whole family! my kids ages 9-16 enjoyed all the characters! Ice Ages series are our family's favorite!
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is another good movie for mixed audiences, any age; however, if I had children that were 8 or younger I would watch it with them, and pause throughout the movie, as I did when my children were young, and when the characters say things like, &#34;we watch over you...&#34;, I would remind them it is a movie, and tell them who we believe watches over them.  Over all it is a good movie, and I do recommend it.
B00C1E8E7E|5.0|and the gang doesn't disappoint. Love these tracks, especially &#34;Tamale&#34; because it's just so live and funny when imagining how they did the song.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is so good and without you realizing it, it leaves you with a good feeling/good message...definitely not a waste of your time, and good for mixed audiences and any age.
B009DH37CY|5.0|Though it is basically the same set as the Live at Wembley album, the Budapest show has its own unique energy and style. You can tell by watching that Freddie loved to play up a crowd, no matter where he was. This was Queen at the top of their game live... it was such a shame that it was cut short do to outside factors. Highly recommended to Queen fans everywhere!
B003B02PEU|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham.  Enjoyed and have already recommended to friends and family.  Worth your time, hope you enjoy too!
